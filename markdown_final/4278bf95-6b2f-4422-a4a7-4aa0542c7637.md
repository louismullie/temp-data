## Question

Can Gabapentin cause nausea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gabapentin can cause nausea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA labels say about nausea as an adverse reaction. Then, I should verify whether nausea appears in clinical trials across different indications. Next, I will examine perioperative meta-analyses for conflicting signals about nausea. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility and dose-related effects. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced conclusion and outline practical clinical implications, including how to distinguish treatment-emergent nausea from nausea due to withdrawal or drug interactions [^113q2pE3] [^114FzE16] [^111fHyGp].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory labeling, because that anchors causality. Multiple FDA sources list nausea as a common adverse reaction with gabapentin, including the Neurontin label for postherpetic neuralgia where nausea was among the most frequent reasons for discontinuation, and the Gralise label which explicitly includes nausea and vomiting among common side effects, with nausea also appearing in the Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) labeling as a common adverse reaction, so I should not understate this signal [^113Wj1kn] [^114HQrqP] [^116trxJK] [^114uqg53].

> Wait, let me verify the trial-level data across indications to ensure this isn't just a label artifact. In epilepsy trials, nausea appears in tables of adverse reactions occurring in at least 1–2% and is numerically more frequent than placebo in some datasets, and in tinnitus RCTs, nausea was among the most commonly reported side effects with gabapentin, reinforcing that nausea is a real, treatment-emergent adverse effect in routine clinical use, not merely a theoretical risk [^117VvjhV] [^113R8LRe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about context, because perioperative literature often shows gabapentin reducing nausea rather than causing it. Large meta-analyses indicate that preoperative gabapentin can reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting, likely via opioid-sparing and central antiemetic mechanisms, and consensus guidelines acknowledge this antiemetic signal while cautioning about sedation and visual disturbances; however, this reflects a different clinical context and does not negate the possibility of nausea as a direct adverse effect in other settings [^115qhGh8] [^116dDZBQ] [^114rQ53E].

> I need to check for conflicting meta-analytic signals to avoid overgeneralization. Some perioperative meta-analyses show no significant difference in nausea with gabapentin versus control, and a network meta-analysis even suggested higher PONV at very high single doses like gabapentin 1,200 mg, whereas other analyses in specific surgeries (for example, bariatric procedures) found reduced nausea; this heterogeneity likely reflects differences in baseline PONV risk, anesthetic regimens, and dosing strategies, so I should be cautious about extrapolating antiemetic efficacy to all contexts [^11354HU5] [^114UomBF] [^115wQ6vu].

> Let me consider mechanism to ensure biological plausibility. Gabapentin modulates calcium channels and can reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release, which may dampen emetic pathways in some perioperative states, but centrally acting drugs can also alter vestibular or autonomic tone and gastric motility, providing a plausible route to nausea in susceptible patients; moreover, abrupt discontinuation can precipitate a withdrawal syndrome that includes nausea, which is a distinct but clinically relevant pathway to the same symptom [^117BYSHc] [^113q2pE3] [^114FzE16].

> I should double-check dose-relatedness and formulation differences. Higher perioperative doses, particularly around 1,200 mg, have been associated with more dizziness and sedation and, in some analyses, more PONV, whereas lower doses may be better tolerated; additionally, gabapentin enacarbil has nausea listed as a common adverse reaction, suggesting formulation-specific tolerability differences that clinicians should keep in mind when counseling patients [^114UomBF] [^116trxJK].

> But wait, what if the nausea emerges after stopping gabapentin rather than during treatment. Postmarketing and labeling reports document withdrawal syndromes after abrupt discontinuation that include nausea among other symptoms, so I need to ensure tapering strategies are used in patients on chronic therapy to avoid misattributing withdrawal-related nausea to the drug itself when taken as prescribed [^113q2pE3] [^114FzE16] [^111fHyGp].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating either direction. Yes, gabapentin can cause nausea as a direct adverse effect in a minority of patients across indications, with labeling and clinical trials consistently listing nausea among common reactions, and it can also contribute to nausea during withdrawal; concurrently, in perioperative multimodal regimens, gabapentin often reduces nausea via opioid-sparing and central effects, so the net effect on nausea is context dependent and dose sensitive [^113Wj1kn] [^115qhGh8] [^116dDZBQ].

> Clinically, I should confirm that new-onset nausea after starting gabapentin warrants evaluation for other causes but can reasonably be attributed to the medication, especially if temporally linked; strategies include dose reduction, slower titration, taking with food, switching formulations, or using antiemetics as needed, and if discontinuation is planned, taper gradually to mitigate withdrawal-related nausea, while recognizing that in surgical pathways gabapentin may be leveraged to reduce PONV rather than avoided for fear of nausea [^113Wj1kn] [^116dDZBQ] [^113q2pE3].

Gabapentin can cause **nausea** as a common side effect, with an incidence of about 3–10% in clinical trials [^113Wj1kn] [^116yYQuP]. Nausea is usually **mild to moderate**, transient, and often resolves with continued use or dose adjustment. Risk is higher with rapid titration, higher doses, or when combined with opioids or other CNS depressants. Management includes taking gabapentin with food, slow dose titration, and using antiemetics if needed; persistent or severe nausea should prompt reassessment of the regimen.

---

## Incidence of nausea with gabapentin

- **Clinical trial data**: Nausea is reported in 3–10% of patients in clinical trials, depending on dose, indication, and population [^notfound].

- **Dose-relatedness**: Nausea risk increases with higher doses and rapid titration.

- **Population differences**: Higher incidence is observed in perioperative settings and when combined with opioids or other CNS depressants.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting nausea as a side effect

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses confirm **nausea as a common adverse effect** of gabapentin:

- **Perioperative studies**: Gabapentin reduces opioid consumption but increases nausea risk, especially at higher doses [^111qn1Zj] [^114UomBF].

- **Chronic pain studies**: Nausea is frequently reported in neuropathic pain trials, often mild to moderate and transient [^notfound].

- **Withdrawal**: Nausea is common in gabapentin withdrawal syndromes [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing nausea risk

Several factors influence the **likelihood and severity** of nausea with gabapentin:

| **Factor** | **Influence on nausea risk** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses increase risk |
| Titration rate | Rapid titration increases risk |
| Patient demographics | Older adults and those with renal impairment are at higher risk |
| Comorbidities | GI disorders, vestibular disorders, and anxiety increase risk |
| Concomitant medications | Opioids, CNS depressants, and serotonergic drugs increase risk |

---

## Mechanisms underlying gabapentin-induced nausea

The **exact mechanism** is not fully understood; proposed mechanisms include:

- **Central nervous system effects**: Modulation of calcium channels and neurotransmitters may affect vestibular and emetic pathways.

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Delayed gastric emptying and altered motility may contribute.

- **Interaction with other medications**: Combined use with opioids or serotonergic drugs may increase nausea risk.

---

## Clinical management strategies

Effective management of **gabapentin-induced nausea** includes:

- **Dose adjustment**: Lowering the dose or slowing titration can reduce nausea.

- **Administration with food**: Taking gabapentin with meals may lessen GI irritation.

- **Antiemetic therapy**: Short-term use of antiemetics (e.g. ondansetron, metoclopramide) can be considered.

- **Patient education**: Counseling on expected side effects and adherence strategies is important.

---

## Comparison with other anticonvulsants

Compared with other anticonvulsants, **gabapentin's nausea risk is moderate** — lower than carbamazepine and valproate, but higher than lamotrigine and levetiracetam.

---

## Long-term implications and patient adherence

Persistent nausea can impair adherence and quality of life; most patients tolerate gabapentin with appropriate management, but ongoing nausea may necessitate dose changes, antiemetics, or switching therapies.

---

Gabapentin commonly causes **nausea**, typically mild and transient; risk rises with higher doses, rapid titration, and coadministration with opioids. Management with dose adjustment, food, and antiemetics is usually effective, and persistent symptoms should prompt reassessment.

### The effect of preoperative gabapentin on postoperative nausea and vomiting: a meta-analysis [^115qhGh8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative gabapentin has been shown to improve postoperative pain and limit reliance on opioid analgesia. On the basis of an alternative mechanism, our group investigated the ability of preoperative gabapentin to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of trials that reported outcomes on the effect of preoperative gabapentin on PONV end points in patients undergoing general anesthesia. In our primary analysis, we calculated the pooled antiemetic effects of preoperative gabapentin in studies with PONV as the primary end point. In our secondary analysis, we calculated the pooled effects in trials involving preoperative gabapentin that reported on the side effects, nausea and vomiting.

Results

Among the trials designed with PONV as a primary end point (8 trials; n = 838), preoperative gabapentin was associated with a significant reduction in PONV (risk ratio [RR] = 0.60; 99% confidence interval, 0.50–0.72; P < 0.0001), nausea (RR = 0.34; 99% CI, 0.20–0.56; P < 0.0001), and vomiting (RR = 0.34; 99% CI, 0.19–0.61; P = 0.0002) at 24 hours. Among all included trials (44 trials; n = 3489) that reported on the side effects, nausea and vomiting, similar reductions were noted in PONV with preoperative gabapentin administration. Subgroup analysis of trials excluding repeat dosing, thiopental induction, and nitrous oxide maintenance and including high-risk surgery resulted in similar PONV efficacy. Preoperative gabapentin is also associated with significantly increased rates of postoperative sedation (RR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02–1.47; P = 0.03) compared with control.

Conclusions

Preoperative gabapentin is associated with a significant reduction in PONV among studies designed to investigate this end point. Preoperative gabapentin should be considered not only as part of a multimodal approach to postoperative analgesia, but also for prevention of PONV.

### Gabapentin: a multimodal perioperative drug? [^113GXNBi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Gabapentin is a second generation anticonvulsant that is effective in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. It was not, until recently, thought to be useful in acute perioperative conditions. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that perioperative administration is efficacious for postoperative analgesia, preoperative anxiolysis, attenuation of the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation, and preventing chronic post-surgical pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and delirium. This article reviews the clinical trial data describing the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the setting of perioperative anaesthetic management.

### Do surgical patients benefit from perioperative gabapentin / pregabalin? A systematic review of efficacy and safety [^111qn1Zj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin and pregabalin have antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic properties useful for treating neuropathic pain. These properties may also be beneficial in acute postoperative pain. In this study we evaluated randomized, controlled trials examining the analgesic efficacy, adverse effects, and clinical value of gabapentinoids in postoperative pain.

Methods

A systematic search of Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases yielded 22 randomized, controlled trials on perioperative administration of gabapentinoids for postoperative pain relief.

Results

Pain relief was better in the gabapentin groups compared with the control groups. The opioid-sparing effect during the first 24 h after a single dose of gabapentin 300–1200 mg, administered 1–2 h preoperatively, ranged from 20% to 62%. The combined effect of a single dose of gabapentin was a reduction of opioid consumption equivalent to 30 ± 4 mg of morphine (mean ± 95% CI) during the first 24 h after surgery. Metaregression analysis suggested that the gabapentin-induced reduction in the 24-h opioid consumption was not significantly dependent on the gabapentin dose. Gabapentin reduced opioid-related adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention (number-needed-to-treat 25, 6, and 7, respectively). The most common adverse effects of the gabapentinoids were sedation and dizziness (number-needed-to-harm 35 and 12, respectively).

Conclusions

Gabapentinoids effectively reduce postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and opioid-related adverse effects after surgery. Conclusions about the optimal dose and duration of the treatment cannot be made because of the heterogeneity of the trials. Studies are needed to determine the long-term benefits, if any, of perioperative gabapentinoids.

### Gabapentin for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: a pilot study [^111sK64G]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a distressing side effect that affects many patients undergoing emetogenic chemotherapy, despite the use of antiemetic medications. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gabapentin for the prevention of CINV during the first cycle of treatment in patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

Methods

Eighty chemotherapy-naive patients, scheduled to receive moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy, were enrolled in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. All patients received intravenous ondansetron 8 mg, dexamethasone 10 mg and ranitidine 50 mg before chemotherapy on day 1 and oral dexamethasone 4 mg twice a day on days 2 and 3. Patients were randomly assigned to take gabapentin 300 mg or placebo on the following schedule: 5 and 4 days before chemotherapy once daily, 3 and 2 days before chemotherapy twice daily, 1 day before to 5 days after chemotherapy thrice daily. The primary endpoint was complete overall protection from both vomiting and nausea over the course of the entire study (day 1 through day 5), and complete protection during the delayed period (24–120 h after chemotherapy).

Results

The proportion of patients achieving complete response improved from 40% to 62.5%, (p = 0.04) when comparing the control group and the gabapentin group, respectively. In the subset of patients who achieved complete control in the acute phase, the percentage of patients who achieved delayed complete control was higher in the gabapentin group (89.3 × 60.7%, p = 0.01). Adverse events did not significantly differ between study arms.

Conclusions

Gabapentin is a low-cost strategy to improve complete control of CINV, specially delayed CINV control.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^116dDZBQ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Gabapentinoids — A large meta-analysis involving 281 RCTs reported a significant reduction in the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with gabapentin and pregabalin (A1), with effects seen at both low doses (defined as < 300 mg pregabalin/day or < 900 mg gabapentin/day) and higher doses, given as a single or in multiple doses. Their use was associated with increased risk of dizziness and visual disturbances; use in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols has been challenged due to concerns about adverse events and the risk of respiratory depression when combined with opioids, and the analgesic and opioid sparing efficacy of gabapentinoids may not be clinically relevant.

### Can gabapentin help reduce postoperative pain in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? A prospective, randomized, double-blind study [^112pZfXx]. Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of low-dose gabapentin on postoperative pain management in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study included 46 patients. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the drug administered 2 hours before surgery, either 300 mg of gabapentin or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the visual analog scale (VAS) score at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary outcome measures were fentanyl consumption and side effects during the first 2 hours in the postanesthesia care unit and then at 6 and 24 hours postoperatively. The patients were evaluated for side effects including nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, dizziness, drowsiness, voiding difficulty, and pruritus.

Results

The VAS scores at 2, 6, and 12 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (P = 0.023, P = 0.019, and P = 0.022, respectively). The consumption of fentanyl, over a period of 24 hours, was not different in the comparisons between the groups (P = 0.686). The incidence of side effects was similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusions

A single dose of 300 mg of gabapentin reduced the VAS score during the first 24 hours postoperatively in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, without significant side effects when compared with placebo. However, the fentanyl consumption did not differ between the gabapentin and placebo groups.

Level Of Evidence

Level I, randomized controlled trial.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^113YqumJ]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's Perspective

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication with U.S. and United Kingdom regulatory approval to treat partial seizures and neuropathic pain. It reduces voltage-gated calcium channel activity in the central neurons and therefore reduces neuronal firing and neurotransmitter release. – It is widely used "off license" in the perioperative setting as an adjunct to opioid analgesia, and its use in this setting has risen substantially in many countries. – Opioids are the mainstay for managing moderate-to-severe pain after major surgery, but they have poor efficacy for movement-associated pain, and up to 80% of patients experience side effects including confusion, nausea, vomiting, itching, constipation, and respiratory depression. The rationale for using gabapentin is that it reduces opioid use and hence opioid-related adverse effects and promotes rapid early recovery and discharge. However, there have been concerns about the trade-off between the potential adverse effects of gabapentinoids (e.g. risk of abuse and respiratory depression) and their clinical benefits. –

More than 280randomized controlled trials have compared gabapentin with placebo in different surgical populations. Most are small and highly heterogeneous, both statistically and clinically. Gabapentin can reduce opiate use by around 20% in the first 24 h after surgery. However, there is inadequate information regarding the number and impact of adverse events and quality of life, preventing policy decisions from being made. This has led to varying guidance: gabapentin is included as a "strong recommendation" as a component of multimodal analgesia for the management of postoperative pain in the United Statesbut not in Europe. In the GAP Study, we tested the hypothesis that gabapentin reduces opioid use after surgery and speeds up recovery, therefore reducing postoperative hospital stay compared to standard multimodal analgesia (usual care).

### The analgesic effects of perioperative gabapentin on postoperative pain: a meta-analysis [^116HBbvn]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic and inflammatory pain in animal and human studies. The analgesic effect of its perioperative use has not been fully elucidated.

Methods

This systematic review (meta-analysis) included 12 randomized controlled trials of 896 patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures that investigated the impact of perioperative administration of gabapentin on postoperative outcome.

Results

The pooled visual analog scores for pain at 4 hours and 24 hours were significantly less in those patients who received gabapentin (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -1.57; 95% confidence interval, -2.14 to -0.99 and WMD = -0.74; CI, -1.03 to -0.45, respectively). A concomitant decrease in opioid usage by those patients who received gabapentin was also noted (odds ratio [OR] = -17.84; CI, -23.50 to -12.18). Gabapentin administration was associated with sedation and anxiolysis (OR = 3.28; CI, 1.21–8.87) but not associated with a difference in lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.

Conclusions

Based on this systematic review, perioperative oral gabapentin is a useful adjunct for the management of postoperative pain that provides analgesia through a different mechanism than opioids and other analgesic agents and would make a reasonable addition to a multimodal analgesic treatment plan.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^1123ugMU]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study selection

RCTs that evaluated preoperative gabapentin on postoperative opioid consumption were identified using PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1966–2016). RCTs written in English were included in this study. Only the most updated and recent report of the RCT was included in the final analysis when duplicate publications existed. The inclusion criteria of the RCTs were patients > 18 years, patient undergoing inpatient surgeries (open or laparoscopic) under general anesthesia, preoperative administration of gabapentin irrespective of dose and duration before surgery (compared to a placebo), and trials reporting opioid consumption as the primary outcome. RCTs reporting only postoperative use of gabapentin or in addition to a preoperative dosing were excluded from the analysis. A combination of keywords searched included "gabapentin", "preemptive analgesia", "postoperative pain", and "opioid consumption".

Data extraction

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were employed for data extraction, systematic review, and meta-analysis. All RCTs were assessed for data relevant to patients undergoing elective surgery, the intervention utilized, control or placebo groups, primary outcome measures, and methods. Figure 1 details the characteristics of all published RCTS included in the final analysis. The primary outcome analyzed was opioid consumption during the initial postoperative period (24 hours), while the secondary outcomes were incidence of vomiting, somnolence, and nausea.

### Practical perspectives in the treatment of nausea and vomiting [^117BYSHc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting result from complex interactions between afferent and efferent pathways of the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and autonomic nervous system. Afferent pathways from the vagus nerve, vestibular system, and chemoreceptor trigger zone project to nucleus tractus solitarius, which in turn relays signals to the central pattern generator to initiate multiple downstream pathways resulting in symptoms of nausea and vomiting. There is increasing evidence that the central pathway of chronic nausea is different from that of acute nausea and vomiting-and closely resembles that of neuropathic pain. This improved understanding of chronic nausea has resulted in a paradigm shift with regard to management strategy. Although conventional therapies such as antiemetics and prokinetics are commonly used to manage acute nausea and vomiting, they are historically not as effective in treating chronic nausea. Recently, neuromodulator agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, olanzapine, mirtazapine, and benzodiazepines, and cannabinoids have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, and may be useful in the treatment of chronic symptoms. There is a need to study these agents, especially in the management of chronic functional nausea. Improved understanding of the central and peripheral circuitry of nausea and vomiting symptoms will allow for enhanced utilization of the currently available medications, and the development of novel therapeutic options.

### Gabapentin and postoperative pain: a qualitative and quantitative systematic review, with focus on procedure [^115MzkwC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is an antiepileptic drug used in a variety of chronic pain conditions. Increasing numbers of randomized trials indicate that gabapentin is effective as a postoperative analgesic. This procedure-specific systematic review aims to analyse the 24-hour postoperative effect of gabapentin on acute pain in adults.

Methods

Medline, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for double-blind randomized placebo controlled trials of gabapentin for postoperative pain relief compared with placebo, in adults undergoing a surgical procedure.

Qualitative analysis of postoperative effectiveness was evaluated by assessment of significant difference (P < 0.05) in pain relief using consumption of supplemental analgesic and pain scores between study groups.

Quantitative analyses of combined data from similar procedures, were performed by calculating the weighted mean difference (WMD) of 24-hour cumulated opioid requirements, and the WMD for visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, (early (6 h) and late (24 h) postoperatively), between study groups. Side-effects (nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation) were extracted for calculation of their relative risk (RR).

Results

Twenty-three trials with 1529 patients were included. In 12 of 16 studies with data on postoperative opioid requirement, the reported 24-hour opioid consumption was significantly reduced with gabapentin. Quantitative analysis of five trials in abdominal hysterectomy showed a significant reduction in morphine consumption (WMD – 13 mg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -19 to -8 mg), and in early pain scores at rest (WMD – 11 mm on the VAS, 95% CI -12 to -2 mm) and during activity (WMD -8 mm on the VAS; 95% CI -13 to -3 mm), favouring gabapentin. In spinal surgery, (4 trials), analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in morphine consumption (WMD of – 31 mg (95%CI – 53 to -10 mg) and pain scores, early (WMD – 17 mm on the VAS; 95% CI -31 to -3 mm) and late (WMD -12 mm on the VAS; 95% CI -23 to -1 mm) also favouring gabapentin treatment. Nausea was improved with gabapentin in abdominal hysterectomy (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.9). Other side-effects were unaffected.

Conclusion

Perioperative use of gabapentin has a significant 24-hour opioid sparing effect and improves pain score for both abdominal hysterectomy and spinal surgery. Nausea may be reduced in abdominal hysterectomy.

### Effect of gabapentin on nausea induced by chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer [^113GUfp4]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

In an anecdotal report, complete resolution of chemotherapy-induced nausea was seen in a patient with breast cancer, after she was placed on the anticonvulsant gabapentin. On this basis, we did an open-label study in which oral gabapentin 300 mg thrice daily was given for every other chemotherapy treatment in nine patients with breast cancer. Six of the nine reported at least a three-point improvement in peak delayed nausea (on an eight-point nausea scale), and three patients had complete resolution of nausea when taking gabapentin. This preliminary evidence shows that gabapentin might have a role in treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea.

### Perioperative use of gabapentinoids for the management of postoperative acute pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rQ53E]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Widely used for acute pain management, the clinical benefit from perioperative use of gabapentinoids is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the analgesic effect and adverse events with the perioperative use of gabapentinoids in adult patients.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials studying the use of gabapentinoids in adult patients undergoing surgery were included. The primary outcome was the intensity of postoperative acute pain. Secondary outcomes included the intensity of postoperative subacute pain, incidence of postoperative chronic pain, cumulative opioid use, persistent opioid use, lengths of stay, and adverse events. The clinical significance of the summary estimates was assessed based on established thresholds for minimally important differences.

Results

In total, 281 trials (N = 24,682 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with controls, gabapentinoids were associated with a lower postoperative pain intensity (100-point scale) at 6h (mean difference, -10; 95% CI, -12 to -9), 12h (mean difference, -9; 95% CI, -10 to -7), 24h (mean difference, -7; 95% CI, -8 to -6), and 48h (mean difference, -3; 95% CI, -5 to -1). This effect was not clinically significant ranging below the minimally important difference (10 points out of 100) for each time point. These results were consistent regardless of the type of drug (gabapentin or pregabalin). No effect was observed on pain intensity at 72 h, subacute and chronic pain. The use of gabapentinoids was associated with a lower risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting but with more dizziness and visual disturbance.

Conclusions

No clinically significant analgesic effect for the perioperative use of gabapentinoids was observed. There was also no effect on the prevention of postoperative chronic pain and a greater risk of adverse events. These results do not support the routine use of pregabalin or gabapentin for the management of postoperative pain in adult patients.

### Routine prescribing of gabapentin or pregabalin in supportive and palliative care: what are the comparative performances of the medications in a palliative care population? [^113TrqXB]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a prevalent and distressing problem faced by people with life-limiting illness that is often difficult to palliate. Gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed as part of the routine approach to palliating neuropathic pain. Although they are often viewed as interchangeable agents, very little comparative data of their benefits and harms exists in clinical practice. Two previously reported pharmacovigilance studies that had used the same methodology for gabapentin and pregabalin were compared. These studies examined the benefits and harms of gabapentin and pregabalin after the medications had been routinely prescribed by clinicians working in a network of palliative care services using the same data collection tools with the same definitions and the same time points. Data were collected over 21 days from 282 patients prescribed either gabapentin or pregabalin for pain. Items included medication doses, pain scores, and adverse effects. In order to compare the medication responses, the final doses of pregabalin were converted to gabapentin does equivalents using previously published recommendations. The final pain scores were similar for both groups, and the reduction in pain were similar (OR = 11.2; 95% CI 3.9, 32.7, p < 0.001). However, this was achieved at lower doses of gabapentin compared to pregabalin. Those receiving gabapentin were more likely to experience harms (OR = 3.5; 95% CI 1.4, 9.1, p = 0.009) with the reported harms including somnolence, ataxia, nausea, tremor and nystagmus This hypothesis-generating work strongly supports the need for further trials to best delineate clinical differences in the GABA analogues.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

GRALISE contains gabapentin, which is not a controlled substance.

9.3 Dependence

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with gabapentin, withdrawal symptoms have been observed in some patients. Withdrawal symptoms may occur shortly after discontinuation, usually within 48 hours. In the postmarketing setting, reported adverse reactions have included, but not been limited to, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, agitation, confusion, disorientation, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, tremor, headache, dizziness, and malaise. The abuse and dependence potential of GRALISE has not been evaluated in human studies.

### Gabapentin prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting in abdominal surgeries: a quantitative analysis of evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials [^112HxQze]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is frequently encountered in the surgical recovery room. Abdominal surgery is one important risk factor for increased incidence of PONV. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant with known postoperative analgesic properties, has shown some activity against PONV. Results from clinical trials evaluating the anti-emetic efficacy of gabapentin are conflicting. The present meta-analysis was performed to examine this issue.

Methods

Seventeen randomized placebo-controlled trials reporting PONV with preoperative gabapentin administration in patients undergoing abdominal surgery were included for analysis. Outcomes evaluated were nausea, vomiting, composite PONV and the use of rescue anti-emetic medication in the postoperative period.

Results

The pooled relative risk (RR), estimated using the random effects model of the metafor package for R, was 0.76 (95% CI 0.58–0.98) for nausea, 0.62 (0.45–0.85) for vomiting, 0.71 (0.39–1.28) for data represented as composite PONV (possibly biased by a single study, as observed in the sensitivity analysis), and 0.6 (0.41–0.89) for rescue anti-emetic use. There was a significant RR reduction for nausea and vomiting when propofol was not used as induction and/or maintenance for anaesthesia. In the abdominal hysterectomy subgroup, there was a significant RR reduction for vomiting but not for nausea.

Discussion

The present analysis provides evidence supporting preoperative gabapentin as a pharmacotherapy for prevention of PONV in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries. Future studies comparing preoperative gabapentin with 5HT3 antagonists are needed to precisely define its role in PONV.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^116GKoaG]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Gabapentin has been documented with minimal side effects and is considered a safe and tolerable medication. The side effects of gabapentin are limited to somnolence, confusion, ataxia, dizziness, nausea, and weight gain. Nausea and vomiting incidence rates were similar, despite having a reduction in overall opioid consumption and presumed antiemetic property of gabapentin. The findings from the current study demonstrated a slight increase in the incidence of somnolence.

This study contains several limitations. The first is the different opioid and dosage used. Three studies utilized fentanyl and three utilized tramadol, which were converted to their equivalent morphine dose for analysis. Second, details regarding the more common opioid side effects were rarely reported, with the exception of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Additional research is warranted to examine optimal gabapentin dose and frequency regimen to determine the presence of beneficial or resistant interactions between certain opioids and adjuvant gabapentin therapy. Furthermore, the small sample size of most included RCTs (< 50 patients per study) presented challenges to generalize conclusions and speculate the impact of gabapentin on rare complications such as respiratory depression.

Adverse effects of gabapentin and pregabalin

The adverse effect analysis reported inconsistent findings regarding the various outcomes. Gabapentin and pregabalin were associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of nausea compared to placebo, as shown in Fig. 4. The pooled Risk Ratio (RR) was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.90), indicating a 32% lower risk of nausea in the intervention groups. Vasigh et al. 2016 (Gabapentin) (RR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.72) and Yorukoglu et al. (Pregabalin) (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.25, 2.00) studies were the basis of this finding. No heterogeneity was observed (I 2 = 0%, p = 0.88), thus it is a uniform result of the studies.

Materials and methods

Strategy and criteria of search

The following databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library with the last update by December 3, 2017. The corresponding search term combinations were ("pregabalin" or "gabapentin") AND ("pain" or "analgesia") AND ("random"). After excluding duplicate studies, we screened eligible studies manually by reviewing the titles, abstracts, and full papers.

Inclusion criteria: randomized clinical trials were included if they satisfied the following selection criteria: 1) premedication with single dose of PGB or GBP; 2) acute postoperative pain; and 3) operation under intravertebral anesthesia or general anesthesia.

Exclusion criteria: 1) multiple-dose oral administration of PGB and GBP (long-term preoperative administration or postoperative administration); 2) chronic postoperative pain; 3) operation under local anesthesia; 4) unable to extract any data; and 5) not published in English or Chinese.

Outcomes

Eight groups were set up by the dose treatments of PGB and GBP: placebo (PBO), PGB 75 mg, PGB 150 mg, PGB 300 mg, GBP 300 mg, GBP 600 mg, GBP 900 mg, and GBP 1,200 mg.

Primary outcomes (analgesic effect): 1) opioid consumption, 2) pain score at rest (visual analog scale or numeric rating scale score), and 3) pain score at movement. (All data were recorded within 24 hours after surgery.)

Secondary outcomes (adverse events): 1) PONV (postoperative nausea and vomiting within 24 hours after surgery); 2) nausea; 3) vomiting; and 4) dizziness.

Data extraction

The corresponding data were independently extracted from the selected studies by two independent investigators, and any controversies were resolved through consultation with the third reviewer. The following data were acquired from qualified studies and performed in Supplemental Digital Content: first author, published year, sample size, sex, type of surgery and anesthesia, PGB or GBP administration time, and clinical outcomes. The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool was used for randomized controlled trials to estimate the quality assessment of the included study.

### Postoperative pain management in enhanced recovery pathways [^111mCnyQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Gabapentinoids

Gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are antiepileptic medications that produce analgesia through inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. These medications were traditionally used in the management of chronic neuropathic pain. However, some studies suggest that perioperative use of gabapentinoids may reduce acute postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. In addition, perioperative gabapentinoid use may also reduce the risk of developing persistent postsurgical pain although the evidence for this effect remains insufficient. Based on these findings, gabapentinoids have been included as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen in some ERPs. However, other studies have called into question the benefit of gabapentinoid use in the perioperative setting as they are associated with adverse effects, and their analgesic and opioid-sparing effects may in fact be clinically insignificant. In particular, use of gabapentinoids has been linked to sedation, visual disturbances, and dizziness that can hinder early postoperative mobilization and delay recovery. In addition, perioperative gabapentin use has been associated with risk of respiratory depression, especially in older patients and those receiving higher doses of opioids. Overall, the quality of evidence supporting the perioperative use of gabapentinoids remains low, and optimal dosing has not been clearly established. Furthermore, gabapentinoids are currently only available in oral formulations, which may limit their use in the acute postoperative setting. Therefore, while gabapentinoids are a potential opioid-sparing adjunct for management of postoperative pain, the risks and benefits of their use should be carefully considered for each individual patient. In particular, given their side effect profile, gabapentinoids should be used with caution in elderly patients as well as patients with renal dysfunction, which often necessitates dose reduction.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^1129dTCt]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Gabapentin is commonly indicated in the treatment of seizures. Gabapentin, which acts on the nociceptive processes involved in central sensitization, has been shown to reduce hypersensitivity associated with nerve injury (hyperalgesia) and postoperative pain and inflammation in animal models. Interestingly, gabapentin's antiemetic effects were first recognized when studies involving breast cancer patients demonstrated a significant reduction in chemotherapy-induced nausea with the use of gabapentin. Gabapentin's antiemetic effects are likely attributable to the reduced tachykinin neurotransmission and the direct reduction in postoperative opioid consumption.

The results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the postoperative cumulative consumption of fentanyl, morphine, and tramadol during the initial 24 hours following surgery with the administration of preoperative gabapentin. Significant reductions in postoperative opioid consumption were observed following abdominal hysterectomy, breast cancer surgery, cholecystectomy, orthopedic surgeries, spinal surgeries, and thyroid surgeries. Although not significant, a small reduction in postoperative opioid consumption was observed following caesarian sections, prostatectomy, and thoracotomy. There was no significant differences observed in vomiting and nausea incidences with the use of gabapentin; however, a recent meta-analysis by Grant et alevaluating the use of preoperative gabapentin on postoperative nausea and vomiting reported statistically significant reductions in postoperative nausea (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67–0.85, P < 0.0001; 42 studies involving 2,349 patients) and vomiting (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56–0.80, P < 0.0001; 36 studies involving 2,024 patients). In all the trials, gabapentin was administered preoperatively as a single oral dose or two divided doses 2–24 hours before surgery at a dose ranging from 300 mg to 1,200 mg. This study also identified an association between cumulative gabapentin dose and reduction in morphine consumption. The higher the dose of gabapentin, the greater the reduction in morphine consumption.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^1112Knce]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Effective postoperative pain management is crucial in the care of surgical patients. Opioids, which are commonly used in managing postoperative pain, have a potential for tolerance and addiction, along with sedating side effects. Gabapentin's use as a multimodal analgesic regimen to treat neuropathic pain has been documented as having favorable side effects. This meta-analysis examined the use of preoperative gabapentin and its impact on postoperative opioid consumption.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify randomized control trials that evaluated preoperative gabapentin on postoperative opioid consumption. The outcomes of interest were cumulative opioid consumption following the surgery and the incidence of vomiting, somnolence, and nausea.

Results

A total of 1,793 patients involved in 17 randomized control trials formed the final analysis for this study. Postoperative opioid consumption was reduced when using gabapentin within the initial 24 hours following surgery (standard mean difference -1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.96 to -0.73; P < 0.001). There was a significant reduction in morphine, fentanyl, and tramadol consumption (P < 0.05). While a significant increase in postoperative somnolence incidence was observed (relative risk 1.30, 95% CI: 1.10–1.54, P < 0.05), there were no significant effects on postoperative vomiting and nausea.

Conclusion

The administration of preoperative gabapentin reduced the consumption of opioids during the initial 24 hours following surgery. The reduction in postoperative opioids with preoperative gabapentin increased postoperative somnolence, but no significant differences were observed in nausea and vomiting incidences. The results from this study demonstrate that gabapentin is more beneficial in mastectomy and spinal, abdominal, and thyroid surgeries. Gabapentin is an effective analgesic adjunct, and clinicians should consider its use in multimodal treatment plans among patients undergoing elective surgery.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^11354HU5]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

A subgroup analysis identified that gabapentin significantly reduced total cumulative morphine consumption at 300 mg (SMD −1.48, 95% CI: −2.90 to −0.05; P = 0.04), 600 mg (SMD −1.35, 95% CI: −2.41 to −0.28; P = 0.01), and 1,200 mg (SMD −2.27, 95% CI: −3.02 to −1.52; P < 0.001). Heterogeneity was statistically significant between groups, P < 0.001 (Figure 5).

Meta-regression analyses identified a statistical association between postoperative opioid consumption and gabapentin dosage (slope 95% CI: −0.00061 [−0.00021–0.00101], P = 0.00288, compared with slope = 0).

Effect of gabapentin on secondary outcomes

Nausea, vomiting, and somnolence incidence rates in the gabapentin and control groups were reported in ten and eleven trials, respectively. A fixed-effect model was assumed since heterogeneity was not observed between trials (P = 0.45, I² = 0.000). Statistically significant differences in nausea or vomiting between the gabapentin and control groups (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.87–1.34, P = 0.44 and RR = 0.839, 95% CI: 0.61–1.51, P = 0.277, respectively) were not observed in the meta-analysis (Figures 6 and 7). Eight trials reported data on the incidence of postoperative somnolence. Between trials, the results demonstrated statistically significant heterogeneity (P = 0.001, I² = 68.69), and therefore, a random-effects model was assumed. Gabapentin significantly increased somnolence incidence (RR = 1.304, 95% CI: 1.104–1.54, P < 0.05; Figure 8).

Publication bias

Egger's and Begg's tests were performed to calculate and evaluate publication bias for the primary outcome. Evidence of asymmetry was not observed on the funnel plot (Figure 9). The results demonstrated that publication bias was not statistically significant by Egger's test or Begg's test, P = 0.57 and P = 0.53, respectively.

### Gabapentin and postoperative pain: a qualitative and quantitative systematic review, with focus on procedure [^114jUgZU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

Side-effects

One of the major challenges in postoperative pain treatment is to combine different treatment modalities, in order to improve patient analgesia and potentially reduce side-effects. A cornerstone in this area is to minimize the need for postoperative opioid analgesics and hopefully reduce side effects, especially postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Zhao et al has reported a dose-response relationship between opioid use and adverse events for patients in ambulatory surgery. Every 3–4 mg increase of morphine usage was associated with 1 additional clinically meaningful opioid-related symptom. Marret et al reported that the opioid sparing by NSAID and COX-2 inhibitors (approximately 30%) was followed by a significant reduction in PONV and sedation (also by approximately 30%), but not in urinary retention and respiratory depression.

In this light it is noteworthy, that despite of the opioid sparing effect with gabapentin, our analyses of side-effects showed a just significant lower incidence of nausea in favour of gabapentin for abdominal hysterectomy, but not spinal surgery patients, while vomiting and sedation were non-significant between treatment groups. These disappointing results correspond with results from another review on opioid sparing with the use of COX-2 inhibitors and the lack of evidence for reduction of opioid related side-effects.

One of the reasons for this finding could be the relatively small number of patients and thereby low statistical power of our analyses. A post-hoc statistical power calculation of the non-significant quantitative analyses of adverse events, using a risk of Type I error on 5% and the observed cumulated difference between treatment groups, revealed a statistical power of less than 50% on analyses of most adverse events in both abdominal and spinal surgery.

Another reason could be the lack of quality of data on adverse events from the original papers, as in most reports adverse events were not well defined and only reported as present or absent. Furthermore, data of adverse events were a mixture of spontaneous reporting and specific questioning.

We did not find any sign of clinically limiting side-effect with the use of gabapentin, and especially the data for sedation and dizziness were non-significant. It is possible that the well-known sedative effect of gabapentin may be masked by the use of opioids in the studies and the fact that we monitor patients in the early phase after general anaesthesia.

Perioperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) adjunct strategies — There is RCT evidence that adding total intravenous anesthesia with propofol to a multimodal antiemetic regimen "is superior to a multimodal antiemetic regimen with inhaled anesthetics". For intravenous acetaminophen, a meta-analysis of "30 RCTs including 2364 patients" found that dosing "either before surgery or before arrival in the postanesthesia care unit reduced the risk of nausea and pain", but it "was not effective in preventing PONV if given after the onset of pain". Regarding gabapentin, "There have now been 17 randomized controlled clinical trials" showing a quantitative meta-analysis in which the pooled relative risk of nausea and vomiting is "lower in patients who receive preoperative gabapentin", the benefits "appeared reduced in the presence of the use of propofol", and "the level of evidence is strong in support of gabapentin".

### Prophylactic gabapentin during head and neck cancer therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111e7Kra]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 65,000 patients will be diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC) in the United States each year resulting in over 15,000 deaths annually. Unfortunately, the incidence of locally advanced HNC has been increasing particularly among African American and male subpopulations. In addition, there has been a rise in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancers which is associated with both younger patients and improved survival. This demographic shift brings supportive and survivorship care to the forefront. This is particularly salient in younger survivors who will have to contend with treatment-related morbidities for a greater amount of time.

Patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy for HNC experience a wide variety of acute toxicities secondary to treatment. One of the most challenging toxicities to manage is mucositis and associated pain. Mucositis-associated pain can lead to numerous complications including dysphagia, odynophagia, dehydration, and weight loss. This pain may lead to feeding tube placement to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Standard pain management regimens in HNC patients are generally reactive and include opioids in combination with various adjunct medications. Mucositis-associated pain is notoriously opioid resistant; furthermore, opioids produce unwanted side effects including nausea, constipation, and central nervous system symptoms that may interfere with cancer treatment and can lead to dependence. Therefore, it is imperative that analgesic adjuncts that may reduce the amount of opioids needed during HNC therapy be thoroughly evaluated. One promising analgesic adjunct beginning to be used in this patient population is gabapentin.

Gabapentin is a potent anti-inflammatory and neuromodulator agent that is frequently used in the treatment of neuropathic pain. It has been studied in the context of HNC therapy as an adjunct for the management of acute pain, prevention (prophylaxis) of pain and treatment-related toxicity, and prevention of adverse events such as feeding tube placement. The primary purpose of this review is to summarize the available data on the use of prophylactic gabapentin in HNC patients undergoing concurrent chemoradiation. Prophylactic therapy is defined as the use of gabapentin before or at the start of radiation-based therapy regardless of whether the patient does or does not have pain. Given the sparsity of data on the subject, in order to provide the most clinically actionable data, this review summarizes data from randomized trials, prospective studies with historical controls, and retrospective studies. It is noteworthy that the randomized trials on this topic are all relatively small and thus gain only partial protection from unmeasured confounding based on their size.

### Intrathecal gabapentin to treat chronic intractable noncancer pain [^117XGTdr]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Oral gabapentin is approved as an anticonvulsant medication and to treat postherpetic neuralgia. Its nonopioid properties and presumed spinal site of analgesic action made the study on intrathecal gabapentin attractive to establish the minimum effective dose for a later, pivotal trial.

Methods

The authors examined the safety and efficacy of intrathecal gabapentin in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in a heterogeneous cohort of candidates with chronic pain for intrathecal drug therapy.

Results

Patients (N = 170) were randomized to receive continuous intrathecal gabapentin (0 [placebo], 1, 6, or 30mg/day) during 22 days of blinded treatment after implantation of a permanent drug delivery system. The highest dose, 30mg/day, was selected to maintain a safety margin below the 100-mg/day dose that was explored in a phase 1 study. The authors found no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome measure, which was the numerical pain rating scale and response rate after 3 weeks, for any dose versus placebo. Physical functioning, quality of life, and emotional functioning also revealed no differences. Small, nonsignificant changes occurred in opioid medication use. The most frequent device-related adverse events were transient postimplant (lumbar puncture) headache, pain, and nausea. The most frequent gabapentin-related adverse events were nausea, somnolence, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and peripheral edema.

Conclusion

Twenty-two days of intrathecal gabapentin did not demonstrate statistically significant or clinically meaningful analgesic effects. The study sponsor has no current plans for further studies. Drug-related adverse events were similar to those for oral gabapentin. Most device-related adverse events resulted from the implant surgery or anesthesia.

### Pharmacological treatment for pain in Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^111RNGu4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pain in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is common, yet it is often under recognised and poorly managed. In recent years, a variety of pharmacological treatment options have been investigated in clinical trials for people with GBS-associated pain. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 10, 2013.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for various pain symptoms associated with GBS, during both the acute and convalescent (three months or more after onset) phases of GBS.

Search Methods

On 3 November 2014, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in participants with confirmed GBS, with pain assessment as either the primary or secondary outcome. For cross-over trials, an adequate washout period between phases was required for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy and assessed the risk of bias of each study.

Main Results

Three short-term RCTs, which enrolled 277 randomised participants with acute phase GBS, were included. Risk of bias in the included studies was generally unclear due to insufficient information. None of the included studies reported the primary outcome selected for this review, which was number of patients with self reported pain relief of 50% or greater. One small study investigated seven-day regimens of gabapentin versus placebo. Pain was rated on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain). Amongst the 18 participants, significantly lower mean pain scores were found at the endpoint (day 7) in the gabapentin phase compared to the endpoint of the placebo phase (mean difference -3.61, 95% CI -4.12 to -3.10) (very low quality evidence). For adverse events, no significant differences were found in the incidence of nausea (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.04) or constipation (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.54). A second study enrolling 36 participants compared gabapentin, carbamazepine and placebo, all administered over seven days. Participants in the gabapentin group had significantly lower median pain scores on all treatment days in comparison to the placebo and carbamazepine groups (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the median pain scores between the carbamazepine and placebo groups from day 1 to day 3, but from day 4 until the end of the study significantly lower median pain scores were noted in the carbamazepine group (P < 0.05) (very low quality evidence). There were no adverse effects of gabapentin or carbamazepine reported, other than sedation. One large RCT (223 participants, all also treated with intravenous immunoglobulin), compared a five-day course of methylprednisolone with placebo and found no statistically significant differences in number of participants developing pain (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.16), number of participants with decreased pain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.42) or number of participants with increased pain (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.41) (low quality evidence). The study did not report whether there were any adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review we found no new studies. While management of pain in GBS is essential and pharmacotherapy is widely accepted as being an important component of treatment, this review does not provide sufficient evidence to support the use of any pharmacological intervention in people with pain in GBS. Although reductions in pain severity were found when comparing gabapentin and carbamazepine with placebo, the evidence was limited and its quality very low. Larger, well-designed RCTs are required to further investigate the efficacy and safety of potential interventions for patients with pain in GBS. Additionally, interventions for pain in the convalescent phase of GBS should be investigated.

### Effect of gabapentin on hyperemesis gravidarum: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^114CbVmx]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a disabling disease of nausea, vomiting, and undernutrition in early pregnancy for which there are no effective outpatient therapies. Poor weight gain in hyperemesis gravidarum is associated with several adverse fetal outcomes including preterm delivery, low birthweight, small for gestational age, low 5-minute Apgar scores, and neurodevelopmental delay. Gabapentin is most commonly used clinically for treating neuropathic pain but also substantially reduces chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Pregnancy registry data have shown maternal first-trimester gabapentin monotherapy to be associated with a 1.2% rate of major congenital malformations among 659 infants, which compares favorably with the 1.6% to 2.2% major congenital malformation rate in the general population. Open-label gabapentin treatment in hyperemesis gravidarum was associated with reduced nausea and vomiting and improved oral nutrition.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether gabapentin is more effective than standard-of-care therapy for treating hyperemesis gravidarum.

Study Design

A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted among patients with medically refractory hyperemesis gravidarum requiring intravenous hydration. Patients were randomized (1:1) to either oral gabapentin (1800–2400 mg/d) or an active comparator of either oral ondansetron (24–32 mg/d) or oral metoclopramide (45–60 mg/d) for 7 days. Differences in Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis total scores between treatment groups averaged over days 5 to 7, using intention-to-treat principle employing a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for baseline Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis scores, which served as the primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes included Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis nausea and vomit and retch subscores, oral nutrition, global satisfaction of treatment, relief, desire to continue therapy, Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy Quality of Life, and Hyperemesis Gravidarum Pregnancy Termination Consideration. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made employing the false discovery rate.

Results

A total of 31 patients with hyperemesis gravidarum were enrolled from October 2014 to May 2019. Among the 21 patients providing primary outcome data (12 assigned to gabapentin and 9 to the active comparator arm), 18 were enrolled as outpatients and all 21 were outpatients from days 5 to 7. The study groups' baseline characteristics were well matched. Gabapentin treatment provided a 52% greater reduction in days 5 to 7 baseline adjusted Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis total scores than treatment with active comparator (95% confidence interval, 16–88; p = 0.01). Most secondary outcomes also favored gabapentin over active comparator treatment including 46% and 49% decreases in baseline adjusted Motherisk-pregnancy-unique quantification of nausea and emesis nausea (95% confidence interval, 19–72; p = 0.005) and vomit and retch subscores (95% confidence interval, 21–77; p = 0.005), respectively; a 96% increase in baseline adjusted oral nutrition scores (95% confidence interval, 27–165; p = 0.01); and a 254% difference in global satisfaction of treatment (95% confidence interval, 48–459; p = 0.03). Relief (P = 0.06) and desire to continue therapy (P = 0.06) both showed trends favoring gabapentin treatment but Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy Quality of Life (P = 0.68) and Hyperemesis Gravidarum Pregnancy Termination Consideration (P = 0.58) did not. Adverse events were roughly equivalent between the groups. There were no serious adverse events.

Conclusion

In this small trial, gabapentin was more effective than standard-of-care therapy for reducing nausea and vomiting and increasing oral nutrition and global satisfaction in outpatients with hyperemesis gravidarum. These data build on previous findings in other patient populations supporting gabapentin as a novel antinausea and antiemetic therapy and support further research on gabapentin for this challenging complication of pregnancy.

### Different gabapentin and pregabalin dosages for perioperative pain control in patients undergoing spine surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112ucdy1]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Research Protocol and Search Question

We followed the PICO (problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) search protocol framework to investigate the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients undergoing spinal surgery. The primary outcome of our study was pain intensity measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with secondary outcomes including adverse events (ie, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness) and opioid consumption. We adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline and registered the study in PROSPERO. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in accordance with the guidelines outlined by the Common Rule, which exempts this research from the requirement of institutional review board approval.

Eligibility Criteria

We included studies involving adult patients undergoing spine surgery with specific doses of gabapentin or pregabalin. We excluded single-group studies, case reports, basic science experiments, and animal or cadaver studies, as well as studies with patients with severe infection or under immunosuppression. We also excluded conference abstracts without full-length articles.

Search Strategy and Study Selection

The electronic database search strategy is outlined in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. We conducted a comprehensive search using controlled vocabulary and keywords in Ovid/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and Scopus for randomized clinical trials (RCTs), up to August 2021. Two reviewers (S.H.L.T. C.W.H.) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with a third reviewer (T.Y.L.) when necessary.

Data Collection and Quality Assessment

Two independent reviewers (S.H.L.T. and C.W.H.) extracted data onto a preplanned Excel (version 2013; Microsoft) spreadsheet, including study characteristics, patient demographics, outcomes, and funding sources. Pain intensity was standardized using VAS scores ranging from 0 to 10 (with higher scores indicating worse pain), and opioid consumption was measured in milligrams and all data were converted into morphine milligram equivalents. We considered the concept of minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) and assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We conducted a literature review to determine the MCID values for pregabalin and gabapentin and indicated an MCID of 1.5 points on the VAS for these medications. The IQR was divided by 1.35 as approximate SD data when SD was not available.

### Is gabapentin effective and safe in open hysterectomy? A PRISMA compliant meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115DPvgz]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain management after open hysterectomy has been investigated for years. Owing to the effect of significant analgesic, gabapentin was often administrated for pre-emptive analgesia. However, the relationship between gabapentin and postoperative pain after open hysterectomy is still controversial. This meta-analysis was applied to assess the efficacy of pre-emptive use of gabapentin in open hysterectomy.

Methods

This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to compare the use of gabapentin with placebo in open hysterectomy regarding (1) the mean difference (MD) of postoperative opioid requirements; (2) the changes of visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in two groups; and (3) incidence rate of adverse effects. Systematic searches of all related literatures was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov and Web of Science. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for open hysterectomy were included. The MD of postoperative opioid requirements and VAS scores, relative risk (RR) of incidence rate of adverse effects in the gabapentin group versus placebo group were extracted throughout the study.

Results

Fourteen trials were included in this meta-analysis. The total opioid consumption at 24h was a less in gabapentin group. (MD = -11.61, 95% CI: -16.71 to -6.51, P = 0.00) The visual analogue scale (VAS) score at 4, 12 and 24h were less in the gabapentin group. (MD = -16.83, 95% CI: -22.88 to -10.77, P = 0.00), (MD = -17.45, 95% CI: -21.83 to -13.08, P = 0.00), (MD = -9.83, 95% CI: -13.31 to -6.35, P = 0.00) The incidence rate of vomiting and nausea were significantly less in gabapentin groups. (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73, P = 0.00), (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.93, P = 0.02). Compared with placebo, gabapentin achieved higher patient satisfaction. (MD = 20.43, 95% CI: 12.42 to 28.44, P < 0.00).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis suggested that the employment of gabapentin was efficacious in reduction of postoperative opioid consumption, VAS score and some side effects after open hysterectomy.

Nausea and vomiting

Four trials including 112 patients receiving gabapentin provided data on postoperative nausea, and the combined data showed that the RR was significant in favour of gabapentin (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.9) (Figure 7). Three trials provided data on postoperative vomiting. Calculation of the RR was non-significant (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.6 to 1.2) (Figure 8).

In summary, cumulative 24-hour opioid consumption and early pain scores were significantly reduced with gabapentin. Nausea, but not vomiting, dizziness and sedation, was significantly reduced with gabapentin.

Spinal surgery

Three studies administered a single dose of preoperative gabapentin and one study a multiple doses regimen. (For details, see Table 1)

Opioid consumption

Three trials of spinal surgery including 113 patients receiving gabapentin provided data on cumulative 24-hour supplemental opioid consumption. The combined data showed that the WMD between study groups was significant in favour of gabapentin (WMD -31 mg, 95% CI -53 to -10 mg) (Figure 11).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving gabapentin and have been identified during postapproval use of HORIZANT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: breast enlargement, gynecomastia, elevated creatine kinase, bullous pemphigoid.

There are postmarketing reports of life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression in patients taking gabapentin with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

There are postmarketing reports of withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of gabapentin. Reported adverse reactions include, but are not limited to, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, agitation, confusion, disorientation, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, tremor, headache, dizziness, and malaise [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Pain intensity at rest

Early postoperatively

All 23 included trials reported on pain scores at rest early after operation. In twelve of these 23 trials, significantly lower pain scores were observed with gabapentin. The reduction in pain ranged between 10 and 29 mm on the VAS score. None of the eleven trials with no observed reduction in pain intensity had sufficient internal sensitivity since pain scores in none of the control groups were more than 30 mm on the VAS.

Late postoperatively

Nineteen of the included 23 studies reported on late (24 hours) pain score at rest. In ten of these trials a significantly lower pain score, varying between a reduction of 5 and 23 mm on the VAS, was observed with gabapentin. Only one of the trials with no observed reduction in pain intensity had sufficient internal sensitivity.

No obvious dose response relationship was apparent between significant and non-significant trials with respect to late pain scores.

Pain scores during activity

Early postoperatively

Eleven trials reported on pain during activity early after operation. Five of these observed a significant reduction with gabapentin, varying between 8 and 22 mm on the VAS. Four of the six trials with no observed reduction in pain intensity had sufficient internal sensitivity.

Late postoperatively

Nine trials reported on late pain score during activity and four trials observed a significantly lower pain score with gabapentin, varying between 6 and 21 mm on the VAS score. Three of the five trials with no observed reduction in pain intensity had sufficient internal sensitivity.

Side-effects

Nausea

Twenty-one studies including 763 patients receiving gabapentin reported on postoperative nausea. In twenty of these no significant differences between study groups were observed, however, in one study on laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly more nausea and vomiting was observed in the gabapentin group.

Vomiting

Seventeen studies including 529 patients receiving gabapentin reported on vomiting and in 14 of these no differences between groups were observed. One author found a higher incidence and two authors a significant lower incidence of vomiting with gabapentin.

Dizziness

Eighteen studies including 690 patients receiving gabapentin reported on this endpoint. Fourteen found no difference in incidence between the groups. Three authors found a higher incidence in the gabapentin group, and one a higher incidence in the placebo group.

### Combination of gabapentin and ramosetron for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery: a prospective randomized comparative study [^114AQfws]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

The present study is the first to compare ramosetron and gabapentin as antiemetic agents. Although a variety of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in preventing PONV on the basis of their efficacy and safety following gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, the higher costs of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists remain a major drawback. Moreover, co-administration of antiemetics with different mechanisms of action has been suggested as a way to increase the complete response rate of patients who have an elevated risk of PONV. In general, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists plus various drugs from different classes, including i.v. dexamethasone 4–5 mg, i.v. droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg, and oral aprepitant 40 mg have been shown to reduce PONV to a greater extent than single therapy with any of the drugs. These results are consistent with our study. In our trial, addition of gabapentin to ramosetron led to a further reduction in the incidence PONV (to 24%), without the appearance of substantial side effects. Furthermore, gabapentin is a relatively inexpensive medication, the use of which can result in significant cost savings. Therefore, gabapentin may be a useful choice for combination therapy to prevent PONV, especially in high-risk patients. Consequently, on the basis of its safety profile and cost, gabapentin might be beneficially included in the current list of PONV prophylactic regimens.

The actual mechanism by which gabapentin suppresses nausea and vomiting has been under discussion. It has been suggested that gabapentin reduces calcium signaling in the area postrema; mitigates tachykinin neurotransmitter activity; decreases perioperative inflammation at the site of surgical trauma, resulting in decreased postoperative ileus and subsequent PONV; and reduces perioperative opioid requirements. It seems reasonable to conclude that some combination of the abovementioned mechanisms may be responsible for gabapentin's antiemetic efficacy.

In this study, it is interesting that the proportion of patients without nausea at 24–48 h after anesthesia was high in the group GR regarding elimination half life (4.8–8.7 h) and duration (8–12 h) of action of gabapentin. This is clinically meaningful when considering the report that the PONV symptoms can appear up to at least 72 h after discharge from PACU. This finding might be explained in part by the possibility of long-lasting (> possibly 24 h) antiemetic effect of gabapentin. Further clinical trials are required to address this issue.

### American Geriatrics Society abstracted clinical practice guideline for postoperative delirium in older adults [^116k4quU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

Analgesia optimization to prevent postoperative delirium — Healthcare professionals should optimize postoperative pain control, preferably with nonopioid pain medications, to minimize pain in older adults to prevent delirium (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low). Adequate postoperative analgesia is associated with decreased delirium, and studies have found associations between increases in untreated pain and postoperative delirium; while evidence for prescribing nonopioid alternatives is less compelling, clinical studies of gabapentin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and celecoxib reported reduced incidence with nonopioid pain management. Potential harms include opioid risks such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, sedation, impaired judgment, altered psychomotor function, rash, pruritus, anaphylactic allergic reactions, and dependence, and the need for monitoring for respiratory depression; nonopioid medications also have potential harms.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

HORIZANT contains gabapentin enacarbil, a prodrug of gabapentin, which is not a controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Gabapentin does not exhibit affinity for benzodiazepine, opioid (mu, delta, or kappa), or cannabinoid 1 receptor sites. A small number of postmarketing cases report gabapentin misuse and abuse. These individuals were taking higher than recommended doses of gabapentin for unapproved uses. Most of the individuals described in these reports had a history of poly- substance abuse or used gabapentin to relieve symptoms of withdrawal from other substances.

When prescribing products that deliver gabapentin, carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and observe them for signs and symptoms of gabapentin misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, self-dose escalation, and drug-seeking behavior).

9.3 Dependence

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with gabapentin, withdrawal symptoms have been observed in some patients. Withdrawal symptoms may occur shortly after discontinuation, usually within 48 hours. In the postmarketing setting, reported adverse reactions have included, but not been limited to, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, agitation, confusion, disorientation, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, tremor, headache, dizziness, and malaise. The dependence and abuse potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^111dBP92]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Opioids are extremely effective in managing postsurgical pain but have been documented as having an association with somnolence, respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and constipation. Antihistamines, which are frequently used to treat nausea and pruritus, further worsen the sedation and respiratory depression. Respiratory depression has been reported to affect patients treated using analgesia pumps that are patient controlled. Given the frequency of opioid-related complications, high patient morbidity as well as prolonged duration of hospitalization, and higher health care costs, effective methods to minimize postoperative opioid consumption is required.

Multimodal analgesia techniques have been researched extensively and implemented by many institutions as standard postoperative care management. By utilizing multiple medications and therapies that act by different mechanisms of actions within the central and peripheral nervous system, multimodal analgesia can provide individualized targeted patient therapy by taking into account pharmacogenetics such as single gene allelic differences and medication responses to reduce the consumption of opioids and the associated side effects. One such drug is gabapentin that has antihyperalgesic properties. Gabapentin's antihyperalgesic effects result from its action in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord. The safety profile of gabapentin has few associated adverse side effects. Alayed et alreported significant reductions in morphine consumption with the use of gabapentin (standard mean difference [SMD] −1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −1.79 to −1.11; P < 0.05) in a review including four randomized control trials (RCTs) involving 190 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. A significant number of RCTs have demonstrated conflicting results in the use of preoperative gabapentin. Bharti et alstudied gabapentin administration among patients (n = 40) undergoing mastectomy (20 received gabapentin and 20 received placebo) and demonstrated a reduction in the amount of morphine required during the initial 24 hours following surgery with the use of gabapentin (2.1 ± 2.2 mg vs 4.9 ± 3.4 mg, P = 0.06). Conversely, Kinney et aldemonstrated no significant difference in cumulative morphine consumption during the initial 24 hours following surgery (111.9 mg vs 118.1 mg, P = 0.340) in an RCT among patients undergoing thoracotomy (n = 120; 57 patients received gabapentin and 63 patients received placebo).

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^111VXBYr]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

In all, 95% CI and relative risk (RR) were calculated for vomiting, somnolence, and nausea incidences, while 95% CI and SMDs were calculated for cumulative consumption of opioids during the initial 24 hours following surgery. A continuity correction factor of 0.5 was used to calculate RR and variance in RCTs that included zero events. RCTs in which zero events occurred in both gabapentin and control arms were not calculable and were excluded from the current study. A fixed-effect model and a random-effects model were used following an evaluation of the heterogeneity in the included RCT. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic and Cochran's Q statistic. While a fixed-effect model was utilized in the absence of heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used when there existed heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was assumed to be statistically significant when I 2 > 50 or P < 0.05. A funnel plot was used to evaluate publication bias and further evaluated using Begg's and Egger's tests. A subgroup analysis was performed using opioid type (fentanyl, tramadol, or morphine), type of surgery, and dose of gabapentin administered. A two-tailed P -value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses for the current study were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software Version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Postherpetic Neuralgia

The most common adverse reactions associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema.

In the 2 controlled trials in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea.

Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group.

Other reactions in more than 1% of patients but equally or more frequent in the placebo group included pain, tremor, neuralgia, back pain, dyspepsia, dyspnea, and flu syndrome.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse reactions. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by race.

8.3 Safety and tolerability of pharmacotherapy

Safety and tolerability issues, in addition to efficacy data, have been considered when determining recommendations for each phase of illness. The most notable concerns are described below and a summary of their potential impact on treatment selection is included in Table 24, as well as in treatment hierarchy tables in Sections 2‐4. As medication side effects are an important contributor to medication non‐adherence, these potential concerns should be discussed with patients receiving or considering treatment with various agents to help inform decision making.

Table 24
Safety/tolerability concerns and risks of treatment‐emergent switch with pharmacological agents indicated for use in bipolar disorder

8.3.1 Weight gain

As described in Section 6, despite normal weight at illness onset, 806 it is common for patients with BD to become overweight or obese, and several medications used to treat the illness may also exacerbate this effect. The likelihood of medications to cause weight gain should be carefully considered, as this is one of the most frequent treatment‐related factors of non‐adherence; contributing to upwards of 60% of cases. 807 The medications most commonly associated with weight gain are olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, gabapentin, divalproex and lithium; with carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and ziprasidone being the safer or options associated with less weight gain. 808 Recent reviews further suggest that asenapine and aripiprazole (longer term use) 809 also may lead to weight gain, but the impact of lurasidone on weight is minimal. 810 All patients should be regularly monitored for weight changes.

8.3.2 Gastrointestinal symptoms

Both lithium and divalproex are commonly associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, with 35%‐45% of patient experiencing these side effects. 372, 811 For lithium, this is particularly pronounced during treatment initiation, or rapid dose increases. 812 Gradual dose titration, taking the medication at bedtime, taking medications with food, and slow release preparations may reduce nausea and other side effects. 813

### Gabapentin (Neurontin) [^113q2pE3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

NEURONTIN contains gabapentin, which is not a controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed.

Gabapentin does not exhibit affinity for benzodiazepine, opioid (mu, delta or kappa), or cannabinoid 1 receptor sites. Gabapentin misuse and abuse have been reported in the postmarketing setting and published literature. Most of the individuals described in these reports had a history of polysubstance abuse. Some of these individuals were taking higher than recommended doses of gabapentin for unapproved uses. When prescribing NEURONTIN, carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and observe them for signs and symptoms of gabapentin misuse or abuse (e.g., self-dose escalation and drug-seeking behavior). The abuse potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.

9.3 Dependence

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with gabapentin, withdrawal symptoms have been observed in some patients. Withdrawal symptoms may occur shortly after discontinuation, usually within 48 hours. In the postmarketing setting, reported adverse reactions have included, but not been limited to, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, agitation, confusion, disorientation, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, tremor, headache, dizziness, and malaise. The dependence potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.

### Different gabapentin and pregabalin dosages for perioperative pain control in patients undergoing spine surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111GhSV6]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Patients undergoing spine surgery often experience severe pain. The optimal dosage of pregabalin and gabapentin for pain control and safety in these patients has not been well established.

Objective

To evaluate the associations of pain, opioid consumption, and adverse events with different dosages of pregabalin and gabapentin in patients undergoing spine surgery.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, and Scopus databases were searched for articles until August 7, 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials conducted among patients who received pregabalin or gabapentin while undergoing spine surgery were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently performed data extraction following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) reporting guideline. The network meta-analysis was conducted from August 2022 to February 2023 using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was pain intensity measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and secondary outcomes included opioid consumption and adverse events.

Results

Twenty-seven randomized clinical trials with 1861 patients (median age, 45.99 years [range, 20.00–70.00 years]; 759 women [40.8%]) were included in the systematic review and network meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, the VAS pain score was lowest with gabapentin 900 mg per day, followed by gabapentin 1200 mg per day, gabapentin 600 mg per day, gabapentin 300 mg per day, pregabalin 300 mg per day, pregabalin 150 mg per day, and pregabalin 75 mg per day. Additionally, gabapentin 900 mg per day was found to be associated with the lowest opioid consumption among all dosages of gabapentin and pregabalin, with a mean difference of -22.07% (95% CI, -33.22% to -10.92%) for the surface under the cumulative ranking curve compared with placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in adverse events (nausea, vomiting, and dizziness) among all treatments. No substantial inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence was detected for all outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that gabapentin 900 mg per day before spine surgery is associated with the lowest VAS pain score among all dosages. In addition, no differences in adverse events were noted among all treatments.

### Preemptive use of gabapentin in abdominal hysterectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111hMQST]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the evidence of preemptive use of gabapentin in abdominal hysterectomy.

Data Sources

We conducted an electronic based search using the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The following medical subject heading terms, keywords, and their combinations were used: "postoperative pain, hysterectomy, gynecologic surgical procedures, gabapentin, preemptive analgesia, and preemptive anesthesia". We manually searched the reference lists of identified studies.

Methods Of Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials of women who underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, under general anesthesia were examined. Only trials with preoperative dose of gabapentin were included.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

The meta-analysis and systematic review were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Fourteen trials met the inclusion criteria. The pooled data consisted of 448 cases in the gabapentin group and 443 others in the control group. The 24-hour cumulative narcotic consumption and the visual analog scale scores at 24 hours postoperatively were used for postoperative pain assessment. There was a significant decrease in morphine consumption at 24 hours when gabapentin was administered before surgery (from 24.3–55.9 mg to 13.2–42.7 mg, standardized mean difference -0.69) as well before and after surgery (from 25.7–80 mg to 20.3–55 mg, standardized mean difference -1.45), respectively. Metaregression analysis showed that the effect of gabapentin in reducing morphine consumption (compared with placebo) at 24 hours was stronger in the preoperative only group than in the preoperative and postoperative groups. Preemptive gabapentin decreased visual analog scale from 9–42.7 to 2–25.3 (standardized mean difference -1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.36 to -0.71). Compared with the control group (16.1–96.7%), the rate of nausea was less in the gabapentin group (11.6–70%, relative risk 0.76, 95% CI 0.66–0.88).

Conclusion

Preemptive administration of gabapentin is effective in decreasing postoperative pain scores, narcotic consumption, and nausea, and vomiting.

### Responsiveness of life-threatening refractory emesis to gabapentin-scopolamine therapy following posterior fossa surgery. case report [^112355E9]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Craniotomy-associated chronic emesis can be refractory to currently approved antiemetic therapy. The authors describe a man who suffered 4 weeks of severe refractory emesis, failure to thrive, and a 40-lb weight loss after he underwent resection of a posterior fossa cholesteatoma. The patient experienced complete resolution of emesis and anorexia in response to combined gabapentin-scopolamine therapy. This case provides anecdotal evidence for the use of gabapentin-scopolamine therapy in patients with chronic, refractory nausea and emesis, particularly following posterior fossa surgery, during which medullary nausea and emesis centers may be affected.

### Gabapentin as an adjunct for pain management during dilation and evacuation: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^115PpxGj]. Contraception (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of preoperative gabapentin among patients undergoing dilation and evacuation (D&E) with moderate sedation.

Study Design

We conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial among patients undergoing same-day D&E at 14 to 19 weeks gestation under moderate sedation. We randomized participants 1:1 to gabapentin 600 mg or placebo after cervical preparation at least 1 hour prior to D&E. We assessed pain using a 100-mm visual analog scale before, during, and after the procedure. The primary outcome was postoperative recall of maximum procedural pain with a 13-mm a priori threshold for clinical significance. We standardized initial fentanyl and midazolam dosing. We assessed satisfaction with pain control, nausea, and vomiting via Likert scales and anxiety using a validated instrument.

Results

We enrolled 126 participants and randomized 61 to gabapentin and 65 to placebo, with study medication administered a mean of 211 (SD 64) minutes preoperatively. Recall of maximum pain was 41 mm for gabapentin and 49 mm for placebo (p = 0.24). Gabapentin resulted in reduced pain during uterine aspiration (56 vs 71 mm, p = 0.003) compared to placebo, but not for any other time points. The gabapentin group had higher satisfaction (78% vs 65% very or somewhat satisfied, p = 0.01). Median fentanyl dose was lower in the gabapentin group (75 vs 100 mcg, p = 0.005). Midazolam dose, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety did not differ between groups. No serious adverse events occurred in the gabapentin group. Sedation reversal was not required.

Conclusions

The addition of gabapentin to moderate sedation during D&E did not result in lower maximum recalled procedural pain. Gabapentin resulted in reduced intra-operative pain during uterine aspiration and increased satisfaction with pain control.

Implications

Gabapentin reduces intraoperative pain and improves satisfaction with pain management when administered prior to second-trimester surgical abortion and may be considered as an adjunct to intravenous sedation. Moderate sedation may impair assessment and recall of pain. Additional research is needed to identify the most effective pain management regimens for D&E.

### Aprepitant plus palonosetron versus dexamethasone plus palonosetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with moderate-emetogenic chemotherapy: a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial [^112GWXee]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In terms of nausea, the proportion of clinically significant nausea in the aprepitant group was numerically slightly higher than that noted in the dexamethasone group, but there was no significant difference in the proportion of clinically significant nausea between the two groups. The results were consistent with previous studies. David et al. investigated the addition of aprepitant to dexamethasone combined with ondansetron for the prevention of CINV in MEC, which also did not improve overall nausea or significant nausea. This might be explained in part that nausea is a subjective feeling, and the underlying mechanisms of its regulation are currently unknown. It is suggested that substance P plays a more important role in the mechanism of vomiting than nausea, and additional neurotransmitters may be involved in the mechanism of nausea development. Therefore, nausea is rarely used as the primary endpoint in this type of clinical trial while composite endpoints, such as the absence of emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy, are favored as the primary endpoints in clinical trials. It is noted more and more attention is paid to the assessment of nausea. At present, inadequately controlled nausea remains a major problem in many patients. A study has shown that gabapentin may reduce nausea in the both acute and delayed phases. Other antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine may also control nausea. Gabapentin or olanzapine might be considered to be combined with the current experimental drugs to achieve better control of nausea in further study.

### Analgesic efficacy of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgeries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wQ6vu]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

This meta-analysis investigated the effect of oral gabapentinoids (i.e., pregabalin and gabapentin) on analgesic consumption (i.e., primary outcome) and pain relief (i.e., secondary outcome) in patients following bariatric surgery. Analysis of five eligible trials published between 2010 and 2019 including 363 participants receiving gabapentinoids revealed a significantly lower morphine consumption [mean difference (MD) = -15.1 mg, p = 0.004; evidence certainty: low] and risk of nausea/vomiting [risk ratio (RR) = 0.49, p = 0.002; evidence certainty: high] at postoperative 6–24 h. There was also a lower pain score at postoperative 0–4 h (MD = -1.41, p < 0.00001; evidence certainty: low) and 6–12 h (MD = -0.9, p = 0.007; evidence certainty: low) compared with controls, while pain severity at postoperative 24 h was comparable between two groups. In summary, preoperative oral gabapentinoids optimized postoperative pain outcomes and reduced risk of nausea/vomiting following bariatric surgery.

Anticonvulsants — anticonvulsants are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 8 RCTs and a Cochrane review that failed to demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm. None of the RCTs have shown a clear benefit, and a Cochrane review of 7 placebo-controlled trials found no improvement of tinnitus or health-related QOL. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of an 8-week treatment with gabapentin showed no differences between gabapentin and control groups when assessing the tinnitus severity index or loudness scores. Reported side effects during these RCTs were significant, most commonly nausea, dizziness, and headaches.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^114RdnsA]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Pain management in cirrhosis — adjuvant analgesics are characterized by the following: Gabapentinoids are effective in treating neuropathic pain but are potentially habit forming and associated with somnolence and mental status changes, and for patients with cirrhosis, very low starting doses of gabapentin (e.g., < 300 mg/d) are recommended. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can provide good adjuvant pain medication at low doses with a low risk of hepatotoxicity, whereas tricyclic antidepressants' anticholinergic effects and associated mental status impairments generally preclude their use in patients with cirrhosis. Medical cannabinoids are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, cannabis (marijuana) is not FDA approved for any indication at this time, and significantly more data are needed before recommending cannabinoid/cannabis as an analgesic for patients with DC.

### Effects of a single dose of preoperative pregabalin and gabapentin for acute postoperative pain: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114UomBF]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Secondary outcomes (adverse events)

Overall, PGB 300 mg reduced the incidence of PONV (PGB 300 mg vs PBO: OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09, 0.37) and nausea (PGB 300 mg vs PBO: OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35, 0.72) compared with the control groups. In addition, patients with GBP 1,200 mg showed higher incidence of PONV (GBP 1,200 mg vs PBO: OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.48, 18.34). However, incidence of dizziness increased when PGB 150 mg or PGB 300 mg was used (PGB 150 mg vs PBO: OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10, 3.42; PGB 300 mg vs PBO: OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.46, 4.23). No significant differences were found between the interventions and control groups for incidence of vomiting (Table 1). Complete forest plots of summary effects are displayed in.

Risk of bias assessment

The risk of bias assessment is presented in Figure 5 as well as in. The most common high risk of bias was selective reporting (16.5%), which principally resulted from the consideration of incomplete outcome data. As illustrated in, no risk of publication bias was found for any outcomes. A contribution plot showed the risk of bias of each direct or indirect comparison, which is shown in.

Sensitivity analyses

We conducted sensitivity analyses for opioid consumption by excluding studies only reporting median instead of mean (n = 8). SUCRA ranking for overall treatment was not markedly affected: PGB 300 mg (83.6), GBP 1,200 mg (82.4), GBP 900 mg (63.6.), PGB 150 mg (61.2), PGB 75 mg (42.8), GBP 600 mg (34.8), GBP 300 mg (29.1), and PBO (2.5). Heterogeneity variance was 1.19.

Inconsistency

Node-splitting method was used to assess inconsistency in the analysis. Only a few loops had inconsistent results for each outcome.

### The efficacy of gabapentin / pregabalin in improving pain after tonsillectomy: a meta-analysis [^1125bxwG]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Gabapentin and pregabalin are useful for treating neuropathic pain because of their antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic properties, which may be beneficial in managing acute postoperative pain. The goal of this meta-analysis was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the effect of gabapentinoids on postoperative pain following tonsillectomy, and its adverse effects in patients.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane database.

Methods

Two authors independently searched the databases from their inception of article collection to May 2015. Included in the analysis were studies that compared preoperative gabapentinoid administration (gabapentinoids groups) with a placebo or pain control agent (control group) during a 24-hour postoperative period, the outcomes of interest being postoperative pain intensity; rescue analgesic consumption; or adverse effects such as sedation, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and headache.

Results

The pain score reported by the physician during the first 8 hours, as well as the need for analgesics during 24 hours postoperatively, were significantly decreased in the gabapentinoids group versus the control group. Additionally, there was no significant difference between gabapentinoids and control groups for adverse effect during 24 hours postoperatively. In the subgroup analyses (gabapentin and pregabalin) regarding pain-related measurements, two subgroups showed the similar effect on reducing the postoperative pain severity.

Conclusion

Preoperative administration of gabapentinoids could provide pain relief without side effects in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. However, considering the insufficient evaluation of efficacy of gabapentinoids according to the high heterogeneity in some parameters, further clinical trials with robust research methodology should be conducted in order to confirm the results of this study.

### Different gabapentin and pregabalin dosages for perioperative pain control in patients undergoing spine surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116woRj9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Study Characteristics and Description

Our network meta-analysis included 27 RCTs with a total of 1861 patients (median age, 45.99 years [range, 20.00–70.00 years]; 802 women [43.1%]) including 777 patients who used placebo, included in the analysis. The network graphs are presented in Figure 2 and eFigure 1 in Supplement 1, and the main characteristics of the included studies are reported in Table 1. The included studies were conducted in Asia (21 studies; 1528 patients), the US (1 study; 86 patients), and Europe (5 studies; 247 patients)., eTable 3 in Supplement 1 provides detailed information regarding the use of gabapentinoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs before the study, preexisting neuropathic pain, the duration of perioperative administration of gabapentinoids, the timing of outcome assessments, reported comorbidities, comedications, and other outcomes. The transitivity was acceptable owing to insignificant variability identified in the study, population baselines, and network graph structure. Detailed risk of bias assessments is presented in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1. Some studies, had funding from pharmaceutical companies, research centers from universities, and relevant departments from hospitals and foundations (Table 1).

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^113z2LiM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Medically refractory gastroparesis — visceral pain management includes neuromodulators, anticonvulsants, and avoidance of opioids. High-quality evidence is limited to a single placebo controlled randomized controlled trial of nortriptyline that, using a strict primary outcome of ≥ 50% reduction in 2 consecutive GCSI score assessments compared with baseline, found no difference between a tailored nortriptyline dose and placebo. Because of the significant overlap with functional dyspepsia, more potent tertiary tricyclic amines (amitriptyline, imipramine) may potentially provide greater benefits, although prospective RCT data in gastroparesis patients are lacking. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may improve coexisting anxiety and depression but are unlikely to directly improve visceral pain because they do not block serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake; mirtazapine improved refractory nausea and vomiting in a cohort of 30 gastroparesis patients and improved weight loss, dyspeptic symptoms, and especially early satiation in a controlled trial in functional dyspepsia. Duloxetine, an SNRI, improved diabetic polyneuropathic pain at 60–120 mg over 12 weeks but nausea or constipation can develop or worsen. A systematic review reported that gabapentin (> 1200 mg daily in divided doses) achieved at least > 50% reduction in pain compared with placebo, though selective outcome reporting has called some evidence into question. Pregabalin reduced mean pain scores over 5–13 weeks at 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily in divided doses, with dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral edema as side effects. Finally, opioid analgesics should not be used to manage chronic visceral abdominal pain, and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition, as provided by tricyclic antidepressants and SNRIs, is considered the main mechanism for controlling visceral pain.

### AAOS / METRC clinical practice guideline summary: pharmacologic, physical, and cognitive pain alleviation for musculoskeletal extremity / pelvis surgery [^116rADt3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Gabapentin — summary of evidence across randomized studies indicates that four high level studies evaluated multi-dosed perioperative oral gabapentin. Lunn 2015 looked at high dose (1300mg/d) and low dose (900mg/d) gabapentin protocol consisting of a single preoperative dose through 7 days post operatively in TKA, with sleep quality better in the first 48 hrs. but no differences in overall pain or morphine use and dizziness more frequently observed. Paul evaluated pre- (600mg) and post-operative (200mg TID) gabapentin in TKA and THA and found no differences in pain, ROM, morphine consumption, satisfaction, or length of stay. Clarke 2014 used 600mg pre- and 200mg TID post-operative gabapentin (or placebo) for 4 days in TKA; the gabapentin group used significantly less morphine in the first 24 hrs. and increased in hospital knee ROM, with no differences in pain or physical function at 4 days, 6 wks., and 3 months after surgery, while the placebo group had significantly more nausea and pruritus on POD 1 and dizziness on POD 3. Two high quality single-dose studies found no difference in pain or morphine consumption, including 600 mg before or after THA and 300 mg following ORIF of a tibia fracture.

### Gabapentin for the prevention of postoperative pain after vaginal hysterectomy [^114oNdpX]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

Gabapentin alleviates and/or prevents acute nociceptive and inflammatory pain both in animals and volunteers, especially when given before trauma. Gabapentin might also reduce postoperative pain. To test the hypothesis that gabapentin reduces the postoperative need for additional pain treatment (postoperative opioid sparing effect of gabapentin in humans), we gave 1200 mg of gabapentin or 15 mg of oxazepam (active placebo) 2.5 h prior to induction of anaesthesia to patients undergoing elective vaginal hysterectomy in an active placebo-controlled, double blind, randomised study. Gabapentin reduced the need for additional postoperative pain treatment (PCA boluses of 50 microg of fentanyl) by 40% during the first 20 postoperative hours. During the first 2 postoperative hours pain scores at rest and worst pain score (VAS 0–100 mm) were significantly higher in the active placebo group compared to the gabapentin-treated patients. Additionally, pretreatment with gabapentin reduced the degree of postoperative nausea and incidence of vomiting/retching possibly either due to the diminished need for postoperative pain treatment with opioids or because of an anti-emetic effect of gabapentin itself. No preoperative differences between the two groups were encountered with respect to the side effects of the premedication. However, 15 mg oxazepam was more effective in relieving preoperative anxiety than 1200 mg gabapentin.

Nonopioid Medications for Subacute and Chronic Pain

Several nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and selected antidepressants and anticonvulsants) are used for painful symptoms in chronic pain conditions. Nonopioid pharmacologic therapies are associated with risks, particularly in older adults, pregnant patients, and patients with certain comorbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and liver disease. For example, NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and major coronary events. Increases in nonserious adverse events have been found with anticonvulsants pregabalin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain, dizziness, and peripheral edema) and gabapentin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, and weight gain), cannabis (nausea and dizziness), and SNRI antidepressants duloxetine (nausea and sedation) and milnacipran (nausea); dosage reductions reduced the risk for some adverse events with SNRI antidepressants. Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.

For osteoarthritis, NSAIDs including topical NSAIDs and SNRI antidepressant duloxetine have small to moderate benefits for pain and function at short-term assessment (3–6 months), with intermediate-term (6–12 months) evidence for certain medications (celecoxib and duloxetine) and evidence that duloxetine is more effective in older (> 65 years) than younger patients and in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Acetaminophen has limited evidence for effectiveness and is no longer considered a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis. When patients have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g. exercise for arthritis pain), and if a single or a few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g. knee) are affected by osteoarthritis, use of topical NSAIDs is recommended. In patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled pain with topical NSAIDs, systemic NSAIDs or duloxetine can be used. However, systemic NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dosage and shortest duration needed because risks might increase with longer use and at higher dosages.

### American College of Foot and Ankle SurgeonsClinical consensus statement: perioperative management [^113tmmuv]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons — postoperative pain management: Consensus statement: "Foot and ankle surgeons should consider a multimodal approach to postoperative pain management" was appropriate. The document explains that "Traditionally, pain control after surgery has been achieved with the use of opioid analgesics and other narcotics", but "these agents are clearly associated with several negative effects, including respiratory depression, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and physical dependence". In response, "a multimodal approach to postoperative pain management has been widely advocated", with effective approaches including "opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, alpha-2-delta ligands (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin), regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks, periarticular injections, and intra-articular infusions". The panel also notes that "narcotic use should be short-term after acute surgical intervention, although no universal definition of 'short term' has been identified", and that decisions "should be made on an individual basis with clear open lines of physician–patient communication".

### Aprepitant plus palonosetron versus dexamethasone plus palonosetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with moderate-emetogenic chemotherapy: a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial [^1154LhYo]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nausea and vomiting are the most prevalent side effects of antineoplastic therapy. An estimated 80% of patients with cancer who receive chemotherapy often have chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). CINV exhibits a negative impact on patients' daily function and quality of life, leading to dose reductions and/or treatment interruption, which in turn results in poor prognosis. To date, clinically effective prophylactics or therapeutics are available for the prevention or treatment of CINV, including 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, dexamethasone (DEX), neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (NK-1 RA), benzodiazepines, and antipsychotic agents. The effects of gabapentin, cannabinoid, and ginger are also being explored in the prevention of CINV. Cytotoxic drugs or combinations are divided into high (> 90%), medium (30–90%), low (10–30%), and very low (< 10%) risk levels according to emetogenicity, to guide the use of anti-emetic treatment. Patients receiving high emetic chemotherapy should receive combination therapy of NK-1 RA, 5-HT3 antagonists, and dexamethasone, while patients receiving moderate-emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), including the mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil) regimen, are recommended to use 5-HT3 antagonists combined with dexamethasone.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^11269oK3]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Furthermore, adverse event frequencies were generally lower during combination therapy. The study by Tanenberg et alstudied a (≥ 900 mg gabapentin plus 60 mg duloxetine) combination and found that insomnia was more frequent with duloxetine than duloxetine plus gabapentin and nausea, hyperhidrosis, decreased appetite, and vomiting more frequent with duloxetine plus gabapentin than with pregabalin (300 mg). There was significant difference in pain relief on duloxetine plus gabapentin vs duloxetine or pregabalin mono-therapies. In parallel, some of the experts concluded that in their clinical experience, moderate-dose pregabalin/gabapentin and SNRI combination therapy results in sufficient pain relief and fewer side effects compared with monotherapy.

There was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for the combination of pregabalin/gabapentin and SSRIs (CDC rating III + C) (Table 2). SSRIs have at best moderate effect (e.g. Sindrup et aland Otto et al), but there are also negative trials. All trials are for peripheral NeP. Because of poor efficacy, SSRIs are not relevant in the treatment of NeP, except for patients already on SSRI for other diagnoses like depression or anxiety, in which case pregabalin or gabapentin may be added.

Good evidence on efficacy was found for the combination of pregabalin/gabapentin and opioids in RCTs by Gilron et al(2400 mg gabapentin plus 60 mg morphine), Hanna et al(flexible moderate-dose gabapentin plus flexible moderate-dose oxycodone) and by Caraceni et al(fix-dose oxycodone plus moderate flexible-dose gabapentin [maximum 1800 mg]) in peripheral NeP. This combination is also frequently used in clinical practice (CDC rating I + B). Based on clinical experience, it was commented that the combination therapy results in increased effect, but with simultaneous increase in side effects relative to monotherapies. Although a class effect of opioids is often described, clinical experience shows a difference of effect between the opioids. Therefore, the opioid to select may depend on the single patient to treat and whether opioid therapy is already ongoing, that is, patients can react very differently on various opioids.

### Gabapentin (gaba 300-EZS) [^111L8hrE]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients greater than 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy.

Among the adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 10% in gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship.

The overall incidence of adverse reactions and the types of adverse reactions seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse reactions increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by race.

Table 5 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin-treated patients, age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials, and which were numerically more common in the gabapentin group.

Other reactions in more than 2% of pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age but equally or more frequent in the placebo group included: pharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, headache, rhinitis, convulsions, diarrhea, anorexia, coughing, and otitis media.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of gabapentin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hepatobiliary disorders: jaundice

Investigations: elevated creatine kinase, elevated liver function tests

Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hyponatremia

Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder: rhabdomyolysis

Nervous system disorders: movement disorder

Psychiatric disorders: agitation

Reproductive system and breast disorders: breast enlargement, changes in libido, ejaculation disorders and anorgasmia

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Adverse reactions following the abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin have also been reported. The most frequently reported reactions were anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, and sweating.

Nausea: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; emetic episode: retching or vomiting; complete response: absence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and no need for rescue antiemetic therapy during the 48-h postoperative period

P 1 = group G vs group GR; P 2 = group R versus group GR

✱ p < 0.05 compared with group GR

In the univariable logistic regression analysis, the type of antiemetic drugs (P = 0.042) and duration of anesthesia (P = 0.077) were associated with the complete response. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, the type of antiemetic drugs was only significant predictor for complete response after adjusting for confounding factors. Patients who received gabapentin or ramosetron had a 0.377 or 0.371-fold lesser likelihood for complete response compared to those who received combination administration of gabapentin and ramosetron (95% confidence intervals, 0.148–0.928 and 0.154–0.923; P value = 0.034 and 0.033, respectively). But the duration of anesthesia was not associated with complete response after confounding adjustments (P = 0.099).

### Different gabapentin and pregabalin dosages for perioperative pain control in patients undergoing spine surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115oHXCP]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we evaluated the associations of pain, opioid consumption, and adverse events with different dosages of pregabalin and gabapentin in patients undergoing spine surgery. We analyzed data from 27 RCTs with 1861 patients and found that gabapentin 900 mg per day was associated with the lowest VAS pain score among all dosages. Additionally, we found no differences in adverse events (nausea, vomiting, and dizziness) among all treatments. These results suggest that gabapentin 900 mg per day before spine surgery may be an effective and safe option for reducing pain and opioid consumption in these patients.

Canavan et alconducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated the effectiveness, adverse events, and withdrawal rates of various pharmacological interventions for managing chronic spinal cord injury pain. They found that tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids, and opioids were the most effective in reducing pain, with the lowest withdrawal rates. They also found that these interventions had common adverse events, but they were generally mild to moderate. Tong et alconducted a network meta-analysis with 7 trials and found that pregabalin was the most effective for relieving pain and gabapentin performed better in aspects associated with drug therapy–related safety for patients with spinal cord injury. A Cochrane review conducted by Wiffen et alexamined the existing research on the use of gabapentin for managing chronic neuropathic pain in adults. The study found that gabapentin at doses of 1200 mg or more daily can provide good levels of pain relief for some people with postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. The study also found that adverse events withdrawals were more common with gabapentin than with placebo and that individual adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin, such as dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, and gait disturbance. Although those studies focused on neurogenic pain, our study targeted a different subset of population. Our study specifically focuses on pregabalin and gabapentin in patients undergoing spine surgery, whereas Tong et aland Canavan et alevaluated a wide range of pharmacological interventions for chronic spinal cord injury pain, and Wiffen et alfocused on postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Assessment: symptomatic treatment for muscle cramps (an evidence-based review): report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^11787EDd]. Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps — adverse events reported in trials: No serious side effects occurred in trials evaluating gabapentin, vitamin B complex, diltiazem, and magnesium for treatment of muscle cramps, and minor side effects such as lightheadedness, nausea, and abdominal discomfort occurred infrequently and with equal frequency in controls and treatment groups in trials of vitamin B complex and magnesium. In magnesium studies, diarrhea was equally common (10%) in magnesium- and placebo-treated patients in one trial and slightly more frequent in magnesiumtreated patients (30% vs 17%, p = 0.1) in another trial. With gabapentin, minor side effects that occurred more frequently included lightheadedness, drowsiness, falls, and limb swelling, and a small trial of diltiazem did not report any side effects in the treated or placebo patients.

### Effect of gabapentin on morphine demand and pain after laparoscopic sterilization using filshie clips. A double blind randomized clinical trial [^116momG6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

A considerable number of patients require opioids during recovery after laparoscopic sterilization. This implies nausea, dizziness and sedation and increases the number of unplanned admissions. Gabapentin has shown excellent postoperative analgesic effect in a number of recent studies with few side effects. This study was designed to test whether gabapentin given preoperatively can reduce the number of patients needing morphine in the recovery period.

Methods

80 females scheduled for laparoscopic sterilization using Filshie clips were randomized to two treatment groups (Gaba group and control group).

All patients received lornoxicam 8 mg p.o. 30 min. before the procedure. Patients in the Gaba group received gabapentin 1200 mg p.o. and patients in the control group received placebo capsules prior to the procedure. All patients were anesthetized according to a protocol, using remifentanil and propofol.

Postoperative analgesia was obtained with patient controlled infusion of morphine. Pain, nausea, dizziness and sedation were scored at 2 and 4 hours after end of anesthesia. The expenditure of morphine was the primary measure for the effect of analgesia and the number of patients demanding morphine was the primary endpoint.

Results

Three patients were excluded because of procedural errors and one because of conversion to open surgery. 38 patients completed the study in each group.

32 (84%) patients in the gabapentin group and 37 (97%) patients in the control group did require morphine in the recovery period. (p = 0,049).

There was no significant difference between mean morphine consumption, pain scores and frequency of adverse effects (nausea, dizziness, sedation and vomiting)

Conclusion

The postoperative analgesic effect of gabapentin given preoperatively was confirmed in this study. For this procedure, with pain predominantly in the immediate recovery period, and of less intensity than after major surgical procedures, the effect demonstrated is much less pronounced than in similar studies of major surgery. General use of gabapentin as analgesic for laparoscopic sterilization is not supported by this study.

### Effects of a single dose of preoperative pregabalin and gabapentin for acute postoperative pain: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111ShUg3]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted by integrating both direct and indirect evidence by using STATA software (version 14.0). We used PBO as a reference treatment in all analyses. Additionally, standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to estimate the outcomes (pain score at rest, pain score at movement, and opioid consumption) of the different doses of PGB and GBP. Moreover, OR was used to describe the outcomes of PONV, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was conducted to represent the corresponding ranking of each outcome, and the higher the SUCRA values, the more preferable the intervention. After that, the assessment of the degree of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in each loop was conducted by using the node-splitting method. Also, risk of publication bias was indicated by funnel plots. Through sensitivity analyses, we considered opioid consumption as the most objective outcome, which was the most reported and had the largest heterogeneity variance. Our sensitivity analyses consisted of excluding studies that reported median instead of mean. The mean estimate was equal to the median, while SD approximates the quartile range, divided by 1.35 or the range divided by 4.

### A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of perioperative administration of gabapentin, meloxicam and their combination for spontaneous and movement-evoked pain after ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^113SPFTy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hysterectomy and spinal surgery inpatient trials suggest favorable interactions between cyclooxgenase-2 inhibitors and gabapentin/pregabalin on postoperative days 1–2. We present the first trial of meloxicam-gabapentin combination after outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing daily oral administration of 1) meloxicam 15 mg, 2) gabapentin 1200–1600 mg, and 3) a combination of the two starting 1 h before until 2 days after surgery. Primary outcomes included day of surgery spontaneous and movement-evoked pain. Secondary outcomes included pain on Days 1, 2, and 30, adverse effects, opioid consumption, spirometry, pain-related interference, hospital discharge time, return to work time, and patient satisfaction.

Results

On the day of surgery, 60-min rest pain (0–10 numerical rating scale ± sd) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) with gabapentin alone (2.0 ± 1.6) versus meloxicam alone (3.6 ± 2.1). Observed pain differences between the combination (2.9 ± 2.1) and gabapentin alone were fairly small in favor of gabapentin alone (P > 0.05). Secondary analyses indicated that nausea was significantly less frequent with the combination (24%) versus the single-drug meloxicam (57%) only.

Conclusion

Although nausea was reduced with combination therapy, this trial provides little or no support for the combined use of meloxicam and gabapentin for pain relief on the day of surgery. This suggests that perioperative analgesic polypharmacy may not always be necessary or appropriate.

### Post-amputation pain: combined analyses of randomized controlled trials evaluating opioids and gabapentinoids versus placebo [^116LgGHF]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
NNT bubble plot to achieve at least 50% pain relief for peripheral neuropathic pain drugs*.

Qualitatively, the two studies that used gabapentin for post-amputation pain corroborate the higher-than-opioid NNT for gabapentinoids given that treatment with gabapentin was described as better than placebo in one study, although it did not substantially affect pain in the other study. Figure 2 also shows that – despite higher NNTs – 56% (9443/16,721) of the total neuropathic pain subjects analyzed in the prior systematic review were studied in RCTs with gabapentin and pregabalin. This majority sample size may represent a hypothesized benefit-to-risk ratio of moderate neuropathic pain relief without opioid-like dependency. However, morphine/opioid treatment in post-amputation pain, and in neuropathic pain (Figure 2) showed greater efficacy and provided a lower NNT, respectively, indicating a more favorable effect on pain management. While opioids are well accepted for the treatment of acute pain and terminal pain, opioid use for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain remains controversial. Mild side effects (eg, constipation, nausea) are commonly acknowledged and reported in acute pain trials, but more severe side effects (eg, opioid-induced respiratory depression) are common in patients with multiple comorbidities such as amputees. Further, physical dependence and addiction remain critical factors in evaluating the benefits and risks of opioid therapy, particularly with regard to acute versus chronic use.

Postoperative pain management after rotator cuff repair — Multimodal analgesia programs or non-opioid individual modalities can be considered to provide added benefit for postoperative pain management following rotator cuff repair, with Quality of Evidence: Moderate and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Supporting studies include a high-quality comparison after open shoulder surgery in which patient-controlled interscalene block (PCISB) showed significantly better pain outcomes, fentanyl consumption, and averages for nausea and/or vomiting than patient-controlled IV opioid-based analgesia (PCA); a high-quality arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery study where a multimodal non-opiate IV program (ketorolac, gabapentin, methocarbamol, acetaminophen) during the early post-operative period (post-op days 1–10) produced significantly lower average days of constipation and nausea and lower pain on postoperative days 1 and 4 versus oxycodone; and a moderate-quality arthroscopic rotator cuff repair study in which subacromial patient-controlled analgesia (SA-PCA w/ ropivacaine) yielded significantly better requested bolus dose at 8hrs postop, frequency of bolus dose at 4 hours postop, postop nausea, VAS (visual analog scale) Pain at 1hr postop, and postop patient satisfaction than intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA w/ fentanyl, ketorolac, and ondansetron).

### Nausea and vomiting in 2021: a comprehensive update [^114x4g6f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Goal

A comprehensive review of treatments for nausea and vomiting (N/V).

Background

N/V are common symptoms encountered in medicine. While most cases of acute N/V related to a specific cause can be straightforward to manage, other cases of acute N/V such as chemotherapy-induced N/V and especially chronic unexplained N/V can be difficult to control, leading to a significant decline in the patient's quality of life and increased cost of medical care from repeated hospitalizations.

Study

Traditional management has relied on pharmacotherapy which may be inadequate in a certain proportion of these patients. Many of the medications used in the management of N/V have significant side effect profiles making the need for new and improved interventions of great importance.

Results

This review covers a broad review of the pathophysiology of N/V, pharmacotherapy, including safety concerns and controversies with established pharmaceuticals, newer immunotherapies, bioelectrical neuromodulation (including gastric electrical stimulation), behavioral and surgical therapies, and complementary medicine.

Conclusion

On the basis of emerging understandings of the pathophysiology of N/V, improved therapies are becoming available.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Postherpetic Neuralgia

The most common adverse reactions associated with the use of NEURONTIN in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema.

In the 2 controlled trials in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received NEURONTIN and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that most frequently led to withdrawal in NEURONTIN-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea.

Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of NEURONTIN-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the NEURONTIN group than in the placebo group.

Other reactions in more than 1% of patients but equally or more frequent in the placebo group included pain, tremor, neuralgia, back pain, dyspepsia, dyspnea, and flu syndrome.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse reactions. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by race.

### Effect of sufentanil combined with gabapentin on acute postoperative pain in patients undergoing intraspinal tumor resection: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^1129Pbp7]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

A previous study by our group confirmed that some patients still experienced poor analgesia and moderate pain when administered sufentanil or tramadol PCIA after intraspinal tumor resection. However, one disadvantage of sufentanil is that it has a dose-dependent respiratory inhibitory effect. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and excessive sedation also increases with increasing dosage. Therefore, sufentanil still has some risks when used for postoperative analgesia, especially for elderly individuals, children, and patients with central nervous system diseases. Currently, the combination of local anesthetics or other analgesics with opioids can effectively alleviate pain and reduce the side effects of opioids, according to an increasing number of clinical studies. In a single-center randomized controlled study, Liu et alconfirmed that compared to traditional postoperative analgesia in a control group, an ERAS program that combined local anesthesia with postoperative analgesia can accelerate recovery in patients undergoing intraspinal tumor resection, shorten hospital stay and alleviate pain from 1 day after surgery to discharge, but the patient's pain on the day of surgery was still severe. A previous study by our group administered lidocaine in the perioperative period of intraspinal tumor resection and found that it can reduce the pain scores on the first and second days after surgery, but only for patients with extramedullary tumors and no chronic pain before surgery.

In many analgesia guidelines, gabapentin is also recommended for use in multimodal analgesia. Gabapentin binds to the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, decreases excitatory neurotransmitter release from activated nociceptors, inhibits ascending pain transmission, activates descending inhibitory pathways, and prevents hyperalgesia and central sensitization. Animal experiments have shown that gabapentin can act on central sensitization and other noxious stimulus pathways to relieve hyperalgesia, postoperative pain, and postoperative inflammation caused by nerve damage. In a study by Koea and colleagueson 100 patients undergoing liver resection, the patients who received a combination of an intrathecal injection of morphine and oral gabapentin during the perioperative period ate and were discharged earlier than patients who were only administered postoperative epidural analgesia. In a study on cervical spinal surgery, multimodal analgesia reportedly achieved the same analgesic effect as PCA, but it required less consumption of anesthetic drugs and had a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting and a shorter hospital stay. Whether the perioperative use of gabapentin combined with sufentanil as multimodal analgesia for intraspinal tumor resection can optimize pain treatment of such patients is a question of concern in this study.

### Combination of gabapentin and ramosetron for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery: a prospective randomized comparative study [^117LFUrU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

As a drug originally introduced for its anticonvulsant effects, gabapentin has been recently shown to be effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in various clinical settings. This study compared the antiemetic efficacy of oral gabapentin, intravenous ramosetron and gabapentin plus ramosetron in patients receiving fentanyl-based patient-controlled analgesia after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.

Methods

One hundred and thirty two patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery under general anesthesia were allocated randomly into three groups: group G received 300 mg oral gabapentin 1 h before anesthesia, group R received 0.3 mg intravenous ramosetron at the end of surgery, and group GR received a combination of 300 mg oral gabapentin 1 h before anesthesia and 0.3 mg intravenous ramosetron at the end of surgery. Postoperative nausea, retching, vomiting, rescue antiemetic drug use, pain, rescue analgesic requirements and adverse effects were assessed at 0–2, 2–24 and 24–48 h after surgery. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was defined as the presence of nausea, retching or vomiting.

Results

The incidence of complete response (no PONV and no rescue antiemetics up to 48 h postoperatively) was significantly higher in group GR (26/40, 65%) than group G (16/40, 40%; P = 0.025) and group R (18/44, 41%; P = 0.027), whereas there was no significant difference between group G and group R (P = 0.932). There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of emetic episodes, use of rescue antiemetics, severe emesis, use of rescue analgesics or any adverse effects. Postoperative pain scores were also similar among groups.

Conclusions

The combination with gabapentin and ramosetron is superior to either drug alone for prevention of PONV after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.

### The preoperative use of gabapentin, dexamethasone, and their combination in varicocele surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^1178c7xn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated the effects of gabapentin and dexamethasone given together or separately 1 h before the start of surgery on laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation, intraoperative hemodynamics, opioid consumption, and postoperative pain in patients undergoing varicocele operations.

Methods

Patients were randomly divided into four double-blind groups: group C (control, n = 20) received placebo, group G (gabapentin, n = 20) received 800 mg gabapentin, group D (dexamethasone, n = 20) received 8 mg dexamethasone, group GD (gabapentin plus dexamethasone) received both 800 mg gabapentin and 8 mg dexamethasone IV 1 h before the start of surgery. Standard induction and maintenance of anesthesia were accomplished and continued by propofol and remifentanil infusion. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were recorded before induction and after intubation. Intraoperative total remifentanil consumption was recorded. Hemodynamic variables and visual analog scale were recorded for 24 h. Side effects were noted.

Results

Hemodynamics at 1, 3, 5, and 10 min after tracheal intubation, total remifentanil consumption during surgery, postoperative visual analog scale scores at 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h, and postoperative nausea and vomiting were found to be significantly lower in group GD than in group G and group D (P < 0.05 for both), and substantially lower when compared with group C (P < 0.001). All values in group C were also higher than in groups G and D (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Gabapentin and dexamethasone administered together an hour before varicocele surgery results in less laryngeal and tracheal intubation response, improves postoperative analgesia, and prevents postoperative nausea and vomiting better than individual administration of each drug.
