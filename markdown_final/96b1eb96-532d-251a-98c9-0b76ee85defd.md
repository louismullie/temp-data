## Question

Detached retina

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about detached retina, specifically rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, including its definition, pathophysiology, classification, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, urgency, surgical options, outcomes, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its subtypes. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why it threatens vision. Next, I will classify macular status and why timing matters. After that, I need to review risk factors and typical symptoms. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic approach, including when to use OCT and ultrasound. Next, I will examine urgency and timing of surgery, followed by a careful comparison of surgical modalities and their outcomes. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, follow-up, and synthesize practical takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and subtypes. Retinal detachment is the separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium, which disrupts photoreceptor nutrition and function; the three main types are rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative, with rhegmatogenous being the most common and driven by retinal breaks that allow vitreous fluid into the subretinal space.

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. In rhegmatogenous detachment, vitreous traction creates a full-thickness retinal break, vitreous fluid enters the subretinal space, and the retina separates from the RPE; photoreceptors lose their choroidal supply, apoptosis begins within hours, and prolonged detachment leads to irreversible structural and functional loss, explaining the time-sensitive nature of repair [^112aXic6] [^1123efHn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about urgency without classifying macular involvement. Clinically, we distinguish macula-on versus macula-off RRD; macula-on cases have better baseline acuity and prognosis, whereas macula-off cases carry worse visual outcomes that deteriorate with longer macular detachment duration, with some data suggesting a sharp decline after 24–72 hours and better results when surgery occurs within 1–3 days of symptom onset [^115y8946] [^1141oxXm] [^1123efHn].

> Next, I should review risk factors. Myopia, aphakia or pseudophakia, trauma, lattice degeneration, and prior retinal detachment in the fellow eye increase risk; age-related vitreous changes and posterior vitreous detachment are common precipitants, and patients with these risks warrant education and periodic exams [^1127C8gj] [^111Vs3ir].

> I will now examine symptoms. Patients classically report flashes, new floaters, and a curtain-like peripheral visual field defect; pain is not typical, so the absence of pain should not reassure against detachment, and any of these symptoms should prompt urgent ophthalmic evaluation [^111L26NN] [^114KCy6n].

> Let me think about diagnosis. Binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression is the gold standard to find breaks and map the detachment; OCT helps define macular status and foveal detachment height, and B-scan ultrasound is essential when the fundus view is obscured, with POCUS in the ED showing high sensitivity and specificity for detachment and helping triage urgency [^115RteeW] [^1143Bmf2] [^113wkeEs].

> Wait, let me verify the urgency framework. Macula-on RRD is a vitreoretinal emergency given the risk of rapid progression; macula-off RRD is also urgent because visual recovery declines with each additional day of macular detachment, and emerging data support operating within 24–48 hours when feasible, especially when foveal detachment height is significant [^115y8946] [^1141oxXm] [^1123efHn].

> Next, I should review surgical options and their comparative outcomes. Pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, and pneumatic retinopexy are acceptable approaches; meta-analyses and contemporary series suggest broadly similar final reattachment rates around 85–95%, with choice influenced by lens status, extent and location of breaks, PVR risk, and surgeon preference; pneumatic retinopexy offers less invasive care but may have lower single-operation success and higher recurrence in some studies, whereas scleral buckling can yield better early visual acuity in select cases [^116A3cWt] [^115Lnk7e] [^113dTSp3].

> Hold on, I should verify postoperative considerations that affect outcomes. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy remains the leading cause of failure, and retinal displacement with metamorphopsia can occur after vitrectomy; immediate postoperative positioning strategies, including early face-down or break-supporting postures, are being studied to mitigate displacement, and patients should be counseled on positioning and activity restrictions during the early postoperative period [^113dTSp3] [^1141oxXm].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios. In pseudophakia, vitrectomy is commonly preferred; in giant retinal tears or high PVR risk, combined approaches with scleral buckle and vitrectomy, or silicone oil tamponade, are often used; in viral retinitis-related detachments, outcomes are guarded and management is individualized; in Stickler syndrome, prophylactic 360-degree laser reduces detachment risk and is recommended in genetically confirmed cases [^116A3cWt] [^111T73TE] [^116jM6j8].

> Let me reconsider follow-up and counseling. After successful repair, patients require close monitoring for new breaks, PVR, and redetachment; between 5–14% develop additional breaks over time, especially after cataract surgery, and patients should be educated to report new flashes, floaters, or field loss promptly; fellow-eye surveillance is essential given the elevated risk of bilateral disease [^113yEDGX] [^1127C8gj].

> But wait, what if the detachment is asymptomatic and chronic. Observational data suggest some asymptomatic, chronic RRDs may remain stable for years, yet expert guidance still favors individualized decisions given the unpredictability of progression; shared decision-making is crucial, and any change in symptoms should trigger urgent reassessment [^1144Mg1e] [^116ndYfa].

> In summary, I should double-check that the key messages are explicit. RRD is a sight-threatening emergency in which early recognition, accurate mapping of breaks, and timely surgery — ideally before macular involvement or within 24–48 hours of macular detachment — optimize anatomical and visual outcomes; no single surgical technique is universally superior, so treatment should be tailored to patient and disease factors, and patients must be educated on symptoms and the need for rapid action to preserve vision [^115y8946] [^116A3cWt].

Retinal detachment is a **sight-threatening emergency** [^111L26NN] caused by separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium, most often due to a retinal break (rhegmatogenous) [^112aXic6]. Key risk factors include high myopia, posterior vitreous detachment, trauma, and prior intraocular surgery [^1113cD7j]. Patients typically report flashes, floaters, and a curtain-like visual field defect [^111L26NN]; prompt diagnosis with indirect ophthalmoscopy and confirmation with OCT or ultrasound is essential [^115RteeW] [^113wkeEs]. Early surgery (vitrectomy, scleral buckle, or pneumatic retinopexy) within 24–48 hours, especially before macular involvement, **improves visual outcomes** [^115y8946] [^1123efHn]; delays increase the risk of permanent vision loss [^116ynR9w]. Even with successful reattachment, some patients have persistent visual deficits, and recurrence or proliferative vitreoretinopathy can occur, requiring close follow-up [^112aXic6] [^113dTSp3].

---

## Pathophysiology

Retinal detachment results from **loss of adhesion** between the neurosensory retina and the RPE, disrupting photoreceptor function and causing vision loss [^112aXic6]. The three main types are:

- **Rhegmatogenous**: Full-thickness retinal breaks allow vitreous fluid into the subretinal space; the most common type [^112aXic6] [^111Vs3ir].
- **Tractional**: Fibrovascular membranes exert tangential traction, separating the retina; common in diabetic retinopathy [^112aXic6].
- **Exudative**: Fluid accumulates beneath the retina without breaks, from inflammation, vascular leakage, or tumors [^112aXic6] [^116ynR9w].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors **increase risk** of retinal detachment:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| High myopia | Axial elongation thins the retina and increases break risk [^notfound] |
| Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) | Vitreous separation can cause tears or holes [^114AVXBG] |
| Trauma | Direct or indirect injury can create retinal breaks [^notfound] |
| Prior intraocular surgery | Cataract extraction, especially if complicated, increases risk [^notfound] |
| Lattice degeneration | Peripheral retinal thinning with holes increases risk [^11677aT7] |
| Family history | Genetic predisposition exists [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include:

- **Flashes of light (photopsia)**: Due to vitreoretinal traction [^notfound].
- **Floaters**: From vitreous hemorrhage or debris [^notfound].
- **Curtain-like shadow**: Progressive visual field defect from detachment [^111L26NN].
- **Sudden vision loss**: Especially with macular involvement [^116ynR9w].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Prompt diagnosis relies on:

- **Indirect ophthalmoscopy**: Gold standard for detecting breaks and detachment [^115RteeW].
- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Assesses macular status and subretinal fluid [^1143Bmf2].
- **Ultrasound (B-scan)**: Useful when media is opaque (e.g. cataract, hemorrhage) [^113wkeEs].

---

## Treatment options

Surgical repair is **required**; options include:

- **Pars plana vitrectomy**: Removal of vitreous and relief of traction; commonly used [^116A3cWt].
- **Scleral buckling**: External indentation to close breaks; effective, especially in younger patients [^116A3cWt].
- **Pneumatic retinopexy**: Gas bubble to close breaks; less invasive, selected cases [^115Lnk7e].

Early surgery within 24–48 hours, particularly before macular detachment, **improves visual outcomes** [^115y8946] [^1123efHn].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on **macular status** and timing of repair [^115y8946]. Macula-on detachments have better visual recovery than macula-off, where prolonged detachment causes irreversible photoreceptor damage [^1123efHn]. Complications include persistent visual deficits, recurrence, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), which can require additional surgery [^112aXic6] [^113dTSp3].

---

## Prevention and follow-up

Prevention focuses on **risk-factor management** and patient education on symptoms, with regular eye exams in high-risk patients [^1127C8gj]. After repair, close follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence or new breaks [^113yEDGX].

---

Retinal detachment is a **medical emergency** requiring rapid diagnosis and surgery; early intervention, especially before macular involvement, significantly improves visual outcomes, whereas delays risk permanent vision loss [^111L26NN] [^115y8946].

### Current opinion on treatment of asymptomatic retinal detachments [^116ndYfa]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the current opinion of vitreoretinal consultants in the UK on the treatment of asymptomatic retinal detachments.

Methods

A questionnaire survey of UK and Eire vitreoretinal consultants on recommended therapy for eight different case scenarios of asymptomatic retinal detachment.

Results

A questionnaire was sent to 115 consultants in UK and Eire. Fifty-four per cent were returned. The majority of surgeons favoured active intervention for most types of asymptomatic retinal detachment, with surgery being the most popular. Laser demarcation of the detached retina was the second most favoured approach followed by observation alone. Discharge with advice to seek attention if symptoms appeared was the least frequently recommended. Recommended management varied considerably for each scenario. The presence or absence of a demarcation line had the greatest influence on the management of each case. Age of patient had a much smaller effect, and degree of myopia had very little effect.

Conclusions

Surgery remains the most common recommended management for an asymptomatic retinal detachment. The striking outcome of the survey is the variability in responses for any given scenario, ranging from surgical intervention to the patient being discharged with advice. This reflects the absence of hard clinical evidence to support any particular management option in such cases. As patient involvement in decision making over management is essential, the opinions expressed in this survey may not be a true reflection of actual practice, although it does highlight the need for further research in this field to provide guidance for treatment of this important condition.

### Interventions for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for preventing retinal detachment [^1133oVfe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration are visible lesions that are risk factors for later retinal detachment. Retinal detachments occur when fluid in the vitreous cavity passes through tears or holes in the retina and separates the retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Creation of an adhesion surrounding retinal breaks and lattice degeneration, with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy, has been recommended as an effective means of preventing retinal detachment. This therapy is of value in the management of retinal tears associated with the symptoms of flashes and floaters and persistent vitreous traction upon the retina in the region of the retinal break, because such symptomatic retinal tears are associated with a high rate of progression to retinal detachment. Retinal tears and holes unassociated with acute symptoms and lattice degeneration are significantly less likely to be the sites of retinal breaks that are responsible for later retinal detachment. Nevertheless, treatment of these lesions frequently is recommended, in spite of the fact that the effectiveness of this therapy is unproven.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of techniques used to treat asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration for the prevention of retinal detachment.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2014), PubMed (January 1948 to February 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 19 February 2014. Textbooks regarding retinal detachment and the reference lists of relevant reports were reviewed for additional study reports. We contacted experts in the field for details of other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

This review was designed to include randomized controlled trials in which one treatment for asymptomatic retinal breaks and lattice degeneration was compared with another treatment or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Initially, one author assessed the search results and collected relevant studies. Since no studies met the inclusion criteria, no studies were assessed for risk of bias. No data were extracted and no meta-analysis could be performed.

Main Results

No trials were found that met the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions could be reached about the effectiveness of surgical interventions to prevent retinal detachment in eyes with asymptomatic retinal breaks or lattice degeneration, or both. Current recommendations for treatment, based upon a consensus of expert opinion, should be assessed in a randomized controlled trial.

Retinal detachment — "A retinal detachment is characterized by vision loss or floaters and flashes of bright light in a patient's visual field", with vision loss "often described as a fixed cloudy or curtainlike defect in the visual field", is "usually painless", and "Visual loss is variable, depending on where on the retina the tear has occurred". Patients "should be emergently evacuated, as surgical management may be necessary, and there is no effective field treatment", with grade "Emergent evacuation: 1C".

### Retinal detachment [^112aXic6]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Retinal detachment (RD) occurs when the neurosensory retina, the neurovascular tissue responsible for phototransduction, is separated from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Given the importance of the RPE for optimal retinal function, RD invariably leads to decreased vision. There are three main types of RD: rhegmatogenous, tractional and exudative (also termed serous) RD. In rhegmatogenous RD, one or more retinal breaks enable vitreous fluid to enter the subretinal space and separate the neurosensory retina from the RPE. In tractional RD, preretinal, intraretinal or subretinal membranes contract and exert tangential forces and elevate the retina from the underlying RPE. Finally, in exudative RD, an underlying inflammatory condition, vascular abnormality or the presence of a tumour causes exudative fluid to accumulate in the subretinal space, exceeding the osmotic pump function of the RPE. The surgical management of RD usually involves pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling or pneumatic retinopexy. The approach taken often depends on patient characteristics as well as on practitioner experience and clinical judgement. Advances in surgical technology and continued innovation have improved outcomes for many patients. However, even if retinal re-attachment is achieved, some patients still experience decreased vision or other visual symptoms, such as metamorphopsia, that diminish their quality of life. Continued research in the areas of neuroprotection and retinal biology as well as continued surgical innovation are necessary to enhance therapeutic options and outcomes for these patients.

### Evaluation and management of suspected retinal detachment [^1113cD7j]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment often is a preventable cause of vision loss. There are three types of retinal detachments: exudative, tractional, and rhegmatogenous. The most common type is rhegmatogenous, which results from retinal breaks caused by vitreoretinal traction. Risk factors for retinal detachment include advancing age, previous cataract surgery, myopia, and trauma. Patients typically will present with symptoms such as light flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, and blurred vision. Early intervention facilitates prevention of retinal detachment after formation of retinal breaks and improves visual outcomes of retinal detachment surgery. Patients with acute onset of flashes or floaters should be referred to an ophthalmologist.

Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks and lattice degeneration — management communication and patient education direct clinicians to inform patients about the relative risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery, to formulate a postoperative care plan and inform patient of these arrangements, and to advise patients to contact an ophthalmologist promptly if they have a substantial change in symptoms such as flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, or decreased visual acuity; patients at high risk of developing retinal detachment should be educated about the symptoms of PVD and retinal detachment and the value of periodic follow-up exams, and patients who undergo refractive surgery should be informed they remain at risk of RRD despite reduction of their refractive error.

### Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: a review of current practice in diagnosis and management [^115y8946]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Aim of intervention

The main target of RRD management is to achieve retinal reattachment. Although the beneﬁt for treatment of asymptomatic (chronic) RRD remains unclear, symptomatic RRD is a clear indication for surgery. On presentation, RRD is usually divided into 'macula-on' where the foveal centre is not involved, and 'macula-off' where the fovea is detached. People with macula-on RRD typically have good initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and a better visual prognosis with successful surgery. Macula-off RRDs have lower initial BCVA and worse visual prognosis even with successful reattachment of the retina. However, in macula-off RRDs postoperative BCVA is better in patients with 1–3 days of visual loss compared with 4–6 days, and hence these patients also need to be treated as a matter of urgency. Indeed it is likely that prognosis reduces linearly for every day that the macula remains detached.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is not routinely required to assess macular status, as this can be established by BCVA and clinical examination, with preoperative BCVA determining potential postoperative BCVA. However, OCT and ultrasound imaging may be useful in assessing the presence of PVD, as this can influence the surgical approach.

Figure 1. Right eye of the patient. A, Fundus photograph of the right eye demonstrates a hamartomatous lesion inducing tractional retinal detachment along the inferotemporal arcade with concurrent inferotemporal branch retinal vein occlusion and preretinal hemorrhage. B, Whole eye with diffusely thickened uvea and complete retinal detachment. Figure 2. Histologic findings in the right eye. A, Whole eye with detached retina, large retinal cyst, and severely contracted iris with peripheral anterior synechiae. B, Retina. Four months later, the patient was diagnosed clinically as having a CHRRPE. Enlargement of the retinal tumor was noted over the following 8 months, accompanied by the development of a vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy.

At age 20 months, the right eye was enucleated owing to it being blind and painful with a fixed pupil and corneal haze. Postoperatively, she was more comfortable, no longer photophobic, and without tearing. Gross pathologic examination revealed a buphthalmic eye with a Baerveldt glaucoma drainage implant on the superonasal sclera. On oblique sectioning, the cornea was clear but thinned. The anterior chamber was filled with a tan, milky fluid. The pupil was widely dilated and the iridocorneal angle was closed by peripheral anterior synechiae. The lens and uveal tract were unremarkable. There was a funnel-shaped retinal detachment. As the tumor enlarged and penetrated the internal limiting membrane, it expanded into the vitreous, resulting in retinal detachment. Histopathologic analysis of the lesion showed a proliferation of spindle cells with scattered admixed neurons.

The histogenetic origin of the spindle cells cannot be identified with certainty, but the morphology along with the coexpression of CD56 and S-100 protein in the retina suggest nonmyelinating Schwann cells.

### The use of artificial intelligence based chat bots in ophthalmology triage [^111azka7]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Error analysis

Upon examining specific questions (supplementary data 1 and 2), clear differences between ChatGPT and Bard were observed. For the topic of "red eye with discomfort and discharge" (question 1), ChatGPT generally received higher scores for accuracy than Bard. While the first chat bot provides an extensive differential diagnosis and treatment options, Bard's answer focuses only on the different causes of conjunctivitis, ignoring other vision-threatening conditions. Bard's answer to the "causes and treatment of double vision" (question 10) lacked accuracy and comprehensiveness, addressing only binocular diplopia, omitting important monocular causes, such as cataract. ChatGPT's response, on the other hand, includes monocular causes, though no categorization is noted.

Both models provided clear answers about "the best timing for cataract surgery" (question 7), denoting the different considerations for procedure scheduling. Yet none of the models addressed the concept of preforming surgery for better visualization of the posterior segment in cases such as choroidal melanomas.

An example for an inaccurate, yet comprehensive answer is ChatGPT's response for "what is the treatment for a retinal tear?" (question 4). The chat bot elaborates on the different treatments yet there is no clear distinction between retinal tear and retinal detachment, which might lead patients with small low-risk tears to believe they're in need for a surgery. Bard's answer, on the other hand, focuses on the differences between retinal tear and retinal detachment but the treatment options is not as elaborated as in the first AI model answer.

Generally, wrong answers had minor errors, for example Chat-GPT's answer to the question "what are the warning signs and symptoms for retinal detachment?" (question 8) included pain as one of the symptoms when in fact it is a painless condition. Notwithstanding, some answers had major errors that can lead to inaccurate diagnosis, like Chat-GPT's answer to question 15 — "my right eye looks smaller than my left one, what is the cause and how can I treat it?" — addressing only right eye ptosis and omitting a wide differential diagnosis including left eye proptosis.

### Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: a review of current practice in diagnosis and management [^116Banrb]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a common condition with an increasing incidence, related to the ageing demographics of many populations and the rising global prevalence of myopia, both well known risk factors. Previously untreatable, RRD now achieves primary surgical success rates of over 80%–90% with complex cases also amenable to treatment. The optimal management for RRD attracts much debate with the main options of pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling and vitrectomy all having their proponents based on surgeon experience and preference, case mix and equipment availability. The aim of this review is to provide an overview for the non-retina specialist that will aid and inform their understanding and discussions with patients. We review the incidence and pathogenesis of RRD, present a systematic approach to diagnosis and treatment with special consideration to managing the fellow eye and summarise surgical success and visual recovery following different surgical options.

Pathophysiology of DR and potential treatment options

The pathophysiology of DR has been extensively studied. The underlying mechanisms are complex and despite the considerable amount of scientific research in this field, several unanswered questions remain. This manuscript reflects on some potential targeted treatment options and necessary clinical research concepts. Describing all involved pathomechanisms in detail is beyond its scope and current reviews delineating this topic in detail are already available. – In brief, there are multiple contributing biochemical pathways including the polyol pathway, hexosamine pathway, protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation which lead to pathological microvascular alterations and ultimately to DR. In Figure 1, the pathogenesis of DR is delineated. Intracellular hyperglycemia induces the increased formation of AGEs, increases the hexosamine pathway and flux through the polyol pathway, and results in PKC activation. Further on, antioxidant capacity is reduced by activation of the polyol pathway and thus retinal cells are exposed to increased oxidative stress. Increased availability of AGEs and PKC activation alter the expression of cytokines, growth factors, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, coagulation factors, transcription factors, and reactive oxygen species. Finally, induction of the hexosamine pathway leads to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine production, which also alters gene expression. Together these pathways, their downstream processes specifically, lead to vascular dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and altered gene expression. These processes are even accelerated by activation of the retinal renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, uncontrolled hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Resulting degeneration of neuronal cells of the retina, angiogenesis, and vascular dysfunction finally lead to tissue damage and clinically imposing loss of vision. Reduced vision is the main symptom of DR but only occurs when the condition is advanced and affects either the center of the retina (diabetic macular edema or ischemic maculopathy) or so much of the peripheral retina in proliferative stages that vitreous hemorrhages or retinal detachment occur. Unfortunately, during the nonproliferative DR stage patients usually have no symptoms and normal vision, leaving patients often unaware of the condition. On routine ophthalmological examination, retinal changes may be very discrete in nonproliferative DR. Even in this stage however, microaneurysms (MAs), pericyte ghosts, acellular capillaries, thickening of the capillary basement membrane, hemorrhages, and hard exudates can be present, with MAs being the earliest ophthalmoscopically detectable clinical manifestation of DR. Characteristic features of DR detectable by ophthalmoscopic examination are hemorrhages, MAs and microvascular abnormalities such as dilated capillaries, cotton wool spots (round or oval spots with feathered edges, which represent local ischemia of the neuroretina), hard exudates (lipid deposits), retinal edema, and intraretinal neovascularization (example given in Figure 2). The Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) examined fundus photographic risk factors for progression of DR over 5 years and established a 13-level scale to describe DR severity and change of severity over time. When nonproliferative DR progresses to the next stage, it is called proliferative DR. The pathognomonic for this advanced stage is the growth of extraretinal new blood vessels from preexisting vessels (neoangiogenesis) and formation of fibrovascular scar tissue. Patients may experience sight threatening vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment due to traction. As a result, patients invariably experience vision loss at this advanced stage. Increasing hypoxia due to vascular occlusion induces VEGF production which plays a major pathophysiological role in proliferative DR and macular edema.

Follow-up evaluation guidance states that the guidelines in Table 3 are recommendations for the timing of re-evaluation in the absence of additional symptoms. Patients with new symptoms or a change in symptoms may require more frequent evaluation, while patients with no positive findings at the initial examination should be seen at the intervals recommended in the Comprehensive Adult Medical Eye Evaluation PPP. All patients with risk factors should be advised to contact their ophthalmologist promptly if new symptoms such as flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, or decreased visual acuity develop.

### How should we report the foveal status in eyes with "macula-off" retinal detachment? [^116KFSyo]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the advancements in retinal surgery over the past decades, foveal involvement in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is still associated with disappointing visual outcomes, even after prompt and successful retinal surgery. Numerous studies and database analyses have assessed a variety of prognostic factors for visual recovery in "macula-off" rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, including individual factors (e.g. age, duration of symptoms, pre-existing retinal pathologies), peri-operative factors (e.g. time and type of surgery, experience of surgeon, follow-up and positioning of patients) as well as anatomical features on first presentation (e.g. foveal involvement, extent of detachment). The purpose of this review was to explore inconsistencies with regard to the nomenclature and assessment of the preoperative macular status in eyes termed "macula-off" in current clinical and scientific practice, and to detail possible morphology-based methods to report the foveal status in macula involving retinal detachment.

### Pathology and pathogenesis of retinal detachment [^116Hntjc]. Eye (2002). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment, separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium, is a sight threatening condition that is considered one of the few ocular emergencies. The literature is enormously rich in studies that focused on different aspects of this disease process. Yet certain aspects remain largely unanswered. We briefly review major aspects of retinal detachment and discuss various important contributions in this field, focussing mainly on the pathogenesis of and predisposing factors to retinal detachment, and on the pathologic changes that occur following its development and following various surgical procedures currently used in its management.

Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) symptoms and floater management — PVD symptoms usually diminish over time and reassurance should be provided, but pars plana vitrectomy is an option if symptomatic floaters remain bothersome after several months. Laser surgeries and pharmacotherapies currently lack sufficient evidence to support their use, whereas pars plana vitrectomy has been used for floater removal with documented post-operative improvement in contrast sensitivity. Comparative reports indicate pars plana vitrectomy showed greater patient satisfaction than Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis, although another study found Nd:YAG vitreolysis improved symptoms versus sham laser surgery.

### Scleral buckle removal: long-term patient outcomes [^114S1WDC]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Scleral buckling has been a reliable treatment option in the repair of primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. Occasionally, patients require scleral buckles (SBs) to be removed for various reasons. While outcomes of SB removal have been investigated in this subset of patients, there has not been any large patient series to reach any conclusions. Long-term sequelae of SB removal are debated in the literature, specifically around the risk of redetachment.

Design

We performed a retrospective, observational study to evaluate the clinical indications for, and outcomes of, SB removal.

Participants

No control patients in this retrospective, observational study.

Methods

Eighty-six individuals with a history of SB removal from June 1, 2000, to January 1, 2021, were followed from a large academic center and a private, retina-only practice in Chicago. Exclusion criteria were age of < 18 years and unplanned or self-explanted SB removal.

Main Outcome Measures

Data extracted included patient symptoms before SB removal, indications for removal, resolution of symptoms following removal, rate of redetachment, and rate of additional ocular surgery. Secondary outcomes included identifying factors associated with poorer outcomes.

Results

Eighty-six eyes with history of SB removal were included with an average follow-up of 4 years. Approximately 60% were males and the mean age at the time of SB removal was 59 years. Leading indications for removal were exposure (61.63%), infection (20.93%), and diplopia/strabismus (19.77%). The average time from SB placement to removal was 12.28 ± 11.16 years. Most patients requiring SB removal presented with symptoms, specifically of pain and discomfort (65.12%), diplopia (22.09%), and drainage/discharge (18.60%). Of these patients, 86.59% experienced symptom resolution following SB removal. Notably, 6.56% (4 eyes) of all eyes with at least 1 year of follow-up experienced a redetachment requiring surgery. Within this subset, the average time from SB placement to removal was 2.05 ± 2.01 years and time to redetachment following removal was 15.95 ± 25.71 months. Nine percent of all eyes required additional strabismus or oculoplastic surgery.

Conclusions

Scleral buckle removal provides a high rate of symptomatic relief and low risk of subsequent detachment. Nevertheless, close monitoring is warranted to monitor for recurrent retinal detachments.

### Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: a review of current practice in diagnosis and management [^113dTSp3]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

Although RRD is now routinely treated, the success rate remains stubbornly less than 100%, and typically around 85% with most large modern series. Potentially, optimising retinal break detection and effective, rapid onset retinopexy, obviating the need for tamponade could help improve primary success rates. PVR remains a common cause of failure and new strategies to prevent and treat PVR are required. The optimum method to repair detached retinas to allow maximal visual recovery, especially in macula-involving cases, is gradually becoming more defined, but surgeon experience and preference will still remain major factors affecting technique choice.

### Idiopathic macular hole preferred practice pattern ® [^113fzCs4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic macular hole — definition, typical population, and clinical objectives are outlined as follows: A macular hole is a discontinuity of the neurosensory retina, located at the fovea or perifoveal region. The patient population consists of adults often 55 years of age or older, most of whom are women, who have idiopathic macular holes; this is in contrast to traumatic macular holes, which tend to be in young men (20s and 30s), and the holes tend to be larger. Clinical objectives include to identify patients at risk for macular hole, educate high-risk patients about the reason for periodic monocular self-assessment and follow-up examination, the symptoms of a macular hole, and the need to return promptly should symptoms occur, follow patients who are at risk for vision loss from macular hole, inform patients of the risks and benefits of the treatment options for macular hole, and optimize recovery of visual function.

### New classification for the reporting of complications in retinal detachment surgical trials [^115Nrvww]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can consensus classification for complication severity be developed to be used in clinical trials of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) surgery?

Findings

In this study, following the development of a comprehensive list of complications of RRD surgery, a Delphi survey among retinal surgeons was undertaken (96% response rate). Consensus was achieved in grading severity of complications of RRD surgery.

Meaning

The proposed severity classification for complications of RRD surgery may facilitate quantification and comparison of harm of different RRD surgical interventions.

### Preventing retinal detachment: where are we? Implications from Stickler syndrome [^112rep4m]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Retinopexy Prophylaxis

Cryotherapy was the primary form of retinopexy prophylaxis from its introduction in 1964, until the advent of laser retinopexy in 1970. Although laser retinopexy can be more precisely placed, with better intensity control, it predominated only gradually until its application to the peripheral retina was substantially improved by the introduction of indirect ophthalmoscope (IDO) delivery during the 1990s.

Nevertheless, over 50 years after the introduction of laser retinopexy, no randomized clinical trial of its use for prophylaxis has been forthcoming.RRD prophylaxis thus remains mostly a matter of judgement by the physician and the informed patient, aided by retrospective studies and literature analysis.

It is commonly accepted that symptomatic tears should be treated, but focal prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic, non-traumatic, predisposing lesions (defects and lattice degeneration*) is still not supported by "strong" evidence and is usually not recommended. Given an option, however, many patients prefer focal treatment (Figure 2) over lifetime observation of potentially causative lesions, since it involves minimal risk and morbidity.

Physicians are duty bound to search for such visible predisposing lesions in the course of routine eye examinations, but it is understood that the majority of causative tears occur in normal appearing (peripheral) retina. This led Byer to conclude that, "If we cannot predict the danger sites, we cannot prevent detachment". After also citing the above, Wilkinson further stated that

A demonstration that vitreoretinal lesions increase risk does not justify the treatment of these disorders in the absence of scientific evidence that the therapy genuinely lowers the rate of subsequent retinal detachment.

### Vitrectomy for primary symptomatic vitreous opacities: an evidence-based review [^112PuCSZ]. Eye (2016). Low credibility.

Floaters are a common ocular condition which form as a consequence of aging changes in the vitreous. Although in most patients the symptoms are minimal, they can cause significant impairment in vision-related quality of life in a small population of patients. Recently there has been an increase in awareness of the visual disability caused by floaters, and the evidence-base for treatment of this condition using small-gauge vitrectomy has increased. In this review, we define the term 'floaters' as symptomatic vitreous opacities (SVO). We suggest a classification dependent on the presence or absence of posterior vitreous detachment and discuss their pathogenesis and natural history. We review their impact on patients' quality of life related to visual function. We review the psychological factors that may have a role in some patients who appear to be affected by SVO to the extent that they pursue all options including surgery with all its attendant risks. We summarise the available evidence-base of treatment options available for SVO with special emphasis on the safety and efficacy of vitrectomy for this condition.

### Pemigatinib (Pemazyre) [^111JACXt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Ocular
Toxicity

Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED)

PEMAZYRE can cause RPED, which may cause symptoms such as blurred vision, visual floaters, or photopsia. Clinical trials of PEMAZYRE did not conduct routine monitoring including optical coherence tomography (OCT) to detect asymptomatic RPED; therefore, the incidence of asymptomatic RPED with PEMAZYRE is unknown.

Among 635 patients who received a starting dose of PEMAZYRE 13.5 mg across clinical trials, RPED occurred in 11% of patients, including Grade 3–4 RPED in 1.3%. The median time to first onset of RPED was 56 days. RPED led to dose interruption of PEMAZYRE in 3.1% of patients, and dose reduction and permanent discontinuation in 1.3% and in 0.2% of patients, respectively. RPED resolved or improved to Grade 1 levels in 76% of patients who required dosage modification of PEMAZYRE for RPED.

Perform a comprehensive ophthalmological examination including OCT prior to initiation of PEMAZYRE and every 2 months for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter during treatment. For onset of visual symptoms, refer patients for ophthalmologic evaluation urgently, with follow-up every 3 weeks until resolution or discontinuation of PEMAZYRE.

Modify the dose or permanently discontinue PEMAZYRE as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Dry Eye

Among 635 patients who received a starting dose of PEMAZYRE 13.5 mg across clinical trials, dry eye occurred in 31% of patients, including Grade 3–4 in 1.6% of patients. Treat patients with ocular demulcents as needed.

### New optical coherence tomography grading system for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: how off is off? [^114zRNAg]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

In retinal detachment studies, the macular region is currently evaluated via funduscopic classification. Most older studies showed that delayed surgery led to significantly lower postoperative visual outcomes. Frings et al showed that surgery within the first 3 days postdetachment had better outcomes than did surgery between 10 and 30 days after symptoms appeared.

Our data demonstrate that even patients with a distinctive detached macula (grades 3b and 4) have significant gains in visual acuity up to reading vision. This is because all retinal detachments undergo surgery within the first 24–48 hours after presentation, most within the first 12 hours. Our data also suggest that even macula-off retinal detachments should be treated as soon as possible, and timely interventions have positive psychological effects for the patient.

We found that a small amount of subretinal fluid (grade 3a) directly under the fovea did not strongly influence BCVA. Previously, only Matsui et al postulated a lower visual outcome for central macula detachments higher than 1000 µm in the OCT. Our data indicate that a 250 µm foveal detachment significantly affects the initial BCVA but can still lead to an improved BCVA if treated early. However, there is very little literature on the amount of subretinal fluid associated with retinal damage and therefore our work is very important as this factor is not considered in current studies. Furthermore, it should be noted that the macular detachment plays an important role, and the structural changes in the retina in the OCT already have an influence on the outcome.

Interestingly, our work showed that patients with a grade 1 retinal detachment sometimes had a worse outcome than patients with higher grades. The fact that all patients were operated within 48 hours may explain these unexpected results. Therefore, we believe that future multicentre studies will play an important role in better interpreting the results.

Certainly, it would be important in the future to include an even larger number of patients in order to have a more balanced group distribution of the different stages, which would allow a better significance. A further limitation of our study is certainly the short follow-up period and the fact that we did not include patients who did not receive OCT preoperatively, in order to better demonstrate the strengths of the OCT grading versus the classic observer. We are aware of the fact that the duration of symptoms is seen in other studies as a predictive factor for the outcome. However, the duration of symptoms is often very subjective and therefore we believe that an objective grading system at the initial presentation of the patient is useful.

### Photodynamic therapy for central serous chorioretinopathy [^113Dn61N]. Eye (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is an idiopathic disorder characterised by detachment of the neurosensory retina due to serous fluid accumulation between the photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelium. There are currently no set guidelines or protocols on its treatment. This study was undertaken to assess the current literature on the the efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a treatment option for CSCR.

Methods

Seven databases (PubMed, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) were searched without restrictions on time or location. We followed PRISMA guidelines and evaluated quality according to STROBE criteria. In total, 117 citations were identified and 31 studies describing 787 eyes were included for review. Data on indications for PDT in CSCR, dosing regimens of verteprofin PDT (which includes treatment dose of vertoporfin, treatment time, fluence, and spot size), number of treatment sessions, response to treatment, mean length of follow-up, and complications were extracted and analysed.

Results

Since the introduction of PDT for the treatment of CSCR in 2003, there have been three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one for acute and two chronic CSCR and 28 further studies that met the STROBE criteria that compared the use of PDT with other treatment options. All studies showed short-term efficacy of PDT in CSCR. The studies were of small sample size and lacked sufficient follow-up to draw conclusions on long-term efficacy and safety.

Conclusions

There is sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that PDT may be a useful treatment option for chronic CSCR in the short-term. The review identifies a need for robust RCTs with longer follow-up to ascertain the role of PDT as a useful treatment option for CSCR.

Posterior vitreous detachment counseling — all patients with a PVD should be instructed to notify their ophthalmologist as soon as possible if they have a substantial change in symptoms, such as an increase in floaters or flashing lights, loss of visual field, or decrease in visual acuity. If patients are familiar with the symptoms of retinal tears or detachment, they may be more likely to report promptly, thus improving the chances of successful treatment and subsequent visual outcome, and patients who undergo refractive surgery to reduce myopia should be informed that they remain at risk of RRD despite reduction of their refractive error.

### CURRENT STATUS AND DETERMINANTS OF POSTOPERATIVE VISUAL FUNCTION-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH RETINAL DETACHMENT: a multivariate analysis [^116FM9di]. Retina (2025). Medium credibility.

Retinal detachment is a common cause of visual dysfunction in which the neurosensory retina separates from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium, disrupting its normal function and nutrient supply. This separation leads to progressive photoreceptor dysfunction, which, if untreated, can result in permanent vision loss. Globally, the annual incidence of retinal detachment is approximately 10 to 18 per 100,000 individuals, with variations based on age, geography, and predisposing conditions such as myopia and cataract surgery. The primary types of retinal detachment include rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative, with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment being the most common, accounting for over 80% of cases. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment primarily arises from retinal breaks that allow vitreous fluid to enter the subretinal space, driven by factors such as posterior vitreous detachment, trauma, or high myopia. The pathophysiology involves a cascade of molecular events, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of photoreceptor cells, further exacerbating visual dysfunction.

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^113bijDA]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Vitrectomy surgery for epiretinal membrane (ERM) and vitreomacular traction (VMT) — indications and timing emphasize symptom-driven decision-making: a Cochrane review found no randomized controlled trial that evaluated surgery versus no intervention, and the decision to intervene usually depends on the severity of symptoms and impact on activities of daily living; patients should be asked how much they are bothered and/or impaired by their visual dysfunction, including reading or driving, and should also be questioned about distortion changes. Vitrectomy surgery for ERM/VMT is elective rather than urgent, and earlier surgical intervention for ERM may result in better long-term visual acuity recovery than delayed surgery, yet the time frame of the delay is considered in months rather than in days. Patients with VMT do not typically improve without vitrectomy when the area of VMT is broad (> 1500 μm), when there is an accompanying pathologic detachment of the macula, or when the presenting visual acuity is poor; overall, the recommendation to observe or perform surgery is mainly based on patients' discomfort with their vision and their understanding of the associated risks, and appropriate intervention should be made with careful informed consent and a discussion of the risk-benefit ratio of surgery.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) evolution and prevention — Precursors to RRDs include PVD, asymptomatic retinal breaks, symptomatic retinal breaks, lattice retinal degeneration, and cystic and zonular traction retinal tufts. Because spontaneous retinal reattachment is uncommon, nearly all patients with a symptomatic clinical RRD will progressively lose vision unless the detachment is repaired, and currently more than 95% of uncomplicated RRDs can be successfully repaired, although more than one procedure may be required. The prophylactic treatment of high-risk breaks usually prevents RRD, and early diagnosis is important because the rate of successful reattachment is higher and the visual results are better when repaired early and especially before the RRD involves the macula.

### Treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy: new options for an old disease [^113AyDsy]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a common ocular disease that causes vision loss, particularly in people of working age. Although it was first described over a century ago, research has expanded in recent years, transforming the understanding and management of this complex condition. Here, we propose clinical recommendations for the treatment and management of CSC, based on evidence from the published literature and the consensus of an international group of retinal experts. Recent evidence describing the pathogenesis of and risk factors for CSC focuses on possible dysfunction of the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium, and the role of corticosteroids. It is suggested that CSC lies within the spectrum of pachychoroid disorders that share the characteristic of thickened choroidal tissue. Available evidence supports half-dose (or half-fluence) verteporfin photodynamic therapy as the treatment of choice for CSC to reduce choroidal hyperpermeability. A subset of patients with chronic CSC can develop choroidal neovascularisation, and these patients should be treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents. Finally, posterior multifocal pigment epitheliopathy is a recognised variant of CSC that may progress to large areas of exudative retinal detachment. We propose a step-wise chart for clinical decision-making in the management and treatment of CSC. New data on long-term visual outcomes and the pathogenesis of CSC in relation to the pachychoroid disease spectrum provide a better understanding to inform our management of this disease.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^114AVXBG]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration — acute horseshoe retinal tears and traumatic breaks usually require treatment. Asymptomatic atrophic or operculated retinal breaks rarely need treatment, and an eye that has atrophic round holes within lattice lesions has minimal subretinal fluid without progression or that lacks evidence of PVD does not require treatment. An early diagnosis of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is important because the rate of successful retinal reattachment is higher and the visual results are better when repaired early, especially before the RRD involves the macula. Patients presenting with an acute PVD and no retinal breaks have a small chance (~2%) of developing retinal breaks in the weeks that follow, and those with any degree of vitreous pigment, vitreous or retinal hemorrhage, or visible vitreoretinal traction upon indirect ophthalmoscopy should be asked to return for a second examination within 6 weeks or promptly if they have new symptoms. Between 5% and 14% of patients with symptomatic PVD found to have a retinal break at the time of the initial visit will develop additional breaks during long-term follow-up. Treatment of peripheral horseshoe tears should extend to the ora serrata if the tear cannot be surrounded using laser surgery or cryotherapy, and the most common cause of failure is inadequate treatment, particularly along the anterior border (where visualization is more difficult).

### Retinal detachment… [^111L26NN]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

It is important to distinguish retinal detachment from posterior vitreous detachment, which is a natural aging process that occurs in many people. Every year, about 1 to 2 people per 10 000 develop retinal detachment. Retinal detachment is a medical emergency. The April 4, 2012, issue of JAMA includes an article about the risk of retinal detachment from a type of antibiotic. This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the November 25, 2009, issue of JAMA. Symptoms Symptoms of posterior vitreous detachment may include sudden onset of floaters, bright flashes of light, and blurred vision. A small percentage of people with posterior vitreous detachment may develop a retinal tear, which can progress to a retinal detachment if it is not treated.

An increasing area of grayness in one eye can mean that a retinal tear has progressed to a detached retina. Patients with symptoms of posterior vitreous detachment or retinal detachment should immediately consult an ophthalmologist. The goal is to prevent detachment of the macula because this is the portion of the retina responsible for fine, detailed central vision. Treatment The chances of recovering vision are greater when the retina is repaired before the macula is detached. Most people with retinal detachment need surgery to repair it, either immediately or after a short time. There are several types of surgery used depending on the severity and type of detachment. Patients with tears or small detachments can often be treated in the office with laser surgery, gas bubble injection, or a freeze treatment called cryopexy.

Patients with more severe retinal detachment need to go to the operating room, where different types of surgery can be performed to reattach the retina. Once the retina is reattached, vision often improves or stabilizes. A person's ability to read with the affected eye after surgery depends on whether the macula was detached, how long it was detached, the severity of the retinal detachment, and the type of treatment performed.

Treatment of CSC

Establishing optimal treatment guidelines for CSC is complicated due to the disease's natural course and its variety of clinical manifestations. Since most acute CSC cases may recover with no treatment (observation only) within 3–4 months, observation has been considered an appropriate first-line approach. Treatment should be considered if retinal detachment persists for more than 3 months.

Considering the relatively good visual prognosis of patients with CSC, the chosen treatment modality must be evidence-based and demonstrate a favourable safety profile, especially since CSC often resolves spontaneously. Most of the studies published to date have analysed retrospective data, and analytical parameters vary in relation to inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment timing and study outcome. Because CSC often improves or resolves spontaneously, large, prospective, randomised controlled trials conducted over a defined treatment period are of particular interest.

Reduction of risk factors

As high levels of endogenous or exogenous corticosteroids are associated with the development of CSC, discontinuation of all forms of steroids is recommended. Lifestyle modifications and psychosocial therapy for patients who are prone to psychological stress, and treatment for sleep apnoea where required, are also helpful.

Laser photocoagulation

Navigated laser photocoagulation has been suggested as a safe and effective laser modality for the treatment of CSC associated with extrafoveal leakage on FA. Reported adverse events include CNV at the treatment site. Despite its effectiveness, laser treatment has not been shown to reduce choroidal thickness and therefore may not affect the overall prognosis of CSC. Additionally, no differences in recurrence rate, visual acuity or choroidal thickness have been reported in comparison with observation alone. However, in a non-randomised comparative study of laser treatment versus observation in 45 eyes, Burumcek et al. observed faster fluid resolution, fewer CSC recurrences and better visual acuity after 5 years of follow-up in eyes that were treated with focal laser versus those that received no active treatment.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^116A3cWt]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management of symptomatic PVD/RRD — evaluation urgency, comparative procedures, and timing are described as: It is essential that clinical personnel be familiar with the symptoms of PVD and RRD and that they recognize the need for urgent ophthalmologic evaluation of symptomatic patients; patients with symptoms of possible or suspected PVD or RRD and related disorders should be examined as soon as is feasible by an ophthalmologist skilled in binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy, and patients with retinal breaks or detachments should be treated by an ophthalmologist with experience in the management of these conditions. Evidence syntheses found low to very low certainty evidence indicating little or no difference between pars plana vitrectomy and scleral buckling in anatomical and visual acuity outcomes, and a meta-analysis also found no significant differences in visual acuity and final reattachment rates; another meta-analysis across 18 randomized controlled trials and 2,751 eyes found scleral buckling had better early postoperative visual acuity than pars plana vitrectomy, with no difference for primary reattachment and no significant differences with combination surgery. A large multicenter retrospective cohort reported that scleral buckle and combination pars plana vitrectomy with scleral buckle were superior to vitrectomy in achieving single-surgery anatomic success, and for macula-on or split cases, scleral buckle had significantly better visual outcomes than pars plana vitrectomy or scleral buckling with pars plana vitrectomy. For dense PVD-associated vitreous hemorrhage, early vitrectomy (usually defined as within 7 days of presentation) has been reported to have a low rate of complications and may be considered to reduce the risk of vision loss occurring secondary to macula-involving RRD; prompt intervention is indicated if there is a tear seen on ultrasonography and the vitreous cavity precludes a view.

### Interventions for central serous chorioretinopathy: a network meta-analysis [^1159gx4a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is characterized by serous detachment of the neural retina with dysfunction of the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The effects on the retina are usually self limited, although some people are left with irreversible vision loss due to progressive and permanent photoreceptor damage or RPE atrophy. There have been a variety of interventions used in CSC, including, but not limited to, laser treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. However, it is not known whether these or other treatments offer significant advantages over observation or other interventions. At present there is no evidence-based consensus on the management of CSC. Due in large part to the propensity for CSC to resolve spontaneously or to follow a waxing and waning course, the most common initial approach to treatment is observation. It remains unclear whether this is the best approach with regard to safety and efficacy.

Objectives

To compare the relative effectiveness of interventions for central serous chorioretinopathy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 5 October 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any intervention for CSC with any other intervention for CSC or control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We pooled data from all studies using a fixed-effect model. For interventions applied to the eye (i.e. not systemic interventions), we synthesized direct and indirect evidence in a network meta-analysis model.

Main Results

We included 25 studies with 1098 participants (1098 eyes) and follow-up from 16 weeks to 12 years. Studies were conducted in Europe, North and South America, Middle East, and Asia. The trials were small (most trials enrolled fewer than 50 participants) and poorly reported; often it was unclear whether key aspects of the trial, such as allocation concealment, had been done. A substantial proportion of the trials were not masked. The studies considered a variety of treatments: anti-VEGF (ranibizumab, bevacizumab), PDT (full-dose, half-dose, 30%, low-fluence), laser treatment (argon, krypton and micropulse laser), beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, Helicobactor pylori treatment, and nutritional supplements (Icaps, lutein); there were only one or two trials contributing data for each comparison. We downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision for most analyses, reflecting study limitations and imprecise estimates. Network meta-analysis (as planned in our protocol) did not help to resolve this uncertainty due to a lack of trials, and problems with intransitivity, particularly with respect to acute or chronic CSC. Low quality evidence from two trials suggested little difference in the effect of anti-VEGF (ranibizumab or bevacizumab) or observation on change in visual acuity at six months in acute CSC (mean difference (MD) 0.01 LogMAR (logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution), 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02 to 0.03; 64 participants). CSC had resolved in all participants by six months. There were no significant adverse effects noted. Low quality evidence from one study (58 participants) suggested that half-dose PDT treatment of acute CSC probably results in a small improvement in vision (MD -0.10 logMAR, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02), less recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.81) and less persistent CSC (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.02) at 12 months compared to sham treatment. There were no significant adverse events noted. Low quality evidence from two trials (56 participants) comparing anti-VEGF to low-fluence PDT in chronic CSC found little evidence for any difference in visual acuity at 12 months (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.15). There was some evidence that more people in the anti-VEGF group had recurrent CSC compared to people treated with PDT but, due to inconsistency between trials, it was difficult to estimate an effect. More people in the anti-VEGF group had persistent CSC at 12 months (RR 6.19, 95% CI 1.61 to 23.81; 34 participants). Two small trials of micropulse laser, one in people with acute CSC and one in people with chronic CSC, provided low quality evidence that laser treatment may lead to better visual acuity (MD -0.20 logMAR, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.11; 45 participants). There were no significant adverse effects noted. Other comparisons were largely inconclusive. We identified 12 ongoing trials covering the following interventions: aflibercept and eplerenone in acute CSC; spironolactone, eplerenone, lutein, PDT, and micropulse laser in chronic CSC; and micropulse laser and oral mifepristone in two trials where type of CSC not clearly specified.

Authors' Conclusions

CSC remains an enigmatic condition in large part due to a natural history of spontaneous improvement in a high proportion of people and also because no single treatment has provided overwhelming evidence of efficacy in published RCTs. While a number of interventions have been proposed as potentially efficacious, the quality of study design, execution of the study and the relatively small number of participants enrolled and followed to revealing endpoints limits the utility of existing data. It is not clear whether there is a clinically important benefit to treating acute CSC which often resolves spontaneously as part of its natural history. RCTs comparing individual treatments to the natural history would be valuable in identifying potential treatment groups for head-to-head comparison. Of the interventions studied to date, PDT or micropulse laser treatment appear the most promising for study in future trials.

### Somatostatin analogues as a treatment option for cystoid maculopathy in retinitis pigmentosa [^113Zgr8q]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common form of inherited retinal dystrophies, initially presents with night blindness and a gradual decline in peripheral vision and progresses to central vision loss. Cystoid maculopathy (CM), characterised by cyst formation in the intracellular spaces of the retina primarily in the outer-plexiform layer, is a common complication in RP, occurring in ~50%. Cystoid spaces can exhibit either leaking or non-leaking characteristics. Potential mechanisms described for CM in RP include disruption of the blood–retina barrier which causes leakage from the perifoveal retinal capillaries, as well as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) pump mechanism failure and/or müller cell oedema and dysfunction. Disruption of retinal architecture due to underlying RP might explain mechanisms for non-leaking cystoid spaces.CM leads to immediate or gradual visual impairment due to retinal thickening and fluid collection, which distort the photoreceptor architecture ultimately accelerating photoreceptor atrophy.CM treatment is important for preserving photoreceptors, thereby optimising visual acuity, especially for RP patients depending on central vision.

Several treatments are available for reducing CM in RP patients. The first choice of treatment is carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) orally or topically which reduces CM in ~42% and increases visual acuity in ~40% of the patients. Intolerable side effects such as potassium deficiency, tingling of limbs (67%–86%), fatigue (17%–43%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (17%–43%) are often a reason to stop this treatment. Topical application of CAI can reduce CM by 30%–81% and improve visual acuity by 19%–37%. Topical or intravitreal steroids can reduce CM in almost all patients with improvement of visual acuity in ~20%. Important side effects of steroids are high intraocular pressure (> 10%) and cataract (> 10%), especially when used chronically, which make this a less attractive treatment option. Vitreoretinal surgery has been shown to significantly reduce foveal thickness (FT) and improve best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in a subset of patients, but it is invasive and can lead to complications such as retinal detachment or macula oedema. The above-mentioned treatments are unfortunately not sufficiently effective for all patients or may cause intolerable side effects.

### Remodelling intravitreal therapy pathways for macular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic and an Austrian national lockdown [^113Qsyf4]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Treatment protocol

Following a survey of Austrian medical retinal key decision makers and clinical leads, an adapted treatment protocol was established at our institution. The standard treatment regime in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was a treat-and-extend regimen for patients with nvAMD or macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusions and a pro re nata regime for DMO. The proposed treatment protocol named treat-and-freeze is summarised in figure 1. It consisted of several key points: first, a standardised questionnaire was asked to identify patients with potential deterioration or retinal detachment symptoms who would be examined with VA assessment, OCT, Goldmann applanation tonometry and dilated fundus exam. If eligible for treatment, patients would then receive an IVI, and the retreatment interval would be determined by the medical retina specialist. All other patients would receive an IVI without further pupil dilation, and the interval would be subsequently extended by 2 weeks for the next appointment with the outlook of maintaining the interval, unless changes were reported. Second, bilateral injections were offered for all patients who were under a treat-and-extend regime to both eyes, and treatment intervals were adjusted to the eye with the shorter interval. To minimise the risk of endophthalmitis or toxic reactions, different agents were used in the two eyes and a single surgical cover covering both eyes for bilateral injections was used as recommended in guidelines. If bilateral treatment implicated a change of agents for one eye, patients were reconsented. Patients refusing bilateral treatment in one session would receive the injection in the eye with the better prognosis; the other eye would be downgraded and rescheduled. Injection clinic patient lists were screened for patients awaiting bilateral injections the following day to plan accordingly.

### Picture of the month-diagnosis… [^114TxSKn]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The patient was diagnosed with anterior chamber cholesterolosis secondary to Coats disease. Coats disease is an idiopathic sporadic condition typified by retinal vascular telangiectasia and subretinal lipid exudation, which can lead to secondary retinal detachment. It occurs more commonly in males and is almost always unilateral. 1 Coats disease can occur at any age but the majority of cases are diagnosed in the first 2 decades of life. 1 There are no documented systemic associations with classic Coats disease. In the Figure, A and B, the retina is detached and can be seen through the pupil just posterior to the lens. Inferiorly, the characteristic vascular telangiectasia is visible. In this case, the diagnosis of Coats disease was made at the initial presentation based on the presence of vascular telangiectasia and the absence of intraocular calcification. Figure. A, External view of the patient at initial presentation.

B, Close-up view of the right eye showing the detached retina visible immediately posterior to the lens through a dilated pupil. The inferior retina shows telangiectatic retinal vessels characteristic of this condition. The detached retina appears yellow because of the presence of lipid exudate below the retina. C, External view of the patient 6 months later. D, Close-up view of the right eye at the 6-month follow-up showing numerous refractile cholesterol crystals in the anterior chamber. Anterior segment cholesterolosis has been documented after severe trauma, chronic inflammation, and chronic retinal detachment. 2 It can also occur as a result of hyphema or vitreous hemorrhage, neither of which were found in our patient. 3 In a large series of 158 eyes with Coats disease, only 3%. had anterior segment cholesterolosis. 1 In Coats disease, the subretinal exudation characteristically contains lipid-laden macrophages and cholesterol clefts.

1 The exudation can escape into the vitreous and anterior chamber by either transudation or through undetected retinal holes, where it is seen as small, freely mobile, yellow refractile crystals 4, 5. Laser photocoagulation and cryotherapy are used to ablate peripheral telangiectasias associated with exudative retinal detachment in an effort to minimize foveal involvement and maximize visual acuity. Patients with mild disease and minimal exudation are observed and patients with markedly advanced disease typically show visual acuity loss despite successful therapy.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^11677aT7]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Lattice retinal degeneration — management, progression risk, and related tear treatment are described as follows: Treatment is not required for atrophic round holes within lattice lesions that are accompanied by minimal subretinal fluid without progression and no posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Lattice retinal degeneration is a risk factor for developing a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). In an analysis of 423 eyes with lattice retinal degeneration in 276 patients over a period averaging nearly 11 years, 150 eyes (35%) had atrophic holes, 10 of these 150 had subretinal fluid extending more than 1 disc diameter (subclinical retinal detachment), six other eyes developed new subclinical RRDs, and clinical RRDs developed in 3 of the 423 eyes, with two due to round retinal holes in patients in their mid–20s and one due to a symptomatic tractional tear. These data indicate a very low risk for progression to clinical RRD without a previous RRD in the fellow eye; however, in eyes with RRD in one eye, one study found benefit in prophylactic laser treatment of the other eye. Prophylactic or interventional treatment should be considered when the detachments are documented to become symptomatic, increase in size, or show other signs of progression. More commonly, RRD occurs in eyes with lattice when a PVD induces a horseshoe tear, and such tears should be treated using either laser demarcation or cryotherapy.

Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) — methods and key to ratings define how evidence and recommendation strengths are assigned. All studies used to form a recommendation for care are graded for strength of evidence individually, and that grade is listed with the study citation. Individual study levels follow the SIGN scale with categories I++, I+, I−, II++, II+, II−, and III, ranging from "High-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias" to "Nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series)". Recommendations for care are formed based on the body of the evidence with GRADE quality categories defined as Good quality ("Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect"), Moderate quality ("Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate"), and Insufficient quality ("Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate Any estimate of effect is very uncertain"). Key recommendation strengths are defined as: "Strong recommendation Used when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects or clearly do not" and "Discretionary recommendation Used when the trade-offs are less certain — either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced". All recommendations for care in this PPP were rated using the system described above, with ratings embedded in italics, and literature searches to update the PPP were undertaken on March 6, 2023, January 23, 2024, and August 5, 2024 in PubMed, with details available at www.aao.org/ppp.

### Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: a review of current practice in diagnosis and management [^111Vs3ir]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) (figure 1) is the most common form of RD occurring in approximately 1 in 10 000 of the population per annum. It develops when there is a retinal 'break' or full-thickness defect in the neurosensory retina (NSR) that allows the ingress of fluid from the vitreous cavity into the subretinal space, resulting in separation of the NSR from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In this review, we mainly discuss acute progressive RRD with onset less than 2 weeks, whereas chronic RRD is defined as being present for longer than 2 weeks.

### Pharmacotherapies for retinal detachment [^115ogtTo]. Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment is an important cause of visual loss. Currently, surgical techniques, including vitrectomy, scleral buckle, and pneumatic retinopexy, are the only means to repair retinal detachment and restore vision. However, surgical failure rates may be as high as 20%, and visual outcomes continue to vary secondary to multiple processes, including postoperative cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane formation, macular folds, and, ultimately, photoreceptor death. Therefore, pharmacotherapies are being sought to aid the success rates of modern surgical techniques and reduce or slow the degeneration of photoreceptors during retinal detachment. This review discusses potential therapeutic avenues that aid in retinal reattachment, reduce the rate of retinal redetachment by limiting proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and protect against photoreceptor cell death.

### Treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy with topical NSAIDs [^117LxKcJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common retinopathy that is characterized by spontaneous serous detachment of the neurosensory retina in the macular region. Visual symptoms in patients with CSCR are often related to the localization of serous retinal detachment in the macular area, presenting with blurred vision, relative central scotoma, metamorphopsia, and reduced contrast sensitivity. This condition appears to affect males more often than females, and perhaps more so in mid-life. The precise etiology of CSCR is unknown but it is suggested that this disease may develop due to increased permeability of choroidal vessels with subsequent increased tissue hydrostatic pressure that overcomes the RPE barrier function and lead to the accumulation of subretinal fluids. Another possible explanation is that excess steroid use or endogenous cortisol production may lead to impaired RPE function, choroidal vascular autoregulation, hypercoagulability and augmented platelet aggregation. Indeed, risk factors to CSCR include steroid use, conditions that are associated with increased cortisol production (i.e. pregnancy and Cushing's disease), type A personality, psychological stress, hypertension, and coagulation disorders.

Most cases of CSCR are self-limiting and regress spontaneously within 3–4 months. Therefore, observation with or without the removal of risk factors is one of the mainstays of therapy for acute CSCR. However, chronic cases pose a risk of progressive vision loss and thus, different treatment options such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), micro-pulse laser, intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, and systemic anti-corticosteroid medications have been used. However, these treatments can have unwanted complications, while their effectiveness in the treatment of CSCR show either controversial or low-quality evidence of improvement.–Therefore, it is not surprising that there is not yet a solid identified mainstay of therapy for CSCR. For this study we propose to test the effectiveness of topical NSAIDs in the treatment of CSCR as a safe alternative to current treatment options.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the diagnosis of concomitant AMD and RRD may not be a devastating diagnosis visually. It appears that the routine use of best surgical practice to manage RRD in AMD is well worth the effort for patients. Though clinicians should be careful not to overestimate visual outcomes, patients can be assured that surgical intervention does offer the hope of functional vision.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^116jM6j8]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal detachment prevention — risk recognition and prophylaxis are summarized as: There are no effective methods of preventing the vitreous syneresis and liquefaction that lead to a PVD and possibly an RRD, so when factors associated with an increased risk of RRD are discovered during a routine eye examination in an asymptomatic patient, a careful peripheral fundus examination is recommended, and patients at high risk should also be educated about the symptoms of PVD and RRD as well as about the value of periodic follow-up examinations. Patients with retinal or vitreous hemorrhage have an increased risk of multiple retinal tears. A systematic review performed in 2012 found that there is no strong evidence to support or refute the use of 360-degree laser surgery intervention in the fellow eyes of patients with a unilateral giant retinal tear. In Stickler syndrome, one study reported that over an average of 6.1 years of follow-up, only 9% of eyes with prophylactic 360° laser had a retinal detachment versus 23% of eyes that did not have prophylactic laser, and in genetically verified Stickler syndrome, 360 degree laser prophylaxis is now recommended.

### Central serous chorioretinopathy: pathogenesis and management [^116WUhqF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapy

The prognosis for resolution and visual recovery in patients with aCSC is usually good, thus observation and patient reassurance is considered the best treatment course. Positive converging lenses can be used to improve visual acuity until CSC resolves. Most affected patients recover spontaneously with improvement of visual acuity, reattachment of the sensory retina, and improvement of the other symptoms within 3–4 months. Conversely, approximately 20–30% of patients will develop one or more recurrences of aCSC, and 5% will develop cCSC. A significant number of these patients develop a limited area of RPE atrophy and depigmentation after resolution of the affected retinal area.

For patients with CSC, it is important to suspend, or replace with an alternative, any current medications containing steroids, including creams, sprays, and eye drops. In patients treated with corticosteroids, only suspension of this therapy will be effective in reducing the bullous retinal detachment.

Faster regression of subretinal exudation may be obtained using laser photocoagulation applied to close focal sites of RPE leakage, or by photodynamic therapy (PDT) applied to the areas of choroidal vascular hyperpermeability.

However, a recent meta-analysis concerning the therapeutic interventions for aCSC analyzed 25 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) concluded that it is not completely clear whether a clinically important benefit exists to treating aCSC since it often resolves spontaneously. Nevertheless, treatment should be considered if resorption does not occur within 3–4 months and in cases of aCSC recurrence in eyes that sustained a permanent visual deficit from a previous episode. Treatment is also suggested in bilateral cases of aCSC, in cases with reduced visual acuity in the fellow eye, and in patients that absolutely require prompt restoration of their vision owing to occupational necessity. The majority of ophthalmologists recommend treatment of cCSC.–

Posterior vitreous detachment and retinal breaks — perioperative counseling and risks specify that the surgeon should inform the patient of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery and is responsible for formulating a postoperative care plan and should inform the patient of these arrangements. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments may occur in spite of appropriate therapy, as traction is an important component and may pull the tear from the treated area, especially when there are larger breaks or bridging retinal blood vessels. The laser surgery- or cryotherapy-induced treatment adhesion (chorioretinal scar) may not be formed or complete for up to 1 month following treatment, and 10% to 16% of patients will develop additional breaks during long-term follow-up; pseudophakic patients are more likely to require retreatment or to develop new breaks.

### Low-dose 0.01% atropine eye drops for symptomatic vitreous floaters: a noninvasive, safe, and effective therapeutic option [^114sgsV8]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To assess whether topical low-dose 0.01% atropine eye drops effectively alleviate floater symptoms, as measured by scores from a modified National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire. Methods: This is a retrospective case series conducted at the Retina Group of Washington. Adults with persistently symptomatic vitreous floaters and either vitreous syneresis without posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) or a history of PVD for at least 3 months were included. Subjects with significant vitreoretinal pathology, significant media opacity, anatomic narrow angles, or a history of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) were excluded. Patients completed a modified National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire before using topical low-dose 0.01% atropine eye drops once daily for 1 week. The same questionnaire was then completed after the 1-week period to assess treatment response. The primary outcome measure was satisfaction with the drops. Results: A total of 44 patients received 0.01% atropine eye drops prescribed for daily application in either 1 or both eyes. There were 22 patients who completed at least 7 days of consecutive drop use. Of these, 13 patients (59.1%) were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the drops, and 11 patients (50%) reported that they would continue using the medication. Conclusions: Low-dose 0.01% atropine eye drops may be an effective, noninvasive treatment option for select patients with persistently symptomatic vitreous floaters resulting from vitreous syneresis or PVD.

### Tamponade in the surgical management of retinal detachment [^115G1Byy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite continuing advances in vitreoretinal care, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) remains a major cause of visual loss worldwide. There is geographic variation in the incidence of RD, with reported rates ranging from 6.3 to 17.9 per 100,000 population, with a rate of ~12 per 100,000 in the USA.

The most commonly used treatment modalities for the management of RD are scleral buckling, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), pneumatic retinopexy, and combination techniques. Overall, these treatment options have been reported to yield a single operation success rate of > 90%.

In recent years, there has been a trend toward PPV as the preferred method of treatment for RD. In the American Society of Retina Specialists (ASRS) 2014 Global Trends in Retina survey, 78% of the US respondents preferred PPV, while only 13% preferred scleral buckling to treat pseudophakic RD without proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). These percentages were 48% and 23%, respectively, for phakic RD without PVR.

When PPV is chosen for the treatment of RD, it is typically accompanied by the use of a postoperative intraocular tamponade agent.

### Personal story: my life with vision loss… [^116XhZBD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

First symptoms of vision loss Serena was recommended an eye exam as part of her diabetes management. But she put it off for years since she didn't have any symptoms. In 2017, she began seeing floaters and had blurred vision in her right eye. She learned she'd developed diabetic retinopathy and had a detached retina. Serena had surgery to reattach her retina, but because she had a severe case, it didn't work. "Three days after the retina reattachment surgery, I woke up and it was just dark. I had lost total vision in my right eye, " she explains. Since then, she's had a retina detachment in her left eye, but this time she immediately started laser treatments. "Today I'm still completely blind in the right eye, but I have about 30% to 35% vision in the left eye". Kristen's story In 2019, Kristen Craig was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. RA is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake.

It causes inflammation in the affected parts — in Kristen's case, her eyes. Kristen began experiencing painful light sensitivity, redness, and blurred vision in her right eye. At first it was suspected to be pink eye. But after the medicine she was prescribed didn't help, Kristen visited an eye doctor. She learned she had uveitis. Uveitis happens when the inside of the eye becomes inflamed. This causes redness, painful sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Over time, uveitis can cause scar tissue inside the eye and permanent damage to vision. Although Kristen had been seeing a doctor for her RA, she had no idea it could affect her eyes. Debilitating flare-ups When Kristen has a uveitis flare-up, she's in so much pain she can't leave her bedroom. She needs a 21-day course of steroid eye drops and pills to feel better.

That also means 21 days of missing out on daily activities, including time with her husband and kids. Each flare-up means more damage to her eyes, which could mean more vision loss. To help prevent uveitis flare-ups, Kristen receives weekly injections to keep her body from attacking itself. Kristen's uveitis flare-ups have decreased over time, but she knows they'll still happen due to RA.

### Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: a review of current practice in diagnosis and management [^111cEkok]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Until the early 1900s, RD was a blinding disorder with unclear pathogenesis; RD was initially thought to represent an exudative process, occurring from choroidal leakage and not caused by retinal breaks. Specifically, it was thought that stretching of the retina, effectively 'inflating' of the retina, caused breaks and early treatment involved instrumentation to produce tears in order to allow for subretinal fluid egress into the vitreous cavity. The field was revolutionised by Jules Gonin who recognised the role of retinal breaks in causing detachments through the study of cadaveric eyes.

The past 80 years of RRD treatment have, therefore, focused on surgical techniques to close or appose the retinal break(s) to the RPE. Once the break is closed, the RPE then actively removes fluid from the subretinal space to the choroid where it is absorbed via the choroidal vasculature. In 1951, Schepens et al introduced extraocular scleral buckling (SB) for RD, raising the rate of successful reattachment to close to 90%. For the next two decades, SB was the principal surgical intervention for patients with RRDs. In 1970s pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was developed as an alternative surgical approach for patients with RD by Charles and Machemer, and in 1973 Norton introduced the use of intraocular tamponade with sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) gas, expanding the role of intraocular surgery in the management of RRDs. Intraocular gases (such as SF6 or perfluoropropane, C3F8) are an important element of managing RRD with PPV as they allow closure of retinal break(s) until a permanent, retinopexy-induced, choroidoretinal adhesion develops. Their use can be substituted by silicone oil (SO) which provides permanent or long-term non-expansile tamponade and may be preferable in eyes with complicated RRD — for example due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), trauma or giant retinal tears — or in patients who have to fly following surgery. In recent years, improvements in vitrectomy instrumentation, the development of wide-angle microscopic viewing systems, the use of perfluorocarbon liquids, and the development of microincisional techniques have reduced the morbidity, and expanded the role of vitrectomy, resulting in it becoming the most popular treatment modality for primary, as well as complex and/or recurrent RRD for many surgeons. An excellent and comprehensive historical review of the evolution of RRD theory and management has been provided by Gloor and Marmor.

### Progress in the management of retinal detachment associated with morning glory syndrome [^114dkmc2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In sum, MGS is a rare congenital malformation characterized by distinct ocular fundus features and significant complications, including various forms of retinal detachment. The complexity of MGS necessitates a multifaceted approach to treatment, involving advanced surgical techniques and thorough postoperative management to address complications effectively. For the treatment of MGS combined with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, most scholars use vitrectomy combined with paraoptic disc laser photocoagulation. Most cases can achieve reattachment of the retina, and the fundus anatomy can remain stable during the follow-up period, but there are still some adverse outcomes, such as retinal redetachment, silicone oil emulsification, elevated intraocular pressure, etc. For the treatment of MGS combined with non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, scholars mostly use vitrectomy combined with paraoptic disc laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy. Both surgical methods can achieve reattachment of the retina, and the fundus anatomy is stable during the follow-up period, but also have adverse consequences such as retinal redetachment, silicone oil emulsification, etc. To prevent MGS combined with retinal detachment, simple paraoptic disc laser photocoagulation can be adopted. While the prognosis for vision remains variable, ongoing research into genetic factors and innovative treatment modalities holds promise for improving outcomes for individuals affected by MGS. Enhanced awareness and understanding among healthcare professionals will be pivotal in ensuring timely diagnosis and intervention, ultimately aiming to optimize the quality of life for patients with this condition.

### Evaluation and management of suspected retinal… [^116ynR9w]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment results when physiologic and anatomic mechanisms of retinal attachment are overcome and the retina separates from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium. Retinal detachments are classified into three pathogenetic types. A patient may present with one or more of these types. Exudative retinal detachment results from the accumulation of serous and/or hemorrhagic fluid in the subretinal space because of hydrostatic factors, or inflammation, or neoplastic effusions. Exudative retinal detachment generally resolves with successful treatment of the underlying disease, and visual recovery is often excellent. The second type of detachment, tractional retinal detachment, occurs via centripetal mechanical forces on the retina, usually mediated by fibrotic tissue resulting from previous hemorrhage, injury, surgery, infection, or inflammation.

Correction of tractional retinal detachment requires disengaging scar tissue from the retinal surface. In patients with tractional retinal detachment, vision outcomes are often poor. 4 Posterior vitreous detachment is harmless by itself, though bothersome floaters may develop and persist. However, in 10 to 15 percent of patients with symptomatic posterior vitreous detachment, a retinal flap tear or hole forms as the vitreous pulls away from the retina, especially in the periphery where the retina is thinner.
5. Over time, the area of detachment increases as more fluid passes through the retinal break. Symptoms depend on the location and extent of the detachment. For example, a small detachment in the inferior retina results in a small superior visual field defect, while a large temporal detachment causes extensive nasal field loss. When the macula detaches, central acuity is lost.

If untreated, nearly all rhegmatogenous retinal detachments progress to involve the macula. 21, 22. Within months, photoreceptors in a detached retina suffer severe and irreversible damage caused by the separation from the underlying choroidal vascular supply, and repair yields less visual improvement. Retinal detachment surgery fails in 5 to 10 percent of patients because of the growth of scar tissue on the retinal surface in the weeks following repair.

### New optical coherence tomography grading system for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: how off is off? [^1143Bmf2]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is the most common vitreoretinal emergency and can lead to blindness if left untreated. Risk factors for retinal detachment are myopia, ocular trauma, cataracts and other ocular surgeries.

Most surgeons have difficulty determining the optimal surgical timing that will yield the best visual results for patients with RRD. Preoperative status of the macular detachment is the most important prognostic indicator for visual recovery after surgical repair of RRD.

In cases of retinal detachment, macular involvement has been historically determined using direct or indirect funduscopy. However, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has recently become more important and is a standard tool in the clinical routine of most ophthalmologists.OCT-based classification of the macular involvement is ideal for preoperatively evaluating patients with retinal detachment and could help identify the optimal timing for surgical intervention. A standardised and accurate OCT classification of the macular involvement would also provide a basis for comparing retinal detachment studies.

Several studies investigating factors that affect visual outcomes have identified other preoperative findings such as visual acuity, age and comorbidities. Other investigations have identified the time between symptom onset and surgery as another important predictive factor.

Macula-off detachment is commonly thought to have a worse visual prognosis than that of macula-on detachment. Specifically, macular detachment height and duration have been found to be major predictive factors for postsurgical visual outcomes.

For retinal detachments with macular involvement, primary anatomical success may not yield good visual outcomes, and the functional results vary greatly. Accurately evaluating the preoperative macular involvement using OCT examinations enables better determining the optimal timing for surgical intervention. This means more precisely predicting patients' visual recovery.

In the current study, we designed a new grading system that can be easily applied in everyday clinical practice to determine the influence and extent of the macular detachment seen in the preoperative OCT evaluation relative to the postoperative visual outcome and surgical intervention timing. Additionally, this consistent OCT classification enables comparing the results of retinal detachment studies.

### Reversing the paradigm on the urgency of acute retinal detachments defined by their foveal status: when off may be more urgent than on… [^1123efHn]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

The visual prognosis is good for what is generally termed 'macula-on' rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRDs) but often less favourable for 'macula-off' RRDs. The longer the fovea is detached and the higher the detachment is from the retinal pigment epithelium, the worse the visual outcome. Indeed, it is the exquisitely engineered fovea that is the key determinant of good visual recovery, and as such, we need to be more precise with the terminology and replace the traditional terms of 'macula-on/off' with 'fovea-on/off'. While posturing and/or immobility induced by bilateral eye patching may temporarily reduce or prevent the spread of subretinal fluid (SRF) under the fovea prior to surgery, prompt surgical intervention is key for improving visual outcomes.

As soon as retinal detachment occurs, inflammatory and wound healing changes start. In animal models, photoreceptor apoptosis has been shown to occur as early as 12 hours after retinal detachment, followed by extensive remodelling with functional and morphological changes eventually involving all retinal layers. Photoreceptor outer segments progressively degenerate, inner segments reorganise, rod and cone opsins are redistributed, and rod axons retract while cones undergo changes in shape. The longer the retina remains detached, the more extensive these changes become and the less likely there is to be complete or near complete recovery of visual function following surgical repair. Furthermore, the damage to cellular functions in fovea-off RRDs also affect other qualities of vision besides acuity, including contrast sensitivity, colour vision and stereopsis. Although the exact relationships between these RRD-induced changes in retinal anatomy and recoverable function are unclear, they appear to be time critical, with irrecoverable loss occurring within 24 hours.

Studies analysing the effect of the duration of loss of central vision (LCV) prior to surgery have shown a deleterious effect of duration on postoperative visual acuity. They have, however, broadly grouped duration of LCV into intervals of 0–2, 3–5 days, etc, with the uncertainty about the history of LCV, making a more detailed analysis of time periods unreliable. Several studies have demonstrated better visual outcome for RRDs with lower foveal detachment height. Since it is not possible to predict in an acute RRD if, and to what extent there will be further recruitment of subfoveal fluid, early surgery is required to minimise the duration and magnitude of foveal elevation.

### New optical coherence tomography grading system for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: how off is off? [^113FdatD]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Retinal surgeons need a more precise method for determining the best time for surgery. Knowing the exact extent of the subretinal fluid and time for the surgical intervention is crucial. One crucial factor in all these studies is that all patients with a fulminant progress of the retinal detachment had earlier consultations with an ophthalmologist than did patients with slow and shallow subretinal detachment, which may deeply affect visual outcome results.

This new uniform OCT grading system is standardised and could be useful for upcoming studies on retinal detachment to enable making between-study comparisons.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^114gKZNx]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Vitrectomy for diabetic retinal disease — persons with vitreous hemorrhage, traction retinal detachment, macular traction, or an epiretinal membrane should be referred to an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of diabetic retinal disease for possible vitrectomy. Evidence Quality is Grade B with Level of Confidence: Medium and Clinical Recommendation Strength: Recommendation, and "This recommendation should generally be followed, but remain alert for new information". Evidence statements indicate that vitrectomy performed for diabetic macular edema (DME) and vitreomacular traction has been shown to improve vision with a low surgical complication rate. Vitrectomy can reduce macular thickening and improve visual acuity in DME when the pre-operative acuity is < 20/80 and there is an epiretinal membrane or vitreoretinal adhesion; however, there is little evidence to support vitrectomy for DME in the absence of epiretinal membrane or vitreomacular traction, and there is no evidence to suggest a superiority of vitrectomy over laser in terms of functional outcomes. Potential benefits are preservation of vision, potential risks/harms are complications from vitrectomy surgery, benefits significantly outweigh harms, direct cost of treatment is a potential cost, the role of patient preferences is large, and gaps in evidence were none identified.

### Optic disk pit maculopathy: current management strategies [^116AhrnX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Optic disk pit (ODP) is a rare congenital abnormality of the optic nerve head and can lead to visual impairment when macular detachment occurred. Recent advances in retinal imaging brought new insights into the pathophysiology of the disease, while new therapeutic options have been also described.

Methods

We made a comprehensive search of the literature regarding the current treatment modalities for the treatment of ODP maculopathy.

Results

Although there have been reported some cases of spontaneous resolution, current management of ODP maculopathy involves several surgical approaches. The most commonly used treatment alternative for ODP maculopathy management is vitrectomy, either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities, such as gas tamponade or laser photocoagulation. Other options, such as scleral buckling and inner fenestration, are also used, based on the recent findings about pathophysiology of the disease.

Conclusion

The management of ODP maculopathy remains challenging. Even though there are further advances in the understanding of the disease pathophysiology, the applied treatment is not single and therapeutic modalities differ in the success rate, related to the anatomical and functional results.

### Natural history of asymptomatic clinical retinal detachments [^1144Mg1e]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the natural history of asymptomatic, clinical rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

Design

Single observer, prospective, consecutive, observational case series.

Methods

Consecutive patients were included who were referred to the author's clinical practice with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment extending greater than two disk-diameters posterior to the equator. Patients whose eye had an intraocular procedure within the past year or who had a history of symptomatic retinal detachment in the fellow eye were excluded. Eighteen eyes of 16 patients were followed for an average of 46 months. The main outcome measure was progression of asymptomatic retinal detachment to symptomatic retinal detachment.

Results

None of the 18 asymptomatic, clinical, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments became symptomatic. The posterior margin of one retinal detachment slightly progressed 4 months into the study and then stabilized for 4 years and remained asymptomatic.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic, clinical, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments can probably be safely observed for many years.

### Long-term outcomes in patients undergoing vitrectomy for retinal detachment due to viral retinitis [^111T73TE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is common in viral retinitis, occurring in 20%–75% of eyes, with resultant poor visual outcomes.–RRD usually occurs after the acute phase of infection, and is secondary to vitreous traction on necrotic retina and inflammatory membranes. The role of prophylactic laser photocoagulation to prevent RRD is unclear, and the optimal approach to vitrectomy for RRD remains difficult to ascertain. In recent years, surgical instrumentation and antiviral regimens have changed dramatically, and there is no single treatment strategy that has been identified as the standard of care. Moreover, no variables have been identified to be predictive of surgical success for RRD or prognostic of visual outcomes. This study investigated the long-term visual and anatomic outcomes in cases with RRD secondary to viral retinitis to determine effective medical treatment and surgical approaches in this challenging group of patients.

Optimising outcomes in macula-off RRD

Timing

Acute progressive macula-on RRD continues to be managed as a VR emergency, requiring urgent referral and intervention. Macula-off RRD, presenting acutely (1 day) is also increasingly considered a VR emergency, given the potential for good post-operative vision and the risk of permanent visual loss.

Early wisdom regarding the optimal timing of surgical intervention in macula-off RRD suggested that undergoing surgery at any time between day 1 and day seven following symptom onset had no effect on final BCVA. However, a retrospective study by Williamson et al evaluated 325 patients with macula-off RRD and found that median final BCVA was 6/9 independently of symptom duration (recorded from day 1 to ≥ 21 days). Notably, they showed that surgery at any time between days 1 and 3 after symptom onset produced equivalent visual outcomes, nevertheless surgery on day 4–6 conferred worse vision. Hence, it seems that outcomes in macula-off RRD could be improved with more urgent intervention.

Postoperative posturing

By using fundus autofluorescence, retinal displacement has been demonstrated to occur following PPV for RRD. It has been suggested that some of the metamorphopsia after otherwise successful reattachment surgery may be secondary to retinal displacement. Research continues to better elucidate variables surrounding the aetiology of the displacement, with studies of immediate postoperative positioning regimens and types of tamponade agents used. Current evidence proposes that early postoperative face-down positioning may help minimise retinal displacememt. In a study of 86 patients, Shiragami et al showed that retinal displacement was greater in patients that adopted a face-down position 10 min after PPV, as opposed to immediately following surgery; 64% (28/44) and 24% (10/42), respectively. Casswell et al compared retinal displacement in patients positioned either face-down or 'supporting-the-break' (positioned such that the retinal break is uppermost in order to allow the floating gas to remain in contact with the break), and reported retinal displacement in 42% and 58%, respectively. Although there was no statistical difference in subjective distortion, there was a significant and clinically relevant improvement in binocular diplopia, suggesting that immediate face down positioning for at least a few hours could improve results.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^115hyNfL]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal break treatment approach — The goal of treatment is to create a chorioretinal adhesion around the retinal tear using cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation to halt progression of subretinal fluid. Treatment of peripheral horseshoe tears should be extended to the ora serrata if the tear cannot be surrounded with laser or cryotherapy, and failure often results from inadequate treatment at the anterior border. Continued vitreous traction may extend the tear and cause a clinical rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Treatment of dialyses must extend over the entire length, reaching the ora serrata beyond each horn or end.

### Topical difluprednate for the treatment of harada's disease [^113MUPfR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The standard of care for initial therapy for VKH is an aggressive course of oral corticosteroids. Our three cases demonstrate the resolution of ocular manifestations of VKH including serous detachments and AC inflammation with topical difluprednate alone. Topical difluprednate has been shown to have minimal systemic absorption, and its use can avoid the common complications associated with oral steroid use. Given the high potency and noninvasive nature of therapy, treatment with difluprednate should be considered a suitable treatment option for uveitic symptoms and serous detachments associated with VKH in the absence of neurological and cutaneous manifestations.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^113yEDGX]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal tear treatment follow-up — if the chorioretinal adhesion appears satisfactory, the first follow-up visit after treatment is at 1 to 2 weeks, and indirect ophthalmoscopy and scleral depression at 2 to 6 weeks will determine the adequacy of the chorioretinal scar, especially around the anterior boundary of the tear. If the tear and the accompanying subretinal fluid are not completely surrounded by the chorioretinal scar, additional treatment should be administered, and at any postoperative visit, additional treatment should be considered if subretinal fluid has accumulated beyond the edge of treatment. Even when a patient has had adequate treatment, additional examinations are important, and between 5% and 14% of patients found to have an initial retinal break will develop additional breaks during long-term follow-up; new breaks may be particularly likely in eyes that have had cataract surgery.

### Ocular point-of-care ultrasonography to diagnose posterior chamber abnormalities: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wkeEs]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Confidence in the estimate of diagnostic accuracy for retinal detachment is bolstered by narrow 95% CIs resulting from the inclusion of several studies and the fact that the results were essentially unchanged when only studies with low risk of bias were included. Retinal detachment must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute visual conditions because of the time sensitivity of the diagnosis. Retinal detachment is uncommon, with an incidence of about 10 cases per 100 000 population per year. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type of retinal detachment, and it occurs when a tear or break in the retina allows vitreous fluid to flow into the subretinal space, causing separation of the neurosensory retina. Symptoms often consist of flashing lights, floaters, or loss of central or peripheral vision. The time sensitivity is associated with the potential for further invasion of vitreous fluid into the subretinal space, lifting the retina, and leading to detachment of the macula and irreversible vision loss. Our results should give EPs confidence that negative POCUS findings substantially decrease the pretest probability of retinal detachment and can be used to minimize the potential for a missed retinal detachment. It should be noted that POCUS for retinal tears has poor sensitivity (47.8%), which is on the same spectrum as that for retinal detachment; however, a tear or hole may occur before the neurosensory retina substantially lifts away or detaches from the retinal pigment epithelium. As a result, timely ophthalmology follow-up should be encouraged if POCUS demonstrates no retinal detachment, because the prevalence of retinal tear is 14% among patients with acute onset of floaters or flashes.

MGS combined with retinal detachment can be managed through various surgical approaches. This article reviews specific case studies involving surgical methods such as vitrectomy combined with paraoptic disc laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy alone, simple paraoptic disc laser photocoagulation, and paraoptic disc laser photocoagulation aimed at preventing retinal detachment. The advantages and disadvantages of each surgical method are discussed, with a focus on whether they are performed in conjunction with retinal tears (Table 1). For cases involving multiple surgical interventions, classification is based on the final surgical procedure or the innovative aspects of the surgical approach.

### Simple retinal detachments: identifying the at-risk case [^1135jdss]. Eye (2002). Low credibility.

The success rate of retinal reattachment surgery has now reached over 90%. The major cause of failure is attributable to the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). It is a complex process comprised of events that are similar to those of the wound healing response with inflammation, migration and proliferation of a variety of cells. These membranes can exert traction and reopen previously closed retinal breaks, create new breaks, and distort or obscure the macula. In the early part of this century the success rate of retinal reattachment surgery was virtually nil and it was not until a better understanding of the pathophysiology of retinal detachment was gained that the success rate improved. It was Gonin who emphasised the relationship between vitreous detachment and traction resulting in retinal tears that led to treatment aimed at closing retinal breaks. To increase even further the final success rate in the treatment of 'simple retinal detachments' a better understanding of the risk factors for PVR is needed in patients presenting with acute retinal detachments. Such risk factors can be broadly divided under the headings of preoperative risk factors, best surgical management and possibly adjuvant therapy.

### Pneumatic retinopexy versus scleral buckle for repairing simple rhegmatogenous retinal detachments [^115Lnk7e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium caused by a full-thickness break associated with vitreous traction. While pneumatic retinopexy (PR), scleral buckle (SB), and vitrectomy are all well-received surgical interventions for eyes with RRD, their relative effectiveness has remained controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of PR versus SB or PR versus a combination treatment of SB and vitrectomy for people with RRD and to summarize any data on economic measures and quality of life.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 3); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; and four other databases on 11 March 2021. We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of PR versus SB (with or without vitrectomy) for eyes with RRD.

Data Collection and Analysis

After screening for eligibility, two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, methods, and outcomes. We followed systematic review standards as set by Cochrane.

Main Results

In this update, we identified and included one new randomized controlled trial. Together with two trials from the 2015 version of the review, we included three trials (276 eyes of 274 participants) comparing the effectiveness of PR versus SB. None compared PR versus a combined treatment of SB and vitrectomy. Of the three trials, one was a small study (published in 1996) with 20 participants (20 eyes) enrolled in Ireland and followed for a mean of 16 months; the second (published in 1989) included 196 participants (198 eyes) in the US followed for at least six months, and the third (published in 2021) was conducted in Italy and enrolled 58 participants (58 eyes) with a follow-up of 12 months. Overall, poor reporting quality resulted in unclear or high risks of bias. We found low-certainty evidence that PR may achieve retinal reattachment slightly less often than SB (risk ratio [RR] 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 to 1.02; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 276 eyes). Eyes undergoing PR may also display a higher risk of recurrent retinal detachment (low-certainty evidence), but the RR estimates were very imprecise (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.98; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 276 eyes). All three studies described the final visual acuity (VA) after the two procedures. However, the results were reported using different metrics and could not be combined. One study (196 participants) reported the proportion of eyes with a final VA of 20/40 or greater and favored PR (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.65; low-certainty evidence), whereas in the 2021 study, both groups showed an improvement in final VA and there was no evidence of a difference between the two (mean difference [MD] -0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.19; low-certainty evidence). No study reported data on quality of life or economic measures. Postoperative safety outcomes generally favored PR versus SB (low/very low-certainty evidence); however, there was considerable uncertainty regarding the risk of any operative ocular adverse events (RR 0.55 CI 0.28 to 1.11; 276 eyes), glaucoma (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.46; 198 eyes), macular pucker (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.11; 256 eyes), proliferative vitreoretinopathy (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.96; 276 eyes), and persistent diplopia (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.09; 256 eyes). Eyes undergoing PR experienced fewer postoperative cataract developments (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.75; 153 eyes), choroidal detachments (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.57; 198 eyes), and myopic shift (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10; 256 eyes).

Authors' Conclusions

The current update confirms the findings of the previous review. PR may result in lower rates of reattachment and higher rates of recurrence than SB, but carries a lower burden of postoperative complications. The effects of these two procedures on other functional outcomes and quality of life remain uncertain. The available evidence remains insufficient and of low quality.
