## Question

Shortness of breath and pericardial effusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage shortness of breath when a pericardial effusion is suspected. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and hemodynamic assessment. Then, I should verify the focused history and exam to raise pretest probability. Next, I will review first-line diagnostics, especially point-of-care ultrasound and echocardiography. After that, I need to check for tamponade physiology and quantify the effusion. Then, I will consider the differential diagnosis and targeted testing. Finally, I will outline management pathways, including pericardiocentesis, etiologic therapy, and follow-up, while highlighting special populations and pitfalls to avoid missteps.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first minutes: airway, breathing, and circulation with continuous monitoring, IV access, and supplemental oxygen as needed, because tamponade can deteriorate rapidly and delay to drainage worsens outcomes. I should also obtain a 12-lead ECG early to look for low voltage, electrical alternans, or PR-segment changes that heighten suspicion for large effusion or pericarditis, and I need to remember that Beck's triad is specific but insensitive, so its absence does not exclude tamponade [^1153YMBy] [^113WHRX1] [^116tgjPz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the focused history next: onset and tempo of dyspnea, positional chest pain, fever, recent infections, malignancy, autoimmune disease, chest trauma or surgery, anticoagulation, dialysis, and medications such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors or cabergoline, because these factors shift the differential and urgency. On exam, I will look for tachycardia, tachypnea, elevated JVP, pulsus paradoxus, muffled heart sounds, hypotension, peripheral edema, and signs of systemic disease, keeping in mind that dyspnea is present in most tamponade cases and that pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg meaningfully increases the likelihood of tamponade [^116tgjPz] [^112ExSqK] [^113cSPmU].

> I will now examine the first-line diagnostics. Point-of-care ultrasound is my immediate test because it can detect pericardial effusion with high specificity and narrows the differential quickly, and if POCUS is unavailable, bedside echocardiography should be obtained urgently. I should double-check for mimics like pleural effusion or epicardial fat pad, and I need to ensure I assess for tamponade signs such as right atrial collapse in systole, right ventricular diastolic collapse, IVC plethora with minimal respiratory variation, and exaggerated respiratory inflow variation, while remembering that a normal thoracic ultrasound makes a routine chest radiograph low yield in this context [^117Y6jfL] [^115GpgT9] [^1114eNnt] [^1169vZRZ].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic impact rather than just the size. The rate of fluid accumulation matters more than absolute volume, so a rapidly accumulating moderate effusion can cause tamponade while a very large chronic effusion may be tolerated. I should quantify the effusion on echo using standard size categories and correlate with clinical and Doppler signs, and I must not overcall tamponade solely on the presence of an effusion without supportive echocardiographic and clinical features [^1151wVFV] [^1169vZRZ] [^1114eNnt].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis systematically: idiopathic or viral pericarditis, malignancy including lung, breast, lymphoma, and primary cardiac tumors, autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, infectious etiologies including TB and bacterial pericarditis, iatrogenic causes such as post-cardiac injury syndrome and procedural complications, metabolic causes like hypothyroidism, and medication-induced effusions from TKIs or cabergoline. I need to ensure I tailor the workup to pretest probability and local epidemiology, especially TB prevalence [^1169vZRZ] [^1127jpB3] [^115eChPD] [^116oEKWt] [^1128aF75] [^116i5H7q] [^113cSPmU].

> I should confirm the targeted laboratory and adjunctive testing strategy: CBC, renal and liver function, inflammatory markers, and thyroid function are foundational. If malignancy is suspected, I will send pericardial fluid cytology and consider tumor markers. If TB is on the table, I will obtain ADA, interferon-gamma, and consider GeneXpert on fluid. If infection is suspected, I will culture blood and pericardial fluid. And if autoimmune disease is suspected, I will order ANA, RF, and complement levels, recognizing that fluid analysis is pivotal when the etiology remains unclear [^111nNqae] [^116oEKWt] [^115eChPD].

> Let me think about imaging escalation. If echocardiography is inconclusive or if I need to define pericardial thickness, masses, or loculations, cardiac CT or CMR can clarify constrictive physiology, calcification, or neoplastic involvement, and in suspected malignant disease, PET/CT may help identify metabolically active pericardium or masses. I should double-check guideline indications before ordering advanced imaging to avoid delays in care [^1125wSKk] [^114jHsEc].

> Now, I need to ensure management aligns with hemodynamic status. For unstable patients with tamponade, emergent echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis is indicated to restore cardiac output, and I should be prepared to manage complications such as pericardial decompression syndrome in predisposed patients. For stable patients with large or symptomatic effusions, I should consider diagnostic and therapeutic drainage, and in malignant effusions I should plan extended catheter drainage to reduce recurrence and obtain cytology to guide oncology care [^1153YMBy] [^115jmvbL] [^116JqjMi] [^111nNqae].

> But wait, what if the effusion is small and the patient is stable? In that scenario, I should confirm that observation with close follow-up and anti-inflammatory therapy is appropriate, reserving drainage for progression or diagnostic uncertainty. I need to ensure I counsel patients on red flags such as worsening dyspnea, chest pressure, syncope, or new edema that would prompt urgent reassessment [^111qQ9VF] [^1169vZRZ].

> I will now examine etiologic therapy because preventing recurrence depends on treating the cause. For viral or idiopathic pericarditis, NSAIDs and colchicine are first-line. For malignant effusions, I should coordinate systemic antineoplastic therapy and consider intrapericardial treatment if refractory. For TB pericarditis, I should initiate anti-tuberculous therapy. For autoimmune pericarditis, immunosuppression may be required. And for drug-induced effusions, I must hold the offending agent, such as TKIs or cabergoline, and monitor for resolution [^112nxU4w] [^111RcVmS] [^112U1go8] [^113cSPmU] [^115h7Rxx].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and procedural nuances. In cancer patients with thrombocytopenia, I should favor a lateral approach with echo guidance and consider platelet transfusion thresholds based on local protocols. In postoperative or loculated effusions, fluoroscopic or CT guidance improves safety. In children, shortness of breath is the most common symptom and tamponade can occur even with moderate effusions, so a lower threshold for drainage is reasonable. And in patients with chest trauma, I must remember that tamponade can present weeks later, so delayed suspicion is warranted [^116wVpfA] [^1153YMBy] [^112p9m7U] [^115qkSQa].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked a pitfall. I should not equate any pericardial effusion on POCUS with tamponade, and I should avoid unnecessary pericardiocentesis in the absence of hemodynamic compromise or clear diagnostic need. Integrating clinical findings, ECG, and echocardiography reduces misdiagnosis and prevents overuse of invasive procedures [^1114eNnt] [^112yLtvs].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and surveillance are explicit. After drainage, I should repeat echocardiography within 24 to 48 hours to assess reaccumulation, monitor inflammatory markers if pericarditis is suspected, and arrange cardiology follow-up. In idiopathic or large effusions, I should consider the risk of effusive-constrictive physiology and plan interval imaging, and in malignant effusions, I should coordinate oncology care and consider preventive strategies such as pericardial window or intrapericardial therapy to mitigate recurrence [^111qQ9VF] [^111Ln676] [^112U1go8].

Shortness of breath in pericardial effusion is caused by **impaired ventricular filling** [^1153YMBy] from pericardial fluid, leading to reduced cardiac output and pulmonary congestion. The severity correlates with the **rate of fluid accumulation** [^1151wVFV] and the presence of tamponade physiology, not just the absolute volume [^11728aK9]. Dyspnea is the **most common symptom** [^116tgjPz], often accompanied by orthopnea, chest pain, and signs of tamponade (hypotension, elevated JVP, muffled heart sounds) [^1153YMBy]. Prompt echocardiography [^111qQ9VF] is essential to confirm the effusion and assess hemodynamic impact; management ranges from observation for small, stable effusions to urgent pericardiocentesis [^11728aK9] for tamponade or large symptomatic effusions, with treatment of the underlying cause to prevent recurrence [^112ExSqK].

## Pathophysiology of shortness of breath in pericardial effusion

Shortness of breath in pericardial effusion arises from **several interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Reduced cardiac output**: Fluid in the pericardial sac compresses the heart, limiting ventricular filling and reducing stroke volume and cardiac output, causing dyspnea and fatigue [^1153YMBy].

- **Pulmonary congestion**: Reduced cardiac output leads to pulmonary venous hypertension and interstitial edema, increasing airway resistance and causing dyspnea and orthopnea [^notfound].

- **Tamponade physiology**: Rapid accumulation causes a precipitous drop in cardiac output with severe dyspnea, orthopnea, and signs of shock [^1153YMBy].

- **Ventricular interdependence**: Elevated intrapericardial pressure causes septal shift and exaggerated respiratory variation in venous return, worsening dyspnea [^116FhqfN].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Patients with pericardial effusion typically present with the following **symptoms**:

| **Symptom** | **Frequency** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Shortness of breath (dyspnea) | Very common (87–89%) | Progressive, worsens with exertion or lying flat (orthopnea) [^116tgjPz] |
| Chest pain | Common | - Pleuritic <br/> - Often relieved by sitting forward <br/> - May be absent in large effusions [^113HNagn] |
| Fatigue and weakness | Common | Due to reduced cardiac output and perfusion [^112ExSqK] |
| Orthopnea | Common | Difficulty breathing when lying flat [^1153YMBy] |
| Palpitations | Common | Due to compensatory tachycardia [^112ExSqK] |
| Cough | Less common | Non-productive, due to pulmonary congestion [^112ExSqK] |

---

## Physical examination findings

Physical examination may reveal the following **signs**, with severity related to effusion size and rate of accumulation:

- **Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)**: Common in tamponade, reflecting impaired venous return [^116tgjPz].

- **Pulsus paradoxus**: Systolic BP drop > 10 mmHg with inspiration; highly suggestive of tamponade [^116tgjPz].

- **Muffled heart sounds**: Due to fluid dampening cardiac sounds [^1153YMBy].

- **Hypotension and tachycardia**: Late signs of tamponade and hemodynamic compromise [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Prompt and accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment, imaging, and laboratory tests**:

- **Echocardiography**: Gold standard; defines effusion size, location, and hemodynamic impact; detects tamponade signs (RA/RV collapse, IVC plethora, exaggerated respiratory inflow variation) [^1169vZRZ] [^1114eNnt].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: May show low voltage, electrical alternans, or PR-segment depression [^113WHRX1].

- **Chest radiography**: Enlarged cardiac silhouette ("water bottle" sign) in large effusions [^116tgjPz].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), renal function, thyroid function, and specific tests based on suspected etiology (e.g. autoimmune, infectious, malignant) [^115ZHtXH].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **effusion size, hemodynamic impact, and underlying cause**:

- **Observation and medical management**: Small, asymptomatic effusions may be observed with treatment of the underlying cause (e.g. NSAIDs, colchicine for pericarditis; thyroid hormone for hypothyroidism) [^11728aK9].

- **Pericardiocentesis**: Indicated for tamponade, large symptomatic effusions, or diagnostic purposes. Echocardiographic guidance is essential [^117XiCmC].

- **Pericardial window or pericardiectomy**: Considered for recurrent or loculated effusions, especially malignant or purulent effusions [^112ExSqK].

- **Treatment of underlying cause**: Address malignancy, infection, autoimmune disease, or iatrogenic causes to prevent recurrence [^111RcVmS].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with **etiology, effusion size, and treatment timeliness**. Complications include **cardiac tamponade** — a life-threatening emergency with hemodynamic collapse [^1153YMBy] — and **constrictive pericarditis**, which may develop after large or chronic effusions and cause persistent dyspnea and right heart failure [^111Ln676] [^114jHsEc]. Recurrent effusions are common with malignancy, autoimmune disease, or inadequate treatment of the cause [^116JqjMi].

---

Shortness of breath in pericardial effusion reflects impaired ventricular filling and reduced cardiac output, with severity driven by the rate of fluid accumulation and tamponade physiology. Prompt echocardiography [^115GpgT9] and targeted management — ranging from observation to urgent drainage — are essential to relieve symptoms and prevent complications [^112ExSqK].

The patient's hematocrit and hemoglobin levels should be assessed to rule out bleeding and hemolysis as causes of shortness of breath. Patients with LVADs take anticoagulation medications and have a bleeding diathesis in addition to the risk of hemolysis from the device–blood interaction.

Reduced CO may also cause shortness of breath. Cardiogenic Shock needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis. These patients may also have co-existent hypotension (see the " Shock " section below for the approach to management of this condition).

The patient should be intubated for mechanical ventilation when hypoxia, hypercarbia, or acidosis worsens or when the airway cannot be protected. Rapid sequence intubation should be performed. Any anesthetic induction agent can be considered, although etomidate or a narcotic and benzodiazepine combination like fentanyl plus midazolam is often preferred. Lung-protective ventilation strategies which include a low tidal volume (V) and adequate PEEP should be used. A very high PEEP can cause worsening of RV dysfunction and should be avoided. Therapeutic management may include draining a pleural effusion, inserting a chest tube for pneumothorax, performing a bronchoscopy procedure, and optimizing hemodynamics.

### An atypical case of rheumatoid arthritis serositis [^115eChPD]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key message
For RA patients presenting with complex pericardial effusions, tuberculosis should be considered as an important differential, with challenges surrounding diagnosis and management making multidisciplinary input essential. RA, the commonest form of inflammatory arthritis, can have extraarticular manifestations, including serositis. With disease-modifying treatment as a risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) infection, this report expands on differentiating between inflammatory, infective and malignant causes of serositis, with a particular focus on RA serositis and tuberculous pericarditis to guide multidisciplinary management. We present the case of a 36-year-old female with a complex, loculated pericardial effusion, progressing to constrictive pericarditis and concurrent pleural effusions on the background of a potential TB contact.

The patient was admitted from clinic following CT evidence of pericardial and right-sided pleural effusions during investigation for a 9-month history of chronic, dry cough. There had been no previous extraarticular manifestations since the diagnosis of seropositive (RF 73 IU/ml, anti-CCP 231 IU/ml) RA 8 years ago, well-controlled on methotrexate and etanercept, withheld on admission with potentially infective causes in mind. Prior to commencing anti-TNFα therapy, the patient had TB screening and a normal interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). She presented non-specifically with dyspnoea, lethargy, loss of appetite and mild weight loss, with clinical features suggestive of right-sided heart failure, including peripheral oedema, liver congestion, ascites, elevated jugular venous pulse, along with reduced breath sounds over the right lung base. The patient was haemodynamically stable and commenced on diuretic treatment.

### Management of a patient with pericardial decompression syndrome and HOCM [^115jmvbL]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 44-year-old man, with a history of arterial hypertension, was referred with increasing shortness of breath due to a large pericardial effusion and imminent tamponade. Emergency ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis resulted in the rapid withdrawal of 2760cc of serous fluid. 3hours later, the patient developed acute pulmonary oedema, which was successfully treated. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was later diagnosed and malignancy was excluded as a cause of the effusion. Clinicians performing pericardiocentesis need to be aware of pericardial decompression syndrome (PDS), a rare but serious complication. Although the underlying mechanisms causing PDS are not fully understood, patients with high left ventricular (LV) filling pressures are at particular risk. In other words: diastolic dysfunction of the LV is a risk factor for the occurrence of PDS.

### Extramedullary haematopoiesis presenting with cardiac tamponade in a patient with polycythaemia vera [^115b4qHB]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old man with a history of polycythaemia vera, diagnosed 4 years ago, presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath. A bedside echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with features concerning for pericardial tamponade. A left anterior thoracotomy and a pericardial window were emergently performed in the operating room and relieved the patient's symptoms. Histology evaluation of the pericardial fragments and pericardial fluid revealed the presence of trilineage haematopoietic elements without any increase in the blasts. A bone marrow core biopsy revealed an increase in reticulin fibre and increase in the number of blasts of 5%-10%, whereas peripheral blood testing was positive for JAK2 V617F mutation. This case report reviews the literature for cases of extramedullary haematopoiesis associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

We describe the case of a 60-year-old man with prior rotational atherectomy and drug-eluting stent to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) who presented with shortness of breath and chest pain 8 weeks after stent placement. Further workup revealed a large pericardial effusion with gram stain positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Subsequently, this was shown to be related to an aneurysm at the site of the prior LAD stent. This case demonstrated coronary stent infection with mycotic aneurysm and purulent pericardial effusion as an extremely rare but serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Misconceptions and facts about pericardial effusion and tamponade [^112yLtvs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Several common misconceptions can make the clinical diagnosis of subacute pericardial tamponade challenging. Widely known physical findings of pericardial tamponade lack sensitivity and specificity. Interpretation of echocardiographic signs requires good understanding of pathophysiology. Over-reliance on echocardiography may result in over-utilization of pericardial drainage procedures. Awareness of these misconceptions with an integrative approach to both clinical and imaging data will help clinicians to assess the hemodynamic impact of pericardial effusion and the need for drainage.

### A rare cause of constrictive pericarditis [^117RLqik]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 67-year-old man presented with 3months of exertional dyspnoea and 1week of oedema. Examination revealed elevated neck veins, pulsus paradoxus, muffled heart sounds, decreased breath sounds and pedal oedema. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated cardiac tamponade, and chest X-ray showed pleural effusion. Pericardiocentesis, thoracocentesis, laboratory investigations and CT did not elucidate an underlying aetiology. Three weeks later, he presented with recurrent cardiac tamponade and pleural effusion. Pericardial window histology was benign. Pleural and pericardial fluids were again unrevealing. Three months later, he presented with worsening congestive heart failure. TTE, cardiac catheterisation and cardiac MRI were consistent with constrictive pericarditis. Preoperative workup did not identify an underlying cause. The patient underwent subtotal pericardiectomy. Intraoperative frozen section indicated malignancy. Pathology confirmed metastatic poorly differentiated signet ring adenocarcinoma of intestinal origin. He died 4days postoperatively from multiorgan failure.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^1173q7BV]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Over 1 million patients develop a pleural effusion annually in the United States alone. Pleural effusions have more than 60 different causes, and vary in size and risk (and rates) of recurrence. Congestive heart failure (CHF), malignancy, pulmonary infection and embolism account for over 90% of pleural effusions.

Pleural effusions can impact profoundly on the cardiorespiratory system. Breathlessness, the commonest presentation, is often debilitating and significantly impairs quality of life. Relief of breathlessness often necessitates therapeutic pleural interventions with associated discomfort, risks of infection, bleeding, pneumothorax and even death. Management of pleural effusions represents a significant healthcare burden worldwide.

To date, research on, and hence our understanding of, the effects of pleural effusions on respiratory physiology and breathlessness has been limited. The conventional belief that pleural effusions cause breathlessness through compression of the lung is overly simplistic. The severity of breathlessness often correlates poorly with the size of the effusion Conversely, symptom reduction from fluid drainage varies significantly between patients, and no reliable predictors exist to identify those who will benefit. Most previous studies have involved small cohorts and examined specific etiological factors in isolation; few have compared physiological changes with symptom benefits in patients.

This article reviews published literature on the pathophysiological effects of pleural effusions (and their therapeutic evacuation). Key knowledge gaps are highlighted which may guide future research.

Lyme carditis — criteria for hospitalization and monitoring: In patients with or at risk of severe cardiac complications of Lyme disease including those with significant PR prolongation (PR > 300 milliseconds), other arrhythmias, or clinical manifestations of myopericarditis, we recommend hospital admission with continuous ECG monitoring (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence); clinical manifestations of Lyme carditis include exercise intolerance, palpitations, presyncope, syncope, pericarditic pain, evidence of pericardial effusion, elevated biomarkers (such as troponin), edema, and shortness of breath.

### Spontaneous secondary pneumothorax with concomitant malignant pericardial effusion in the context of metastatic synovial sarcoma [^117UyYY1]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient was admitted to the medical ward prior to being transferred to another facility where he underwent a surgical pericardial window and had 950 mL of fluid drained. Just prior to the procedure, the pericardial effusion was confirmed via a formal echocardiogram which demonstrated severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, right ventricular diastolic free wall collapse and moderate to large sized pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade.

After the procedure, the patient was then transferred back to the medical ward. However, days after he became acutely short of breath due to a newly developing right malignant pleural effusion detected on CT. The patient subsequently underwent a right intercostal catheter insertion via pigtail insertion but continued to be symptomatic after the procedure. He was subsequently referred to the palliative care unit. During his stay in the palliative care unit, the patient went to the toilet and collapsed suddenly. He was pronounced deceased at the scene. Up until his last moment, he was comfortable with anxiolytics and analgesics.

### Delayed presentation of pericardial tamponade following blunt chest trauma [^115qkSQa]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present a case of delayed-onset pericardial tamponade nineweeks after a blunt chest trauma. The patient is a 77-year-old man who presented with shortness of breath nineweeks after fracturing his sternum in a head-on motor vehicle collision. CT and echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion prompting pericardiocentesis. Eight hundred millilitres (mL) of fluid were drained, which rapidly improved his symptoms. This is the longest reported interval between the development of tamponade and a blunt chest trauma. Our case illustrates the importance of maintaining a clinical suspicion for effusion and tamponade even weeks after non-penetrating chest wall injuries.

### Associated pleural and pericardial effusions: an extensive differential explored [^111URRzh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Concurrent pleural and pericardial effusions are not an unusual finding, but their differential diagnosis remains uncertain. Medline-based review identified an extensive list of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and myriad other etiologies. A single retrospective study had addressed this presentation. Several principles of a diagnostic workup are suggested, acknowledging that a significant minority of patients may not require a comprehensive workup and remain 'idiopathic'.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of pericarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1169vZRZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pericardial effusion — definition, causes, imaging goals, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) size grading: Pericardial effusion is defined by the accumulation of > 50 mL of fluid in the pericardial space. Approximately one-half of pericardial effusions are idiopathic; in North America and Western Europe, postviral infection is the most common identifiable cause, whereas tuberculosis is the most common cause in places where it is endemic. The objectives of imaging pericardial effusions are to support diagnosis, evaluate the size and location of the effusion, assess its hemodynamic impact, and inform decisions regarding drainage, if indicated, and TTE is the first-line imaging investigation. Echocardiographic size categories are: trivial (< 1.0 cm and not visualized throughout cardiac cycle), small (< 1.0 cm), moderate (1.0–1.9 cm), large (2.0–2.5 cm), and very large (> 2.5 cm). Common mimickers on echocardiography include a left pleural effusion and an epicardial fat pad that has a heterogenous echodensity, moves with the myocardium, and is often located anterior to the right ventricle.

Pericardial reserve volume and pressure–volume relations — The pericardial sac has a small pericardial reserve volume of approximately < 50 mL, which is adequate to allow increased right heart filling with normal inspiration without increased pericardial restraint and right heart chamber pressures. With marked swings in intrathoracic pressures due to acute dyspnea, right heart filling during inspiration can exceed this reserve volume, causing pericardial constraint and increased cardiac pressures; this overfilling may decrease left heart filling through ventricular interdependence, interactions that occur chiefly in diastole due to the inelastic parietal pericardium.

### BRIPPED scan for evaluation of ED patients with shortness of breath [^115x6bJK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The BRIPPED scan is an ultrasound evaluation of pulmonary B-lines, right ventricle size, inferior vena cava collapsibility, pleural and pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, left ventricle ejection fraction, and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. The primary goal was to evaluate the effect of the BRIPPED scan on the physician's list of differential diagnoses for patients presenting with shortness of breath.

Methods

This prospective randomized control trial was performed on patients presenting to the emergency department with shortness of breath. Primary data analysis was performed using an ordinal quasi-symmetry model to compare the magnitude of change in the differential diagnoses between 2 groups. Secondary outcome measures included changes in physician orders or interventions, time to disposition, time to perform the BRIPPED scan, and the interrater reliability of the interpretation of the scan.

Results

A total of 104 patients and 24 physicians were enrolled in this study. Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to each cohort. Among the BRIPPED cohort, there was significant movement of likelihood for several etiologies of shortness of breath on the physician differential. There was no significance in the change of differential diagnosis between the BRIPPED and control cohorts. The average (SD) time to perform the scan was 5.7 (1.3) minutes (95% confidence interval, 5.4–6 minutes).

Conclusion

The BRIPPED scan is a rapid ultrasound evaluation of shortness of breath in the emergency department. BRIPPED influenced physician differential diagnoses to the same degree as laboratory and radiographic testing. BRIPPED did not alter the final diagnosis in this patient population.

### Pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade in a 10-year-old male [^1154rH2H]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 10-year-old male with a past medical history of premature pubarche, mild persistent asthma, and eczema presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and chest pain. On examination, he was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and scattered atelectasis. Echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU for pericardiocentesis and drain placement. As he later became hypertensive and febrile, we will discuss how our patient's hospital course guided our differential diagnosis and how we arrived at a definitive diagnosis using a multidisciplinary approach.

### Metastatic involvement of the heart and pericardium: CT and MR imaging [^1127jpB3]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Metastases to the heart and pericardium are much more common than primary cardiac tumors and are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Tumors that are most likely to involve the heart and pericardium include cancers of the lung and breast, melanoma, and lymphoma. Tumor may involve the heart and pericardium by one of four pathways: retrograde lymphatic extension, hematogenous spread, direct contiguous extension, or transvenous extension. Metastatic involvement of the heart and pericardium may go unrecognized until autopsy. Impairment of cardiac function occurs in approximately 30% of patients and is usually attributable to pericardial effusion. The clinical presentation includes shortness of breath, which may be out of proportion to radiographic findings in patients with pericardial effusion or may be the result of associated pleural effusion. Patients may also present with cough, anterior thoracic pain, pleuritic chest pain, or peripheral edema. The differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion in a patient with known malignancy includes malignant pericardial effusion, radiation-induced pericarditis, drug-induced pericarditis, and idiopathic pericarditis. Any disease process that causes thickening or nodularity of the pericardium or myocardium or masses within the cardiac chambers can mimic metastatic disease.

### Rapid fire: pericardial effusion and tamponade [^114rZ3tu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

One of the most common causes of pericardial effusion in the Western world is malignancy. Emergency physicians must maintain vigilance in suspecting pericardial effusion and tamponade in patients with known or suspected malignancy who present with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypotension. Diagnosis can be expedited by key physical examination, electrocardiogram, and sonographic findings. Unstable or crashing patients with tamponade must undergo emergent pericardiocentesis for removal of fluid and pressure to restore cardiac output.

We present a case of 46-year-old male with no pertinent past medical history who presented to the emergency department with ongoing chest pain for 9 days associated with intermittent fevers and shortness of breath. On examination, the patient had a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and blood pressure of 143/72 mmHg. There were no audible murmurs or rubs on auscultation. He endorsed ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath.

The patient underwent contrast computed tomography (CT) angiography pulmonary embolism with pulmonary arterial phase timing that showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but demonstrated a moderate sized pericardial effusion with high density concerning for hemopericardium, along with an outpouching on the right atrial wall with a narrow neck concerning for a pseudoaneurysm (Fig. 1). Further workup, including lab work and an electrocardiogram, were unremarkable. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) redemonstrated the pericardial effusion and right atrial pseudoaneurysm (Fig. 2).

### Imatinib-induced pericardial effusion in a child [^111XzzFY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 12-year-old boy presented with central chest pain, shortness of breath and type 1 respiratory failure. He had a background of graft versus host disease (GvHD), which was currently managed with imatinib therapy. A focused bedside ultrasound scan was performed revealing a large pericardial effusion. The child was referred to a tertiary paediatric cardiology centre where he underwent emergency pericardiocentesis, draining a total of 800 mL of pericardial fluid. Fluid analysis excluded infection, and with no other concerns for a GvHD flare the diagnosis of an imatinib-induced pericardial effusion was made. On terminating the therapy, the pericardial collection did not reaccumulate. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced pericardial and/orpleural effusion should be considered as a differential diagnosis in paediatric patients on this therapy presenting in a similar manner.

### How to perform pericardiocentesis in cancer patients with thrombocytopenia: a single-center experience [^116wVpfA]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Subxiphoid vs Lateral Approach for Pericardiocentesis

Most common access sites for pericardiocentesis are the subxiphoid and lateral approaches. We favor lateral approach using the 7 cm "short" Cook micropuncture introducer set in emergent or urgent settings; if the patient is unstable, short of breath, thrombocytopenic, on anticoagulation, or has a history of abdominal surgery with scarring in subxiphoid area; or if the distance to pericardial space is more than 5–7 cm from the subxiphoid. We favor the subxiphoid approach if the distance from the echo probe to the subxiphoid space is < 5 cm, the patient has a history of breast reconstructive surgery, there is the presence of chest wall scarring from radiation or tumor involvement in the chest wall, there is an apically loculated pericardial effusion, the patient had previous left lung surgery, or there are large left sided tumors with displacement of the heart to the right, as illustrated in the access site decision making algorithm (Central Illustration).

### Chlamydia pneumoniae-associated pleuropericarditis: a case report and systematic review of the literature [^114ZuSGQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 40-year old female was transferred to our Department of Medicine for the assessment and treatment of pleuropericarditis following lower respiratory tract infection. Her body mass index was 25.7 kg/m² and her personal history was positive for current smoking (~ 10 cigarettes/day, 40 pack years) and arterial hypertension (occasional use of amlodipine 5 mg). The present history of the patient begins 5 weeks ago with a hospitalization in a Respiratory Department for CAP (fever, dyspnea, chest X-ray positive for consolidation on the left upper lobe; Additional File 1). The patient received ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin for 10 days without any medical report on causative pathogen. Four weeks after her discharge the patient presented with fever, shortness of breath especially in exertion and pleuritic chest pain and was admitted to a Respiratory Department where bilateral pleural (mainly left) and mild pericardial effusion were found. Pericardial friction rub was not identified. Her blood tests revealed increased neutrophils and indices of inflammation (Table 1, Additional File 1). Piperacillin/tazobactam and linezolid were initially administered. Thoracocentesis on the left side revealed neutrophilic exudate with pH 7.40. Despite antibiotic treatment, patient was not improved. Moreover C-reactive protein (CRP), pleural and pericardial effusions remained unchanged. Procalcitonin, high-sensitive troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels were within normal limits during hospitalization. Blood and sputum cultures were negative. Extensive rheumatological workup was negative. In electrocardiography sinus tachycardia (112 bpm), frequent premature ventricular contractions, periods of ventricular trigeminy and inverted T-wave in V1–V6 were observed. Echocardiography was positive for mild mitral and triscupid valve regurgitation and mild pericardial effusion, without any sign of hemodynamic decompensation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging (including CT pulmonary angiogram) did not reveal pulmonary embolism or pathological findings from lung parenchyma and was positive only for the presence of pleural and pericardial effusions (Additional File 1). Pulmonologists administered ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily with the indication of idiopathic pleuropericarditis. The patient presented allergic reaction to ibuprofen and was transferred to our Department of Medicine on day (D) 12. Upon her admission, the patient presented with diffuse maculo-papular rash that was attributed to the allergic reaction to ibuprofen. Ibuprofen was withdrawn and IV methylprednisolone 40 mg once daily was initiated. Antibiotic treatment was suspended due to the lack of evidence of bacterial infection. Due to sinus tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes metoprolol 25 mg twice daily was administered. Patient's file was reviewed and pericarditis investigation and differential diagnosis was conducted according to current guidelines. The patient fulfilled two out of four major criteria (pericardial chest pain and new pericardial effusion), along with one of the additional supporting findings (elevated CRP, white blood cells and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), rendering the diagnosis of pericarditis evidence-based. Colchicine 0.5 mg once daily (patient's weight 66 kg) was initiated, for the treatment of pericarditis under investigation. The patient presented clinical improvement and CRP dropped to nearly normal (Additional File 1). Methylprednisolone was stopped after 3 days, as it was administered to treat the allergic reaction to ibuprophen. Low grade fever and pleuritic chest pain recurred rapidly, along with rising CRP levels. A new chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion but this time mainly on the right side. A repeat thoracocentesis revealed neutrophilic exudate with pH 7.40 and in a new chest CT the only new finding was the reduction of the left pleural effusion in combination with the increase of the right sided pleural effusion. Empirical initiation of meropenem was decided (Additional File 1). Clinical and laboratory findings did not improve with the addition of antibiotics; thus, antibiotics were suspended due to lack of evidence in favor of a bacterial cause for the new fever and IV methylprednisolone 40 mg once daily was again initiated.

Blood flow restoration after intervention. Venography conducted through the catheter demonstrated restoration of blood flow in the SVC

However, one week after the intervention, the patient began experiencing worsening chest tightness and shortness of breath. Before hemodialysis, the blood pressure was measured at 120/95mmHg and heart rate at 110 beats per minute. However, after 3 h of dialysis with an ultrafiltration of 2200 ml, the patient suddenly developed hypotensive shock with a blood pressure of 84/60mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, heart rate of 168 beats per minute (showing atrial tachycardia on electrocardiogram), and oxygen saturation of 80% as measured by pulse oximetry. Following rescue efforts, a chest CT scan revealed pericardial effusion (Fig. 3). Approximately 600 mL of bloody fluid was drained through pericardiocentesis, which alleviated the patient's symptoms of cardiac tamponade. After excluding pericardial effusion caused by tumors or inflammation, we considered the newly developed hemorrhagic pericardial effusion to be related to the endovascular treatment. Eventually, the patient was discharged in good condition with proper functioning of the catheter. The patient has not experienced any recurrence of SVCS, and thus far, the catheter has continued to work well during follow-up visits. We recommended that the patient undergo another venous fistula surgery, but the patient has not agreed so far.

### Diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases [^116Vc5ab]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

The management of pericardial diseases is largely empirical because of the relative lack of randomized trials that involve patients with these conditions. A first attempt to bring together and organize current knowledge resulted in the publication of the first guidelines on the management of pericardial diseases. Nevertheless, a number of observational studies and the first randomized trials are moving the management of pericardial diseases towards evidence-based medicine, particularly for pericarditis. Emerging data indicate that management can be tailored to the individual patient and, although the optimal duration of treatment is not clearly established, some recommendations can be formulated to guide management and follow-up.

In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving the nilotinib dosage equivalent to DANZITEN 142 mg and 190 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions (including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites) or pulmonary edema, were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving the nilotinib dosage equivalent to the recommended dosage of DANZITEN 142 mg twice daily and 190 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.1% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions were severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 0.7% and 0.4% of patients receiving the nilotinib dosage equivalent to the recommended dosage of DANZITEN 142 mg and 190 mg twice daily, respectively, and in no patients receiving imatinib. Similar events were also observed in postmarketing reports. Monitor patients for signs of severe fluid retention (e.g., unexpected rapid weight gain or swelling) and for symptoms of respiratory or cardiac compromise (e.g., shortness of breath) during DANZITEN treatment; evaluate etiology and treat patients accordingly.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^112VeT6n]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pericardial effusions are primarily categorized into inflammatory and non-inflammatory cases. This classification and the severity of the conditions determine the therapeutic plan. An essential consideration in understanding the epidemiology of the disease is the geographical region and country of residence. Not all pericardial effusions require evaluation to determine the cause. In developed countries, they are mainly categorized as idiopathic, believed to be associated with temporary viral infections. The second and third most common reasons are diagnosed diseases and malignancies. Conversely, in developing countries, tuberculosis remains the primary cause of the disease. These epidemiological factors can assist health decision-makers in approaching disease prevention and treatment. On a smaller scale, they empower physicians to make informed decisions for patient treatment when there is insufficient time to investigate the cause of pericardial effusion or when such investigation is not rationalized based on cost–benefit considerations. History, physical examination, and echocardiography constitute the main pillars of diagnosis. Treatment can range from observation to percutaneous or surgical procedures depending on the etiology and severity of fluid accumulation.

### How to perform pericardiocentesis in cancer patients with thrombocytopenia: a single-center experience [^112tzpHU]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Case

A 62-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease (drug-eluting stent to left anterior descending artery 4 months before presentation, currently taking aspirin and clopidogrel), and malignant epithelioid mesothelioma presented to the emergency department with progressive shortness of breath and worsening chest pain.

His cancer treatment history included chemoradiation with 3 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed, followed by surgical left pleurectomy with decortication and partial pericardiectomy.

On arrival to the emergency center, the patient's examination revealed labored breathing, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distention. The patient's heart rate was 92 beats/min, blood pressure 80/60 mm Hg, temperature 36.8 o C, and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood count of 1,700/μL, hemoglobin 7.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 91,000/μL.

Chest x-ray revealed an increased cardiac silhouette. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed interval development of a large pericardial effusion (Figure 1). An echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction with a large pericardial effusion, concerning for tamponade. Given the patient's thrombocytopenia, previous pulmonary surgery, and multiple comorbidities, the surgery team recommended percutaneous pericardiocentesis, which was subsequently performed.

A 48-year-old man presented to accident and emergency with syncope on a background history of 3&emsp14; weeks of increasing shortness of breath. He collapsed at home prompting admission. He was a smoker with a 30-pack-year history. On examination, he was found to be tachypnoeic and hypoxic, with a raised JVP and quiet heard sounds. He was haemodynamically stable and a chest x-ray showed right upper-lobe collapse. His resting ECG demonstrated electrical alternans prompting urgent referral to the cardiologist for echocardiography. This revealed a large pericardial effusion with evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse. In view of this, he underwent urgent pericardiocentesis. A subsequent CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions and multiple lung nodules. Both pericardial and pleural fluid cytology were reported as metastatic non-small cell adenocarcinoma. The pericardial fluid continued to reaccumulate requiring a pericardial window. He was referred to the oncology team for palliative chemotherapy.

	Monitoring Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter. Perform chemistry panels, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glucose prior to therapy and periodically. Electrocardiograms should be obtained at baseline, 7 days after initiation and periodically thereafter, as well as following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor lipid profiles and glucose periodically during the first year of Tasigna therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. Should treatment with any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a lipid lowering agent) be needed to treat lipid elevations, evaluate the potential for a drug-drug interaction before initiating therapy as certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Assess glucose levels before initiating treatment with Tasigna and monitor during treatment as clinically indicated. If test results warrant therapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines.

5.13

	Fluid Retention

In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions (including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites) or pulmonary edema, were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.1% of patients receiving imatinib.

### Pericardial effusion impending tamponade: a look beyond beck's triad [^116yuahf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of chronic or slowly progressing pericardial effusion with impending tamponade remains a challenge, particularly when classical physical signs are subtle or absent. A high index of suspicion should be entertained in such cases in the appropriate setting even when the clinical signs and symptoms are missing. We present two cases where the pericardial effusion was missed in the emergency department due to subtle clinical features or mistaken for a more familiar "look-a-like" presentation. A review of the literature and an analysis of various clinical parameters of published cases were performed. It is pivotal that physicians should not only be aware of the limitations of the traditional clinical signs, but also be familiar with the use of other subtle findings and the importance of other modalities that may potentially enhance the sensitivity in diagnosing chronic pericardial effusion impending tamponade.

### Incidence of pericardial effusion in patients presenting to the emergency department with unexplained dyspnea [^114xavHF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the frequency of pericardial effusion in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with unexplained, new onset dyspnea.

Methods

This prospective observational study took place at an urban community hospital ED with a residency program and an annual census of 65,000 visits. Patients presenting between May 1999 and January 2000 with new-onset dyspnea were eligible if they lacked any pulmonary, infectious, hematological, traumatic, psychiatric, cardiovascular, or neuromuscular explanation for their dyspnea after ED evaluation. Patients received a focused echocardiogram by certified emergency physicians. Data were recorded on standardized data sheets and studies were taped for review. Effusions were categorized as small when the fluid stripe measured less than 10 mm. Moderate-sized effusions measured 10 to 15 mm. Large effusions measured more than 15 mm.

Results

One hundred three patients were enrolled. Median age was 56 years (IQR 44, 95% CI = 32 to 67). Fourteen patients (13.6%, 95% CI = 8% to 23%) had effusions. Four had large effusions that explained their dyspnea and were admitted to cardiology; two of these effusions were hemorrhagic, and two were viral in origin. Seven patients with small effusions were treated conservatively at home. Three patients had moderate-sized effusions; all were admitted but treated conservatively.

Conclusions

While limited by small numbers, these preliminary data suggest that patients with unexplained dyspnea should be checked for pericardial effusion when bedside ED ultrasound is available.

He was diagnosed as having human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and skin manifestations of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). He had a significant pericardial effusion, which was drained. He had bilateral pleural effusions, the left effusion larger than the right. His effusion was associated with primary effusion lymphoma. He was subjected to a pleuroscopy and the cause of the blood-stained effusion was thought to be due to chronic pleuritis and unrelated to the pleural KS. The patient also had the characteristic lesions of KS on the parietal pleural, which is unusual, as most involve the visceral surface.

Although serological tests for autoantibodies were negative, an eventual diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, was performed based on the clinical picture. The multiorgan involvement meant that the initial diagnosis and effective management required multidisciplinary input from cardiology, neurology, rheumatology, psychiatry, immunology and occupational and physiotherapy.

### Pericardial effusion: a rare presentation of adult T-cell leukemia / lymphoma [^111J6g1p]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) has a wide variety of clinical presentations. The most common ones include leukemia, hypercalcemia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and skin lesions. We report a case of ATLL in a 73-year-old woman who presented initially with chest discomfort and shortness of breath. The patient had no peripheral lymphadenopathy, circulating lymphoma cells, hepatosplenomegaly, or skin lesions. CT scan showed small mediastinal lymph nodes and pericardial effusion. Diagnosis was established by cytomorphologic evaluation and flow cytometric analysis of the pericardial fluid. Cardiac involvement is a rare event in ATLL and, when present, usually is a late finding in the setting of disseminated disease. This case was unusual because the patient lacked all common clinical features of ATLL. We present this case so as to increase awareness that ATLL could initially present with pericardial effusion. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of cardiac involvement are also discussed.

### Malignant pericardial effusion, or fluid around the heart due to cancer… [^112ExSqK]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A pericardial effusion is a condition where excessive fluid accumulates in the sac around the heart, which normally has just minimal fluid present. Infection, autoimmune diseases, kidney failure, heart attack, previous radiation therapy, trauma, and cancer are the most common causes. It may not cause any symptoms if the amount of fluid is small or increasing slowly. If the fluid accumulates rapidly or in large amounts, the following symptoms may develop: Difficulty breathing Cough, chest pain Generalized weakness High heart rate and palpitations Lightheadedness or fainting, confusion Enlargement of the neck veins Bluish discoloration of fingernails or lips Bilateral leg swelling, abdominal distension.

An electrocardiogram measures the heart's electrical activity and may show an increased heart rate, low electrical amplitude of a decreased electrical signal because it is reduced by traveling through the fluid, and sometimes an ECG pattern called electrical alternans that reflects the heart changing position as it moves within the excess fluid. The most helpful test is an echocardiogram, or ultrasonography of the heart. This will show the fluid in the sac around the heart and give an estimate of the volume and how it is affecting the heart's ability to pump. One way to be more certain if the fluid collection in the pericardial sac is from cancer is to find cancer cells in the fluid. Pericardial effusion is treated by draining the fluid and/or treating the underlying cause. Some effusions may be small or moderate, and the physician may recommend close monitoring.

But larger effusions can cause tamponade, which is when the pressure from the fluid reduces the heart's ability to pump blood forward, making it an emergency for an urgent fluid drainage. For cancer-related pericardial effusion, anticancer treatment is also recommended, which may prevent further fluid reaccumulation. Fluid drainage can be done by either pericardiocentesis or pericardial window. JAMA Patient Page: Pericardial Effusionhttps: //jamanetwork. com/journals/jama/fullarticle/206790.

### An unusual cause of severe dyspnea: diastolic dysfunction due to calcific constrictive pericarditis [^116c57Qh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Constrictive pericarditis is a rare cause of dyspnea. This disease shares many signs and symptoms with other causes of cardiac failure as well as gastrointestinal and renal diseases, making it difficult to diagnose.

Case Report

We present a case of a 73-year-old woman who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) in respiratory failure after a recent history of worsening dyspnea. Constrictive pericarditis was strongly suspected on bedside ultrasonography. Computed tomography scan showed extensive pericardial calcifications and large pleural effusions, supporting the diagnoses. The patient was admitted for treatment and evaluation of constrictive pericarditis, but died of complications during cardiac catheterization.

Conclusions

The etiology and physiology of constrictive pericarditis are reviewed and an ultrasound-centered approach to undifferentiated dyspnea in the ED is discussed.

### Transitory effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^111Ln676]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion of various sizes is a quite common clinical finding, while its progression to effusive-constrictive pericarditis occurs in about 1.4–14% of cases. Although available evidence on prevalence and prognosis of this rare pericardial syndrome is poor, apparently a considerable proportion of patients conservatively managed has a spontaneous resolution after several weeks. A 61-year-old female presented to our emergency department reporting fatigue, effort dyspnea and abdominal swelling. The echocardiography showed large pericardial effusion with initial hemodynamic impact, so she underwent a pericardiocentesis with drainage of 800–850cm³ of exudative fluid, on which diagnostic investigations were undertaken: possible viral and bacterial infections, medical conditions, iatrogenic causes, neoplastic and connective tissue diseases were all excluded. Despite empirical therapy with NSAIDs and colchicine, after about one week she had a recurrence of pericardial effusion and progressive development of constriction. Echocardiography performed after a few weeks of anti-inflammatory therapy showed resolution of constriction and PE, with clinical improvement. If progression of pericardial syndromes to a constrictive form is rarely described in literature, cases of transitory effusive-constrictive phase are even more uncommon, mainly reported during the evolution of pericardial effusion. According to the available data, risk of progression to a constrictive form is very low in case of idiopathic pericardial effusion. We report a case of large idiopathic subacute pericardial effusion, treated with pericardiocentesis and then evolved into an effusive-constrictive pericarditis. A prolonged anti-inflammatory treatment leads to complete resolution of pericardial syndrome without necessity of pericardiectomy.

### Pericardial effusions: causes, diagnosis, and management [^111qQ9VF]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The presentation of a patient with a pericardial effusion can range from an incidental finding to a life-threatening emergency. Accordingly, the causes of pericardial effusions are numerous and can generally be divided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory etiologies. For all patients with a suspected pericardial effusion, echocardiography is essential to define the location and size of an effusion. In pericardial tamponade, the hemodynamics relate to decreased pericardial compliance, ventricular interdependence, and an inspiratory decrease in the pressure gradient for left ventricular filling. Echocardiography provides insight into the pathophysiologic alterations, primarily through an assessment of chamber collapse, inferior vena cava plethora, and marked respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow. Once diagnosed, pericardiocentesis is performed in patients with tamponade, preferably with echocardiographic guidance. With a large effusion but no tamponade, pericardiocentesis is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes, though is performed if there is concern for a bacterial infection. In patients with malignancy, pericardial window is preferred given the risk for recurrence. Finally, large effusions can progress to tamponade, but can generally be followed closely until the extent of the effusion facilitates safe pericardiocentesis.

### Cardiac tamponade [^1153YMBy]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency caused by the progressive accumulation of pericardial fluid (effusion), blood, pus or air in the pericardium, compressing the heart chambers and leading to haemodynamic compromise, circulatory shock, cardiac arrest and death. Pericardial diseases of any aetiology as well as complications of interventional and surgical procedures or chest trauma can cause cardiac tamponade. Tamponade can be precipitated in patients with pericardial effusion by dehydration or exposure to certain medications, particularly vasodilators or intravenous diuretics. Key clinical findings in patients with cardiac tamponade are hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure and distant heart sounds (Beck triad). Dyspnoea can progress to orthopnoea (with no rales on lung auscultation) accompanied by weakness, fatigue, tachycardia and oliguria. In tamponade caused by acute pericarditis, the patient can experience fever and typical chest pain increasing on inspiration and radiating to the trapezius ridge. Generally, cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that can be confirmed using various imaging modalities, principally echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade is preferably resolved by echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis. In patients who have recently undergone cardiac surgery and in those with neoplastic infiltration, effusive-constrictive pericarditis, or loculated effusions, fluoroscopic guidance can increase the feasibility and safety of the procedure. Surgical management is indicated in patients with aortic dissection, chest trauma, bleeding or purulent infection that cannot be controlled percutaneously. After pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy, NSAIDs and colchicine can be considered to prevent recurrence and effusive-constrictive pericarditis.

### A rare case of right atrial perforation and pericardial tamponade following leakage of bone cement [^116wwETF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

On the 13th postoperative day, the patient's chest tightness and shortness of breath worsened compared to the previous day, raising concerns about potential cardiac and pulmonary issues. A CT scan of the lungs was performed, revealing a surprising increase in pericardial and bilateral pleural effusion compared to the previous scan, as well as a long, dense shadow at the heart (Fig. 2 B). Given the patient's elevated pleural effusion and deteriorating oxygenation, she was promptly transferred to the intensive care unit of the thoracic surgery department. A chest tube was inserted on the same day to drain the pleural effusion.

Fig. 2
A Chest X-ray showing irregular long cement images highlighted within the yellow circle, B CT angiography of the lungs, with yellow arrows pointing to the bone cement in the right atrium, C full aortic angiogram, with the yellow arrow indicating a high-density shadow in the region of the right atrium, tricuspid valve, and right ventricle. LA = left atrium, AO = aortic, RA = right atrium, RV = right ventricle

On the 14th postoperative day, the patient's chest tightness and shortness of breath persisted, with 800 mL of fluid drained from the chest tube. The drainage fluid was light red and tested positive for the Rivalta test (+). The total cell count exceeded 50,000, with a white blood cell count of 6,480, indicating an exudate with associated inflammation. A chest X-ray confirmed a large volume of pericardial and bilateral pleural effusions, along with a long, high-density shadow resembling blood vessels near the heart (Fig. 2 A). Given the patient's lack of previous cardiac surgery or thoracic trauma, this finding raised concern. That day, pericardiocentesis was performed to relieve pressure from the accumulating pericardial effusion, yielding 190 mL of dark red fluid.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^11571vM9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Pleural effusions have major effects on the cardiorespiratory system and cause abnormalities in gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and muscle function and hemodynamics. The association between these abnormalities and effusion-related breathlessness, and the response following thoracentesis, remains uncertain. Future research should aim to identify the key mechanisms driving breathlessness in patients with a pleural effusion and the important predictors of improvement following pleural drainage.

### Symptomatic pericardial cyst with a mass effect on the right heart [^111pb5h2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pericardial cysts comprise 6–7% of mediastinal masses. On average, they have a diameter of 5.4 cm and are rarely symptomatic. It is even more rare for pericardial cysts to be greater than 10 cm in diameter, which are preferentially excised via an open approach. There is limited literature on robotic video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) for giant symptomatic pericardial cysts. We present the case of a 66-year-old with a symptomatic pericardial cyst and coexisting loculated pleural effusion successfully treated with robotic VATS excision.

Case description

Our patient presented with worsening shortness of breath and yellow-sputum production. Work-up revealed a 12.3 x 10.9 x 6.8 cm pericardial cyst with mass effect on the right atrium and ventricle. He underwent a right robotic assisted (VATS). He required pneumolysis for adequate exposure of the pericardium because of loculated pleural effusion. Excision was performed with electrocautery along the rim of the cyst for decompression and resection. The patient's hemodynamics remained stable throughout the procedure.

Conclusions

For our patient, robotic VATS was a safe and effective approach for resecting a pericardial cyst in a hostile thoracic cavity. There is limited reporting giant pericardial cysts resected via a robotic VATS approach in patients with challenging anatomic exposure secondary to loculations. This supports robotic VATS for excision of giant symptomatic pericardial cysts, including in select patients with an anatomically hostile thoracic cavity.

Regarding specific circumstances for pericardial effusion, more specifically with respect to patients with neoplastic pericardial effusion, ESC 2025 guidelines recommend to perform extended pericardial drainage (3–6 days) in patients with suspected or definite neoplastic pericardial effusion to prevent effusion recurrence.

Assumptions and definitions — pericardial entities are defined to guide diagnosis and management: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium leading to characteristic pleuritic chest pain which can be accompanied by pericardial rub, typical electrocardiogram changes, new or worsening pericardial effusion, and elevated inflammatory markers; pericardial effusion is fluid accumulation in the pericardial space visible on imaging such as echocardiography; cardiac tamponade is compression of the heart by abnormal fluid accumulation causing impaired cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise; constrictive pericarditis is loss of elasticity with often abnormal pericardial thickening that impairs diastolic filling and leads to heart failure symptoms and can be transient/subacute (predominantly inflammatory and reversible) or advanced/chronic (often calcified and irreversible); effusive constrictive pericarditis is persistent constrictive physiology even after drainage of pericardial effusion.

### Untreated primary hypothyroidism with simultaneous rhabdomyolysis, pericardial effusion, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss: a case report [^116i5H7q]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism, one of the prevalent endocrine disorders worldwide, has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, from an asymptomatic condition to myxedema coma. Although the majority of patients with hypothyroidism have minor clinical symptoms, which are recovered with levothyroxine treatment, some patients occasionally do experience fatal complications. Here we report, for the first time, the case of a patient who had hypothyroidism with simultaneous occurrence of rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury, moderate pericardial effusion, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old man with a previous history of dyslipidemia and untreated hypothyroidism was admitted to the hospital due to shortness of breath, lethargy, lower extremity discomfort, and unilateral hearing loss. Laboratory results revealed rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury and severe hypothyroidism. We detected cardiomegaly without lung parenchymal infiltration on chest radiography and moderate pericardial effusion on transthoracic echocardiography. We performed pure tone audiometry and identified profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Aggressive fluid resuscitation, levothyroxine treatment, and systemic and intratympanic steroid therapy alleviated the patient's severe hypothyroidism, rhabdomyolysis, and pericardial effusion; however, sensorineural hearing loss was not fully recovered.

Conclusions

Early recognition of life-threatening complications is important in patients with severe hypothyroidism to prevent adverse outcomes. This case suggests that hypothyroidism should be considered in patients who have rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney disease and pericardial effusion. Moreover, sudden sensorineural hearing loss should be kept in mind as a rare complication of hypothyroidism.

### Haemorrhagiccomplex pericarditis presenting with cardiac tamponade in an immunocompetent woman [^116aGoya]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A young woman in her mid-40s was referred by her primary care physician for fever, worsening shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain and tachycardia. CT angiogram of the chest revealed a large pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram confirmed tamponade physiology despite her being haemodynamically stable. She had an emergency pericardiocentesis which revealed evidence of a haemorrhagic pericardial effusion. However, the patient was still symptomatic after treatment and had to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with a pericardial window and chest tube. Postoperatively, her fevers resolved. Pan-culture was initially negative, and all antibiotics were discontinued. Acid-fast bacilli cultures later grew Mycobacterium avium complex. She continued to have chest discomfort postoperatively, but follow-up CT of the chest 3 months postoperatively showed continued resolution of her pericardial effusion. The patient's symptoms improved, and she has had no recurrence of effusion without the need for anti-tuberculosis drugs.

### Pericardial involvement at diagnosis in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients [^116m1rJq]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Because most cases are clinically silent, the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of pericardial involvement in Hodgkin lymphoma are unknown.

Methods

Records of all patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma treated at our institution between 1991 and 2004 were reviewed. Pericardial involvement was identified by computerized tomography (CT) as focal thickening or nodularity present at the time of diagnosis, and by echocardiography as pericardial effusion. Outcomes measured were incidence of pericardial involvement, relapse-free survival, and overall survival.

Results

Thirteen of 273 patients (5%) had pericardial involvement. All patients with pericardial involvement had nodular sclerosing tumors versus 183 of 260 patients without pericardial involvement (P = 0.02); 9 (67%) had a bulky mediastinal mass versus 27% (P = 0.002). Two patients required pericardial drainage to drain very large effusions (n = 2). Both patients were symptomatic with either shortness of breath or superior vena cava syndrome. In the 11 cases that did not undergo surgical drainage, the effusion resolved within days after starting chemotherapy. Two patients experienced distant relapse but underwent successful salvage therapy. All 13 patients remain alive and free of disease at a median follow-up of 9.7 years (range, 1.7–12.9 years) with normal cardiac function.

Conclusions

Pericardial involvement by lymphoma is usually asymptomatic unless accompanied by substantial pericardial effusion. In most cases, pericardial involvement resolves with treatment of the underlying malignancy, but close observation for hemodynamic complications is required. A symptomatic effusion, once treated, does not affect survival.

### Postcardiac injury syndrome and stroke following permanent pacemaker insertion [^1128aF75]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

An 80-year-old woman initially presented with an episode of pleuritic chest pain 10 days after implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker. She returned to hospital a day later with vomiting and fever. She was found to have new atrial fibrillation in addition to right-sided weakness and dysarthria. An infarct in the left anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory was later confirmed on CT. She continued to have recurrent febrile episodes associated with vomiting and dyspnoea. Extensive investigations for infection were negative, and her symptoms were initially attributed to aspiration pneumonia. The patient gradually deteriorated despite antibiotics and became progressively short of breath, with development of large pleural and pericardial effusions. A diagnosis of postcardiac injury syndrome was made after exclusion of other differentials. The patient recovered well after pleurocentesis, pericardiocentesis and a pericardial window, with resolution of symptoms without further medical therapy.

### Integrating point-of-care ultrasound in the ED evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath [^117Y6jfL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The differential diagnoses of patients presenting with chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SOB) are broad and non-specific. We aimed to 1) determine how use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) impacted emergency physicians' differential diagnosis, and 2) evaluate the accuracy of POCUS when compared to chest radiograph (CXR) and composite final diagnosis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational study in a convenience sample of patients presenting with CP and SOB to the Emergency Department (ED). Treating physicians selected possible diagnoses from a pre-indexed list of possible diagnoses of causes of CP and SOB. The final composite diagnosis from a chart review was determined as the reference standard for the diagnosis. The primary analysis involved calculations of sensitivity and specificity for POCUS identifiable diagnoses in detecting cause of CP and SOB. Additional comparative accuracy analysis with CXRs were conducted.

Results

128 patients with a mean age of 64 ± 17 years were included in the study. Using a reference standard of composite final diagnoses, POCUS had equal or higher specificity to CXR for all indications for which it was used, except for pneumonia. POCUS correctly identified all patients with pneumothorax, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. In patients with a normal thoracic ultrasound, CXR never provided any actionable clinical information. Adding POCUS to the initial evaluation causes a significant narrowing of the differential diagnoses in which the median differential diagnosis from 5 (IQR 3–6) to 3 (IQR 2–4) p < 0.001.

Conclusion

In evaluation of patients with CP and SOB, POCUS is a highly feasible diagnostic test which can assist in narrowing down the differential diagnoses. In patients with a normal thoracic ultrasound, the added value of a CXR may be minimal.

### Diagnosing pericarditis [^113HNagn]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Pericarditis, or inflammation of the pericardium, is most often caused by viral infection. It can also develop as a result of bacterial or other infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, injury to the mediastinal area, and the effects of certain drugs (notably hydralazine and procainamide). The clinical features of pericarditis depend on its cause, as well as the volume and type of effusion. Patients with uncomplicated pericarditis have pleuritic-type chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and may be relieved by leaning forward. Chest radiographs, Doppler studies, and laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the degree of effusion. In most patients, pericarditis is mild and resolves spontaneously, although treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or a short course of a corticosteroid may be helpful. When a large pericardial effusion is produced, cardiac function may be compromised, and cardiac tamponade can occur. In patients with longstanding inflammation, the pericardium becomes fibrous or calcified, resulting in constriction of the heart. Drainage or surgical intervention may be necessary in patients with complicated pericarditis.

### Presenting signs and symptoms of pericardial effusions in the pediatric emergency department [^112p9m7U]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The primary objective of this study was to describe the frequency of the most common presenting signs and symptoms of pericardial effusions, particularly with relation to the size of the effusion. The secondary objective was to review the final etiology of the pericardial effusion in those patients who had presented to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of patients younger than 17 years who presented and were evaluated at the pediatric emergency department and subsequently diagnosed with a pericardial effusion during a period of 10 years.

Results

A total of 23 patients matched the inclusion criteria. The most common symptom was shortness of breath (65%), followed by fever (52%), fatigue (44%), and chest pain (44%). Shortness of breath (60%) and chest pain (60%) were the most frequent symptoms among patients with a small pericardial effusion. Fever (86%), cough (71%), and shortness of breath (71%) were the most frequent symptoms among patients with moderate pericardial effusion. In patients with large pericardial effusions, the most frequent symptoms were shortness of breath (63%) and abdominal pain (63%). Tachycardia (52%) and tachypnea (52%) were the most common abnormal vital signs. The most common etiology was cardiac (44%) and autoimmune disease (26%).

Conclusions

This study suggests that the presence of certain symptoms should be associated with a high index of suspicion for pericardial effusion for the pediatric emergency care physician.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Fibrotic Conditions

There is a risk of cardiac valvulopathy, and pericardial, pleural, pulmonary, and retroperitoneal fibrosis with CABERGOLINE treatment. Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they develop shortness of breath, chest pain, persistent cough, difficulty with breathing when lying down, or swelling in their extremities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Orthostatic Hypotension

Warn patients about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and instruct patients to rise slowly from a supine or sitting position. Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they develop dizziness or lightheadedness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Impulse Control Disorders and Compulsive Behaviors

Patients should be alerted to the possibility that patients may experience intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, and other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking CABERGOLINE. Advise patients to inform their health care provider if they develop new or increased uncontrolled spending, gambling urges, sexual urges, or other urges while being treated with CABERGOLINE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Pregnancy

Advise patients to notify their health care provider if they suspect they are pregnant, become pregnant, or intend to become pregnant during therapy. A pregnancy test should be done if there is any suspicion of pregnancy and continuation of CABERGOLINE treatment should be discussed with their health care provider [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Aortic dissection presenting as shortness of breath from diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^114Pqksh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Aortic dissection is a rare but well-known life-threatening disease that classically presents with tearing chest pain radiating to the back yet can have deceiving clinical presentations.

Case Report

A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department with mild shortness of breath without chest pain. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) detected diffuse B-lines, a dilated aortic root, aortic regurgitation, and pericardial effusion. A computed tomography angiogram confirmed a Stanford type A aortic dissection with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), a rare complication of type A aortic dissection involving the posterior aortic wall with extension into the main pulmonary artery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Acute aortic dissection can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations with a high mortality rate for patients with an untimely diagnosis. Although an intimal flap within the aortic lumen is the characteristic finding on ultrasound, additional POCUS findings of a pericardial effusion, aortic regurgitation, and a dilated aortic root may be seen with proximal dissections. Diffuse B-lines on thoracic POCUS, although commonly associated with pulmonary edema in decompensated heart failure, can be seen in patients with DAH which has a multitude of etiologies, including aortic dissection.

### Follow-up and treatment of idiopathic pericardial effusion… [^115W76DF]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Despite its increased frequency in diagnosis, the natural history, clinical course and management of this condition have not been well defined. Sagristà-Sauleda and colleagues performed a long-term prospective study to determine the clinical course of pericardial effusion and the need for intervention in patients with this condition. Patients were considered to have idiopathic pericardial effusion if they met all of the following criteria: the cause of pericardial effusion was undetermined after a complete medical evaluation, including examination of the pericardial fluid or tissue; the sum of the anterior and posterior echo-free spaces exceeded 20 mm at end diastole; the disease did not progress during the observation period; and the effusion persisted for more than three months. Cardiac tamponade was diagnosed if the systolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg, pulsus paradoxus was present and jugular venous pressure had increased.

Patients underwent pericardiocentesis in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with subsequent chemical and bacteriologic evaluation of the pericardial fluid. If the pericardial effusion reappeared, a second pericardiocentesis was done. An anterior pericardiectomy was performed if the pericardial effusion reoccurred and lasted for more than six months. After the initial pericardiocentesis, patients were seen every three months for one year and then annually. Patients who became symptomatic were seen on an acute basis. Thirteen of the patients were initially asymptomatic, seven presented with atypical chest pain and seven were admitted to the hospital with overt cardiac tamponade. The duration of the effusions ranged from six months to 15 years. In all patients, the evaluation of pericardial fluid was normal or nondiagnostic. Follow-up ranged from 18 months to 20 years.

During follow-up, five patients underwent early pericardiectomy because of the presence of symptoms or the recurrence of a large effusion. Pericardiocentesis alone fully resolved or significantly reduced the pericardial effusion in eight patients. Ultimately, 20 of the 28 patients underwent pericardiectomy with no associated mortality. Only two patients required the procedure to treat overt tamponade. Thus, pericardiocentesis should be performed in most patients. Anterior pericardiectomy should be considered in patients with recurrence of fluid or those who develop symptoms of tamponade.

5.2	Pleural, Pulmonary and Retroperitoneal Fibrosis

CABERGOLINE is contraindicated in patients with a history of pleural, pulmonary, or retroperitoneal fibrosis. During CABERGOLINE treatment monitor for signs and symptoms of progressive fibrosis, including:

Pleuro-pulmonary disease (e.g., dyspnea, shortness of breath, persistent cough, chest pain).
Renal impairment or ureteral/abdominal vascular obstruction (e.g., pain in the loin/flank, lower limb edema, abdominal masses or tenderness that may indicate retroperitoneal fibrosis).

Consider clinical and diagnostic monitoring for pleural, pulmonary, and retroperitoneal fibrosis such as with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum creatinine measurements, chest-x-ray, and other investigations at baseline and as necessary during CABERGOLINE treatment. If pleural, pericardial, retroperitoneal, or pulmonary fibrosis occur, discontinue CABERGOLINE.

Postmarketing cases of pleural, pulmonary, and retroperitoneal fibrosis have been reported following CABERGOLINE administration. Some reports were in patients previously treated with other ergotinic dopamine agonists. CABERGOLINE-treated patients who developed a pleural effusion or pulmonary fibrosis and subsequently discontinued CABERGOLINE had improvement of their pulmonary symptoms.

5.3	Orthostatic Hypotension

Check blood pressure at baseline and during treatment with CABERGOLINE and monitor for orthostatic hypotension. Warn patients about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and precautions to take when rising from a supine or sitting position. Instruct patients to report dizziness or lightheadedness with changes in position to their healthcare provider.

CABERGOLINE can cause orthostatic hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with hyperprolactinemic disorders, the percentage of CABERGOLINE-treated patients and placebo-treated patients who developed orthostatic hypotension was 4% and 0%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of orthostatic hypotension is greater in CABERGOLINE-treated patients when taking concomitant drugs that lower blood pressure.

5.4	Risks with Use of CABERGOLINE for Postpartum Lactation Inhibition or Suppression

Avoid use of CABERGOLINE for the inhibition or suppression of postpartum physiologic lactation because of the risk of serious adverse reactions. Use of bromocriptine, another dopamine agonist for this unapproved use has been associated with cases of hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction seizures, and death.

Results

Clinical characteristics

Figure 1 shows the study flow chart. Of the 175 patients screened, 24 patients were excluded due to having pericardial effusions that were not amenable to safe pericardiocentesis (n = 16), missing information (n = 4), absence of a pericardial effusion (n = 3) and prolonged TB therapy (n = 1). Of the remaining 151 patients, 49.0% (74/151), 33.1% (50/151) and 17.9% (27/151) were classified as definite-, probable- and non-TB, respectively. Only 1/74 definite-TB patients was PF smear-positive.

Only 18% (18/98) of HIV-infected patients were on anti-retroviral therapy at enrolment. Non-TB participants were significantly older, less likely to be HIV-infected, and more likely to have severe shortness of breath despite significantly smaller pericardial effusions than those with definite and probable TB. In contrast, definite-TB and probable-TB patients had similar clinical characteristics.

### Total electrical alternans in a patient with malignant pericardial tamponade [^1121aU6P]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a 59-year-old man with acute abdominal pain and progressive shortness of breath. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma scan showed free fluid in the hepatorenal recess and in the recto-uterine recess. Later, due to clinical deterioration and the differential possibility of a pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection, a CT scan was performed which revealed large pericardial effusion. This, together with a dilated vena cava inferior and portal system, raised the suspicion of cardiac tamponade. The diagnosis was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). In retrospect, the ECG at admission showed a sinus tachycardia, low-voltage QRS complexes and a total electrical alternans corresponding with the swinging heart seen on TTE. An electrical alternans on ECG is an important diagnostic clue but is often missed, causing an unnecessary delay to proper diagnostic and therapeutic measures.

### American Society of Echocardiography clinical recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with pericardial disease: endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^1125wSKk]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

General indications for imaging in constrictive pericarditis (CP) emphasize that "The suspicion for CP is based on clinical history and examination, which require subsequent evaluation and confirmation by imaging and hemodynamic data", and that referrals often stem from "heart failure, shortness of breath, evaluation of cardiac function, and peripheral edema". In unsuspected cases, "abnormal ventricular septal motion and/or increased pericardial thickness suggests the possibility of CP, which can be confirmed by diagnostic hemodynamic features". In suspected constriction, imaging focuses on "pericardial thickness, interventricular dependence, other associated abnormalities (valvular, myocardial, or coronary artery disease), and evidence of alternative pathologies, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, RV dysfunction, or severe tricuspid regurgitation". Echocardiography "remains the initial imaging test, and can provide a definite diagnosis of CP for most patients", but when findings are equivocal, "additional imaging testing (CT or CMR) is needed to make the diagnosis with more confidence", and "hemodynamic cardiac catheterization may be necessary to establish the diagnosis". Even if CP is certain after echocardiography, "other imaging tests are often necessary to evaluate pericardial inflammation, coexisting myocardial disease, or comprehensive pericardial as well as cardiovascular anatomy for subsequent management decisions".

### Nilotinib [^111qTjS2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Monitoring Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter. Perform chemistry panels, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glucose prior to therapy and periodically. Electrocardiograms should be obtained at baseline, 7 days after initiation and periodically thereafter, as well as following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor lipid profiles and glucose periodically during the first year of nilotinib therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. Should treatment with any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a lipid lowering agent) be needed to treat lipid elevations, evaluate the potential for a drug-drug interaction before initiating therapy as certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway [se e Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Assess glucose levels before initiating treatment with nilotinib and monitor during treatment as clinically indicated. If test results warrant therapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines.

5.13 Fluid Retention

In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions (including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites) or pulmonary edema, were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.1% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions were severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 0.7% and 0.4% of patients receiving nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in no patients receiving imatinib. Similar events were also observed in postmarketing reports. Monitor patients for signs of severe fluid retention (e.g., unexpected rapid weight gain or swelling) and for symptoms of respiratory or cardiac compromise (e.g., shortness of breath) during nilotinib treatment; evaluate etiology and treat patients accordingly.

### A delayed diagnosis of cardiac tamponade [^116QjhyH]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 64-year-old female was referred to the on-call surgical team by her general practitioner with a 2-week history of feeling generally unwell; more short of breath with lethargy and myalgia with a 2-day history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain. On initial assessment she was tachycardic and an abdominal examination revealed a soft abdomen with right upper quadrant tenderness. An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed a distended gall bladder with the diameter of the common bile duct at the upper limit of normal. It also revealed free fluid within the abdomen, bilateral pleural effusions and a large left ovarian cyst. The medical team became involved and ordered a CT thorax and abdomen which showed a large pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural effusions, a small amount of ascites and a large left ovary; reported as appearances most consistent with malignancy. On further assessment by a cardiologist the patient showed signs of cardiac tamponade and she underwent urgent pericardiocentesis.

### Impending cardiac tamponade caused by salt supplement in a hyponatremic patient with chronic kidney disease [^113Brzsx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

We documented a hyponatremic patient who developed imminent cardiac tamponade upon oral salt supplement. A 72-year-old diabetic woman had hemorrhagic stroke; pericardial effusion; and chronic kidney disease, stage IV. She developed hyponatremia (serum sodium level, 125 mmol/L), compatible with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, and received oral salt supplement 9 g/d for 4 days. Shortness of breathing and increasing heart rate ensued, and the echocardiography found accumulation of pericardial effusion with signs of impending cardiac tamponade. Pig-tail drainage through pericardiocentesis was done, and the vital signs were stabilized. We found the production of pericardial effusion increased from 100 to 220 mL/d after oral salt supplement at 3 g/d was reassumed. We discuss the relationship between serum sodium levels, the dose of salt supplement and the accumulation of pericardial effusion.

### Recurrent rash in an 11-year-old boy with pericardial and pleural effusions [^112cSXw1]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

An 11-year-old, previously healthy boy presented to the emergency center (EC) for acute respiratory distress in the setting of 5 months of recurrent and worsening rash with progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. At the onset of his rash, he and his younger brothers were diagnosed with roseola. Although his brothers' symptoms resolved, the patient's rash recurred, prompting his primary care provider to prescribe amoxicillin. The rash subsequently worsened, so amoxicillin was stopped; a prednisone course was prescribed which alleviated the rash. Upon completion of the prednisone course, the rash returned more diffusely with associated symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Because of these symptoms, his mother brought him to the EC, where his vitals were notable for tachypnea and tachycardia. His initial EC imaging workup was remarkable for an echocardiogram with a mild to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, chest x-ray (CXR) with a large right pleural effusion, and chest computerized tomography significant for prominent and diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with numerous enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Laboratory results were notable for elevated liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, d-dimer, and brain natriuretic peptide. Differential diagnosis remained broad, including infectious, oncologic, and rheumatologic etiologies. Our panel of experts reviews the evaluation, hospital course, and treatment of this patient presenting with an unusual rash and serositis.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^11728aK9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a relatively common complication associated with inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases. The primary etiology of this condition could be considered when choosing therapeutic options and factors such as effusion size and its hemodynamic consequence. In most cases, small to moderate pericardial effusions can be managed with observation and anti-inflammatory medications unless the effusion develops rapidly. However, in a small proportion of patients, large effusions lead to impaired cardiac filling with hemodynamic compromise and cardiovascular collapse due to cardiac tamponade. The rate at which fluid accumulates is the primary determinant of hemodynamic impact and thus guides the choice of treatment, irrespective of the effusion's size. Severe cases are typically treated with pericardiocentesis with echocardiographic guidance. More aggressive treatments may be necessary for cases due to purulent or malignant etiologies. These cases may require a pericardial window to allow for long-term drainage of the pericardial fluid. This comprehensive review focuses on the epidemiology of pericardial effusion and discusses pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options for different causes of secondary pericardial effusions.

### What echocardiographic findings suggest a pericardial effusion is causing tamponade? [^1114eNnt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pericardial tamponade is neither a clinical nor an echocardiographic diagnosis alone. The echocardiogram carries diagnostic value and should be performed when there is suspicion for tamponade based on the history and physical exam. A pericardial effusion uncovered on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be mistaken for tamponade and thereby lead to inappropriate and invasive management with pericardiocentesis.

Objective

This narrative review will summarize the echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that support the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade. It will provide a succinct description of the core findings for which emergency physicians should evaluate at the bedside, along with potential pearls and pitfalls in this evaluation. Labeled images and video clips are included.

Discussion

The core echocardiographic findings of pericardial tamponade consist of: a pericardial effusion, diastolic right ventricular collapse (high specificity), systolic right atrial collapse (earliest sign), a plethoric inferior vena cava with minimal respiratory variation (high sensitivity), and exaggerated respiratory cycle changes in mitral and tricuspid valve in-flow velocities as a surrogate for pulsus paradoxus.

Conclusion

The emergency physician must recognize and understand the core echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that suggest pericardial tamponade. Together with the history and clinical exam, these findings can help make the overall diagnosis and determine management.

Novel diagnostic criteria and classification by duration for pericarditis — diagnosis requires "Pleuritic chest pain or equivalent suggestive clinical presentation (must be present)" plus "at least 1 more finding (0 = unlikely, 1 = possible, 2+ = definite diagnosis)" from the following: "Pericardial friction rub"; "ECG changes: diffuse ST-elevation and/or PR-segment depression"; "Inflammatory biomarkers elevation (C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate)"; "Cardiac imaging evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion (especially echocardiography, other imaging modalities as alternative)"; or "Cardiac imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation (cardiac magnetic resonance pericardial late gadolinium enhancement and/or edema, computed tomography with contrast as alternative)". Duration classification is listed as: "Acute: Event lasting < 4–6 weeks", "Incessant: Event lasting > 4 to 6 weeks without remission", "Recurrent: New episode with signs and symptoms of pericardial inflammation after a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks", and "Chronic: Event lasting > 3 months".

### Constrictive pericarditis caused by primary pericardial mesothelioma: a case series [^114jHsEc]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

A 38-year-old woman (case 1) without significant clinical history presented to the outpatient clinic with fever and chest pain. Echocardiography showed substantial pericardial effusion with imminent tamponade. Hence, pericardiocentesis was performed. Viral pericarditis was suspected, and the patient was treated with an NSAID, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and colchicine. After initial clinical improvement, she developed shortness of breath and ascites. Follow-up echocardiography showed an inspiratory leftward shift of the interventricular septum and a dilated inferior vena cava, suggestive of constrictive physiology (Figure 1). Computed tomography (CT) showed no pericardial calcifications. CMR displayed a thickened pericardium up to 8 mm with late gadolinium enhancement and prolonged native T1 and T2 relaxation times, indicating increased vascularization of the pericardium and edema, a suspect of active inflammation. Left ventricular function was normal, and right ventricular function was moderately impaired. Using myocardial tagging, multiple adhesions were detected. During real-time cine imaging within a respiratory cycle, a leftward interventricular septum shift on inspiration was confirmed, compatible with ventricular interdependency and a constrictive physiology. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed diffuse fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the pericardium with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 6.28. No extra-pericardial pathological fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was observed, particularly not in the pleurae. The microbiological and serological analyses of blood and pericardial fluid, including tuberculosis testing, were all negative. Immunosuppressive therapy was intensified with prednisone and anakinra. Nevertheless, she developed progressive fatigue and shortness of breath. Hence, a pericardiectomy was performed, resulting in an improvement of symptoms. Histological examination showed a malignant mesothelioma of the epithelioid type (Figure 2). A broad immunohistochemical panel was performed to confirm the diagnosis (positive staining: calretinin, D2–40, pankeratin, 34betaE12, keratin 7, and GATA3; negative staining: mCEA, BerEp4, TTF1, p40, ER, PR, CDX2, CK20, PAX8, CD31, ERG, and HHV8; BAP1 did not show loss of staining). Adjuvant treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab/ipilimumab) was started, and she remained clinically stable for several months. However, 6 months after diagnosis, she developed signs of systemic hypoperfusion due to progressive constrictive pericarditis and eventually died of severe right-sided congestive heart failure and diffuse thromboembolisms considered to be secondary to the malignancy.

### Pericardial effusion and systemic capillary leak syndrome late post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination [^1154m8TH]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Case presentation

A previously healthy female in her early 50s presented with a 7-day history of bilateral lower extremity swelling and a 2-day history of shortness of breath on exertion (NYHA class III severity). On the day of admission, she developed non-radiating central chest pressure. She had received the AstraZeneca SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 5 weeks prior to symptom onset.

On examination, she had a low jugular venous pressure (JVP), diffuse non-pitting oedema and clear lungs. Blood pressure was 100/75 mm Hg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 100% on room air, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and temperature 36.4°C. Initial investigations revealed polycythaemia with haemoglobin of 176 g/L and elevated haematocrit of 52%, as well as low serum albumin without albuminuria. On admission day 2, the patient developed acute worsening of hypoxaemia, hypotension, paraesthesia and peripheral mottling with slow capillary refill. At this time, JVP was again seen to be low, and repeat CT pulmonary angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism, pulmonary oedema or pericardial effusion.

### A rare case of primary cardiac lymphoma [^117QcjMF]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old man presented with shortness of breath and tachycardia along with systemic symptoms of weight loss and lethargy. A pulmonary embolus was the initial suspected diagnosis but through extensive investigations a rarer cause of his symptoms was identified. This case demonstrates the importance of cardiac imaging in the assessment and non-invasive tissue characterisation of a suspected cardiac tumour; in our case, this was subsequently confirmed by careful histological/immunocytochemical evaluation of the pericardial effusion as a primary cardiac B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, thus enabling appropriate management leading to an excellent clinical outcome.

### A 61-year-old man with shortness of breath, ascites, and lower extremity edema [^117ECmv4]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

A 61-year-old man presented with an 18-month history of progressive shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, worsening bilateral lower extremity edema, abdominal swelling, and increased assistance with activities of daily living. Pertinent past medical history included right-sided pneumonia secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae that was complicated by empyema, requiring right-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with decortication 2 years earlier. He had a negative cardiac history, no recent travel in the last 3 years, and no known exposure to tuberculosis. His medications included aspirin and daily furosemide. His symptoms appeared to be refractory to diuretic therapy. Previous workup 6 months earlier included an echocardiography (ECHO) showing enlarged left and right atria with a normal ejection fraction, and a catheterization of the left side of the heart with reported normal left ventricular function and unobstructed coronary arteries.

### Does this patient with a pericardial effusion have cardiac tamponade? [^116tgjPz]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Cardiac tamponade is a state of hemodynamic compromise resulting from cardiac compression by fluid trapped in the pericardial space. The clinical examination may assist in the decision to perform pericardiocentesis in patients with cardiac tamponade diagnosed by echocardiography.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of the history, physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between 1966 and 2006, reference lists of these articles, and reference lists of relevant textbooks.

Study Selection

We included articles that compared aspects of the clinical examination to a reference standard for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. We excluded studies with fewer than 15 patients. Of 787 studies identified by our search strategy, 8 were included in our final analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed articles for study results and quality. A third reviewer resolved disagreements.

Data Synthesis

All studies evaluated patients with known tamponade or those referred for pericardiocentesis with known effusion. Five features occur in the majority of patients with tamponade: dyspnea (sensitivity range, 87%-89%), tachycardia (pooled sensitivity, 77%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 69%-85%), pulsus paradoxus (pooled sensitivity, 82%; 95% CI, 72%-92%), elevated jugular venous pressure (pooled sensitivity, 76%; 95% CI, 62%-90%), and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph (pooled sensitivity, 89%; 95% CI, 73%-100%). Based on 1 study, the presence of pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg in a patient with a pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of tamponade (likelihood ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.8–6.3), while a pulsus paradoxus of 10 mm Hg or less greatly lowers the likelihood (likelihood ratio, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01–0.24).

Conclusions

Among patients with cardiac tamponade, a minority will not have dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, or cardiomegaly on chest radiograph. A pulsus paradoxus greater than 10 mm Hg among patients with a pericardial effusion helps distinguish those with cardiac tamponade from those without. Diagnostic certainty of the presence of tamponade requires additional testing.

### Pericarditis [^112nxU4w]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder that has multiple causes and presents in various primary-care and secondary-care settings. New diagnostic techniques have improved the sampling and analysis of pericardial fluid and allow comprehensive characterisation of cause. Despite this advance, pericarditis is most commonly idiopathic, and radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous procedures have become important causes. Pericarditis is frequently self-limiting, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases. Integrated use of new imaging methods facilitates accurate detection and management of complications such as pericardial effusion or constriction. Differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy remains a clinical challenge but is facilitated by tissue doppler and colour M-mode echocardiography. Most pericardial effusions can be safely managed with an echo-guided percutaneous approach. Pericardiectomy remains the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis and provides symptomatic relief in most cases. In the future, the pericardial space might become a conduit for treatments directed at the pericardium and myocardium.

### A rare case of right atrial perforation and pericardial tamponade following leakage of bone cement [^115Eawon]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Most cement leaks do not produce obvious clinical symptoms, and identifying asymptomatic patients can be challenging. Bone cement leaks tend to be long and thin, as they often originate from the vertebral venous system. The symptoms vary depending on how the leaked cement migrates through the venous system to the right heart and pulmonary artery. The symptoms can include acute chest pain, syncope, and life-threatening complications such as pericardial tamponade caused by perforation, as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the clinical symptoms of cement leakage are not specific. In our case, the patient experienced sudden chest tightness and shortness of breath. Other cases reported in the literature have shown symptoms such as retrosternal pain, epigastric pain, severe dyspnoea, sudden syncope, and cardiogenic shock, including hypotension, hypoxemia, and cold, clammy skin. In some instances, severe complications like cardiac perforation and pulmonary embolism do not manifest immediately. It has been documented that cardiac perforation caused by cement leakage did not appear until 2.5 years after the operation, during which the patient typically did not experience chest discomfort. In our case, the patient developed chest tightness and shortness of breath on postoperative day 10, and pericardial effusion was detected. However, there were no signs of hemodynamic instability or significant symptoms related to the pericardial effusion. At this point, performing a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan would have been a more appropriate step, enabling a better assessment of the condition and potentially preventing any delay in surgical intervention.

### Myeloid sarcoma presenting as an anterior mediastinal mass invading the pericardium: serial imaging with F-18 FDG PET / CT [^112AijCW]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Myeloid sarcoma is a tumor formed by extramedullary accumulation of myeloblasts or immature myeloid cells. These tumors can develop in lymphoid organs, bone, skin, soft tissue, and other organs, and may precede or occur concurrently with acute myeloid leukemia. This is a case of a 42-year-old man who presented with a 2-week history of cough and shortness of breath on exertion. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large mediastinal mass and pericardial effusion. An F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT scan showed intense fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mediastinal mass with invasion of the parietal pericardium. Biopsy of the mediastinal mass and pericardium revealed myeloid sarcoma. The pericardial effusion was drained and the patient was treated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HiDAC) chemotherapy. A follow-up positron emission tomography-CT was done 2 months after the last cycle, showing poor response to therapy and significant progression of disease with invasion through the anterior chest wall. Myeloid sarcoma can be added to the differential diagnosis of F-18 FDG avid anterior mediastinal masses, as well as F-18 FDG uptake in the pericardium.
