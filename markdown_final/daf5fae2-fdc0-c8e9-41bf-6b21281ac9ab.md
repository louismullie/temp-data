## Question

Neonatal respectait distress syndrome treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment goals and principles. Next, I will examine antenatal prevention, followed by delivery room stabilization. After that, I need to review non-invasive respiratory support, surfactant therapy including timing, dosing, and administration methods, and when to escalate to invasive ventilation. I will then consider adjunctive therapies, supportive care, special populations, and finally summarize a practical algorithm with monitoring and quality metrics, ensuring each step is supported by current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and pathophysiology so I don't anchor on a misclassification. Neonatal RDS is primarily a disease of preterm infants due to surfactant deficiency, leading to atelectasis, V/Q mismatch, and respiratory failure; modern management emphasizes early non-invasive support and selective surfactant to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury and BPD, which frames all subsequent decisions [^0ef9606e] [^29e9f607].

> I need to state the treatment goals clearly and verify alignment with contemporary guidance. The aims are to maximize survival while minimizing complications such as air leaks and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, using lung-protective strategies that avoid mechanical ventilation when possible and prioritize early non-invasive support and timely surfactant when indicated [^0ef9606e] [^29e9f607].

> Next, I should review antenatal prevention because this is foundational. A single course of antenatal corticosteroids is recommended for all patients at high risk of preterm delivery from viability up to 34 completed weeks, ideally given at least 24 hours before birth; repeat dosing can be considered once if preterm birth risk persists after 7 days, but regularly scheduled repeat courses should be avoided, and administration is not recommended with chorioamnionitis or in late preterm planned cesarean without a compelling indication [^9c843de2] [^2639e66a] [^6a3f796a] [^c9afc839] [^481673e6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about delivery room management; I should confirm the lung-protective approach. For infants at risk of RDS, initiate CPAP or synchronized NIPPV from birth if not requiring intubation for stabilization, titrate oxygen to avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia, and maintain normothermia with plastic wrap and servo-controlled incubators to reduce complications [^ac366b11] [^4554edfa] [^0ef9606e].

> I will now examine non-invasive respiratory support as first-line therapy. CPAP reduces treatment failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality compared with supplemental oxygen alone, though pneumothorax risk may increase; synchronized NIPPV can be considered to reduce reventilation needs and BPD, and bilevel devices have not shown advantage over CPAP alone, so device selection should be individualized and protocolized [^2745fcd4] [^4ed2cd9b] [^0ef9606e].

> Wait, let me verify surfactant indications and timing because this is where practice has evolved. Early rescue surfactant is recommended when RDS is worsening, typically when FiO2 exceeds about 0.30 on CPAP at ≥ 6 cm H2O or when lung ultrasound suggests surfactant need; in intubated infants, early surfactant within 2 hours reduces mortality, pneumothorax, and chronic lung disease compared with delayed therapy, and animal-derived preparations are preferred over synthetic agents [^6d63443f] [^aaeea214] [^94fa3e6e].

> I should double-check dosing and administration technique. For rescue therapy, an initial dose of 200 mg/kg poractant alfa is recommended over 100 mg/kg poractant or 100 mg/kg beractant; less invasive surfactant administration (LISA/MIST) is preferred in spontaneously breathing infants on CPAP to avoid intubation and reduce BPD, with attention to local expertise, dosing volume, and surfactant type to optimize delivery [^37bf5a09] [^3753bde2] [^5f63c41d].

> Let me consider repeat dosing and special indications so I don't miss opportunities. Repeat surfactant is indicated if there is ongoing moderate-to-severe RDS with high oxygen needs after excluding other causes, and surfactant may be considered after pulmonary hemorrhage or in congenital pneumonia when surfactant inactivation is suspected, though evidence varies and decisions should be individualized [^70083e3b] [^5942bfba] [^2375573c].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to invasive ventilation and how to ventilate safely. Mechanical ventilation is reserved for failure of non-invasive support or severe decompensation, and when used, employ lung-protective modes such as volume-targeted ventilation or high-frequency oscillation, minimize duration, and avoid routine sedative infusions like morphine or midazolam that may prolong ventilation without clear benefit [^6e7220f9] [^173ddb6e] [^ff31235b].

> I need to ensure adjunctive therapies are addressed. Caffeine is standard to facilitate extubation and reduce BPD, and for hemodynamically significant PDA, consider pharmacologic closure with indomethacin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen, favoring acetaminophen if thrombocytopenia or renal concerns exist; fluid management should start around 70–80 mL/kg/day and be individualized to urine output, sodium, and weight loss to avoid edema or dehydration [^0ef9606e] [^6e0e446a] [^6f4233c5].

> But wait, what about supportive care that influences outcomes. Maintain normothermia, initiate parenteral nutrition from birth, and use antibiotics judiciously with early cessation when sepsis is ruled out; these elements reduce complications and improve overall outcomes in RDS care bundles [^0ef9606e] [^acb95cce] [^88c04375].

> I should confirm special populations and caveats. For infants ≤ 24 weeks, evidence is limited and extrapolation from older gestations should be cautious; in resource-limited settings, prioritizing CPAP and surfactant access yields the greatest mortality impact; in term or near-term infants with surfactant inactivation states such as meconium aspiration, surfactant may reduce ECMO use even if mortality is unchanged, so case-by-case use is reasonable [^0ef9606e] [^1685f528] [^c01398e3].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Antenatally, give steroids when indicated and arrange perinatal center transfer; in the delivery room, stabilize with CPAP/NIPPV, titrate oxygen, and maintain temperature; postnatally, escalate support if FiO2 rises on CPAP and give early rescue surfactant via LISA when indicated; if non-invasive support fails, intubate and use lung-protective ventilation with caffeine; reassess for repeat surfactant, manage PDA and fluids proactively, and wean ventilation as soon as feasible while maintaining supportive care [^0ef9606e] [^29e9f607].

> Finally, I should review monitoring and quality metrics to close the loop. Track antenatal steroid coverage, CPAP initiation rates, surfactant timing and method, mechanical ventilation duration, BPD rates, and neurodevelopmental outcomes; align local protocols with European and WHO guidance and participate in audits to reduce unwarranted variation and continuously improve care [^0ef9606e] [^4554edfa].

Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is best managed with a **lung-protective, stepwise approach** that starts with antenatal corticosteroids to reduce risk, followed by early non-invasive support (CPAP or NIPPV) to stabilize breathing, and timely surfactant when indicated [^9c843de2] [^ac366b11] [^6d63443f]. Early surfactant (within 2 hours) for intubated infants improves survival and reduces air leaks and chronic lung disease [^aaeea214]; **less invasive surfactant administration (LISA/MIST)** is preferred in spontaneously breathing infants on CPAP to avoid intubation and reduce BPD [^3753bde2] [^5f63c41d]. Supportive care includes strict temperature control, judicious fluids, caffeine to facilitate extubation, and antibiotics only when indicated [^0ef9606e] [^6f4233c5] [^88c04375]. Mechanical ventilation is reserved for CPAP failure, using lung-protective modes and minimizing duration to reduce BPD risk [^6e7220f9] [^173ddb6e].

---

## Antenatal prevention

- **Antenatal corticosteroids**: A single course is recommended for all patients at high risk of preterm delivery from viability to 34 weeks, ideally given at least 24 hours before birth [^9c843de2] [^2b941f7c].

- **Repeat dosing**: Consider a single repeat course if preterm birth risk persists after 7 days, but avoid regular or serial courses [^2639e66a] [^6a3f796a].

- **Maternal transfer**: Transfer to a perinatal center with appropriate neonatal care capabilities is recommended when feasible [^2caa7f32].

---

## Initial stabilization and respiratory support

- **Non-invasive support**: Initiate CPAP or synchronized NIPPV from birth in preterm infants with signs of RDS to reduce mechanical ventilation and BPD [^ac366b11] [^5213bbd1].

- **Oxygen titration**: Use pulse oximetry to target SpO2 90–95% to avoid hypoxemia and hyperoxia [^notfound].

- **Temperature control**: Maintain normothermia with plastic bags, hats, and servo-controlled incubators to reduce morbidity [^notfound].

---

## Surfactant replacement therapy

- **Indications**: Give surfactant early in the course of RDS, typically when FiO2 > 0.30 on CPAP ≥ 6 cm H2O or if lung ultrasound suggests need [^6d63443f].

- **Timing**: Early surfactant (within 2 hours) in intubated infants reduces mortality, air leaks, and chronic lung disease [^aaeea214] [^9c511d8f].

- **Preparation**: Animal-derived surfactants (e.g. poractant alfa) are preferred over synthetic preparations [^94fa3e6e].

- **Dosing**: Use 200 mg/kg poractant alfa for rescue therapy when available [^37bf5a09].

- **Administration**: Prefer LISA/MIST in spontaneously breathing infants on CPAP to avoid intubation and reduce BPD [^3753bde2] [^5f63c41d].

- **Repeat dosing**: Give a second or third dose if ongoing RDS is present and other causes are excluded [^70083e3b].

---

## Mechanical ventilation

Reserve mechanical ventilation for **CPAP failure or severe RDS**, and use **lung-protective strategies** — volume-targeted ventilation or high-frequency oscillation — to minimize volutrauma and barotrauma [^6e7220f9] [^173ddb6e]. Minimize the duration of ventilation and use caffeine to facilitate extubation and reduce BPD [^0ef9606e].

---

## Supportive care

- **Fluid management**: Start IV fluids at 70–80 mL/kg/day and tailor to urine output, sodium, and weight loss [^6f4233c5].

- **Nutrition**: Initiate parenteral nutrition from birth and advance enteral feeds as tolerated [^acb95cce].

- **Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**: Treat hemodynamically significant PDA with indomethacin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen, preferring acetaminophen if thrombocytopenia or renal concerns exist [^6e0e446a].

- **Antibiotics**: Use judiciously and stop early when sepsis is ruled out [^88c04375].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuously monitor **respiratory status**, oxygen saturation, blood gases, and signs of deterioration. Conduct regular cranial ultrasounds to screen for intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia, and arrange long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up to detect and manage sequelae [^notfound].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Antenatal corticosteroids | Preterm labor < 34 weeks |
| 2 | CPAP/NIPPV | Clinical RDS |
| 3 | Surfactant (LISA/MIST) | FiO2 > 0.30 on CPAP ≥ 6 cm H2O |
| 4 | Mechanical ventilation | CPAP failure or severe RDS |
| 5 | Supportive care | All infants |

Despite recent advances in the perinatal management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), controversies still exist. We report updated recommendations of a European Panel of expert neonatologists who developed consensus guidelines after critical examination of the most up-to-date evidence in 2007 and 2010. This second update of the guidelines is based upon published evidence up to the end of 2012. Strong evidence exists for the role of antenatal steroids in RDS prevention, but it is still not clear if the benefit of repeated courses on respiratory outcomes outweighs the risk of adverse outcomes in the short and long term. Many practices involved in preterm neonatal stabilization at birth are not evidence based, including oxygen administration and positive pressure lung inflation, and they may at times be harmful. Surfactant replacement therapy is crucial in the management of RDS but the best preparation, optimal dose and timing of administration at different gestations is not completely clear. In addition, use of very early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has altered the indications for prophylactic surfactant administration. Respiratory support in the form of mechanical ventilation may be lifesaving but can cause lung injury, and protocols should be directed at avoiding mechanical ventilation where possible by using non-invasive respiratory support such as CPAP. For babies with RDS to have best outcomes, it is essential that they have optimal supportive care, including maintenance of normal body temperature, proper fluid management, good nutritional support, appropriate management of the ductus arteriosus and support of the circulation to maintain adequate tissue perfusion.

Despite recent advances in the perinatal management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), controversies still exist. We report the updated recommendations of a European panel of expert neonatologists who had developed consensus guidelines after critical examination of the most up-to-date evidence in 2007. These updated guidelines are based upon published evidence up to the end of 2009. Strong evidence exists for the role of a single course of antenatal steroids in RDS prevention, but the potential benefit and long-term safety of repeated courses are unclear.

Surfactant replacement therapy is crucial in the management of RDS, but the best preparation, optimal dose and timing of administration at different gestations is not always clear. Respiratory support in the form of mechanical ventilation may also be lifesaving, but can cause lung injury, and protocols should be directed at avoiding mechanical ventilation where possible by using nasal continuous positive airways pressure or nasal ventilation. For babies with RDS to have best outcomes, it is essential that they have optimal supportive care, including maintenance of a normal body temperature, proper fluid management, good nutritional support, management of the ductus arteriosus and support of the circulation to maintain adequate tissue perfusion.

### Management of respiratory distress syndrome: an update [^e7876eaa]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress syndrome is the most common respiratory disorder in preterm infants. Over the last decade, because of improvements in neonatal care and increased use of antenatal steroids and surfactant replacement therapy, mortality from respiratory distress syndrome has dropped substantially. However, respiratory morbidity, primarily bronchopulmonary dysplasia, remains unacceptably high. The management of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants is based on various modalities of respiratory support and the application of fundamental principles of neonatal care. To obtain best results, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial. This review discusses surfactant replacement therapy and some of the current strategies in ventilatory management of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome-2016 update [^e02fb9c2]. Neonatology (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) ensure that clinicians must continue to revise current practice. We report the third update of the European Guidelines for the Management of RDS by a European panel of expert neonatologists including input from an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the beginning of 2016. Optimizing the outcome for babies with RDS includes consideration of when to use antenatal steroids, and good obstetric practice includes methods of predicting the risk of preterm delivery and also consideration of whether transfer to a perinatal centre is necessary and safe. Methods for optimal delivery room management have become more evidence based, and protocols for lung protection, including initiation of continuous positive airway pressure and titration of oxygen, should be implemented from soon after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of the management of RDS, and newer protocols for surfactant administration are aimed at avoiding exposure to mechanical ventilation, and there is more evidence of differences among various surfactants in clinical use. Newer methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been developed and offer potential for greater comfort and less chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease although minimizing the time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and if necessary postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimizing the general care of infants with RDS are also essential with good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion and judicious use of antibiotics all being important determinants of best outcome.

### Neonatal mortality from respiratory distress syndrome: lessons for low-resource countries [^1685f528]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a major contributor to neonatal mortality worldwide. However, little information is available regarding rates of RDS-specific mortality in low-income countries, and technologies for RDS treatment are used inconsistently in different health care settings. Our objective was to better understand the interventions that have decreased the rates of RDS-specific mortality in high-income countries over the past 60 years. We then estimated the effects on RDS-specific mortality in low-resource settings. Of the sequential introduction of technologies and therapies for RDS, widespread use of oxygen and continuous positive airway pressure were associated with the time periods that demonstrated the greatest decline in RDS-specific mortality. We argue that these 2 interventions applied widely in low-resource settings, with appropriate supportive infrastructure and general newborn care, will have the greatest impact on decreasing neonatal mortality. This historical perspective can inform policy-makers for the prioritization of scarce resources to improve survival rates for newborns worldwide.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome-2019 update [^2caa7f32]. Neonatology (2019). Medium credibility.

As management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) advances, clinicians must continually revise their current practice. We report the fourth update of "European Guidelines for the Management of RDS" by a European panel of experienced neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the end of 2018. Optimising outcome for babies with RDS includes prediction of risk of preterm delivery, need for appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal centre and timely use of antenatal steroids. Delivery room management has become more evidence-based, and protocols for lung protection including initiation of CPAP and titration of oxygen should be implemented immediately after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of management of RDS, and newer protocols for its use recommend early administration and avoidance of mechanical ventilation. Methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been further developed and may cause less distress and reduce chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease, although minimising time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and, if necessary, postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimising general care of infants with RDS are also essential with good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion and judicious use of antibiotics all being important determinants of best outcome.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^29e9f607]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) care pathways evolve slowly as new evidence emerges. We report the sixth version of "European Guidelines for the Management of RDS" by a panel of experienced European neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to end of 2022. Optimising outcome for babies with RDS includes prediction of risk of preterm delivery, appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal centre, and appropriate and timely use of antenatal steroids. Evidence-based lung-protective management includes initiation of non-invasive respiratory support from birth, judicious use of oxygen, early surfactant administration, caffeine therapy, and avoidance of intubation and mechanical ventilation where possible. Methods of ongoing non-invasive respiratory support have been further refined and may help reduce chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease, although minimising time spent on mechanical ventilation by targeted use of postnatal corticosteroids remains essential. The general care of infants with RDS is also reviewed, including emphasis on appropriate cardiovascular support and judicious use of antibiotics as being important determinants of best outcome. We would like to dedicate this guideline to the memory of Professor Henry Halliday who died on November 12, 2022. These updated guidelines contain evidence from recent Cochrane reviews and medical literature since 2019. Strength of evidence supporting recommendations has been evaluated using the GRADE system. There are changes to some of the previous recommendations as well as some changes to the strength of evidence supporting recommendations that have not changed. This guideline has been endorsed by the European Society for Paediatric Research (ESPR) and the Union of European Neonatal and Perinatal Societies (UENPS).

### Equipoise in research and the development of neonatal interventions for the management of respiratory distress syndrome: a historical perspective [^7e4fce66]. American Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

The historical review of how evidence was developed for the management of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants has not been clearly characterized. Knowledge of this process is essential to understand the role of equipoise and its influence on the decision to evaluate interventions as they were implemented in the practice of medicine. We suspect that errant approaches to clinical equipoise secondary to states of false certainty and false uncertainty have been important barriers to the timely acquisition and implementation of evidence-based knowledge necessary to improve outcomes in this fragile population of infants. When confronted with the decision to test an intervention, physicians should question whether they have lost clinical equipoise based on opinion, expertise, or observational data rather than evidence obtained from methodological inquiry; doing so facilitates reaching clinical equipoise and promotes the application of scientific methodology to answer relevant clinical questions. Timely acquisition of evidence-based knowledge can be viewed as an ethical imperative when the status quo may have negative consequences on outcomes for generations.

Introduction

Survival of preterm infants continues to improve, with those at 22–23 weeks of gestation now having reasonable chances of making it home to their families. There is a growing trend towards offering initial life support to infants born at lower perceived levels of viability, which in some countries is now defined as low as 22 weeks of gestation. However, we caution that recommendations given in these guidelines are based on evidence from studies, which almost without exception, have been generated in times where the resuscitation of the most preterm infants was not often attempted, and until very recently, infants of the lowest gestations were not included in clinical trials. We therefore recommend caution when applying current recommendations to the most preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Until more evidence is available, these guidelines apply mainly to management of RDS in infants with gestational ages of greater than 24 weeks. Managing RDS remains a key component of neonatal intensive care. European data from 2014 to 2016 show that around 50% of all babies born between 22 +0 and 32 +6 weeks receive surfactant; therefore, relevant skills for surfactant administration and mechanical ventilation (MV) remain important.

RDS is caused by pulmonary immaturity and surfactant deficiency, resulting in respiratory insufficiency from soon after birth. There is now less emphasis on radiographic diagnosis and grading of RDS, such as "ground glass with air bronchograms." Definitions based on blood gas analyses are also redundant, as management has moved towards an approach of pre-emptive treatment with surfactant based on clinical assessment of work of breathing and inspired oxygen requirement to avoid worsening RDS. The aim of modern RDS management is to maximise survival while minimising complications such as air leaks and BPD. Many strategies for prevention and treatment of RDS and providing early respiratory support have been tested in clinical trials and are summarised in updated systematic reviews, all of which inform these guidelines. This current version updates previous versions after critical examination of the most recent evidence available to end of 2022. We have again used a format of summarising management strategies followed by evidence-based recommendations according to the GRADE system to reflect the authors' judgement of the evidence supporting each of the statements (Table 1). Summary of recommendations is shown in Table 2.

### Early versus delayed selective surfactant treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome [^aaeea214]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical trials have confirmed that surfactant therapy is effective in improving the immediate need for respiratory support and the clinical outcome of premature newborns. Trials have studied a wide variety of surfactant preparations used either to prevent (prophylactic or delivery room administration) or treat (selective or rescue administration) respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Using either treatment strategy, significant reductions in the incidence of pneumothorax, as well as significant improvement in survival, have been noted. It is unclear whether there are any advantages to treating infants with respiratory insufficiency earlier in the course of RDS.

Objectives

To compare the effects of early versus delayed selective surfactant therapy for newborns intubated for respiratory distress within the first two hours of life. Planned subgroup analyses included separate comparisons for studies utilizing natural surfactant extract and synthetic surfactant.

Search Methods

We searched the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE (MeSH terms: pulmonary surfactant; text word: early; limits: age, newborn: publication type, clinical trial), PubMed, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants, and journal handsearching in the English language. For the updated search in April 2012 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, 2012, Issue 1) and PubMed (January 1997 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials comparing early selective surfactant administration (surfactant administration via the endotracheal tube in infants intubated for respiratory distress, not specifically for surfactant dosage) within the first two hours of life versus delayed selective surfactant administration to infants with established RDS were considered for review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data regarding clinical outcomes were excerpted from the reports of the clinical trials by the review authors. Subgroup analyses were performed based on type of surfactant preparation, gestational age, and exposure to prenatal steroids. Data analysis was performed in accordance with the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

Main Results

Six randomized controlled trials met selection criteria. Two of the trials utilized synthetic surfactant (Exosurf Neonatal) and four utilized animal-derived surfactant preparations. The meta-analyses demonstrate significant reductions in the risk of neonatal mortality (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.95; typical risk difference (RD) -0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; 6 studies; 3577 infants), chronic lung disease (typical RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86; typical RD -0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; 3 studies; 3041 infants), and chronic lung disease or death at 36 weeks (typical RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.91; typical RD -0.06; 95% CI -0.09 to -0.03; 3 studies; 3050 infants) associated with early treatment of intubated infants with RDS. Intubated infants randomized to early selective surfactant administration also demonstrated a decreased risk of acute lung injury including a decreased risk of pneumothorax (typical RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.82; typical RD -0.05; 95% CI -0.08 to -0.03; 5 studies; 3545 infants), pulmonary interstitial emphysema (typical RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.89; typical RD -0.06; 95% CI -0.10 to -0.02; 3 studies; 780 infants), and overall air leak syndromes (typical RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.78; typical RD -0.18; 95% CI -0.26 to -0.09; 2 studies; 463 infants). A trend toward risk reduction for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death at 28 days was also evident (typical RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00; typical RD -0.04; 95% CI -0.07 to -0.00; 3 studies; 3039 infants). No differences in other complications of RDS or prematurity were noted. Only two studies reported on infants under 30 weeks' gestation. Decreased risk of neonatal mortality and chronic lung disease or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age was noted.

Authors' Conclusions

Early selective surfactant administration given to infants with RDS requiring assisted ventilation leads to a decreased risk of acute pulmonary injury (decreased risk of pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema) and a decreased risk of neonatal mortality and chronic lung disease compared to delaying treatment of such infants until they develop worsening RDS.

### Tocolytic therapy for preterm delivery: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c177ec23]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome

For the outcome neonatal respiratory distress syndrome 42 trials were included in the network meta-analysis and 37 in the pairwise meta-analyses. Five trials were excluded from the pairwise meta-analyses as they compared treatments from within the same class. Direct evidence was available for 13 class versus class pairwise comparisons (see supplementary appendix 2 for the full results). Heterogeneity between trials was not evident in any comparison.

Fig 5 shows the posterior median odds ratios (95% credible intervals) from each pairwise meta-analysis alongside the posterior median odds ratios for the full suite of 21 class comparisons available from the network meta-analysis for respiratory distress syndrome.

The results from the network meta-analysis (table and fig 5) suggested no evidence of a difference between the classes in reducing respiratory distress syndrome and no clear effect compared with placebo. The rankograms (fig 7) suggested that calcium channel blockers were the best class for reducing respiratory distress syndrome; however, this probability was only 47% and so indicative of considerable uncertainty. The probability that calcium channel blockers were ranked in the top three classes for reducing respiratory distress syndrome was 80%. The worst performing class was the others, with only an 11% probability of being in the top three classes for reducing respiratory distress syndrome.

### Core concepts: respiratory distress syndrome… [^5244ae0e]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory distress syndrome is seen primarily in the preterm neonate and is due mostly to pulmonary surfactant deficiency. Lung atelectasis leads to ventilation-perfusion mismatching, hypoxia, and eventual respiratory failure in the untreated infant who has RDS. RDS is diagnosed by physical findings consistent with respiratory distress and characteristic radiographic findings. Treatment of RDS begins antenatally with the administration of maternal steroids to women at risk of preterm delivery between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation. The use of repeat doses of antenatal steroids is under investigation but is currently not recommended outside of randomized, controlled trials. SRT has been approved for use since 1990 and has been successful in decreasing rates of RDS. Natural surfactant is currently recommended for use, but synthetic surfactant that contains proteins to mimic surfactant proteins is being investigated.

In general, prophylactic use of surfactant is recommended over rescue treatment in infants at high risk for developing RDS, but the determination of which infants are at high risk for developing RDS remains a clinical one. The push toward use of less invasive ventilation strategies in the treatment of RDS has led to several trials of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Results of the SUPPORT trial are pending, but the COIN trial has concluded that nCPAP use in infants who have RDS is not detrimental. Inhaled nitric oxide for RDS still requires investigation on safety and efficacy. Several other treatments have been studied, but as of yet, only inositol administration shows promise in the treatment of RDS. Several complications of the recommended treatments for RDS have been identified, but the benefits far outweigh the risks. Finally, there remains a need for long-term follow-up studies on preterm infants treated for RDS to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Surfactant replacement therapy in the neonate: beyond respiratory distress syndrome [^9f342f45]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Surfactant-replacement therapy is a life-saving treatment for preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, a disorder characterized by surfactant deficiency. Repletion with exogenous surfactant decreases mortality and thoracic air leaks and is a standard practice in the developed world. In addition to respiratory distress syndrome, other neonatal respiratory disorders are characterized by surfactant deficiency, which may result from decreased synthesis or inactivation. Two of these disorders, meconium aspiration syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, might also be amenable to surfactant-replacement therapy. This paper discusses the use of surfactant-replacement therapy beyond respiratory distress syndrome and examines the evidence to date.

### Progesterone after previous preterm birth for prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (PROGRESS): a randomised controlled trial [^34726a28]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Sample Size

The clinical endpoint of respiratory distress syndrome has been chosen as the primary endpoint. For women eligible for this trial, the best estimate of the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome is 15%, using information from a randomised trial with similar eligibility profile. A sample size of 984 women will be able to show a 40% reduction in respiratory distress syndrome from 15% to 9% (5% level of significance, two-tailed alpha, 80% power).

Analysis and Reporting of Results

The initial analysis will examine baseline characteristics of all randomised women, as an indication of comparable treatment groups. Outcome comparisons for women and infants will be analysed for the primary and secondary outcomes on an "intention to treat" basis, according to treatment allocation at randomisation to either progesterone or placebo. The relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be reported for the major outcomes, and the number needed to treat to prevent one adverse outcome will be calculated. Regression techniques will be used to examine the influence of prognostic factors on the major outcomes.

### Multiple versus single doses of exogenous surfactant for the prevention or treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome [^a5c78ab7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of surfactant therapy in the treatment of infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Due to surfactant inactivation, multiple doses of surfactant may lead to improved outcome.

Objectives

To determine the effect of multiple doses of exogenous surfactant compared to single doses of exogenous surfactant on mortality and complications of prematurity in premature infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome.

Search Strategy

For the initial search in 1999, searches were made of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Medline (MeSH terms: pulmonary surfactant; limits: age groups, newborn infant; publication type, clinical trials), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants, and journal hand searching in the English language. In June 2008, the searches were updated including Medline, Cinhal and Embase using similar terms as the original search.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing a policy of multiple doses of surfactant to a policy of single doses of surfactant extract in premature infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome were considered for this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data on clinical outcomes including pneumothorax, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage (all intraventricular hemorrhage and severe intraventricular hemorrhage), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and mortality were excerpted by the both reviewers (R. Soll; E. Ozek). For this update additional data were sought on pulmonary hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, neurodevelopmental follow-up, rehospitalization for pulmonary reasons, and reactive airway disease. Data were analyzed according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

Main Results

Three trials were identified that met study criteria. Two studies were randomized controlled trials of multiple vs. single dose animal derived surfactant extract in infants with established respiratory distress syndrome. Meta-analysis of these trials suggests a reduction in the risk of pneumothorax (typical relative risk 0.51, 95% CI 0.30, 0.88; typical risk difference-0.09, 95% CI -0.15, -0.02) and a trend towards a reduction in the risk of mortality (typical relative risk 0.63, 95% CI 0.39, 1.02; typical risk difference -0.07, 95% CI -0.14, 00.00). One study of multiple vs. single dose synthetic surfactant in infants at high risk of respiratory distress syndrome was identified. This study reported a decrease in NEC (relative risk 0.20, 95% CI 0.08, 0.51; risk difference-0.05, 95% CI -0.07, -0.02) and mortality (relative risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.39, 0.81; risk difference-0.07, 95% CI -0.12, -0.03)No data on long-term neurological or pulmonary outcome were reported. No complications associated with multiple dose treatment were reported in the identified trials.

Authors' Conclusions

In infants with established respiratory distress, a policy of multiple doses of animal derived surfactant extract resulted in greater improvements regarding oxygenation and ventilatory requirements, a decreased risk of pneumothorax and a trend toward improved survival. In infants at high risk of respiratory distress, a policy of multiple doses of synthetic surfactant resulted in greater improvements regarding oxygenation and ventilatory requirements, a decreased risk of NEC and decreased mortality. The ability to give multiple doses of surfactant to infants with ongoing respiratory insufficiency leads to improved clinical outcome and appears to be the most effective treatment policy.

### Exogenous surfactant therapy in 2013: what is next? Who, when and how should we treat newborn infants in the future? [^c4d40f11]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Surfactant therapy is one of the few treatments that have dramatically changed clinical practice in neonatology. In addition to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), surfactant deficiency is observed in many other clinical situations in term and preterm infants, raising several questions regarding the use of surfactant therapy.

Objectives

This review focuses on several points of interest, including some controversial or confusing topics being faced by clinicians together with emerging or innovative concepts and techniques, according to the state of the art and the published literature as of 2013. Surfactant therapy has primarily focused on RDS in the preterm newborn. However, whether this treatment would be of benefit to a more heterogeneous population of infants with lung diseases other than RDS needs to be determined. Early trials have highlighted the benefits of prophylactic surfactant administration to newborns judged to be at risk of developing RDS. In preterm newborns that have undergone prenatal lung maturation with steroids and early treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the criteria for surfactant administration, including the optimal time and the severity of RDS, are still under discussion. Tracheal intubation is no longer systematically done for surfactant administration to newborns. Alternative modes of surfactant administration, including minimally-invasive and aerosolized delivery, could thus allow this treatment to be used in cases of RDS in unstable preterm newborns, in whom the tracheal intubation procedure still poses an ethical and medical challenge.

Conclusion

The optimization of the uses and methods of surfactant administration will be one of the most important challenges in neonatal intensive care in the years to come.

### Ambroxol for women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory distress syndrome [^aec2bb6f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant (an active agent that keeps pulmonary alveoli open and facilitates the entry of air to the lungs, thus improving the oxygenation of the newborn). A number of interventions such as pulmonary surfactant and prenatal corticosteroids are used to prevent RDS. Ambroxol has been studied as a potential agent to prevent RDS, but effectiveness and safety has yet to be evaluated.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of giving ambroxol to pregnant women who are at risk of preterm birth, for preventing neonatal RDS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (29 November 2013), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 11), Embase (1988 to November 2013), MEDLINE (PubMed 1970 to November 2013), LILACS (1982 to November 2013), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (November 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of ambroxol given to pregnant women at risk of preterm birth versus placebo, antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone or dexamethasone), or no treatment. We did not identify any trials comparing ambroxol with dexamethasone (corticosteroid) in this review. Nor did we identify any trials comparing ambroxol combined with corticosteroid versus corticosteroid alone, or placebo/no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included 14 studies (in 18 trial reports), involving 1047 pregnant women at risk of preterm birth with 1077 newborns. However, three of the included studies did not report on this review's outcomes of interest. We carried out two main comparisons: ambroxol versus antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone); and ambroxol versus placebo or no treatment. Seven RCTs provided data for our comparison of ambroxol versus corticosteroid (betamethasone) and two trials contributed data to our comparison of ambroxol compared to placebo or no treatment. The included studies were generally judged as having either 'low' risk of bias or 'unclear' risk of bias (because the trial reports provided insufficient details about methods of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding). Primary outcomesThere was no clear evidence of a difference in the incidence of RDS among newborns born to women who received ambroxol when compared to newborns of women who were given the corticosteroid, betamethasone (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.07, seven RCTs, 728 women/758 newborns, moderate quality evidence) or placebo/no treatment (average RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20, two studies, 204 women/204 newborns, T2 = 0.07; I(2) = 53%, low-quality evidence). Results were imprecise and consistent with appreciable benefit as well as negligible effect. Similarly, there was no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of perinatal mortality between the group of women who received ambroxol and women in the corticosteroid (betamethasone) group (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.12, six studies, 648 women/657 newborns, moderate quality evidence) or the placebo/no treatment group (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.98, one study, 116 women/116 newborns, low-quality evidence). In terms of maternal adverse effects, there was no clear differences (in nausea or vomiting) between those women who received ambroxol compared to either those women who received corticosteroids (betamethasone) (average RR 3.45; 95% CI 0.34 to 35.51, three studies, 305 women, T(2) = 2.82; I(2) = 67%, very low-quality evidence), or women who received placebo or no treatment (RR 1.79; 95% CI 0.45 to 7.13, one study, 116 women, low-quality evidence). No other adverse effects (e.g. diarrhoea, gastric irritation and headache) were reported in the included studies. Secondary outcomesFor the review's secondary outcomes, none of the included studies reported on the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis or rate of maternal mortality. One small trial (involving 88 women) comparing ambroxol with placebo or no treatment, reported no difference between groups in terms of the need for mechanical ventilation in the neonate (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.21, 88 women/88 babies, low-quality evidence) or the administration of pulmonary surfactant (RR 1.19; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.30, one RCT, 88 women/88 babies, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review is based on very low to moderate quality evidence from 14 small trials (many are published in the form of conference abstracts with minimal methodological details provided). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the practice of giving ambroxol to women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal RDS, perinatal mortality and adverse effects. More research is needed in order to fully evaluate the benefits and risks of this intervention.

### Treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in neonates diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome in a low-income country: a report from Bangladesh [^21612f0a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress syndrome remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality worldwide. This retrospective study describes practice patterns for respiratory distress syndrome in a resource-limited setting and seeks to identify both risk factors for mortality and beneficial treatment modalities. Health, demographic, and treatment data were collected. Potential associations were analyzed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Of 104 children included for analysis, 38 died. Although most children were initially treated with noninvasive respiratory support, 59 progressed to invasive ventilation. Requirement for invasive ventilation was associated with death. A clear trend toward improved survival in mechanically ventilated patients was seen with surfactant administration.

### Respiratory distress of the term newborn infant [^ad6828b4]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress is recognised as any signs of breathing difficulties in neonates. In the early neonatal period respiratory distress is common, occurring in up to 7% of newborn infants, resulting in significant numbers of term-born infants being admitted to neonatal units. Many risk factors are involved; the increasing number of term infants delivered by elective caesarean section has also increased the incidence. Additionally the risk decreases with each advancing week of gestation. At 37 weeks, the chances are three times greater than at 39–40 weeks gestation. Multiple conditions can present with features of respiratory distress. Common causes in term newborn infants include transient tachypnoea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate and pneumothorax. Early recognition of respiratory distress and initiation of appropriate treatment is important to ensure optimal outcomes. This review will discuss these common causes of respiratory distress in term-born infants.

### Surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants: United Kingdom national consensus [^5fe81e00]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Our aim was to develop consensus recommendations from United Kingdom (UK) neonatal specialists on the use of surfactant for the management of respiratory distress syndrome RDS in preterm infants. RDS due to surfactant deficiency is common in preterm infants. Signs, including tachypnoea, recessions, and grunting, usually commence shortly after birth, and increase in severity during the first 12–48 h of postnatal life. Significant RDS may require mechanical ventilation (MV) or noninvasive ventilatory support (NIV), both of which have potential to cause lung injury via a number of mechanisms. The aim of RDS management is to provide appropriate respiratory support whilst minimising complications and, ultimately, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Treatment with exogenous surfactant reduces requirement for positive pressure ventilation, mitigates risk of pulmonary air leak, and improves survival.

International consensus guidelines on management of RDS have been published; however, recent developments in the field of less invasive surfactant administration prompt the need for a UK national consensus on surfactant use in preterm infants with, or at risk of, RDS.

### Surfactant replacement therapy in preterm infants: a European survey [^a548477b]. Neonatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Exogenous surfactant is an undisputed treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome but its efficacy is highly dependent on the treatment strategy. International guidelines have published recommendations on the optimal surfactant replacement strategy.

Objective

To determine how evidence-based guidelines on surfactant replacement therapy are implemented in daily clinical practice.

Methods

Data on surfactant replacement therapy, including preparation, dosing and timing, were collected in 173 European neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) by questionnaire and in a cohort of preterm infants mechanically ventilated on two separate predefined dates in these units.

Results

All NICUs used animal-derived surfactant in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome, with Poractant being most widely used (86%). The most frequently used first dose was 100 mg/kg (58%) and 200 mg/kg (39%) and all NICUs allowed for repeat dosing. 39% of the NICUs claimed to use prophylactic treatment (< 15 min of life). Data on surfactant treatment were collected in 338 infants, with a median gestational age of 27 weeks and a birth weight of 860 g. All infants were treated with animal-derived surfactant. The median first dose was 168 mg/kg in the Poractant group compared with 100 mg/kg in the Beractant and Bovactant groups. Prophylactic treatment was used in 23% of the infants and 28% of the infants received surfactant > 2 h after birth. 43% of the infants received multiple doses.

Conclusions

With the exception of surfactant timing, guidelines on surfactant replacement therapy seem to be implemented in daily clinical practice in European NICUs.

### Respiratory distress in the newborn [^7d7c7581]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The most common etiology of neonatal respiratory distress is transient tachypnea of the newborn; this is triggered by excessive lung fluid, and symptoms usually resolve spontaneously. Respiratory distress syndrome can occur in premature infants as a result of surfactant deficiency and underdeveloped lung anatomy. Intervention with oxygenation, ventilation, and surfactant replacement is often necessary. Prenatal administration of corticosteroids between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn when the risk of preterm delivery is high. Meconium aspiration syndrome is thought to occur in utero as a result of fetal distress by hypoxia. The incidence is not reduced by use of amnio-infusion before delivery nor by suctioning of the infant during delivery. Treatment options are resuscitation, oxygenation, surfactant replacement, and ventilation. Other etiologies of respiratory distress include pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and congenital malformations; treatment is disease specific. Initial evaluation for persistent or severe respiratory distress may include complete blood count with differential, chest radiography, and pulse oximetry.

### Surfactant therapy guided by tests for lung maturity in preterm infants at risk of respiratory distress syndrome [^7e4501d0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Administration of various exogenous surfactant preparations has been shown to decrease lung injury and pneumothorax and improve survival in very preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). There is no consensus on the threshold for surfactant administration, to allow timely intervention and avoid over-treatment, also considering the invasiveness of the procedure and its cost. Rapid tests for lung maturity, which include the click test, lamellar body counts and stable microbubble test, might guide the identification of those infants needing surfactant administration.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency in preterm infants at risk for or having RDS. Comparison 1: In preterm infants at risk for RDS, does surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency compared to prophylactic surfactant administration to all high-risk infants minimize the need for surfactant treatment and prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia and mortality? Comparison 2: In preterm infants who require early respiratory support, does surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency compared to surfactant therapy provided to infants with RDS diagnosed on clinical and radiologic criteria minimize the need for surfactant treatment and prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia and mortality?

Search Methods

We searched in October 2022 CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase and three additional trial registries. We also screened the reference lists of included studies and related systematic reviews for studies not identified by the database searches.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating rapid tests after birth for surfactant deficiency in infants at high risk of RDS or requiring respiratory support. We specified two comparisons: 1)surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency versus prophylactic surfactant administration to all high-risk infants in extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks' gestation) and very preterm (28 to 32 weeks' gestation); 2)surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency versus surfactant therapy provided to preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation) with RDS diagnosed on clinical and radiologic criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used the fixed-effect model with risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD), with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data. Our primary outcomes were: neonatal mortality, mortality prior to hospital discharge, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and the composite outcome bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included three RCTs enrolling 562 newborn infants in this review. No studies compared surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency versus prophylactic surfactant administration to all high-risk infants. Comparing surfactant therapy guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency versus surfactant therapy provided to infants with RDS diagnosed on clinical and radiologic criteria. No studies reported neonatal mortality. Compared with surfactant therapy provided to infants with RDS diagnosed on clinical and radiologic criteria, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency on mortality prior to hospital discharge: RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.41, RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05, 562 participants, 3 studies; I² for RR and RD = 75% and 43%, respectively; very low-certainty evidence. Surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency may result in little to no difference in bronchopulmonary dysplasia: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.32, RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.04, 562 participants, 3 studies; I² for RR and RD = 0%; low-certainty evidence. No studies reported the composite outcome bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality. Surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency may result in little to no difference in surfactant utilization (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.11, RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.06, 562 participants, 3 studies, I² for RR and RD = 63% and 65%, respectively, low-certainty evidence), and any pneumothorax (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.92, RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.01, 506 participants, 2 studies, I² for RR and RD = 0%, low-certainty evidence) compared with surfactant therapy provided to infants with RDS diagnosed on clinical and radiologic criteria. No studies reported moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment. We identified two large ongoing RCTs.

Authors' Conclusions

No studies compared surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency to prophylactic surfactant administration to all high-risk infants. Low to very low-certainty evidence from three studies is available on surfactant therapy guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency versus surfactant therapy provided to infants with RDS diagnosed on clinical and radiologic criteria. No studies reported neonatal mortality, the composite outcome 'bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality', or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Compared with surfactant therapy provided to infants with RDS diagnosed on clinical and radiologic criteria, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency on mortality prior to hospital discharge. Surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency may result in little to no difference in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, surfactant utilization and any pneumothorax. The findings of the two large ongoing trials identified in this review are likely to have an important impact on establishing the effects of surfactant treatment guided by rapid tests for surfactant deficiency in preterm infants.

### RDS-NExT workshop: consensus statements for the use of surfactant in preterm neonates with RDS [^eaacd936]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in neonates is often defined as respiratory distress occurring within 6 h of birth and associated with radiographic features of a reticular-granular pattern, low lung volumes, and air bronchograms and is caused by an inadequate amount of surfactant. Other definitions use clinical signs and symptoms rather than radiographic data to confirm diagnosis. Although treating neonatal RDS with exogenous surfactant is lifesaving, the variability in criteria used to make the diagnosis contributes to the lack of consensus on treatment thresholds. Surfactant replacement therapy has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes, including reductions in mortality risk and risk of air leaks, in neonates with RDS.

Guidelines in the US published by the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) were last updated almost 10 years ago, in 2013 and 2014, respectively. More recent international guidelines have been published, including the European Consensus Guidelines on the Management of RDS: 2022 Update, the Turkish Neonatal Society Guidelines in 2019, and the Canadian Paediatric Society Position Statement Guideline in 2021. In addition, many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) create and adhere to their own protocols at the institutional level, for example, the Royal Children's Hospital, Starship Children's Hospital, and Alaska Native Medical Center. Recent reviews summarize current research and complement existing guidelines.

### Personalized medicine for the management of RDS in preterm neonates [^d0556f41]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Continuous positive airway pressure and surfactant represent the first- and second-line treatment for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm neonates, as European and American guidelines, since 2013 and 2014, respectively, started to recommend surfactant replacement only when continuous positive airway pressure fails. These recommendations, however, are not personalized to the individual physiopathology. Simple clinical algorithms may have improved the diffusion of neonatal care, but complex medical issues can hardly be addressed with simple solutions. The treatment of respiratory distress syndrome is a complex matter and can be only optimized with personalization. We performed a review of tools to individualize the management of respiratory distress syndrome based on physiopathology and actual patients' need, according to precision medicine principles. Advanced oxygenation metrics, lung ultrasound, electrical impedance tomography, and both quantitative and qualitative surfactant assays were examined. When these techniques were investigated with diagnostic accuracy studies, reliability measures have been meta-analysed. Amongst all these tools, quantitative lung ultrasound seems the more developed for the widespread use and has a higher diagnostic accuracy (meta-analytical AUC = 0.952 [95% CI: 0.951–0.953]). Surfactant adsorption (AUC = 0.840 [95% CI: 0.824–0.856]) and stable microbubble test (AUC = 0.800 [95% CI: 0.788–0.812]) also have good reliability, but need further industrial development. We advocate for a more accurate characterization and a personalized approach of respiratory distress syndrome. With the above-described currently available tools, it should be possible to personalize the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome according to physiopathol-ogy.

### Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for improving neonatal health outcomes [^a0792d75]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) are at risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and need for respiratory support due to lung immaturity. One course of prenatal corticosteroids, administered to women at risk of preterm birth, reduces the risk of respiratory morbidity and improves survival of their infants, but these benefits do not extend beyond seven days. Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids have been used for women at ongoing risk of preterm birth more than seven days after their first course of corticosteroids, with improvements in respiratory outcomes, but uncertainty remains about any long-term benefits and harms. This is an update of a review last published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety, using the best available evidence, of a repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids, given to women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids with the primary aim of reducing fetal and neonatal mortality and morbidity.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, including cluster-randomised trials, of women who had already received one course of corticosteroids seven or more days previously and were still at risk of preterm birth, randomised to further dose(s) or no repeat doses, with or without placebo. Quasi-randomised trials were excluded. Abstracts were accepted if they met specific criteria. All trials had to meet criteria for trustworthiness, including a search of the Retraction Watch database for retractions or expressions of concern about the trials or their publications.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods. Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trial quality and scientific integrity. We chose primary outcomes based on clinical importance as measures of effectiveness and safety, including serious outcomes, for the women and their fetuses/infants, infants in early childhood (age two to less than five years), the infant in mid- to late childhood (age five to less than 18 years) and the infant as an adult. We assessed risk of bias at the outcome level using the RoB 2 tool and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (4895 women and 5975 babies). High-certainty evidence from these trials indicated that treatment of women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroids, compared with no repeat corticosteroid treatment, reduced the risk of their infants experiencing the primary infant outcome of RDS (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.90; 3540 babies; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 11 to 29) and had little or no effect on chronic lung disease (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.22; 5661 babies). Moderate-certainty evidence indicated that the composite of serious infant outcomes was probably reduced with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroids (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97; 9 trials, 5736 babies; NNTB 39, 95% CI 24 to 158), as was severe lung disease (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; NNTB 45, 95% CI 27 to 256; 4955 babies). Moderate-certainty evidence could not exclude benefit or harm for fetal or neonatal or infant death less than one year of age (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24; 5849 babies), severe intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 5066 babies) and necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.22; 5736 babies). In women, moderate-certainty evidence found little or no effect on the likelihood of a caesarean birth (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; 4266 mothers). Benefit or harm could not be excluded for maternal death (RR 0.32, 95% 0.01 to 7.81; 437 women) and maternal sepsis (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.39; 4666 mothers). The evidence was unclear for risk of adverse effects and discontinuation of therapy due to maternal adverse effects. No trials reported breastfeeding status at hospital discharge or risk of admission to the intensive care unit. At early childhood follow-up, moderate- to high-certainty evidence identified little or no effect of exposure to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with no repeat corticosteroids for primary outcomes relating to neurodevelopment (neurodevelopmental impairment: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10; 3616 children), survival without neurodevelopmental impairment (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 3845 children) and survival without major neurodevelopmental impairment (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.05; 1816 children). An increase or decrease in the risk of death since randomisation could not be excluded (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.40; 5 trials, 4565 babies randomised). At mid-childhood follow-up, moderate-certainty evidence identified little or no effect of exposure to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with no repeat corticosteroids on survival free of neurocognitive impairment (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; 963 children) or survival free of major neurocognitive impairment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.04; 2682 children). Benefit or harm could not be excluded for death since randomisation (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.26; 2874 babies randomised) and any neurocognitive impairment (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.29; 897 children). No trials reported data for follow-up into adolescence or adulthood. Risk of bias across outcomes was generally low although there were some concerns of bias. For childhood follow-up, most outcomes had some concerns of risk of bias due to missing data from loss to follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

The short-term benefits for babies included less respiratory distress and fewer serious health problems in the first few weeks after birth with repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course. The current available evidence reassuringly shows no significant harm for the women or child in early and mid-childhood, although no benefit. Further research is needed on the long-term benefits and risks for the baby into adulthood.

### Surfactant for respiratory distress syndrome: new ideas on a familiar drug with innovative applications [^fc8b819f]. Neonatology (2017). Low credibility.

In the last 4 decades, advances in neonatology have led to a significant increase in the survival of preterm infants. One of the biggest advances was the introduction of surfactant replacement therapy for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. This is the main cause of respiratory insufficiency in preterm infants and is one of the major causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Surfactant replacement therapy is already a well-investigated and established therapy in neonatology. However, surfactant replacement therapy has progressed and been refined over recent decades, especially with the increasing care for preterm infants born before 26 weeks' gestational age and the recent clinical focus on avoiding mechanical ventilation. Clinical evidence is evolving on new types of surfactant, surfactant dosages, co-medication given before, with, or after surfactant replacement, and new technical advances regarding the mode of administration.

### Exogenous surfactant therapy in 2013: what is next? Who, when and how should we treat newborn infants in the future? [^c68caaae]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

National guidelines for exogenous surfactant administration

Table 1 summarizes national recommendations for surfactant prophylactic use. The British Association of Perinatal Medicine recommended in 1999 that very preterm infants, born before 32 weeks GA be treated with exogenous surfactant at birth only if they needed intubation, and that all very preterm infants below 29 GA be intubated for the administration of exogenous surfactant. More recently, in 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on the Fetus and Newborn has recommended using surfactant in infants with RDS as soon as possible after intubation, irrespective of exposure to antenatal steroids or gestational age. They have also recommended that prophylactic surfactant treatment be administered to extremely preterm infants (< 28 weeks GA) at high risk of RDS, especially infants who have not been exposed to antenatal steroids. The Canadian Paediatric society has advocated that intubated infants with RDS receive exogenous surfactant therapy, and that infants at significant risk of RDS receive prophylactic surfactant treatment as soon as they are stable, within a few minutes of intubation. The consensus guidelines developed by European experts in neonatology recommend prophylactic surfactant administration to all extremely preterm infants born at less than 26 weeks GA and to all preterm infants with RDS who require intubation for stabilization. In addition, they recommend that early rescue surfactant therapy be administrated to untreated preterm infants with RDS. In a recent update of European consensus guidelines on the management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants, the experts state that the best preparation, optimal dose and timing of surfactant administration at different gestational ages is not completely clear. In addition, the use of very early CPAP has altered the indications for prophylactic surfactant administration.

Table 1
International guidelines for RDS treatment

A European survey conducted in 2011 has analysed the incorporation of guidelines for surfactant therapy into clinical practice in 173 NICUs across 21 European countries. Only 39% of the NICUs used prophylactic treatment. Twenty-three % of preterm infants received their first surfactant dose within the first 15 minutes after birth, while 28% of them received it after 2 hours of life. A gestational age of less than 28 weeks and a birth weight of less than 1000 g were used as criteria for prophylactic treatment in most of NICUs. Eighty eight % used a median FiO 2 of greater than 0.40 as the indication for rescue surfactant treatment, at a median time of 2 hour after birth.

### A comparison of 2 doses of antenatal dexamethasone for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome: an open-label, noninferiority, pragmatic randomized trial [^edcdf9a9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antenatal corticosteroids have been used for the prevention of respiratory complications, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and other adverse neonatal outcomes for over 50 years, with limited evidence about their optimal doses. Higher steroid doses or frequencies of antenatal corticosteroids in preterm newborns pose adverse effects such as prolonged adrenal suppression, negative effects on fetal programming and metabolism, and increased risks of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological impairments. Conversely, lower doses of antenatal corticosteroids may be an effective alternative to induce fetal lung maturation with less risk to the fetus. Late preterm births represent the largest population of all preterm neonates, with a respiratory distress syndrome risk of 8.83%. Therefore, determining the optimal antenatal corticosteroid dosage is of particular importance for this population.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of 5-mg and 6-mg dexamethasone in preventing neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in women with preterm births at 32 0 to 36 6 weeks of gestation.

Study Design

This was an open-label, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial. Singleton pregnant women (n = 370) at 32 0 to 36 6 weeks of gestation with spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes were enrolled. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to a 5-mg or 6-mg dexamethasone group. Dexamethasone was administered intramuscularly every 12 hours for 4 doses or until delivery. The primary outcome was the reduction in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome cases, whereas the secondary outcomes were any adverse maternal or neonatal events.

Results

Between December 2020 and April 2022, 370 eligible women, anticipating deliveries within the gestational range of 32 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks, willingly participated in the study. They were evenly split, with 185 women assigned to the 5-mg group and 185 to the 6-mg group. The study revealed that the demographic profiles of the participants in the 2 groups were remarkably similar, with no statistically significant disparities (P > .05). It is noteworthy that most of these women gave birth after 34 weeks of gestation. Despite a substantial proportion not completing the full course of steroid treatment, the 5-mg dose exhibited noninferiority compared with the 6-mg dose of dexamethasone, as indicated by a modest proportional difference of 0.5% (95% confidence interval, -2.8 to 43.9). Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome occurred in a relatively low percentage of newborns in both groups, affecting 2.2% in the 5-mg group and 1.6% in the 6-mg group. Notably, the risk difference of 0.6% fell comfortably within the predefined noninferiority threshold of 10%.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that a 5-mg dexamethasone dose is noninferior to a standard 6-mg dose in preventing neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in preterm births.

### Postnatal thyroid hormones for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants [^34115cb5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome are at increased risk of adverse neonatal and developmental outcomes. In animal research, thyroid hormones stimulate surfactant production and reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory distress when given antenatally.

Objectives

To determine whether thyroid hormone therapy used postnatally in preterm infants with suspected respiratory distress syndrome results in clinically important improvements in respiratory morbidity and subsequent improvements in neonatal and long term outcomes.

Search Strategy

Searches were performed of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006), PREMEDLINE (March 2006), EMBASE (1980 - March 2006), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts and conference proceedings, supplemented by requests to expert informants.

Selection Criteria

Trials that enrolled preterm infants with suspected respiratory distress syndrome and allocated infants thyroid hormone treatment compared to control commenced in the first 48 hours after birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

Independent assessment of trial quality and data extraction by each author. Synthesis of data using relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) using standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group.

Main Results

Two studies enrolled preterm infants with respiratory distress. Amato (1988) allocated infants to L-thyroxine 50 mug/dose at 1 and at 24 hours or no treatment. Amato (1989) allocated infants to L-triiodothyronine 50 mug/day in two divided doses for two days or no treatment. Both studies had methodological concerns including quasi-random methods of patient allocation, no blinding of treatment or measurement and substantial post allocation losses. Neither study reported any significant benefits in neonatal morbidity or mortality from use of thyroid hormones. Meta-analysis of two studies (80 infants) found no significant difference in mortality to discharge (typical RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.47, 2.14). Amato 1988 reported no significant difference in use of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38, 1.09). No significant effects were found in use of mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, air leak, CLD at 28 days in survivors, patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular haemorrhage or necrotising enterocolitis. Neurodevelopment was not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from controlled clinical trials that postnatal thyroid hormone treatment reduces the severity of respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal morbidity or mortality in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

### Surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants: United Kingdom national consensus [^f26ce071]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

For the purpose of this expert consensus, UK specialists in neonatal respiratory disease and its management were selected based on their previous clinical and scientific experience of RDS management. In a three-step modified Delphi process, seven recommendations were debated and modified in a series of iterative reviews, with the goal of reaching an expert panel consensus. The final stage of the Delphi process was a face-to-face meeting to discuss the precise wording and hierarchy of the recommendations. The Delphi process was supported by an unconditional grant from Chiesi UK Limited; however, the authors maintain complete control over all content of the recommendations.

### Less-invasive surfactant administration for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome: a consensus guideline [^1193f346]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Less-invasive surfactant administration (LISA) is a method of surfactant delivery to preterm infants for treating respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can reduce the composite risk of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia and the time on mechanical ventilation.

Methods

A systematic literature search of studies published up to April 2021 on minimally invasive catheter surfactant delivery in preterm infants with RDS was conducted. Based on these studies, with parental feedback sought via an online questionnaire, 9 UK-based specialists in neonatal respiratory disease developed their consensus for implementing LISA. Recommendations were developed following a modified, iterative Delphi process using a questionnaire employing a 9-point Likert scale and an a priori level of agreement/disagreement.

Results

Successful implementation of LISA can be achieved by training the multidisciplinary team and following locally agreed guidance. From the time of the decision to administer surfactant, LISA should take < 30 min. The comfort of the baby and requirements to maintain non-invasive respiratory support are important. While many infants can be managed without requiring additional sedation/analgesia, fentanyl along with atropine may be considered. Parents should be provided with sufficient information about medication side effects and involved in treatment discussions.

Conclusion

LISA has the potential to improve outcomes for preterm infants with RDS and can be introduced as a safe and effective part of UK-based neonatal care with appropriate training.

### Progesterone after previous preterm birth for prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (PROGRESS): a randomised controlled trial [^ad7f707f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, as a consequence of preterm birth, is a major cause of early mortality and morbidity during infancy and childhood. Survivors of preterm birth continue to remain at considerable risk of both chronic lung disease and long-term neurological handicap. Progesterone is involved in the maintenance of uterine quiescence through modulation of the calcium-calmodulin-myosin-light-chain-kinase system in smooth muscle cells. The withdrawal of progesterone, either actual or functional is thought to be an antecedent to the onset of labour. While there have been recent reports of progesterone supplementation for women at risk of preterm birth which show promise in this intervention, there is currently insufficient data on clinically important outcomes for both women and infants to enable informed clinical decision-making. The aims of this randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial are to assess whether the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries in women with a history of previous spontaneous preterm birth will reduce the risk and severity of respiratory distress syndrome, so improving their infant's health, without increasing maternal risks.

Design

Multicentered randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Inclusion Criteria

pregnant women with a live fetus, and a history of prior preterm birth at less than 37 weeks gestation and greater than 20 weeks gestation in the immediately preceding pregnancy, where onset of labour occurred spontaneously, or in association with cervical incompetence, or following preterm prelabour ruptured membranes. Trial Entry & Randomisation: After obtaining written informed consent, eligible women will be randomised between 18 and 23+6 weeks gestation using a central telephone randomisation service. The randomisation schedule prepared by non clinical research staff will use balanced variable blocks, with stratification according to plurality of the pregnancy and centre where planned to give birth. Eligible women will be randomised to either vaginal progesterone or vaginal placebo. Study Medication & Treatment Schedules: Treatment packs will appear identical. Woman, caregivers and research staff will be blinded to treatment allocation. Primary Study Outcome: Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (defined by incidence and severity).

Sample Size

of 984 women to show a 40% reduction in respiratory distress syndrome from 15% to 9% (p = 0.05, 80% power).

Discussion

This is a protocol for a randomised trial.

### Progesterone after previous preterm birth for prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (PROGRESS): a randomised controlled trial [^038f2e92]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Follow-up of women in both treatment groups

Women will be reviewed in the antenatal clinic according to the recommendation of the practitioner responsible for their care. Women will receive further trial medication treatment packs on a monthly basis. At 34 weeks gestation, women will be asked about the occurrence of any side effects experienced and compliance with the treatment protocol. After birth, information will be obtained relating to birth and infant outcomes from the woman's and infant's case notes by the research assistant and the delivery form completed. Similarly, the postnatal and neonatal forms will be completed for each live born infant after discharge from hospital.

Primary Study Endpoints

The primary study outcome is:

- Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (defined by the incidence (increasing respiratory distress or oxygen requirement or the need for respiratory support from the first six hours of life, in a term or preterm infant) and severity of neonatal respiratory disease (mild = mean airway pressure (MAP) < 7 cm H 2 O, and/or fractional inspired oxygen (FiO 2) < 0.4; moderate = MAP 7–9.9 cm H 2 O, and/or FiO 2 0.40–0.79; severe = MAP ≥ 10 cm H 2 O, and/or FiO 2 ≥ 0.80 with need for ventilation).

### WHO recommendations on interventions to improve preterm birth outcomes [^9011b83d]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for preterm infant, more specifically with respect to surfactant therapy, indications for respiratory distress syndrome, WHO 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate early surfactant replacement therapy (within the first 2 hours after birth) rather than waiting for the symptoms to worsen before giving rescue therapy in intubated preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

### Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for respiratory distress in preterm infants [^2745fcd4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory distress, particularly respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), is the single most important cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. In infants with progressive respiratory insufficiency, intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with surfactant has been the usual treatment, but it is invasive, potentially resulting in airway and lung injury. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been used for the prevention and treatment of respiratory distress, as well as for the prevention of apnoea, and in weaning from IPPV. Its use in the treatment of RDS might reduce the need for IPPV and its sequelae.

Objectives

To determine the effect of continuous distending pressure in the form of CPAP on the need for IPPV and associated morbidity in spontaneously breathing preterm infants with respiratory distress.

Search Methods

We used the standard strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL (2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions; and CINAHL on 30 June 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of preterm infants with respiratory distress were eligible. Interventions were CPAP by mask, nasal prong, nasopharyngeal tube or endotracheal tube, compared with spontaneous breathing with supplemental oxygen as necessary.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods of Cochrane and its Neonatal Review Group, including independent assessment of risk of bias and extraction of data by two review authors. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Subgroup analyses were planned on the basis of birth weight (greater than or less than 1000 g or 1500 g), gestational age (groups divided at about 28 weeks and 32 weeks), timing of application (early versus late in the course of respiratory distress), pressure applied (high versus low) and trial setting (tertiary compared with non-tertiary hospitals; high income compared with low income) MAIN RESULTS: We included five studies involving 322 infants; two studies used face mask CPAP, two studies used nasal CPAP and one study used endotracheal CPAP and continuing negative pressure for a small number of less ill babies. For this update, we included one new trial. CPAP was associated with lower risk of treatment failure (death or use of assisted ventilation) (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.82; typical risk difference (RD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.09; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 4 to 11; I² = 50%; 5 studies, 322 infants; very low-certainty evidence), lower use of ventilatory assistance (typical RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.96; typical RD -0.13, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.02; NNTB 8, 95% CI 4 to 50; I² = 55%; very low-certainty evidence) and lower overall mortality (typical RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.83; typical RD -0.11, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.04; NNTB 9, 95% CI 2 to 13; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 322 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). CPAP was associated with increased risk of pneumothorax (typical RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.30; typical RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 11, 95% CI 7 to 50; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 274 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, defined as oxygen dependency at 28 days (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.13; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 209 infants; very low-certainty evidence). The trials did not report use of surfactant, intraventricular haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis and neurodevelopment outcomes in childhood.

Authors' Conclusions

In preterm infants with respiratory distress, the application of CPAP is associated with reduced respiratory failure, use of mechanical ventilation and mortality and an increased rate of pneumothorax compared to spontaneous breathing with supplemental oxygen as necessary. Three out of five of these trials were conducted in the 1970s. Therefore, the applicability of these results to current practice is unclear. Further studies in resource-poor settings should be considered and research to determine the most appropriate pressure level needs to be considered.

### Surfactant for meconium aspiration syndrome in term and late preterm infants [^c01398e3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surfactant replacement therapy has been proven beneficial in the prevention and treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The deficiency of surfactant or surfactant dysfunction may contribute to respiratory failure in a broader group of disorders, including meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of surfactant administration in the treatment of late preterm and term infants with meconium aspiration syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE and EMBASE (1985 to December 2006), previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, conference and symposia proceedings, expert informants, and journal handsearching, without language restrictions. We contacted study authors for additional data. We ran an updated search in November 2014 and searched the following sites for ongoing or recently completed trials: www.clinicaltrials.gov; www.controlled-trials.com; and www.who.int/ictrp.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials which evaluated the effect of surfactant administration in late preterm and term infants with meconium aspiration syndrome are included in the analyses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on clinical outcomes including mortality, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), pneumothorax, duration of assisted ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, intraventricular haemorrhage (any grade and severe IVH), and chronic lung disease. We conducted data analyses in accordance with the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

Main Results

Four randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of four trials (326 infants) showed no statistically significant effect on mortality [typical risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 2.39; typical risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05]. There was no heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 0% for both RR and RD). The risk of requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was significantly reduced in a meta-analysis of two trials (n = 208); [typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.91; typical RD -0.17, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.04; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 3 to 25]. There was no heterogeneity for RR (1² = 0%) but moderate heterogeneity for RD (I² = 50%). One trial (n = 40) reported a statistically significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (mean difference -8 days, 95% CI -14 to -3 days; test for heterogeneity not applicable). There were no statistically significant reductions in any other outcomes studied (duration of assisted ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen, pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, air leaks, chronic lung disease, need for oxygen at discharge or intraventricular haemorrhage).

Authors' Conclusions

In infants with MAS, surfactant administration may reduce the severity of respiratory illness and decrease the number of infants with progressive respiratory failure requiring support with ECMO. The relative efficacy of surfactant therapy compared to, or in conjunction with, other approaches to treatment including inhaled nitric oxide, liquid ventilation, surfactant lavage and high frequency ventilation remains to be tested.

### Surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants: United Kingdom national consensus [^2649be25]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

Consensus recommendations for the management of RDS in preterm infants were developed; this manuscript provides a narrative for these recommendations. The recommendations are as follows:

1. All neonatal units should have an agreed policy for the management of early RDS.

Minimising unwarranted variation in care is an NHS (National Health Service) mandate, and European Standards of Care for Newborn Health require that guidelines for management of RDS should be available in individual units.

2. Early rescue surfactant rather than prophylaxis is recommended. In some situations, this may include surfactant administration in the delivery suite.

Early rescue involves surfactant treatment for RDS early in the course of the disease when additional oxygen requirement is still relatively low, usually within a few hours after birth. Surfactant prophylaxis is traditionally defined as surfactant administration solely on the basis of gestational age and/or expected high risk of RDS. In the modern context of noninvasive ventilatory management, surfactant prophylaxis and unnecessary intubation has potential for harm. A systematic review of studies comparing surfactant administration through intubation as prophylaxis versus stabilisation on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with early rescue surfactant (if required) showed that infants initiated on CPAP were at lower risk of chronic lung disease or death. The potential benefit or harm of prophylactic surfactant administration using less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) techniques is at present unknown.

### RDS-NExT workshop: consensus statements for the use of surfactant in preterm neonates with RDS [^b1c86690]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Variability among these guidelines demonstrates a lack of consensus concerning surfactant use and administration in the neonatal setting. Variation exists at the institutional level in the management of neonates with RDS, including neonates born at increasingly lower gestational ages, mode of administration (as new, less-invasive, methods are being developed), timing of administration, repeat dosing, and infant positioning during administration of surfactant. Gaps in evidence and shortcomings of existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) further complicate bedside decision-making, leaving clinicians on their own to answer important questions about the patients for whom they care in the NICU.

The objective of the Respiratory Distress Syndrome Neonatal Expert Taskforce (RDS-NExT) initiative was to define the most-effective practice strategies pertaining to neonatal surfactant use and administration, specifically in preterm neonates with RDS. We approached this by convening a panel of leading experts practicing in varying acuity level NICUs from various regions of the US, in an effort to establish consensus on best clinical surfactant practice. This was accomplished by utilizing a modified Delphi method. The output of this initiative was not intended to replace existing evidence and clinical guidelines; rather, the goal was to fill in the gaps where evidence is lacking, with input from expert opinion leaders, in order to improve the care of neonates with RDS or at high-risk of developing RDS.

### RDS-NExT workshop: consensus statements for the use of surfactant in preterm neonates with RDS [^faf1935e]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide the best clinical practice guidance for surfactant use in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The RDS-Neonatal Expert Taskforce (RDS-NExT) initiative was intended to add to existing evidence and clinical guidelines, where evidence is lacking, with input from an expert panel.

Study Design

An expert panel of healthcare providers specializing in neonatal intensive care was convened and administered a survey questionnaire, followed by 3 virtual workshops. A modified Delphi method was used to obtain consensus around topics in surfactant use in neonatal RDS.

Result

Statements focused on establishing RDS diagnosis and indicators for surfactant administration, surfactant administration methods and techniques, and other considerations. After discussion and voting, consensus was achieved on 20 statements.

Conclusion

These consensus statements provide practical guidance for surfactant administration in preterm neonates with RDS, with a goal to contribute to improving the care of neonates and providing a stimulus for further investigation to bridge existing knowledge gaps.

### The role of surfactant therapy in nonrespiratory distress syndrome conditions in neonates [^a9dfdd77]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

While treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with surfactant in premature neonates is well established, evidence for its use in non-RDS conditions, especially in the term neonate, has been less abundant. The last published review on a PubMed search was in 2001. In this review, we comprehensively and critically evaluated the evidence from the literature regarding the use of surfactant in specific non-RDS disorders in neonates. Surfactant administered as a bolus should be considered in the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome with progressive respiratory failure. While controversial in congenital diaphragmatic hernia, it should be considered in Group B streptococcal pneumonia. As evidence evolves, we anticipate the broader application and more routine use of surfactant therapy for respiratory failure because of causes other than RDS.
