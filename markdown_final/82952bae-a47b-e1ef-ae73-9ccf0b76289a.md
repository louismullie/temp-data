## Question

54 yo F with a history of rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone (10 mg daily) and weekly methotrexate presents with progressive dyspnea and dry cough. Imaging shows bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities; O2 sat 94% on room air. Labs: WBC 5.2, mildly elevated LDH, negative procalcitonin, negative influenza/RSV PCR. She is scheduled for BAL to evaluate for infection vs. methotrexate pneumonitis. ID service recommends empiric TMP-SMX DS BID for possible PJP coverage, to be started now. Start TMP-SMX as suggested?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to start empiric TMP-SMX for possible Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in a 54-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone 10 mg daily and weekly methotrexate, who presents with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, bilateral ground-glass opacities on CT, and SpO2 94% on room air, with BAL planned. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability of PJP given her immunosuppression and clinical-radiographic picture. Then, I should verify whether her current steroid dose meets accepted thresholds for PJP risk and whether combination with methotrexate alters that risk. Next, I will review guideline-based treatment dosing and duration, including whether to add adjunctive corticosteroids. After that, I need to check drug–drug interactions, especially TMP-SMX with methotrexate, and decide how to mitigate toxicity. Finally, I will weigh benefits versus harms, consider alternatives if TMP-SMX is contraindicated, and outline a monitoring and de-escalation plan pending BAL results.

> Let me first confirm the pretest probability. She has RA on chronic immunosuppression with bilateral ground-glass opacities, dyspnea, and a nonproductive cough; LDH is mildly elevated and procalcitonin is low, which fits PJP more than bacterial pneumonia, and her oxygenation, while not severely hypoxemic, is borderline and could progress quickly in non-HIV PJP, so the clinical suspicion is high enough to justify empiric therapy while diagnostics proceed [^87a1d955] [^3639f5ec].

> Wait, let me verify the risk threshold for steroids. I initially thought 10 mg prednisone daily might not meet prophylaxis thresholds, but hold on, I should verify the treatment, not prophylaxis, context. For non-HIV patients, major guidelines and reviews identify chronic glucocorticoids as a key risk, and many recommend treatment-level concern with doses around or above 15–20 mg/day, yet case series and reviews document PJP at 10–20 mg/day, particularly with additional immunosuppression like methotrexate, so her 10 mg/day plus methotrexate meaningfully elevates risk and supports empiric therapy given the clinical picture [^62c19df2] [^2ca3551d] [^f66d8917].

> I need to check the correct treatment dosing. For mild-to-moderate PJP, standard therapy is TMP-SMX dosed as TMP 15–20 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours, or alternatively two double-strength tablets orally three times daily, typically for 21 days. ID's suggestion of TMP-SMX DS BID is underdosed for treatment, so I should correct that to TID dosing or weight-based TMP 15–20 mg/kg/day in divided doses to align with HIV and non-HIV guidance [^2b372d63] [^83158c18] [^e313a82f].

> Hold on, I should verify adjunctive corticosteroids. In moderate-to-severe PJP, defined by PaO2 less than 70 mmHg on room air or A-a gradient 35 mmHg or higher, adjunctive prednisone is recommended starting within 72 hours of specific therapy. Her SpO2 94% corresponds to mild disease, so routine steroids are not indicated now, but I should monitor closely for deterioration and add steroids if hypoxemia worsens or the A-a gradient widens [^a6a4f6b2] [^aa1599f5].

> Next, I should review the methotrexate interaction. TMP-SMX can inhibit renal tubular secretion and displace methotrexate from protein binding, increasing methotrexate levels and risking myelosuppression and mucositis. Some oncology and rheumatology guidance advises avoiding concurrent TMP-SMX when methotrexate is used, but wait, let me reconsider in this life-threatening infection context. Given high PJP mortality and the lack of equally effective single alternatives, the balance favors empiric TMP-SMX with close lab monitoring and holding methotrexate during treatment, rather than substituting a less effective agent upfront [^e32274b0] [^83158c18].

> I should double-check alternatives in case of intolerance or severe reaction. If TMP-SMX is contraindicated, options include atovaquone 750 mg twice daily with food, dapsone 100 mg daily plus TMP 15 mg/kg/day in three divided doses, or primaquine 30 mg daily plus clindamycin 450 mg every 6 hours. Pentamidine is reserved for severe cases given toxicity and IV administration, so for mild disease these oral alternatives are reasonable if needed [^2b372d63] [^83158c18].

> Let me weigh benefits versus harms. Non-HIV PJP carries high mortality, often exceeding 30–50% in some cohorts, and delays in therapy increase risk of respiratory failure and death. TMP-SMX is first-line and highly effective, and although adverse effects are common, most are manageable; with vigilance for methotrexate toxicity and supportive care, the net benefit strongly favors empiric treatment now rather than waiting for BAL results, which can take days and may be falsely negative early [^83158c18] [^2ca3551d].

> I will now examine a practical, safety-conscious plan. Start TMP-SMX at the correct treatment dose, hold methotrexate during therapy, check CBC, renal, and hepatic function every 3–5 days, add folinic acid if significant cytopenias emerge, and reassess oxygenation and symptoms at 48–72 hours to decide on adjunctive corticosteroids. If BAL is negative and an alternative diagnosis like methotrexate pneumonitis becomes likely, discontinue TMP-SMX and pivot management accordingly [^a6a4f6b2] [^c3d2adee].

> But wait, what if this is methotrexate pneumonitis rather than PJP. The radiologic overlap is substantial, and differentiating them definitively without BAL is hard; however, given the mortality of missed PJP and the relatively low risk of a short, carefully monitored TMP-SMX course, treating both concurrently while diagnostics proceed is a reasonable bridge strategy, with steroids reserved for deterioration or if drug-induced ILD is strongly suspected, acknowledging that coexisting processes can occur in immunosuppressed patients [^c3d2adee].

> Final decision: Yes, start empiric TMP-SMX now, but correct the dose to TMP 15–20 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours or two double-strength tablets three times daily for 21 days, hold methotrexate, monitor labs closely, and escalate to adjunctive corticosteroids if hypoxemia worsens or the A-a gradient meets severity thresholds. This aligns with non-HIV PJP treatment guidance and balances efficacy with methotrexate-related toxicity risk [^83158c18] [^2b372d63] [^a6a4f6b2].

Empiric TMP-SMX is **indicated now** for this 54-year-old woman with RA on prednisone and methotrexate who presents with dyspnea, dry cough, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and mild hypoxemia. Non-HIV PJP risk is **significant with glucocorticoids ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks** [^f745ee01] or with methotrexate, and delays in therapy increase mortality [^notfound]. Start TMP-SMX at 15–20 mg/kg/day of the TMP component divided every 6–8 hours [^83158c18] [^2b372d63], monitor for methotrexate interaction, and adjust methotrexate as needed. If TMP-SMX is contraindicated, use atovaquone or clindamycin plus primaquine [^2b372d63] [^d226907a]. Continue empiric therapy until BAL results guide definitive management.

## Risk assessment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP)

- **Glucocorticoid therapy**: Chronic prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks is a major risk factor for PJP [^f745ee01] [^f66d8917]; even lower doses can pose risk when combined with other immunosuppressants [^62c19df2].

- **Methotrexate therapy**: Methotrexate impairs cell-mediated immunity and increases susceptibility to opportunistic infections, including PJP [^notfound].

- **Clinical presentation**: Progressive dyspnea, dry cough, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and mild hypoxemia are classic for PJP [^3639f5ec].

- **Laboratory findings**: Mildly elevated LDH and negative procalcitonin support PJP over bacterial pneumonia [^notfound].

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Empiric therapy**: Empiric TMP-SMX is recommended for immunocompromised patients with suspected PJP, especially with glucocorticoid exposure and compatible imaging [^notfound].

- **First-line treatment**: TMP-SMX is the preferred therapy for PJP, with dosing at 15–20 mg/kg/day of the TMP component divided every 6–8 hours for 21 days [^83158c18] [^2b372d63].

- **Adjunctive corticosteroids**: Indicated for moderate-to-severe PJP (PaO2 < 70 mmHg or A-a gradient ≥ 35 mmHg) [^a6a4f6b2] [^aa1599f5].

## Potential risks and benefits of empiric TMP-SMX therapy

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Effective treatment of PJP, reducing mortality and progression [^13816686] | Potential for adverse effects, including myelosuppression, renal impairment, and hypersensitivity reactions [^e32274b0] |
| Broad coverage against other opportunistic infections (e.g. toxoplasmosis, bacterial infections) [^b6f79b09] | Interaction with methotrexate, increasing risk of hematologic toxicity [^e32274b0] |
| Early initiation prevents disease progression and respiratory failure [^notfound] | Delay in definitive diagnosis if BAL is pending |

---

## Alternative therapies

If TMP-SMX is contraindicated or not tolerated, **alternatives include**:

- **Atovaquone**: 750 mg orally twice daily with food [^2b372d63].

- **Clindamycin plus primaquine**: Clindamycin 600 mg IV/PO every 8 hours plus primaquine 30 mg base orally daily [^2b372d63].

- **Pentamidine**: 4 mg/kg IV daily, reserved for severe cases due to toxicity [^a6a4f6b2].

---

## Monitoring and management of potential complications

- **CBC and renal function**: Monitor closely for myelosuppression and renal impairment [^e32274b0].

- **Methotrexate interaction**: Consider holding or adjusting methotrexate during TMP-SMX therapy to mitigate toxicity risk [^notfound].

- **Adverse effects**: Manage hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal upset, and electrolyte disturbances promptly [^b6f79b09].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Empiric TMP-SMX is **indicated now** for this patient given her immunocompromised state, glucocorticoid exposure, and classic PJP presentation. Early therapy reduces mortality and progression; monitor for adverse effects and methotrexate interaction, and adjust therapy based on BAL results.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^17fbd297]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the established benefits of primary PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIID, the optimal prophylaxis schedule remains uncertain. One of the most important uncertainties is the timing of discontinuation of PJP prophylaxis. TMP‐SMX carries some risk of adverse events (AEs), some of which may be severe. Therefore, minimizing exposure to TMP‐SMX while preserving its optimal prophylactic efficacy is a logical next step in building evidence for the universal recommendation for primary PJP prophylaxis. In patients with HIV, the decision to discontinue primary PJP prophylaxis is guided by CD4 counts and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Guidelines recommend the cessation of prophylaxis when CD4 counts have risen to more than 200 cells/mmand are maintained for at least three months in response to ART. However, the correlation between CD4 counts and PJP risk is less clear in patients without HIV, including those with AIID, which renders CD4 counts a less reliable surrogate measure to direct prophylaxis. Although previous studies have suggested that PJP mainly occurs when a patient receives > 15 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent, it is uncertain whether this could be a relevant indication to consider the cessation of PJP prophylaxis. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with PJP infection despite prophylaxis and to offer insights into establishing an ideal primary prophylaxis regimen for patients with AIID.

Treatment & Prophylaxis

Current guidelines for managing PJP in immunosuppressed patients on immunotherapeutic and molecular-targeted agents do not provide specific treatment algorithms. Although TMP-SMX is considered first-line therapy for PJP based on randomised trials in HIV-infected patients, alternative agents such as atovaquone or clindamycin plus primaquine may be used if TMP-SMX is contraindicated. Limited data suggest that outcomes for granulomatous PJP treatment may be comparable to those for other PJP infections.

While severe PJP infections typically require 21 days of treatment, the optimal duration for granulomatous or cavitary PJP remains uncertain due to potentially higher organism burden and reduced drug penetration. In our case, treatment was extended to multiple months based on the patient's immunocompromised state, extensive lung involvement and slow radiographic improvement. Although this approach led to improvement, such prolonged courses are not routine. Zhang et al reported successful treatment of cavitary PJP lesions with a standard 3-week course of TMP-SMX in a patient with common variable immune deficiency, suggesting that shorter courses may still be effective in some cases of granulomatous PJP infections.

The efficacy of steroids in preventing inflammatory damage in non-HIV-infected individuals with PJP remains uncertain. Additionally, the benefits of ruxolitinib discontinuation in PJP infection are uncertain, given worsening haematologic disease activity can itself cause immunocompromise. Further complicating risk–benefit decisions, if ruxolitinib is stopped, there is a need to monitor closely for ruxolitinib discontinuation syndrome. There may be a benefit of rechallenging with ruxolitinib if it is temporarily discontinued to help resolve an infection.

There are no specific guidelines for prophylaxis of PJP in patients on ruxolitinib. Green et al suggest that a PJP risk greater than 3.5% warrants prophylaxis in immunocompromised non-HIV-infected adults. Although the overall risk of PJP in patients with myelofibrosis taking ruxolitinib does not appear to reach this threshold, further studies are needed to understand the risk in subsets of patients with evidence of more severe immunosuppression such as prior opportunistic infections or severe cytopenias.

WARNINGS:

The potential for development of acute PJP still exists in patients receiving NebuPent prophylaxis. Therefore, any patient with symptoms suggestive of the presence of a pulmonary infection, including but not limited to dyspnea, fever or cough, should receive a thorough medical evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests for possible acute PJP as well as for other opportunistic and nonopportunistic pathogens. The use of NebuPent may alter the clinical and radiographic features of PJP and could result in an atypical presentation, including but not limited to mild disease or focal ­infection.

Prior to initiating NebuPent prophylaxis, symptomatic patients should be evaluated appropriately to exclude the presence of PJP. The recommended dose of NebuPent for the prevention of PJP is insufficient to treat acute PJP.

### A case of hypercalcemia from Pneumocystis jirovecii in an immunosuppressed non-HIV patient [^1da4469a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Herein, we present a case where PJP and hypercalcemia has presented with nonspecific clinical symptoms. Our results are in line with other reports of atypical presentations of PJP and emphasizes the importance of recognition in at-risk patients. In our case, our patient was not on empiric PJP prophylaxis given use of primarily rituximab for immunosuppression. While current guidelines suggest TMP-SMX prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence of PJP (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04–0.62), in trials comparing PJP prophylaxis vs. placebo or no treatment there was no significant effect on all-cause mortality. Taken together, there is a lack of consensus around guideline-based recommendations towards PJP prophylaxis in those immunosuppressed outside of the HIV setting. Recently, in a large-centre retrospective analysis, Park et al. reviewed the efficacy and safety of primary PJP prophylaxis, with TMP-SMX, in patients receiving rituximab. They demonstrated that over nearly 2600 person-years, 92 PJP infections occurred, with a mortality rate of 27%. Notably, patients receiving PJP prophylaxis showed significantly lower incidence of PJP (hazard ratio 0.20, 95% CI 0.10–0.42) and related mortality (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.05–0.84]). Intention to treat analysis showed the number needed to treat was 32 and number needed to harm, from a serious adverse drug reaction, was 101. Overall, these findings strongly suggest that potential benefit from TMP-SMX prophylaxis for patients receiving rituximab outweigh any likely harm.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^f6e15b4e]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although previous studies show that primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is effective in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing for prophylaxis withdrawal. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for PJP despite prophylaxis and provide evidence for an optimal prophylaxis schedule.

Methods

This case-control study included 1,294 prophylactic episodes in 1,148 patients with rheumatic disease who received immunosuppressants and prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The primary outcome was a one-year incidence of PJP. A Cox proportional hazards model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with outcomes.

Results

During 1,174 person-years of observation, 10 cases of PJP were identified, with an incidence rate of 0.85 per 100 person-years. The mean ± SD duration of TMP-SMX prophylaxis was 181.9 ± 128.7 days. Except in one case, PJP occurred after discontinuation of TMP-SMX, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval of 117.0 (86.0–161.0) days. The dose of glucocorticoids at the time of TMP-SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group relative to the control group (median [IQR]: 22 [20–40] vs 10 [5–15] mg). Discontinuing TMP-SMX while on a glucocorticoid dose > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent significantly increased the risk of PJP (adjusted hazard ratio: 13.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–111.80). There were 63 cases of adverse events during the observation period, and 10 (15.9%) were attributed to TMP-SMX with probable causality.

Conclusion

Tapering glucocorticoids with 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent could be a reasonable timepoint to initiate the withdrawal of PJP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic diseases.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^7b464582]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

In the present study including 113 hematological patients with PJP, improvement in PaO 2 /FiO 2 between baseline and day 8 did not differ between patients receiving the reduced or standard dose of TMP-SMX. This result remained unchanged when correcting for age, ECOG performance status ≥ 3, and baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 in an adjusted regression analysis. In analogy with a previous study on adjunctive corticosteroids for PJP treatment in HIV-uninfected patients, ΔPaO 2 /FiO 2 was selected as the primary outcome to reflect the change in oxygenation, the most prominent feature defining severity of PJP. The choice to use day 8 after treatment start for assessment of ΔPaO 2 /FiO 2 was made in concordance with previously published guidelines suggesting that this may be an appropriate time point for assessment treatment response in hematologic patients with PJP.

The role of adjunctive corticosteroids remains controversial in non-HIV PJP. While some studies demonstrate reduced mortality in patients with respiratory failure and improved clinical response rates with combination therapy, others show no benefit in 30-day or 1-year mortality. In our study, 40% of patients with rapidly progressive disease, such as case1 with persistent high fever that is difficult to control and case 2, case 7, case 10 both with rapid deterioration of respiratory function, received adjunctive corticosteroids with favorable outcomes. Notably, the single mortality case, who developed ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, ECMO, and blood purification, did not receive early corticosteroid therapy. This observation, while not definitive, underscores the potential importance of early intervention, as prompt treatment initiation may reduce progression to invasive ventilation and death.

Several limitations warrant consideration in our analysis. Initially, it is important to note that this study is a single-center investigation with a limited sample size. Specifically, one patient who was highly suspected of having PJP did not undergo confirmatory testing prior to death. This circumstance may potentially influence the analysis of the results. It underscores the critical importance of early diagnosis and timely initiation of treatment for effective disease control. Through a comprehensive review of the 10 cases presented herein, we have identified additional biological markers that may be indicative of PJP. Furthermore, we propose that systemic anti-PJP treatment should be proactively initiated in cases where PJP is highly suspected, even before the results of etiological tests are available. To further substantiate the perspectives presented in this paper, additional multicenter studies with larger datasets are warranted. Second, despite guideline recommendations, we lacked standardized alternative prophylaxis protocols for patients intolerant to TMP/SMX. Third, serial BDG monitoring was not performed in patients with initially normal levels, potentially missing dynamic changes in this biomarker. Nevertheless, our findings clearly demonstrate that PJP infection in pediatric malignancy patients primarily results from inadequate prophylaxis coverage or adherence. Future research should focus on developing rapid diagnostic strategies and establishing optimal timing for combination therapy, including both antifungal agents and adjunctive corticosteroids. Such advances could potentially improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.

### Clinical analysis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in children with malignant disease [^cc57279e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ), formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii, is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). Before the implementation of routine prophylaxis, PJP was the leading cause of infectious mortality in pediatric leukemia patients. While prophylaxis has significantly reduced PJP mortality in children with cancer, new challenges have emerged due to the increasing prevalence of hematologic malignancies requiring immunosuppressive therapy and the development of novel biotherapies.

Multiple risk factors for PJP have been identified. The primary risk stems from T-cell deficiency or dysfunction, whether due to underlying malignancy or immunosuppressive therapy. Corticosteroid treatment has been established as an independent risk factor associated with mortality in both adults and children. Additional risk factors include respiratory cytomegalovirus (CMV) coinfection, myeloablative conditioning for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), high-grade graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), T-cell-specific therapy (e.g. alemtuzumab), craniospinal or chest irradiation, and myelosuppressive therapy.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) remains the gold standard for PJP prophylaxis in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. While effective prophylaxis has substantially reduced PJP morbidity and mortality, a significant number of patients develop PJP despite available prophylaxis guidelines, with medication non-compliance emerging as a major contributing factor in pediatric cases. The clinical presentation of PJP typically includes fever, hypoxemic dyspnea, and nonproductive cough, accompanied by bilateral interstitial pneumonia with diffuse patchy consolidative and ground-glass opacities on chest imaging. However, early diagnosis remains challenging due to the absence of pathognomonic clinical or radiological findings at disease onset, and delayed diagnosis correlates with increased mortality. Prompt identification and treatment initiation are crucial for improving outcomes. While TMP/SMX is an effective first-line treatment, PJP remains a significant threat to immunocompromised children.

Although numerous studies have documented PJP in HIV-negative adults, research on pediatric HIV-negative PJP remains limited. This retrospective descriptive study characterizes PJP cases in children with malignant diseases at our institution. By analyzing clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and treatment outcomes, we aim to enhance understanding of PJP in pediatric malignancies and provide guidance for early diagnosis and effective management.

### Pneumocystis in metastatic lung cancer, a pragmatic approach in support of prophylaxis [^f66d8917]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In patients with lung cancer, especially with brain metastasis, corticosteroids are commonly prescribed. Life expectancy is limited to a few months or years in most cases, and physicians do not prescribe chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis spp. A retrospective study showed that fewer patients with solid tumours (3.9%) received prophylaxis compared with patients with haematological malignancies (63.6%).

Lung cancer is at low risk of PJP (< 25 cases/100 000 patient-year) like other solid tumours, excluding central nervous system cancer. But for patients having solid cancer and being treated by corticosteroids, the incidence of PJP rises to 1.3%. Furthermore, PJP is usually more abrupt and fulminantamong patients with neoplastic disease, and its mortality rate is much higher, approaching 50%, and a significant risk factor of mortality with an OR = 2.66. In different studies, 55%–87% of patients with PJP had previously used corticosteroids, and 18%–31% had a solid tumour. The most important predisposing factor for developing PJP is the use of steroids, even at a low dose (equivalent to ≥ 20 mg/day prednisone for ≥ 1 month). ATS guidelines recommend prophylaxis when prednisone doses exceed 20 mg/day for longer than 1 month.

Recent guidelinesand two general reviewsrecommend prophylaxis for patients with solid cancer receiving prolonged, high-dose corticosteroid treatment (16–25 mg of prednisolone/day or ≥ 4 mg dexamethasone daily for ≥ 4 weeks) regardless of the stage of malignancy.

Concerning the toxicity of TMP–SMX, 85% of the patients do not experience any toxic effects. So, when steroids are prescribed for a patient with cancer, especially in metastatic diseases, we prioritise a pragmatic attitude: start a prophylaxis if survival exceeds 3 months.

Learning points

Corticosteroids are a major risk factor of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), adding to the risk of PJP in lung cancer.
Guidelines recommend PJP prophylaxis by trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX) when dose > 20 mg/day.
Side effects occur in 15% of cases, and discontinuation of the prophylaxis is required in 3% of patients treated.
Our pragmatic proposal: start a primary prophylaxis if survival exceeds 3 months, and eventually discuss alternatives in case of TMP–SMX intolerance.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^fe2931a3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Consensus recommendations for infectious disease prophylaxis during chronic GC therapy — Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP): PJP prophylaxis should be used when the annual incidence of PJP for a given disease and treatment modality is ≥ 3.5%. For neuromuscular disease (NMD) receiving glucocorticoid (GC) monotherapy where disease-specific incidence is unknown, prophylaxis may be offered to patients receiving ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month; if a second immunosuppressive agent is added, prophylaxis should be offered for patients receiving ≥ 20 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month. Trimethoprim‑Sulfamethoxazole (TMP‑SMX) one single‑strength tablet daily or one double‑strength tablet three times a week is the recommended regimen for PJP prophylaxis in patients with normal renal function, adjusted for renal function. For TMP‑SMX allergy, alternative options include atovaquone 1.5g daily, dapsone 100 mg daily, or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly.

### The radiologist's role in detecting systemic anticancer therapy-related interstitial lung disease: an educational review [^c3d2adee]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

The possibility for co-existing conditions should be considered when diagnosing SACT-related ILD. Although each potential differential diagnosis and co-existing condition has distinct diagnostic characteristics that aid in determining their likelihood, with CT imaging particularly valuable in this regard, ascertaining the primary limiting condition can be complex, especially when there is microbiological evidence of infection. For instance, the presence of PJ in the airways may not necessarily indicate Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP), but simply colonization. Usually, patients with PJP will present with a degree of hypoxia and respiratory distress, whereas SACT-induced ILD cases are typically mild in severity (Table 2). Although the co-existence of drug-induced ILD and PJP is rare, distinguishing between the two based solely on clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory results can be difficult, particularly in severe cases. Where clear differentiation is challenging or time and resources are limited, it may be necessary to treat both conditions simultaneously. For example, it is not uncommon to administer steroids for SACT-related ILD and broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected co-existing infections. Following the initiation of therapy, more detailed investigations typically guide definitive diagnosis.

SACT-related ILD may develop within days to months after drug administration; however, late clinical manifestations do occur and late-occurring ILD events should not be excluded as a possible diagnosis.

### Pneumonia in newly diagnosed treatment-naïve chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^fd8a5f59]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 78-year-old man with newly diagnosed treatment-naïve chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was referred to a pulmonary clinic for 1month of dry cough and dyspnoea on exertion. Further workup with CT of the chest showed patchy ground-glass opacities predominantly on the right side. The patient was started on empiric antibiotic for presumed community-acquired pneumonia but did not have any improvement in his symptoms and eventually required supplemental oxygen. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage from the right middle lobe showed Pneumocystis jirovecii cysts on Grocott methenamine silver stains. The patient was HIV negative. He was placed on P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) treatment with clindamycin and primaquine due to history of significant allergy to sulfa drugs. The patient's symptoms completely resolved after a 21-day course of treatment and no longer needed supplemental oxygen. This case highlights the importance of keeping PJP infection in differential diagnosis in both treated and untreated patients with CLL with dyspnoea and pulmonary infiltrates.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis — TMP-SMX management and related considerations: For patients with non-life-threatening adverse reactions to TMP-SMX, the drug should be continued if clinically feasible. If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, re-institution of therapy should be considered after the reaction has resolved; the dose of TMP-SMX can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BI) or the drug can be given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII). Therapy should be permanently discontinued, with no rechallenge, in patients with suspected or confirmed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). TMP-SMX DS once daily also confers protection against toxoplasmosis and many respiratory bacterial infections; a lower dose also likely confers protection. Whenever possible, patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency before administration of dapsone or primaquine, and an alternative agent should be used if the patient is found to have G6PD deficiency. Aerosolized pentamidine or dapsone (without pyrimethamine) should not be used for PCP prophylaxis in patients who are seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^41b98b4f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although the effectiveness of PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIIDs is widely recognized, there is no clear consensus on the optimal regimen, particularly regarding the duration of maintenance. Although previous studies have demonstrated the excellent prophylactic efficacy of TMP‐SMX in reducing the incidence of PJP, its use carries a potential risk of various AEs. Therefore, establishing appropriate criteria for discontinuing prophylaxis could enhance patient outcomes while improving safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large‐scale study to investigate the potential risk factors associated with PJP despite prophylaxis, which may provide crucial evidence for establishing an optimal prophylaxis protocol.

This study showed that the one‐year incidence of PJP among patients receiving prophylactic TMP‐SMX was low, reinforcing previous reports that TMP‐SMX has high prophylactic efficacy against PJP. Furthermore, there was only one case of breakthrough PJP during TMP‐SMX prophylaxis. Given the high effectiveness of TMP‐SMX in PJP prophylaxis, further research is needed to address next steps, such as identifying specific risk groups and determining the optimal duration for maintaining prophylaxis, to ensure effective prevention.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) treatment — first-line TMP-SMX and adjuncts: TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is the treatment of choice for PCP (AI), and outpatient oral TMP-SMX is highly effective for mild-to-moderate disease (AI); lower doses may also be effective though randomized controlled data are unavailable, and the dose must be adjusted for abnormal renal function. Multiple randomized clinical trials indicate TMP-SMX is as effective as parenteral pentamidine and more effective than other regimens, and leucovorin to prevent myelosuppression during acute treatment is not recommended. Mutations associated with resistance to sulfa drugs have been documented, but their effect on outcome is uncertain. Patients who have PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis usually can be treated effectively with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII). In moderate-to-severe disease — defined by room air PaO2 < 70 mmHg or A-a (alveolar-arterial) gradient ≥ 35 mmHg — patients should receive adjunctive corticosteroids as soon as possible and certainly within 72 hours after starting specific PCP therapy (AI).

### Successful repeat ECMO in a patient with AIDS and ARDS [^e75adca3]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 23-year-old man presented with fever (> 40°C), dyspnoea and dry cough. He visited a community hospital, where he was found to be hypoxic with arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2) of 58 mm Hg on 15 L/min of oxygen via mask with a reservoir, requiring non-invasive positive pressure mode of ventilation (NPPV) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation. Chest X-ray and chest CT scan showed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities. The patient received empirical antibiotics (ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin) and methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days with no improvement in respiratory status, and the patient was transferred to our hospital. After admission, the patient's respiratory status further deteriorated, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and endotracheal intubation with ventilator support.

The following day, the diagnosis of AIDS was made with a CD4 count of 8.5 cells/µL and an HIV virus load of 550 000 copies/mL. A PCR was positive for P. jirovecii in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) was initiated for the treatment of PjP. In addition, the antibacterial regimen was changed to meropenem, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, micafungin and ganciclovir. Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg per day was continued.

Unfortunately, he developed hypoxaemia refractory to mechanical ventilation; arterial blood gas analysis showed persistent hypoxaemia (PaO 2 of 48 mm Hg) on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) with positive end expiratory pressure of 12 cm H 2 O on ICU day 3 (figure 1).

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^b04aa706]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In settings with a low prevalence of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, patients with hematologic malignancies constitute the largest risk group for developing PJP. Widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has significantly lowered the incidence of PJP in high-risk hematological patients, but PJP still occurs in high-risk patients not tolerating TMP-SMX or after discontinuing prophylaxis, and in low-risk patients not receiving prophylactic treatment, in particular patients who have received treatment with high-dose corticosteroids.

The recommended first-line treatment for PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies is TMP-SMX given at a high dose, 15–20 mg/kg of the TMP component, but the evidence supporting this high dose is anecdotal. TMP-SMX therapy may cause dose-dependent adverse events, and previous studies have shown that the standard high-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP may be correlated to an increased frequency of such adverse events.

In a recent meta-analysis analyzing reduced-dose vs standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality but an 18% absolute risk reduction of adverse events with reduced doses of TMP-SMX. However, few patients with hematological malignancies were included in this study, and it is thus unclear if these findings can be generalized to a hematological population. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by comparing clinical outcomes and adverse events in hematologic patients receiving a reduced vs standard dose of TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP.

Treatment of PJP

The median initial corrected treatment doses were 11.6 mg TMP/kg/day (range 7.9–14.8 mg TMP/kg/day) and 16.7 mg TMP/kg/day (range 15.1–20 mg TMP/kg/day) in the reduced- and standard-dose groups, respectively (Figure 2). Nineteen of 33 patients (58%) in the standard-dose group were subject to dose reductions after the first 2 full days of treatment that resulted in a mean corrected daily dose of TMP-SMX of ≤ 15 mg/kg on days 3–7. In only 1 of 80 patients in the reduced-dose group, the dose was increased so that the mean corrected daily dose TMP-SMX was > 15 mg/kg on days 3–7. This patient was not considered to be a case of clinical failure according to the documentation in the medical record by the treating physician, and the reason for the dose increase was unknown.

Figure 2.
Distribution of initial corrected treatment doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the reduced- and standard-dose groups. The initial treatment dose corresponds to the mean daily dose/kilogram of trimethoprim (TMP) (corrected for renal function) on the first and second day of a full daily treatment. The horizontal lines represent the median values, boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentile of each group's distribution of values, and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values.

Details regarding PJP treatment and duration of TMP-SMX are presented in Table 2. Eighty patients received < 21 days of TMP-SMX treatment (median, 14 days [range, 2–20 days]). The reason for TMP-SMX discontinuation was clinical cure in 58 of 80 patients (median TMP-SMX duration, 14.5 days [range, 7–20 days]), adverse reactions and switch to a second-line drug in 6 of 34 patients (median TMP-SMX duration, 8 days [range, 6–12 days]), and death in 16 of 80 patients.

### Clinical course, treatment and outcome of Pneumocystis pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a retrospective analysis over 17 years [^a65fbdcc]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, PcP is a rare but potentially fatal disease in immunocompromised patients with diseases of different etiology. About 50% of cases were non-HIV-associated. Initial LDH levels - if validated by others - might be a useful predictor of in-hospital mortality, and TMP-SMX treatment doses in patients at high risk of death (e.g. ICU admission + LDH > 495 U/L) should probably not be reduced below 15 mg/kg BW.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in the non-HIV-infected population [^2ca3551d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Summarize data on the pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention options for non-AIDS immunocompromised patients who have Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); review the epidemiology of patients presenting with PJP; and discuss the first and second-line pharmacological options for treatment and prophylaxis of PJP in this population.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1989-February 2016) searched. Terms searched included combinations of Pneumocystis jirovecii, Pneumocystis carinii, non-HIV, infected, patients, prevention, prophylaxis, Bactrim, treatment, AIDS, opportunistic, immunocompromised, cancer, and pathophysiology

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles included had the most relevant information on PJP pathophysiology, and first-/second-line treatment and prophylactic options. Inclusion criteria were met and evaluated with 43 sources.

Data Synthesis

P jirovecii has a complicated life-cycle; it seeks to find compromised immune systems in order to replicate, causing life-threatening complications. With immunosuppressive medications coming to market for immunomodulating diseases, PJP has become a prevalent opportunistic infection in the non-HIV population. CD4+ lymphocyte count < 200 cells/µL is the primary risk factor for PJP presentation in these patients. With data from clinical trials, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) has become the primary treatment and prophylaxis of PJP in the non-HIV population, although second-line options are available.

Conclusion

PJP is a health problem that may result in an increased concern as more immunomodulating medications to treat various disease states are developed. Patients on these drugs or those with immunosuppressive diseases should have their CD4+ count monitored. Health care providers should continue to use TMP/SMX as the primary option in non-HIV, immunocompromised patients for treatment and prophylaxis of PJP.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Pneumocystis pneumonia, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ECIL 2016 guidelines recommend to use composite criteria to assess the need for diagnostic bronchoscopy and empiric treatment for PCP, as single clinical diagnostic criteria are insufficient to prove the diagnosis:

- patient at risk

- clinical signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea and/or cough, fever, hypoxemia, chest pain

- imaging findings compatible with PCP, preferably chest CT

- with or without unexplained serum LDH elevation.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^081d70b2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with hematologic malignancies are subject to treatment protocols where organ dysfunctions are common complications, and TMP-SMX–associated, dose-dependent adverse events may therefore pose a significant treatment challenge in this patient group. In our study, the number of patients experiencing adverse events requiring clinical intervention was low overall, and no statistically significant difference in adverse events with a CTCAE grade of ≥ 2 between the treatment groups was found. The low toxicity may in part be explained by the low proportion of patients with renal dysfunction at baseline (6%), a median treatment duration shorter than 21 days (median, 15 days) and the fact that a large proportion of patients (58%) in the standard-dose group had their dose reduced after the first 2 full days of treatment.

Strengths of this study include the multicenter design with participation of 6 Swedish university hospitals, resulting in detailed outcome data for a large and well-defined cohort of hematologic patients with PJP and allowing for a broad generalization of the results. Furthermore, extensive efforts were made to achieve a stringent case classification for PJP and to exclude cases of Pneumocystis colonization, in order to increase the validity of the results. On the other hand, this approach resulted in a reduction of the number of included patients, and together with the relatively low 30-day mortality of 14%, we cannot rule out that a relevant difference in mortality between the treatment groups, especially in patients with severe pneumonia, might have been missed.

Other limitations include the risk of selection bias (ie, the risk that patients with a worse baseline prognosis received higher treatment doses), and the risk that other, unrecognized, confounding factors may have impacted the outcomes. Despite attempting to adjust for confounders using adjusted regression analysis, the presence of residual bias cannot be ruled out in retrospective cohort studies.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing reduced-dose and standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP exclusively in patients with hematologic malignancies. In summary, our study showed that in patients with mild to moderate PJP, the mortality was low, and treatment with reduced dose of TMP-SMX was effective. No significant differences in mortality between treatment groups were seen among patients with severe PJP, but the numbers were low and the result must be interpreted with caution. Even if compensating statistically for confounders, the risk of residual confounding in retrospective cohort studies is evident and prospective controlled studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) primary prophylaxis — first-choice TMP-SMX dosing: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is dosed as TMP 2.5–5 mg/kg body weight/dose with SMX 12.5–25 mg/kg body weight/dose twice per day, and the total daily dose should not exceed 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX. Acceptable schedules include giving doses 3 days per week, 2 days per week, or every day, with the daily schedule using a total daily dose of TMP 5–10 mg/kg body weight as a single daily dose.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) — adjunctive corticosteroids and special considerations — adjunctive corticosteroids are indicated when PaO2 < 70 mmHg at room air or alveolar-arterial DO2 gradient > 35 mmHg (AI). Prednisone dosing, beginning as early as possible and within 72 hours of PCP therapy, is Days 1–5: 40 mg PO twice daily; Days 6–10: 40 mg PO daily; Days 11–21: 20 mg PO daily (AI). IV methylprednisolone can be administered as 75% of prednisone dose. Benefit of corticosteroid if started after 72 hours of PCP therapy is uncertain, but some clinicians will use it for moderate-to-severe PCP (BIII). Whenever possible, patients should be tested for G6PD before use of dapsone or primaquine, and alternative therapy should be used in patients found to have G6PD deficiency. Patients who are receiving pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine for treatment or suppression of toxoplasmosis do not require additional PCP prophylaxis (AII). If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, re-institution should be considered after the reaction resolves; the dose can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BI), reduced, or the frequency modified (CIII). TMP-SMX should be permanently discontinued in patients with possible or definite Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrosis.

### Clinical analysis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in children with malignant disease [^e17f2338]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in pediatric malignancy patients receiving chemotherapy or glucocorticoids, and provide guidance for timely diagnosis and effective treatment.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment approaches, and outcomes in pediatric malignancy patients who developed PJP.

Results

Ten patients (1:1 male-to-female ratio; median age 6.50 years, range 2.83–14.58 years) were followed for a median of 14 months (range 6–53 months). Eight developed PJP during chemotherapy and two post-completion. Nine received glucocorticoids in their chemotherapy regimen. PJP prophylaxis was either absent (n = 4) or discontinued > 1 month prior (n = 5). Clinical presentations included fever, dyspnea, and wheezing, often without significant cough. Laboratory findings showed elevated (1,3)-β-D-glucan(BDG)in 7 cases. Chest CT typically revealed bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates, ground-glass opacities, and nodular shadows. All cases had a positive metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) or targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) result for P. jirovecii from sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. Treatment included Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(TMP/SMZ) with/without caspofungin and adjunctive corticosteroids. Eight patients required PICU admission (median stay 7.5 days, range 0–45 days) for respiratory support. Nine patients survived PJP, with one PJP-related death and one death from underlying disease.

Conclusion

High clinical suspicion for PJP is warranted in pediatric malignancy patients presenting with fever, dyspnea, elevated BDG, and characteristic imaging findings, particularly in those with inadequate prophylaxis. Early pathogen detection and treatment initiation are crucial. While TMP/SMZ remains first-line therapy, combination with caspofungin may improve outcomes. Short-term adjunctive corticosteroids may benefit moderate to severe cases.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^f57b2dcb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

As in line with previous studies, risk factors such as lymphopenia, impaired renal function, age, and rituximab use were significantly associated with PJP. Our earlier research demonstrated that TMP‐SMX prophylaxis reduces the incidence of PJP and related mortality in patients treated with rituximab. An intriguing finding in this study was that among the 16 patients who developed PJP despite prophylaxis, 15 experienced the onset of PJP merely a few months following the cessation of prophylactic TMP‐SMX.

In this context, it is noteworthy that the PJP group in our study had a shorter prophylaxis duration than the control group, leading to the discontinuation of prophylaxis while the patients were still receiving relatively higher doses of GCs. Previous studies on PJP in patients with AIID showed that most PJP cases occurred when patients received > 15–20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalents. Expanding upon this finding, we demonstrated that the risk of PJP persists even with prophylaxis, unless it is continued until GC doses are tapered to ≤ 12.5 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. In fact, patients who stopped prophylactic TMP‐SMX at a dose of concomitant GC higher than the threshold showed an approximately 10‐times‐higher risk of PJP than other patients. This result suggests that tapering the GC dose by 12.5 mg/day or less can be a relevant threshold for considering the withdrawal of prophylactic TMP‐SMX.

Discussion

PJP is a significant threat to immunocompromised children, occurring through either environmental exposure or reactivation of latent infection. The primary risk factors encompass impaired cell-mediated immunity and immunosuppressive therapy, particularly in patients undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancies, HSCT, or receiving high-dose corticosteroids. A recent multicenter study highlighted that patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and solid tumors experienced more severe PJP manifestations and higher mortality rates, with prior corticosteroid therapy (prednisone ≥ 10 mg daily) emerging as the sole immunosuppressant associated with 90-day mortality. Our cohort's disease distribution - acute leukemia (50%), lymphoblastic lymphomas (30%), HLH (10%), and solid tumors (10%) - aligns with these established risk profiles, with 90% receiving high-dose corticosteroids.

PJP infections occur more frequently in patients lacking prophylaxis, with up to 25% of unprophylaxed pediatric oncology patients developing PJP during chemotherapy. The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) guidelines recommend TMP/SMX as first-line prophylaxis in pediatric hematology patients throughout chemotherapy and for 6 weeks to 6 months after completing maintenance therapy. For HSCT recipients, prophylaxis should continue from neutrophil engraftment until achieving protective immune recovery. In our institution, we recommend TMP/SMX prophylaxis (25 mg/kg daily for three consecutive days weekly) for all chemotherapy patients who can tolerate it. The reasons for non-use or discontinuation of TMP-SMX in our survey included high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy, severe liver damage, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and poor adherence of the child or parent. But analysis of our PJP cases revealed that 40% had never received prophylaxis, 50% had discontinued prophylaxis more than one month before infection, and 10% received irregular prophylaxis. These findings suggest that prophylaxis non-adherence, rather than prophylaxis failure, drives infections.

Case Presentation

A 54-year-old Indian woman presented with low-grade fever and cough with expectoration for 1 month. Fever was not associated with any chills or night sweats. Expectoration was minimal in amount and mucoid in nature. Her appetite was decreased, without any significant weight loss. She denied any history of dyspnea or hemoptysis. The patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 1 year previously and was initially started on methotrexate and short-term glucocorticoids. At the time of presentation, she was taking methotrexate 15 mg weekly and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily. Her joint disease was controlled on immunomodulators. She had no other comorbid condition, and she was a never smoker. She neither traveled within or outside India in the past nor came in contact with patients with pulmonary TB. A chest radiograph was done because a prior workup showed an ill-defined solitary nodular lesion in the right lower zone. She took a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate, but that was of no benefit.

### Primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients receiving rituximab [^74f5d8c0]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although previous studies suggested that rituximab increases the risk of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), it is uncertain whether its primary prophylaxis for PJP is justified.

Research Question

Does the benefit of primary prophylaxis for PJP in patients receiving rituximab treatment outweigh the potential risk of the prophylaxis?

Study Design and Methods

This retrospective study included 3,524 patients (hematologic diseases, 2,500; rheumatic diseases, 559; pre/post-solid organ transplantation, 465) first exposed to rituximab between 2002 and 2018 in a tertiary referral center in South Korea. Patients were classified into a control group (n = 2,523) and a prophylaxis group (n = 1,001) according to the administration of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) during the first 28 days after the start of rituximab (intention-to-treat analysis). In addition, exposure to TMP-SMX was examined as a time-varying variable (time-varying analysis). The primary outcome was the prophylactic effect of TMP-SMX on the 1-year incidence of PJP. Inverse probability of treatment weights was applied to minimize the baseline imbalance. The secondary outcome included the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to TMP-SMX.

Results

Over 2,759.9 person-years, 92 PJP infections occurred, with a mortality rate of 27.2%. The prophylaxis group showed a significantly lower incidence of PJP (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.10–0.42]) than the control group. This result was consistent with the results of time-varying analysis, in which only one PJP infection occurred during TMP-SMX administration (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.01 [0.003–0.16]). The incidence of ADRs related to TMP-SMX was 18.1 (14.6–22.2)/100 person-years, and most were of mild to moderate severity. On the basis of 10 severe ADRs, the number needed to harm was 101 (61.9–261.1), whereas the number needed to prevent one PJP infection was 32 (24.8–39.4).

Interpretation

TMP-SMX prophylaxis significantly reduces PJP incidence with a tolerable safety profile in patients receiving rituximab treatment.

Case presentation

A 51-year-old white female who was referred from our outpatient pulmonary clinic to the ED (emergency department) for worsening respiratory distress and six weeks history of persistent dry cough. Prior to this admission, the patient was seen at an urgent care and was prescribed a 10 days course of oral antibiotic empirically without significant improvement. Subsequently, the patient was seen in our outpatient pulmonary clinic for a working diagnosis of pneumonia and a previous chest x-ray depicting bibasilar opacities. In the office, the patient complained of dyspnea with ambulation. She was tested negative for COVID-19. Therefore, patient was prescribed oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily empirically for 14 days and 40 mg of oral prednisone for 5 days. The patient was advised to communicate her progress with the treating physician, so her treatment protocol can be adjusted if needed. However, attempts to wean her prednisone made her dyspnea worse with pulse oximetry reportedly in high 80 s% on ambulation. PFTs (pulmonary function tests) outpatient showed restrictive lung pattern with reduced FEV-1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) at 52%, and reduced FVC (Forced vital capacity) at 47%.

5.5 Interstitial Lung Disease

Cases of interstitial lung disease, some resulting in death, occurred in patients who received TORISEL. Some patients were asymptomatic, or had minimal symptoms, with infiltrates detected on computed tomography scan or chest radiograph. Others presented with symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and fever. Some patients required discontinuation of TORISEL and/or treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics, while some patients continued treatment without additional intervention. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.

It is recommended that patients undergo baseline radiographic assessment by lung computed tomography scan or chest radiograph prior to the initiation of TORISEL therapy. Follow such assessments periodically, even in the absence of clinical respiratory symptoms.

It is recommended that patients be followed closely for occurrence of clinical respiratory symptoms. If clinically significant respiratory symptoms develop, consider withholding TORISEL administration until after recovery of symptoms and improvement of radiographic findings related to pneumonitis. Empiric treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics may be considered. Opportunistic infections such as PJP should be considered in the differential diagnosis. For patients who require use of corticosteroids, prophylaxis of PJP may be considered.

5.6 Hyperlipidemia

The use of TORISEL is likely to result in increases in serum triglycerides and cholesterol. In the phase 3 trial, 87% of patients receiving TORISEL had at least one elevated serum cholesterol value and 83% had at least one elevated serum triglyceride value. This may require initiation, or increase in the dose, of lipid-lowering agents. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides should be tested before and during treatment with TORISEL.

5.7 Bowel Perforation

Cases of fatal bowel perforation occurred in patients who received TORISEL. These patients presented with fever, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, bloody stools, diarrhea, and/or acute abdomen. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening abdominal pain or blood in their stools.

5.8 Renal Failure

Cases of rapidly progressive and sometimes fatal acute renal failure not clearly related to disease progression occurred in patients who received TORISEL. Some of these cases were not responsive to dialysis.

5.9 Wound Healing Complications

Use of TORISEL has been associated with abnormal wound healing. Therefore, caution should be exercised with the use of TORISEL in the perioperative period.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) clinical manifestations in people with HIV — symptoms and objective findings: The most common manifestations are subacute onset of progressive dyspnea, fever, non-productive cough, and chest discomfort that worsens within days to weeks, and with exertion tachypnea, tachycardia, and diffuse dry (cellophane) rales may be observed. Hypoxemia ranges from mild (room air arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2] ≥ 70 mmHg or alveolar-arterial gradient [A-a gradient] < 35 mmHg) to moderate (A-a gradient ≥ 35 to < 45 mmHg) to severe (A-a gradient ≥ 45 mmHg). Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase levels to > 500 mg/dL is common but also nonspecific, and the chest radiograph typically demonstrates diffuse, bilateral, symmetrical "ground-glass" interstitial infiltrates emanating from the hila in a butterfly pattern.

Pneumocystis jirovecii

Efficacy of prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has mostly been examined in patients receiving treatment with glucocorticoids. The exact dose and duration of treatment with glucocorticoids cannot be defined based on the available data thus far. However, prophylaxis in patients with various AIIRD receiving prednisolone more than 15–30 mg/day for more than 2–4 weeks, has been found to reduce episodes of PCP and associated mortality(table 6). On the other hand, in a study enrolling 184 patients with giant cell arteritis treated with high doses of glucocorticoids (average starting dose of 47 mg of prednisone/day), no PCP cases were recorded, while prophylaxis for PCP was given in only 5 patients.

Table 6
Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP in patients treated with GC

Data for other antirheumatic treatments beyond glucocorticoids are very limited. Katsuyama et al found that patients with RA treated with bDMARDs, having also specific risk factors for PCP development, might benefit from prophylaxis for PCP. In 214patients with RA who received prophylaxis for PCP based on the presence of at least two risk factors (age ≥ 65 years, coexisting pulmonary disease and use of glucocorticoids), no PCP cases were reported, compared with the incidence observed (0.93/100 000) for patients with the same characteristics in whom prophylaxis for PCP was administered based on physician's discretion. In addition, in a small retrospective study, it was shown that annual incidence of PCP was lower in patients treated with cyclophosphamide who received PCP prophylaxis (5.33% (95% CI 0.65% to 19.24%)), compared with those who did not (9.50% (95% CI 1.15% to 34.33%)). Of note, in all but one of these patients, glucocorticoids were coadministered (mean maximum dose of prednisone: 39 mg/day). The most common prophylactic scheme in clinical practice and in published studies is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 480 mg/day or 960 mg three times a week. However, there are a handful of studies, including a RCT, suggesting that reduced dosing regimes (eg, 480 mg every other day) are equally effective and have fewer adverse effects(online supplemental table 5).

### Clinical course, treatment and outcome of Pneumocystis pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a retrospective analysis over 17 years [^2c8cfa98]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Based on the high burden of PcP and the likelihood of unfavorable outcome particularly in non-HIV-positive patients, chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended in high-risk populations. TMP-SMX is also the treatment of choice for PcP. Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy is recommended in HIV-positive patients with severe respiratory failure. However, while beneficial outcomes of higher dosage of corticosteroids in HIV-positive patients during PcP are reported, the outcome of using corticosteroids in non-HIV-positive patients is not clear.

We here report comprehensive epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, therapeutic and outcome data on 240 cases of PcP, including a high percentage of non-HIV-positive patients, in a tertiary care center over the last 17 years. Additionally, we aimed at identifying predictors of outcome.

Precautions and contraindications

Contraindications to the TMP–SMX prophylaxis must be considered: documented hypersensitivity, megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency, severe renal impairment and porphyria. Caution must also be exercised in patients with impaired renal function, impaired hepatic function, severe drug allergies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or blood dyscrasias. The potential for myelosuppression or drug interactions may necessitate consideration of an alternative prophylactic agent.

Myelosuppression has been associated with TMP–SMX use in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Conversely, in a study of adult patients with acute leukaemia, no significant difference in myelosuppression was found when TMP–SMX (1 double strength tablet twice daily) was compared with placebo. The original reports of efficacy of TMP–SMX for prophylaxis did not demonstrate significant myelosuppression. However, when used for prophylaxis against bacteraemia following autologous bone marrow transplantation, the time to neutrophil recovery is significantly longer in patients receiving TMP–SMX, compared to patients receiving ciprofloxacin. We recommend that an alternative prophylactic agent be used in at-risk patients with expected myelosuppression > 7 days (Table 3).

In patients receiving chemotherapy with methotrexate, pancytopenia may occur if prophylactic TMP–SMX is used concurrently. The sulphamethoxazole component may increase toxicity of methotrexate by displacement from binding sites or reduced renal excretion. Small studies of children with acute leukaemia have demonstrated both increased free methotrexate and no change in plasma concentration of methotrexate when co-administered with TMP–SMX. In a study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with up to 25 mg methotrexate per week who received TMP–SMX prophylaxis, no patient developed myelosuppression. Conversely, there are a number of case reports of significant adverse events with the combination. We therefore recommend an alternative prophylactic agent in the setting of concurrent methotrexate therapy (Table 3).

Prophylaxis with TMP–SMX may not be tolerated in patients with advanced malignancy and reduced oral intake due to nausea or dysphagia. This may not have been a significant contributor to duration of prophylaxis in our series as only one out of 13 cases of PCP were utilising palliative care services at the time of diagnosis. Further study is required to address the question of appropriateness of commencing prophylaxis in the setting of palliation.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia complicating immunosuppressive therapy in Crohn's disease: a preventable problem? [^dacb9159]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 76-year-old man who presented with moderate active Crohn's colitis that was refractory to high-dose corticosteroids, mesalazine and 6-mercaptopurine. He subsequently received a trial of infliximab with poor response and was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, improving on antiviral therapy. Three weeks into treatment he developed acute respiratory distress with hypoxaemia and diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates. This was confirmed as Pneumocystis jirovecii on bronchoalveolar lavage. He responded well to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and was subsequently discharged home. Despite the favourable outcome, our case raises the question of whether chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is appropriate. There are currently no recommendations on providing chemoprophylaxis against CMV colitis and so we focus on pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) where wide debate surrounds the use of prophylactic TMP-SMX in HIV-negative patients. Contrasting approaches to chemoprophylaxis against PCP in IBD likely relates to a lack of clear parameters for defining risk of PCP among patient groups. This must be addressed in order to develop universal guidelines that take into account patient-dependent risk factors. Awareness of the severity of PCP among HIV-negative individuals and the current consensus on PCP prophylaxis in IBD must be raised in order to minimise the risk of PCP and drive research in this controversial area.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^fa54dee9]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Opportunistic infection — acute treatment and chronic maintenance therapy specifies TMP-SMX (TMP 5 mg/kg and SMX 25 mg/kg) IV or PO twice a day (AII) as preferred therapy, with acute therapy given for at least 6 weeks (BII) and longer if disease is extensive or response is incomplete at 6 weeks, after which all patients should be initiated on chronic maintenance therapy. Chronic maintenance options include pyrimethamine* 25–50 mg PO daily plus sulfadiazine 2,000–4,000 mg PO daily (in 2–4 divided doses) plus leucovorin 10–25 mg PO daily (AI), or TMP-SMX DS one tablet twice a day (AII); alternatives include atovaquone 750–1,500 mg PO twice a day plus (pyrimethamine* 25 mg plus leucovorin 10 mg) PO daily (BII), atovaquone 750–1,500 mg PO twice a day plus sulfadiazine 2,000–4,000 mg PO daily (in two to four divided doses) (BII), or atovaquone 750–1,500 mg PO twice a day (BII). Adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) should only be administered when clinically indicated to treat mass effect associated with focal lesions or associated edema (BIII) and discontinued as soon as clinically feasible; antiseizure medications should be administered to patients with a history of seizures (AII) and continued through acute treatment (BII) but should not be used as seizure prophylaxis (BIII); if clindamycin is used in place of sulfadiazine, additional therapy must be added to prevent PCP (AII).

### Trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-positive advanced breast cancer with or without brain metastases: a phase 3b / 4 trial [^49cba46b]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Lack of an adjudication committee in DESTINY-Breast12 limits direct comparison of ILD/pneumonitis rates with those from previous clinical studies that included an adjudication committee within the protocol. However, rates of ILD/pneumonitis events observed in both cohorts (16% (grade 5: 2%) and 13% (grade 5: 1%) of patients with and without baseline BMs, respectively) were consistent with T-DXd data for patients with HER2 + mBC in the DESTINY-Breast01 (16%; grade 5: 3%), DESTINY-Breast02 (10%; grade 5: < 1%) and DESTINY-Breast03 (15%; grade 5: 0) studies –. Most cases of ILD/pneumonitis were mild or moderate; however, six deaths in the baseline BMs cohort and three deaths in the no baseline BMs cohort were judged by investigators to be caused by ILD/pneumonitis. Although opportunistic infections were not systematically tested, five cases of opportunistic infection were reported as co-occurring with ILD/pneumonitis (one grade 4 event and four grade 5 events) in the baseline BMs cohort. Clinical and radiologic features of drug-induced ILD/pneumonitis can resemble infectious etiology; in patients with co-occurring opportunistic infection and ILD/pneumonitis, differentiating the underlying cause of pulmonary toxicity can be challenging, and drug-induced ILD is a diagnosis of exclusion. These results highlight the need to consider PJP prophylaxis in patients taking chronic corticosteroids. Prompt initiation of steroidal treatment in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis is required in accordance with current guidelines, and T-DXd should be interrupted as a precaution until the etiology is confirmed. Delays in providing this treatment (for example, waiting for results of blood culture tests) should be avoided where possible to minimize worsening of ILD/pneumonitis and associated fatalities in this patient population. Where ILD/pneumonitis is suspected, the possibility of infectious etiology should be explored subsequent to immediate treatment to inform future treatment decisions.

### Risk-benefit analysis of primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving rituximab [^e4cef9a3]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify a specific population of patients with rheumatic diseases receiving rituximab treatment for whom the benefit from primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) outweighs the risk of adverse events (AEs).

Methods

This study included 818 patients treated with rituximab for rheumatic diseases, among whom 419 received prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) with rituximab, while the remainder did not. Differences in 1-year PJP incidence between the groups were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Risk-benefit assessment was performed in subgroups stratified according to risk factors based on the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 case of PJP and the number needed to harm (NNH) due to severe AEs. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to minimize the confounding by indication.

Results

During the 663.1 person-years, there were 11 PJP cases, with a mortality rate of 63.6%. Concomitant use of high-dose glucocorticoids (≥ 30 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent during 4weeks after rituximab administration) was the most important risk factor. The PJP incidence (per 100 person-years) was 7.93 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.91–17.25) in the subgroup receiving high-dose glucocorticoids compared with 0.40 (95% CI 0.01–2.25) in the subgroup without high-dose glucocorticoid use. Although prophylactic TMP/SMX significantly reduced the overall PJP incidence (HR 0.11 [95% CI 0.03–0.43]), the NNT to prevent 1 case of PJP (146) was higher than the NNH (86). In contrast, the NNT fell to 20 (95% CI 10.7–65.7) in patients receiving concomitant high-dose glucocorticoids.

Conclusion

The benefit associated with primary PJP prophylaxis outweighs the risk of severe AEs in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving rituximab and concomitant high-dose glucocorticoid treatment.

Impact ofdose at discontinuing‐on the incidence of

Because the GC dose at TMP‐SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group, we further evaluated its impact on PJP occurrence. Using maximally selected rank statistics, the optimal cutoff GC dose that best distinguished the PJP from the control group was identified as 12.5 mg prednisone equivalent (P < 0.001). In fact, 90% (9 of 10) of the patients who developed PJP in the prophylaxis group were taking > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent dosage at the time of prophylaxis withdrawal, compared with only 35.1% (n = 451) in the control group. When the entire prophylactic episodes were divided into two groups based on the GC dose at the end of prophylaxis (> 12.5 mg vs ≤ 12.5 mg of prednisone equivalent), the episodes with higher GC dose (n = 460, 35.5%) at the time of prophylaxis withdrawal showed a significantly higher risk of PJP (HR, 18.55; 95% CI, 2.35–146.42; P = 0.006) (Figure 2). The result was consistent in the multivariable Cox regression analysis in which relevant risk factors for PJP were adjusted (adjusted HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 1.71–111.80; P = 0.014) (Table 3).

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) secondary prophylaxis in children with and exposed to HIV — TMP-SMX (Cotrimoxazole) is the first choice, dosed as TMP 2.5–5 mg/kg body weight/dose with SMX 12.5–25 mg/kg body weight/dose twice per day, with dosing based on the TMP component; the total daily dose should not exceed 320 mg TMP and 1,600 mg SMX, and dosing schemes used include 3 days per week on consecutive or alternate days, 2 days per week on consecutive or alternate days, or every day with a total daily dose of TMP 5–10 mg/kg body weight given as a single dose each day. Alternatives include dapsone for children aged ≥ 1 months at 2 mg/kg body weight (maximum 100 mg) by mouth once daily or 4 mg/kg body weight (maximum 200 mg) by mouth once weekly; atovaquone for children aged 1–3 months and > 24 months–12 years at 30–40 mg/kg body weight/dose by mouth once daily with food, for children aged 4–24 months at 45 mg/kg body weight/dose by mouth once daily with food, and for children aged ≥ 13 years at 1,500 mg (10 cc oral yellow suspension) per dose by mouth once daily; and aerosolized pentamidine for children aged ≥ 5 years at 300 mg every month via Respirgard II™ nebulizer. Secondary prophylaxis is indicated for children with prior episode of PCP, and criteria for discontinuing secondary prophylaxis and for restarting secondary prophylaxis are the same as for primary prophylaxis.

### Temsirolimus [^d2decce2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Interstitial Lung Disease

Cases of interstitial lung disease, some resulting in death, occurred in patients who received Temsirolimus injection. Some patients were asymptomatic, or had minimal symptoms, with infiltrates detected on computed tomography scan or chest radiograph. Others presented with symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and fever. Some patients required discontinuation of Temsirolimus injection and/or treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics, while some patients continued treatment without additional intervention. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.

It is recommended that patients undergo baseline radiographic assessment by lung computed tomography scan or chest radiograph prior to the initiation of Temsirolimus injection therapy. Follow such assessments periodically, even in the absence of clinical respiratory symptoms.

It is recommended that patients be followed closely for occurrence of clinical respiratory symptoms. If clinically significant respiratory symptoms develop, consider withholding Temsirolimus injection administration until after recovery of symptoms and improvement of radiographic findings related to pneumonitis. Empiric treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics may be considered. Opportunistic infections such as PJP should be considered in the differential diagnosis. For patients who require use of corticosteroids, prophylaxis of PJP may be considered.

5.6 Hyperlipidemia

The use of Temsirolimus injection is likely to result in increases in serum triglycerides and cholesterol. In the phase 3 trial, 87% of patients receiving Temsirolimus injection had at least one elevated serum cholesterol value and 83% had at least one elevated serum triglyceride value. This may require initiation, or increase in the dose, of lipid-lowering agents. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides should be tested before and during treatment with Temsirolimus injection.

5.7 Bowel Perforation

Cases of fatal bowel perforation occurred in patients who received Temsirolimus injection. These patients presented with fever, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, bloody stools, diarrhea, and/or acute abdomen. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening abdominal pain or blood in their stools.

5.8 Renal Failure

Cases of rapidly progressive and sometimes fatal acute renal failure not clearly related to disease progression occurred in patients who received Temsirolimus injection. Some of these cases were not responsive to dialysis.

5.9 Wound Healing Complications

Use of Temsirolimus injection has been associated with abnormal wound healing. Therefore, caution should be exercised with the use of Temsirolimus injection in the perioperative period.

### Management of rheumatoid arthritis: update from ACR… [^5b5f8c18]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, hydroxychloroquine is recommended for initial treatment in those with low disease activity.
- Methotrexate is recommended for initial treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and moderate or high disease activity.
- Rheumatoid arthritis treatment should be targeted to a standardized disease activity scale. Moderate to High Disease Activity With moderate to high disease activity, methotrexate is the best initial treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate has stronger evidence of disease-modifying activity than the other csDMARDs, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. Although some bDMARDs and tsDMARDs have evidence of better outcomes, methotrexate is safe and effective, with convenient dosing and low cost. Combination therapy is not recommended for initial treatment because it is unnecessary for many patients and incurs higher toxicity and cost. Recommendations for methotrexate therapy are summarized in.

|If symptoms do not improve sufficiently with oral methotrexate, switch to subcutaneous methotrexate before changing or adding medications| Neither short- nor long-term glucocorticoid therapy is recommended as standard initial treatment, although some patients may require short-term glucocorticoid therapy in addition to DMARDs to aid with symptom control. Coexisting Conditions For patients with subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules, methotrexate is recommended as initial therapy unless nodules progress. Switching to a different DMARD is then recommended. Although preexisting lung disease is a risk factor for methotrexate-related pneumonitis, the risk is uncertain and other therapies can also worsen lung disease. Methotrexate is recommended with careful monitoring. 1 The CADI is easy to access, is the quickest to complete, requires no laboratory measurements, and grades disease activity as remission, low, moderate, and high.

The ACR is clear on the initial recommended medications — hydroxychloroquine for low disease activity and methotrexate for moderate or high disease activity. For patients with uncontrolled symptoms while taking methotrexate, triple therapy with conventional synthetic DMARDs is consistently effective. Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine can all be easily prescribed and monitored with little or no guidance from a rheumatologist and are much safer, better tolerated, and less expensive than biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

### Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with b / tsDMARDs: insights from 3787 cases in the FIRST registry [^126959ca]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Kaplan-Meier curves for time to pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)-onset. P -value was calculated by log rank test under intention-to-treat analysis.

Supplementary Table S1 (available at Rheumatology online) provides details on the PCP prophylaxis profile at the study baseline. The PCP incidence increased with increased number of coexisting risk factors from 0.2% (no risk factor) to 11.1% (3 risk factors); however, PCP prophylaxis suppressed the risk factors–dependent increase in PCP incidence in both cohorts (no risk factor, 0.0%; 1 risk factor, 0.3%; 2 risk factors, 1.0%; 3 risk factors, 0.0%; Supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online).

Of note, 8 participants throughout the study developed PCP despite having received prophylaxis at baseline (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Furthermore, each was being treated with either pentamidine inhalation prophylaxis (n = 5) or untreated with any prophylaxis (n = 3) at the time of PCP onset. On the other hand, no PCP was observed in participants treated with SMX–TMP prophylaxis (P < 0.0001, Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online), suggesting that SMX–TMP is the preferable prophylaxis. However, SMX–TMP is known to be associated with a considerable rate of adverse events. Indeed, 11.4% of participants discontinued the regular prophylaxis dose of SMX–TMP (560 mg TMP/week) due to adverse events in another cohort study conducted at our hospital (data not shown). Therefore, we de-escalated the prophylaxis dose of SMX–TMP from 2012 with reference to a new regimen using a lower dose SMX–TMP known to be associated with less adverse events. The incidence of PCP in this study decreased chronologically from 3.4/100 PYs in 2004 to 0/100 PYs in 2019, although the SMX–TMP dose in the prophylaxis was reduced from 454 mg/week in 2004 to 275 mg/week in 2019 on average (Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online). These data suggest that a lower dose of SMX–TMP can be effective in preventing PCP in RA patients treated with b/tsDMARDs.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis — alternative regimens and TMP-SMX management: Alternative prophylactic options include dapsone 50 mg PO daily with pyrimethamine 50 mg plus leucovorin 25 mg PO weekly (BI), dapsone 200 mg plus pyrimethamine 75 mg plus leucovorin 25 mg PO weekly (BI), or atovaquone 1,500 mg PO daily with food (BI). Regimens that should only be used if the person is seronegative for Toxoplasma gondii are dapsone 100 mg PO daily (BI), aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly via Respirgard II nebulizer (BI), or intravenous pentamidine 300 mg every 28 days (CIII). Patients who are receiving pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine for treatment or suppression of toxoplasmosis do not require additional PCP prophylaxis (AII). If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, reinstitution should be considered after the reaction resolves (AII); the dose can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BII) or the drug can be given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII), and TMP-SMX should be permanently discontinued in patients with possible or definite Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrosis (AIII).

### Pneumonia in a patient taking benepali for rheumatoid arthritis [^0146254f]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a 57-year-old woman who contracted Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia while on Benepali, the biosimilar version of etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis. She had seropositive erosive disease. She was admitted to clinic with a 2-week history of dyspnoea, dry cough and fever. Her initial examination showed her to be hypoxic on air with saturations of 77% and left basal crackles. Her admission chest X-ray showed fine reticular shadowing, with an initial suspicion of pulmonary fibrosis. She was empirically treated for community-acquired pneumonia but continued to deteriorate with a worsening type 1 respiratory failure. She was intubated and ventilated on intensive care. The suspicion was raised of P. jiroveci pneumonia given her immunosuppression, hypoxic presentation and chest X-ray changes. This was confirmed on sputum PCR. She was treated with a 3-week course of steroids and co-trimoxazole. She was discharged home after a 2-week admission.

### Disseminated nocardiosis with infective endocarditis of a transplanted heart [^9e60c0bf]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We identified a total of 10 case reports of nocardial endocarditis involving native heart valves from 1973 to 2017. Two of those cases occurred in patients with a history of solid organ transplantation (liver and kidney). None of the cases occurred in a patient with a history of heart transplantation. The most common presenting feature in these patients was fever. The antibiotic treatment regimen used most frequency was imipenem/amikacin followed by a prolonged course of TMP/SMX. With treatment, 6 of the 10 patients (60%) survived.

Due to underlying chronic kidney disease, this patient was previously treated with pentamidine rather than TMP/SMX for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis (PJP). Although pentamidine does provide excellent coverage for PJP, it is not active against Nocardia. This clue from the patient's history raised suspicion for nocardiosis, which was reaffirmed when Gram-positive bacilli were found in the blood. Currently, there is no official recommendation for prophylaxis against Nocardia in immunocompromised hosts. It has traditionally been thought that TMP/SMX at doses used for prophylaxis against PJP provides at least some coverage against Nocardia. However, recent studies have shown that the use of TMP/SMX at prophylactic doses is not protective against nocardiosis.
