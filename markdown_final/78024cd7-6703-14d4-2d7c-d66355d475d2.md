## Question

Can MRI findings distinguish between plexiform neurofibromas and fat-containing Bochdalek hernias?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether MRI findings can distinguish between plexiform neurofibromas and fat-containing Bochdalek hernias. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core MRI signal characteristics that separate neural tissue from fat. Then, I should verify the classic imaging features of plexiform neurofibromas and of Bochdalek hernias. Next, I will compare these features head-to-head and consider potential pitfalls and mimics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and state the bottom line with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental tissue contrast principles. Plexiform neurofibromas are composed of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, and collagen and typically show low-to-intermediate signal on T1-weighted images and high signal on T2-weighted images, often with a target sign and variable enhancement, reflecting their neural origin and myxoid stroma, whereas fat-containing Bochdalek hernias contain macroscopic fat that follows subcutaneous fat signal on T1 and suppresses on fat-suppressed sequences, which is a key discriminator on MRI [^f2538793] [^53e534b2] [^cf282cd0].

> Wait, let me verify the classic MRI features of plexiform neurofibroma. On T1-weighted images, plexiform neurofibromas are isointense to muscle, on T2-weighted images they are hyperintense and may show a target sign with central low signal and peripheral high signal, and post-contrast there is variable enhancement of solid components. They often track along nerves in a fascicular or rope-like pattern and may demonstrate a split-fat sign at the poles, all of which reflect their neurogenic origin and architecture [^f2538793] [^53e534b2] [^e6a123df].

> I need to check the MRI features of a fat-containing Bochdalek hernia. Bochdalek hernias are posterolateral diaphragmatic defects that typically contain omental or peritoneal fat herniating into the thorax. On MRI, the fat component shows high T1 signal that suppresses on fat-suppressed sequences, and multiplanar imaging can demonstrate the diaphragmatic defect and continuity with the abdomen, which is pathognomonic for hernia rather than a solid neural tumor [^cf282cd0] [^05092e70].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should compare these features head-to-head. Signal on T1-weighted images is the most reliable separator: plexiform neurofibromas are low-to-intermediate and isointense to muscle, whereas Bochdalek hernia fat is high signal like subcutaneous fat. On T2, neurofibromas are hyperintense and may show a target sign, while hernia fat is intermediate-to-low on T2 and suppresses on fat-sat. Enhancement after gadolinium is expected in neurofibroma solid components but absent in hernia fat. And morphology differs: neurofibromas are solid, often multilobulated, and may encase or follow nerves, while hernias show a fat-filled sac traversing a diaphragmatic defect with clear anatomic continuity [^f2538793] [^53e534b2] [^cf282cd0].

> But wait, what if there are mimics or pitfalls. Let me consider a few. A neurofibroma with prominent myxoid change can be very bright on T2 and might be mistaken for fluid or cystic change, yet it remains solid and will not suppress on fat-saturated sequences, unlike fat. Conversely, a hernia containing not only fat but also bowel or omentum could show mixed solid and fat components, but the fat will still suppress on fat-sat and the diaphragmatic defect will be visible on coronal or sagittal planes. Rarely, lipomatous tumors can herniate and mimic a hernia, but their internal septations and enhancement patterns differ from simple hernia fat and can be distinguished with careful MRI assessment and, if needed, histology [^f2538793] [^3fdb6b6b] [^16a365b3].

> I should double-check the practical diagnostic approach. A standardized MRI protocol with T1, T2, and fat-suppressed sequences in orthogonal planes is essential. If a lesion is high signal on T1 and suppresses on fat-sat, a fat-containing hernia is most likely. If the lesion is low-to-intermediate on T1, high on T2, and enhances, a plexiform neurofibroma is favored. Multiplanar reconstructions help confirm diaphragmatic continuity for hernias, and documenting nerve continuity or a target sign supports neurofibroma. In equivocal cases, diffusion-weighted imaging may add value for neurogenic tumors, though it is not specific for this exact differential and should be interpreted in context [^7f5042aa] [^f2538793] [^3be3a4a4].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating certainty. Yes, MRI can reliably distinguish plexiform neurofibromas from fat-containing Bochdalek hernias in most cases by combining T1 signal behavior with fat suppression, T2 signal and enhancement patterns, and anatomic morphology. The key discriminators are fat signal that suppresses on fat-sat versus solid neural tissue that does not, and the demonstration of a diaphragmatic defect with herniated fat versus a solid nerve-sheath tumor tracking along nerves. Pitfalls exist when hernia contents are mixed or when neurofibromas are very myxoid, but careful multiplanar MRI usually resolves these issues without biopsy [^f2538793] [^53e534b2] [^cf282cd0].

MRI can reliably distinguish plexiform neurofibromas from fat-containing Bochdalek hernias by their **signal characteristics and anatomic features**. Plexiform neurofibromas are **solid, T1-hypointense, T2-hyperintense lesions** that enhance and track along nerves, often showing a "target sign" or "fascicular sign", and are continuous with a parent nerve [^f2538793] [^53e534b2]. In contrast, Bochdalek hernias contain **macroscopic fat** that follows subcutaneous fat signal on T1 and suppresses on fat-suppressed sequences, herniates through a posterolateral diaphragmatic defect, and lacks enhancement or nerve continuity [^cf282cd0] [^05092e70]. These features make MRI the **modality of choice** for confident differentiation without biopsy [^notfound].

## MRI features of plexiform neurofibromas

Plexiform neurofibromas are **benign nerve sheath tumors** arising from multiple nerve fascicles, typically in patients with NF1 [^f2538793]. MRI is the gold standard for characterization because of its superior soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar capabilities [^4fb8a551].

- **T1-weighted imaging**: Isointense to hypointense relative to muscle; may show subtle heterogeneity.
- **T2-weighted imaging**: Hyperintense with a characteristic "target sign" (central low signal with peripheral high signal) in about 50% of cases, reflecting central collagenous and peripheral myxoid components [^f2538793] [^e6a123df].
- **Contrast enhancement**: Variable, often heterogeneous, with the central region enhancing more than the periphery in target lesions [^e6a123df].
- **Morphology**: Multilobulated, infiltrative lesions that track along nerves, often encasing vessels without invasion; may show the "fascicular sign" (multiple small ring-like structures on T2) [^53e534b2].
- **Growth pattern**: Typically slow, but can cause significant morbidity due to size and location; malignant transformation to MPNST is a key concern, prompting surveillance for new pain, rapid growth, or neurologic deficits [^5b2b1927] [^984b99fa].

## MRI features of fat-containing Bochdalek hernias

Bochdalek hernias are congenital diaphragmatic defects through which intra-abdominal fat herniates into the thorax. MRI is highly specific for identifying **fat and the diaphragmatic defect** [^cf282cd0].

- **T1-weighted imaging**: Hyperintense signal identical to subcutaneous fat, often with a thin capsule [^16a365b3].
- **T2-weighted imaging**: Intermediate signal that suppresses on fat-suppressed sequences, confirming fat content [^16a365b3].
- **Contrast enhancement**: No enhancement of the fat component; rare peripheral enhancement of the capsule or adjacent pleura may be seen.
- **Morphology**: Well-circumscribed fat-containing mass contiguous with the abdomen through a posterolateral diaphragmatic defect; may contain omentum or, rarely, bowel [^cf282cd0] [^05092e70].
- **Complications**: Typically asymptomatic, but can cause respiratory compromise if large or if bowel herniates and obstructs [^05092e70].

## Key MRI differentiating features

| **Feature** | **Plexiform neurofibroma** | **Fat-containing bochdalek hernia** |
|-|-|-|
| T1 signal | Isointense to hypointense (muscle-like) | Hyperintense (fat-like) |
| T2 signal | Hyperintense with target sign | Intermediate, suppresses on fat-sat |
| Enhancement | Heterogeneous, solid enhancement | No enhancement of fat |
| Morphology | Multilobulated, infiltrative, nerve-tracking | Well-circumscribed, fat-containing |
| Diaphragm | Intact | Defect with herniation |
| Nerve continuity | Present (parent nerve) | Absent |
| Fat suppression | Does not suppress | Suppresses completely |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Accurate MRI differentiation guides management: plexiform neurofibromas require **longitudinal surveillance** for growth and malignant transformation, with MRI as the primary modality and PET-CT reserved for suspected MPNST [^4fb8a551] [^984b99fa]; Bochdalek hernias are managed conservatively unless symptomatic or complicated, in which case surgical repair is indicated [^notfound].

MRI reliably distinguishes plexiform neurofibromas from fat-containing Bochdalek hernias by their **signal characteristics, enhancement, morphology, and relationship to nerves and the diaphragm**, enabling confident, noninvasive diagnosis and appropriate management.

Plexiform neurofibromas — these lesions are a distinct type of neurofibroma that arise from 1 or multiple nerve trunks or branches, often come to attention early in childhood, and are believed to be congenital. They are found in approximately 50% of individuals with NF1 by whole-body MRI in adults, but less than 20% of individuals will require any intervention during childhood.

There is a broad spectrum of primary pelvic retroperitoneal masses in adults that demonstrate characteristic epidemiologic and histopathologic features and natural histories. These masses may be classified into five distinct subgroups using a pattern-based approach that takes anatomic distribution and certain imaging characteristics into account, allowing greater accuracy in their detection and characterization and helping to optimize patient management. The five groups are cystic (serous and mucinous epithelial neoplasms, pelvic lymphangioma, tailgut cyst, ancient schwannoma), vascular or hypervascular (solitary fibrous tumor, paraganglioma, pelvic arteriovenous malformation, Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome, extraintestinal GIST [gastrointestinal stromal tumor]), fat-containing (lipoma, liposarcoma, myelolipoma, presacral teratoma), calcified (calcified lymphocele, calcified rejected transplant kidney, rare sarcomas), and myxoid (schwannoma, plexiform neurofibroma, myxoma). Cross-sectional imaging modalities help differentiate the more common gynecologic neoplasms from more unusual masses. In particular, the tissue-specific multiplanar capability of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging permits better tumor localization and internal characterization, thereby serving as a road map for surgery.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1: a diagnostic mimicker at CT [^3d76bf6e]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common of the phakomatoses and has a variety of localized or, more frequently, systemic manifestations throughout the thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities. Classic computed tomographic (CT) findings in NF1 with thoracic involvement include small, well-defined subcutaneous neurofibromas, focal thoracic scoliosis, posterior vertebral scalloping, enlarged neural foramina, and characteristic rib abnormalities due to bone dysplasia or erosion from adjacent neurofibromas. However, more atypical manifestations are occasionally seen, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be useful in equivocal cases. NF1 with abdominopelvic involvement tends to arise in the retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and paraspinal regions; it may be quite extensive and therefore difficult to distinguish from adenopathy at CT. The multiplanar capabilities of MR imaging, particularly with T2 weighting, make this modality helpful in evaluating affected patients and making the diagnosis. The classic peripheral manifestations of NF1 include limb hemihypertrophy, pseudarthrosis, peripheral nerve neurofibromas, and subcutaneous common and plexiform neurofibromas. In some cases of NF1, imaging findings are inconclusive, and biopsy and subsequent pathologic analysis are required. Familiarity with the various manifestations of NF1 in different anatomic locations is important in making the diagnosis and optimizing postdiagnostic treatment.

Discussion

In this article, we have shown a wide range of lipomatous tumours in patients who presented with a palpable lesion herniating through a defect in the abdominal wall or extending in the psoas compartment.

In daily practice, this implies that however rare soft tissue sarcomas may be, the ultrasound assessment of an inguinal hernia or a quadriceps muscle strain can be the moment of detecting a sarcoma, i.e. this examination is often not performed by an MSK radiologist or in a tertiary referral centre.

We would like to summarise the take home messages for the encounter with these herniating lesions using the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) guidelines for soft tissue tumours for reference.

The first diagnostic step in the characterisation of a palpable soft tissue mass is an ultrasound. Ultrasound is mainly performed to exclude clearly benign lesions such as ganglions or other cystic lesions, bursas, small subcutaneous lipomas, palmar or plantar fibromas and neurofibromas.

When assessing a superficial lipomatous lesion, it should be homogeneous and well defined, encapsulated and compressible. When assessing a hernia with ultrasound, if the herniating tissue is not fully accessible, i.e. too large or the margins are not clearly visible, additional cross-sectional imaging by CT or MRI is warranted. For pelvic and retroperitoneal lesions, CT is the first step in further characterisation of the lesion.

Worrisome features for lipomatous tumours include size > 5 cm, nodularity which may represent a dedifferentiated area within the tumour, multiple septations or thickened septations within the lesion and deep location, i.e. below the superficial muscle fascia (intra- or inter-muscular, retroperitoneal). In addition, from our experience, haziness of the fat and oedema within the fatty tumour can point towards a malignant lesion.

Diffuse vascular malformations like hemangiomatosis and cystic lymphangiomatosis can involve both the bone and the soft tissue (liver, spleen, lung). At diagnosis, enhanced sequences will be performed to differentiate enhancing hemangiomatosis from non enhancing lymphangiomatosis.

Several studies have also demonstrated the role of WB-MRI to follow-up neurofibromatosi s, for volumic assessment of plexiform neurofibromas.

Limits and perspectives

The main limits of WB-MRI are its low specificity for staging in oncology, with the risk to overestimate secondary lesions and over-treat the patients. Conventional sequences do not differentiate benign from malignant lymphadenopathy as PET-CT does. Adding diffusion sequence may help to overcome this limitation.

Small lesions in the lung or small lymph nodes can also be overlooked with WB-MRI. Indeed, Brennan et al. have demonstrated that sensitivity of WB-MRI using coronal and axial sequences was 100% for lymph nodes larger than 12 mm, but was only 11% for lymph nodes smaller than 6 mm. For tumoral staging, it is therefore recommended to add axial sequences on the trunk with respiratory gating if possible. DWI could also improve the sensitivity of WB-MRI to diagnose small lesions.

Technological advances could decrease movement artefacts, using respiration gating, but with a slight increase of the acquisition time.

Dynamic enhanced sequences can be performed with some manufacturers with a reasonable temporal resolution.

3T MRI can improve signal to noise ratio, but can also increase susceptibility artifacts in particular for DWI. Fat suppression is also challenging at higher-field MRI.

Diffusion-weighted imaging

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can help to characterise lesions, adding functional information.

DWI sequence for whole body examination is now available on most devices, however acquisition time remains high and this sequence is not performed routinely. Single shot echo planar (SS-EPI) sequence is commonly used. DWIBS (Diffusion-weighted Whole Body Imaging with Body background Signal Suppression) is performed with fat saturation, free breathing, and a high b value (b = 1000 s/mm 2) in order to suppress background noise and to enhance lesion signal. Inversion of grey scale is used to obtain TEP like images. DWIBS sequence only provides qualitative analysis.

### Radiological manifestations of abdominopelvic nerve tumours seen in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^daaec05b]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common of the phakomatoses, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Neurofibromas arise from Schwann cells and fibroblasts and plexiform neurofibromas are pathognomonic for NF1, which may arise in any peripheral nerve. The clinical expression of NF1 is extremely variable and gastrointestinal manifestations of NF1 are relatively uncommon. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging findings of abdominopelvic nerve tumours seen in NF1 in both paediatric and adult patients.

### A Bayesian approach for diagnostic accuracy of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2a0c993a]. Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths, Limitations, and Future Perspectives

Limitations to this study include the relatively high proportion of studies included to be at high risk of bias, most commonly due to concerns regarding patient selection. There was heterogeneity among study populations which led to heterogeneity of diagnostic accuracy as evaluated by subgroup analyses. Studies could be too strict in patient selection when only histologically proven lesions are included, possibly representing a group of lesions that are considered high risk of malignancy based on imaging. Contrarily, when non-symptomatic lesions are included the proportion of low-risk lesions rises. Subgroup analyses in this study should however be interpreted with caution as many were performed on a small number of studies. Most studies were also retrospective of nature further diminishing quality of evidence. Lastly, MPNSTs can be difficult to distinguish histologically from BPNSTs and a central review of pathology would be ideal. Despite these limitations using a Bayesian approach, the quantification of diagnostic accuracy and uncertainty of common MRI and FDG-PET characteristics were reliable even when a total number of studies or patients was small and there was heterogeneity in thresholds. Unfortunately many features of interest, such as delayed scanning in FDG-PET and functional MRI are thus far infrequently studied which excluded them from meta-analyses. Yet these features seem promising, possibly providing higher accuracies compared to features analyzed in meta-analyses. Based on the findings of this study, future research should investigate several knowledge gaps. First, the MRI characteristics found in this study should be validated in a large series of patients to distinguish a patient group at high risk for malignant transformation which minimizes the need for further diagnostics in low-risk patients. Second, only symptomatic or growing lesions should generally undergo imaging. More regular radiological follow-up could be considered of large plexiform neurofibromas at tumor sites that may cause symptoms only in a later stage, such as retroperitoneal or mediastinal sites. In younger children, more frequent radiological follow-up may be indicated as well in case of plexiform neurofibromas at tumor sites that may cause morbidity even without malignant transformation. The value of cystic changes, heterogeneity on T1- and T2-weighted images, large tumor size, and intratumoral lobulation should be studied for additional value too. DWI and ADC imaging seem of interest as well and might be of particular interest in the sporadic patient population. Schwannomas are the most common form of BPNST in sporadic patients and cannot be reliably distinguished on FDG-PET as schwannomas commonly have high levels of FDG uptake. Also, schwannomas with cystic changes are common (ancient schwannomas) and may exhibit heterogeneous features.MRI characteristics need to be assessed between sporadic and NF1 patients to explore possible variations in diagnostic accuracy which may necessitate different diagnostic guidelines. In NF1, the use of a SUV max threshold of ≥ 3.5 should be replicated in a large database of patients who underwent scans that adhere to EARL criteria. Additionally, late scanning and other semi-quantitative parameters should be evaluated in the same population to find one with higher specificity. Altogether, these findings may enable proper diagnostic algorithms to arise for evaluating MRI scans and using distinct threshold values of FDG-PET characteristics in NF1 populations. This way unnecessary imaging, biopsies, and harmful resections will diminish. In sporadic patients, suspect lesions should then undergo biopsy based on MRI findings. In NF1 patients, suspect lesions should be evaluated with additional FDG-PET imaging. Lesions with SUV max > 3.5 or high T/L ratio should have a PET-guided biopsy. Whenever biopsies of suspect lesions are negative one may consider nerve-sparing resection or a wait-and-scan approach. Furthermore, the use of radiomics and deep learning has not yet been studied in nerve sheath tumors, but may be useful when studies are performed correctly including sufficient MPNST images. It may even help stratifying low- and high-grade MPNSTs. The search for an ideal liquid biopsy should be stimulated as well since its use may diminish the need for FDG-PET scans and decrease radiation exposure in the NF population who is already prone to tumorigenesis.

### Spectrum of gastrointestinal lesions of neurofibromatosis type 1: a pictorial review [^cafd8d08]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Extra-peritoneal neurofibromas are often single and can be localised everywhere in the retroperitoneal space, mainly in the paraspinal position.

Plexiform neurofibromas are variants of neurofibromas that involve a plexus of nerves or multiple fascicles in a medium- to large-sized nerve within a larger nerve resulting macroscopically in "rope-like" or "bag-of-worms" aspects. They are benign nerve sheath tumours usually affecting the head, neck, pelvis and extremities but can be found anywhere in the body. They tend to grow to large sizes and may cause substantial disfigurement. Plexiform neurofibromas are seen exclusively in NF1; they are thought to be congenital and usually manifest early in life with an incidence of 15–30%. In the abdomen, they are most commonly found in the abdomino-pelvic wall and retro-peritoneum. Intra-hepatic infiltration is rare, comprising 2.3% of all plexiform neurofibromas of the abdomen and pelvis, and has been reported in fewer than 20 cases in the literature, 3 of which were in children.

On CT, plexiform neurofibromas appear as a multilobulated hypoattenuating tumour (Fig. 3). They may rarely infiltrate the mesentery by extending along nerve pathways. On MRI, plexiform neurofibromas appear with a characteristic "ring-like" pattern due to their fascicular architecture (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
A 13-year-old boy with systemic NF1. Small bowel CT scan (a, b) and MRI (c, d) show a lobulated mass surrounding the retroperitoneal vessels extending from the left lateral aortic region to hepatic hilum (arrows)

Malignant transformation of neurofibromas to MPNSTs is possible. It has been reported that most MPNSTs arise from preexisting plexiform neurofibromas and metastasise throughout the body.

### Fat-containing soft-tissue masses in children [^bc38a77d]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of soft-tissue masses in children can be difficult because of the frequently nonspecific clinical and imaging characteristics of these lesions. However key findings on imaging can aid in diagnosis. The identification of macroscopic fat within a soft-tissue mass narrows the differential diagnosis considerably and suggests a high likelihood of a benign etiology in children. Fat can be difficult to detect with sonography because of the variable appearance of fat using this modality. Fat is easier to recognize using MRI, particularly with the aid of fat-suppression techniques. Although a large portion of fat-containing masses in children are adipocytic tumors, a variety of other tumors and mass-like conditions that contain fat should be considered by the radiologist confronted with a fat-containing mass in a child. In this article we review the sonographic and MRI findings in the most relevant fat-containing soft-tissue masses in the pediatric age group, including adipocytic tumors (lipoma, angiolipoma, lipomatosis, lipoblastoma, lipomatosis of nerve, and liposarcoma); fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumors (fibrous hamartoma of infancy and lipofibromatosis); vascular anomalies (involuting hemangioma, intramuscular capillary hemangioma, phosphate and tensin homologue (PTEN) hamartoma of soft tissue, fibro-adipose vascular anomaly), and other miscellaneous entities, such as fat necrosis and epigastric hernia.

### Spectrum of gastrointestinal lesions of neurofibromatosis type 1: a pictorial review [^94b35410]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Neurofibromas

Neurofibroma is the hallmark lesion of NF1. Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumours arising from Schwann cells, and the Auerbach plexus is the usual site of origin. They may be unique or multiple with four subtypes, listed in Table 3: cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodular or diffuse plexiform and spinal.

Table 3
Different subtypes of neurofibromas

Often multiple, neurofibromas of the gastrointestinal tract originate from the myenteric plexus. Histologically, they are composed of Schwann cells, fibroblasts and myxoid or mucinous matrix surrounded by collagenous tissue with mast cell infiltration and adipocytes, associated with cystic degeneration. It may present as a solitary mass with smooth well-defined margins or a plexiform presentation. Malignant transformation is reported in between 5 and 15%, especially in patients of over 40 years of age.

Asymptomatic in 65%, GI tract neurofibromas are often incidentally detected during surgery for associated tumours. Those tumours show up as thickening of the bowel wall or multiple nodules recognised at conventional barium examination as mural rigidity, external mass effect or scalloping of the mucosa. On CT scan, they appear as homogeneously hypoattenuating round or tubular masses (Fig. 2). This characteristic reflects components of myxoid stroma, Schwann cells, adipocytes, and cystic degeneration. On MRI, they present low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and variable signal on T2-weighted images with high signal intensity of cystic or myxoid areas and low intensity signal of the collagenous and fibrotic tissue that enhance after gadolinium administration.

### Unexpected diagnosis of superficial neurofibroma in a lesion with imaging features of a vascular malformation [^381e96c3]. Pediatric Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Plexiform neurofibroma is a pathognomonic, often disabling feature of neurofibromatosis type I. Although the target-like appearance of deep plexiform neurofibroma on T2-weighted MRI has been well-described, a second superficial form of plexiform neurofibroma has differing imaging features. We report a 15-year-old boy who presented with multiple cutaneous lesions exhibiting clinical and imaging characteristics of a venolymphatic malformation. These lesions were histologically proved to represent superficial plexiform neurofibromas. We wish to emphasize the unique MR findings of superficial plexiform neurofibromas; these findings are different from the imaging characteristics of the deep form and can be confused with a low-flow vascular malformation.

### Pediatric soft-tissue tumors and pseudotumors: MR imaging features with pathologic correlation: part 2. tumors of fibroblastic / myofibroblastic, so-called fibrohistiocytic, muscular, lymphomatous, neurogenic, hair matrix, and uncertain origin [^37efc9b3]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

In the final part of this two-part review article on soft-tissue masses in children, the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features, clinical findings, and pathologic findings in a wide variety of tumors, including those of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic origin, so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors, smooth-muscle tumors, skeletal-muscle tumors, tumors of uncertain differentiation, and lymphoma, are described. Other neoplasms that are not included in the World Health Organization classification of soft-tissue tumors but may be seen clinically as soft-tissue masses, specifically dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, neurogenic tumors and pilomatricoma, are also included. In contrast to the tumors reviewed in Part 1 of this review, the MR imaging features and clinical findings of the tumors included here are largely nonspecific. However, MR imaging is useful in determining site of tumor origin, extent of disease, and relation of tumor to adjacent anatomic structures, and for follow-up after therapy. In some of these entities, the combination of findings may aid in narrowing the differential diagnosis, such as persistent low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images in some fibroblastic lesions, identification of hemosiderin and a synovial origin in pigmented villonodular synovitis, or the presence of multiple target signs on T2-weighted images in deep plexiform neurofibroma. In a large number of cases, however, tissue biopsy is required for final diagnosis.

### Congenital bilateral plexiform neurofibromas of the cavernous sinuses [^a06b0779]. Pediatric Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

We report the CT and MRI findings of congenital bilateral plexiform neurofibromas of the cavernous sinuses in a 2-month-old girl. Contrast-enhanced CT showed enhancement of masses in both cavernous sinuses and enlargement of both superior orbital fissures. On MRI the masses were isointense with muscle on T1-weighted images, hypointense on T2-weighted images and showed strong homogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. A dural tail sign was observed. The diagnosis was proven by biopsy.

### Discrimination of benign, atypical, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis type 1 using diffusion-weighted MRI [^841399c1]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Of note, MPNSTs primarily arise from pre-malignant precursor lesions, so-called atypical neurofibromas (ANFs). ANFs typically present as distinct nodular lesions and are histopathologically considered pre-malignant tumors. Unlike MPNSTs, ANFs do not show recurrence after previous resection nor the ability to metastasize. Therefore, early detection of transformation processes from BPNST to pre-malignant ANF or MPNST is crucial for patient outcome. Especially differentiation of BPNST vs. ANF/MPNST is of clinical relevance as suspicion of ANF/MPNST results in biopsy/resection.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for monitoring plexiform neurofibromas due to its non-invasiveness and excellent soft tissue contrast. Evaluation of MRI-based features has shown promise in detecting malignant transformation. Therefore, MRI evaluation of plexiform neurofibromas includes a screening for "worrisome features" suggestive of malignant transformation, including irregular tumor margins, peritumoral edema, lobulated appearance, or intratumoral heterogeneity (i.e. hemorrhages or cystic changes). However, potential disadvantages of using qualitative imaging features include limited reproducibility among readers and limited diagnostic accuracy.

### Spontaneous hemorrhage simulating rapid growth of a benign subperiosteal plexiform neurofibroma [^12b2cc21]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Spontaneous subperiosteal hemorrhage is a rare complication of von Recklinghausen's disease. There are few reports describing the MR imaging characteristics of this entity. Our case is unique among these as an underlying plexiform neurofibroma was visualized by MR imaging. We present a 12-year-old child with neurofibromatosis 1 who presented with a rapidly enlarging mass of the fibula. Surgery and pathology revealed subperiosteal hemorrhage into a benign, plexiform neurofibroma. The MR imaging features, pathogenesis and clinical implications of this entity are discussed. Recognition of this disease process and differentiating it from malignant transformation can prevent unnecessary surgery.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 — plexiform neurofibromas are believed to be congenital lesions, are present in approximately 50% of people with NF1, but less than 20% will require any intervention during childhood, and are benign tumors that may transform into MPNSTs (usually accompanied by symptoms such as pain, rapid growth, or neurologic dysfunction).

3. Discussion

NF1 is one of the most common human genetic diseases. It has an incidence of 1 in 3000–4000 individuals and affects male and female subjects equally in all races. PNFs are considered pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis. Clinically, the growth patterns of PNFs can be classified into 3 categories: superficial, displacing, and invasive. Superficial PNF arise from subcutaneous or cutaneous nerves and may remain within the upper skin layers. They occur as a result of proliferation of all supporting elements of the nerve fibers, including Schwann cell, perineurial cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and infiltration of mast cells. Invasive lesions infiltrate multiple tissue planes and cannot be resected without functional disturbance. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors sometimes arise from preexisting PNFs. Therefore, rapid growth of a PNF and onset of clinical neurologic deficits should prompt an immediate evaluation for malignant transition. However, clinical alone do not allow differentiation of malignant tumors and benign PNF. Such tumors should be further examined with CT scan and/or open biopsy, and closely monitored clinical and with MRI.

Clinical management for the PNF requires a multidisciplinary approach and the use of a multi-speciality Neurofibromatosis clinic is desirable. However, current treatment options for PNF are limited to surgical intervention, and there is debate in the literature regarding the timing of operation and extent of resection. Some authors suggest that early resection of smaller tumors may minimize the extent of local involvement. Others have countered that complete resection is often impossible and so cannot justify resection in asymptomatic children for whom there is a significant potential for regrowth of the residual tumor. Needle et al have found that age less than 10 years at operation is a prognostic for progression of the lesions. But there is no denying the fact that the resection of a giant benign tumor can be important in minimizing cosmetics deformities. The clinical presentations of PNF in an individual, in addition to the emotional burden of carrying the disease and social stigma, have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. The PNF presented in this report had been slowly growing for 12 years, but the boy kept it hidden from public view for social reason by constantly wearing heavy clothes. The resection of the large tumor can improve patients' condition and provide good quality of life.

### Health supervision for children with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^984b99fa]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Malignancies related to NF1 — Life expectancy is decreased by 8 to 15 years, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) usually arise by malignant transformation of an existing plexiform or nodular neurofibroma with a lifetime risk of 8% to 13% to develop an MPNST. Treatment involves surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; however, 5-year survival remains at less than 20%. The primary care provider should be alert to malignant transformation when a known plexiform neurofibroma develops pain (especially persistent pain or pain that wakes the patient from sleep), rapid growth, or change in consistency (eg, from soft and pliable to firm and hard); patients and families should also be educated in reporting such symptoms for potential referral to a sarcoma specialist. Patients who are symptomatic should undergo MRI of the affected area and consideration of a positron emission tomography with radiographic computed tomography (PET-CT) scan, which has been shown in some larger studies to help in distinguishing benign neurofibromas from MPNSTs.

### Understanding a mass in the paraspinal region: an anatomical approach [^53e534b2]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Peripheral nerve sheath tumours (PNST)

The spine is surrounded by nerves of various origins; consequently, various types of neurogenic tumours can affect the paraspinal region.

Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours are classified into schwannomas and neurofibromas. Around 15% of the PNST are axial, their majority being present in either the brachial or lumbosacral plexus. Neurofibroma are more than twice as common in the trunk than schwannoma. Classically, they present as fusiform masses along a nerve that depicts the 'tail sign'. Paraspinal BPNSTs, arising from the spinal nerve or its roots, may have a typical dumbbell configuration, with intraspinal and paraspinal components that communicate via an intervertebral foramen (Fig. 17). They demonstrate low signal intensity on T1WI and high signal intensity on T2WI, sometimes with a distinctive central hypointense signal surrounded by hyperintense signals on T2WI termed the 'target sign'. A ring of fat, observed over the proximal and distal poles of masses, the 'split-fat sign', is highly suggestive of neural neoplasms. The fascicular sign, seen on T2WI, characterised by multiple small ring-like structures with peripheral hyperintensity (the fascicular bundles) suggests a lesion of neurogenic origin. Older tumours may contain cystic degeneration and calcifications along the walls of masses (Fig. 18). BPNSTs usually demonstrate contrast enhancement. Plexiform neurofibromas are neurofibroma variants that affect nerves in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2) and have a large lobulated or infiltrative appearance.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) are rare (10% of the PNST) but are more common where there is history of spinal irradiation. Radiological features of MPNSTs are non-specific; however, four imaging findings are suggestive of the diagnosis: a large size (> 5 cm), infiltrative margins with perilesional oedema, absence of split-fat sign and heterogeneous signals on T1WI, T2WI and postcontrast images.

### Malignant transformation in a sciatic plexiform neurofibroma in neurofibromatosis type 1-imaging features that aid diagnosis [^f9586eea]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 41-year-old Asian male with NF1 and bilateral sciatic plexiform neurofibromas, presented with unintentional weight loss, increasing size of a left thigh mass associated with increasing pain and radiculopathy. MRI of the left thigh demonstrated imaging features suspicious of malignant transformation. The patient had a new left lung mass, demonstrating avid FDG uptake, raising suspicion for metastasis. Surgical resection of the left thigh mass confirms malignant transformation in a preexisting sciatic plexiform neurofibroma. Diagnosis of malignant transformation in a nerve sheath tumour can be challenging. MRI remains the main preferred imaging modality in the evaluation of these tumours. Imaging features that raise suspicion for malignant transformation are discussed. Although none of these are specific for malignant transformation, studies suggest that the presence of two to four of these features should prompt further investigations.

Plexiform neurofibromas usually occur in the neck, pelvis, and extremities. Jaws and oral cavity plexiform neurofibromas have also been described. Magnetic resonance (MR) patterns for neurofibromas are typical. They include low-to-intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images, enhancement of the solid component of the tumor after contrast medium administration, heterogeneity on T2-weighted images, and in some cases, multiple target signs due to a collagen central area. We report MR findings of two neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients with enlarging tongue plexiform neurofibromas.

### Management of advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal plexiform neurofibroma in adults [^aa350667]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngeal neurofibromas are rare. The plexiform subtype is less common and often presents during childhood in association with neurofibromatosis type I. Because it is unencapsulated and more aggressive, plexiform neurofibroma presents a management dilemma. Imaging, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, can aid in diagnosing neurofibroma, differentiating the nonplexiform and plexiform subtypes, and planning the subsequent operative approach. The importance of conservative surgery to relieve symptoms, but preserve laryngopharyngeal function, and close follow-up are stressed. We report 2 adult cases of plexiform neurofibroma involving the larynx and hypopharynx and discuss the controversies in management.

### Presacral masses: multimodality imaging of a multidisciplinary space [^5f83188b]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

The presacral space is a clinically important space that is relevant to multiple disciplines and lies at the intersection of the axial skeleton, neural axis, and pelvic soft tissues. A wide variety of benign and malignant conditions may derive from its various elements. An appropriate differential diagnosis may be formulated from a more comprehensive list by considering the specific imaging features of a given case: In particular, involvement of the sacrum (either remodeling or destruction) and the presence or absence of a solid, soft-tissue component may help narrow the differential diagnosis. Typically, osteochondral and neurogenic tumors remodel or destroy the sacrum, whereas sacral involvement is less common in patients with a mesenchymal tumor. Ewing sarcomas and chordomas are typically associated with a large soft-tissue mass. Demographic features are also important: Typically, congenital and developmental tumors occur in younger patients, and chondrosarcomas occur in older patients (mean age, 45 years). Finally, specific imaging features may help establish the diagnosis. For instance, an osseous or chondroid matrix is indicative of osteosarcoma or chondrosarcomas; neurofibromas may have a target appearance at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging; hemangiomas have areas of increased signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images, a result of fat and hemorrhage; and myeloplipomas contain macroscopic fat.

### Radiological diagnosis of perinephric pathology: pictorial essay 2015 [^1aaa0ed7]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Neurofibroma

Neurofibroma is a benign nerve sheath tumour more often seen as an isolated entity (90%) rather than in conjunction with associated genetic conditions such as neurofibromatosis. They consist of Schwann cells, fibroblasts and rich networks of collagen fibres. More common in men, its incidence occurs in young to middle-aged men, 20 to 40 years of age. On CT imaging, neurofibroma are homogenous (Fig. 20), smooth and round with distinct outlines. Imaging characteristics are secondary to their lipid rich architecture and collagen deposits. MRI shows hypointense T1-weighted imaging consistent with neural tissue. In addition, high peripheral signalling on T2-weighted images with low central signalling can be seen due to myxoid degeneration peripherally and nerve tissue centrally. When multiple neurofibroma are present, neurofibromatosis should be considered. Unlike schwannoma, neurofibroma are inseparable from the normal nerve, and surgical excision must include the adjacent nerve.

### MRI growth patterns of plexiform neurofibromas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^9166d155]. Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1:3000. Approximately 30% of NF1 patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) which often cause severe clinical deficits. We studied the growth patterns of 256 plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and associated disfigurement and functional deficits to determine whether there are definable growth types of these tumors. Retrospectively, we evaluated MRI scans obtained during 1997 to 2003 of 256 plexiform neurofibromas from 202 patients with NF1. Clinical investigation was carried out at the same time as the MRI scans. We identified three growth patterns: superficial in 59, displacing in 76, and invasive growth in 121 tumors. The majority (52%) of invasive PNF were found in the face, head and neck area. While superficial PNF primarily caused aesthetic problems, displacing PNF led in most cases to aesthetic problems and pain, while invasive PNF led mainly to functional deficits and disfigurement. Our study demonstrates that PNF have different growth patterns that are associated with specific clinical features. Classification of PNF may open new opportunities in clinical management, especially regarding decisions and options associated with surgical intervention.

### Health supervision for children with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^4fb8a551]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Imaging considerations — use of imaging in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) care notes that diagnostic imaging is often used for applications such as tumor surveillance and that it has been standard practice to use clinical assessment to determine if, when, and where to image. MRI is the most common modality for imaging of plexiform neurofibromas and brain lesions such as OPGs and low-grade gliomas, and in addition to MRI, PET-CT may be indicated in the assessment of possible malignant transformation of a neurofibroma. The value of imaging to assess the extent of a plexiform neurofibroma in the absence of evidence of progression is debatable because treatment decisions are typically based on clinical, and not radiographic, progression, so decisions about whether, when, and where to image are judgments best left to providers experienced in caring for children with NF1.

### Anatomy and pathology of the masticator space [^3fed4148]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Neurogenic tumours

Nerve sheath tumours are common benign tumours of the masticator space, where they arise from the mandibular nerve or its branches. Schwannoma is the most common neurogenic tumour and usually occurs along the proximal portion of the mandibular nerve, close to the foramen ovale. It appears as an oval or fusiform mass with well-defined smooth contours. On unenhanced CT the lesion has soft-tissue density while on MRI it is isointense or slightly hypointense on T1WI and hyperintense on T2WI. Enhancement is usually homogeneous, although larger tumours may show heterogeneous attenuation or heterogeneous signal intensity due to cystic degeneration or haemorrhage. Atrophy and fatty infiltration of the mastication muscles are commonly seen in cases of chronic denervation (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
A 28-year-old man with a schwannoma of the mandibular nerve. a Precontrast and (b) postcontrast coronal T1-weighted images show a small, fusiform, homogeneously enhancing mass (arrow) at the level of the foramen ovale compatible with a schwannoma of the mandibular nerve. Also note the atrophy and fatty infiltration of the mastication muscles (black dots) due to chronic atrophy

Neurofibromas may appear as solitary or multiple lesions. When multiple, they are usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Neurofibromas in NF1 may be localised or plexiform. Localised neurofibromas may demonstrate the characteristic "target sign" on T2WI with a central area of low signal intensity surrounded by a hyperintense rim. Plexiform neurofibromas are diagnostic of NF1 and appear as a diffuse tortuous expansion along the branches of the parent nerve (Fig. 6).

The largest one is superficial to the mandibular ramus and has a heterogeneous appearance (black dot). b Coronal fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced T1WI shows tortuous expansion of small nerves in the masticator space (white arrow in b), compatible with plexiform neurofibromas

### Neoplastic pathology at the crossroads between neck imaging and cardiothoracic imaging [^e6a123df]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Neurofibromas

Neurofibroma is another benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor which has a strong association with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). This tumor is composed of an unencapsulated proliferation of all nerve elements, and the tumor is intermixed and inseparable from the affected nerve. This tumor can be subdivided into three types: localized, diffuse cutaneous, and plexiform, each with a unique imaging appearance. The modality of choice to evaluate these lesions is MRI, in which the lesion will appear hypointense on T1WI and intermediate to high intensity on T2WI. The target sign may be present, in which the lesion will demonstrate a low central signal from collagen deposition with a hyperintense rim when viewed in the short axis plane. Post contrast, the T2 hypointense region centrally will show some enhancement, and the periphery will remain unenhanced (Fig. 10).

Fig. 10
Neurofibroma. T2WI MR sagittal (a) and axial (b) images of the chest showing multiple round lesions with peripheral hyperintensity and central hypointensity, giving the classic appearance of the target sign (arrows). c Coronal T1WI MR post contrast demonstrates mild central enhancement with a non-enhancing periphery (arrows)

Neurofibromas can undergo malignant degeneration and when this occurs, it is classified as a malignant peripheral neural sheath tumor (MPNST). These tumors typically occur in the deep soft tissues, and the most common sites are the sciatic nerve, brachial plexus, and sacral plexus. These neoplasms account for 5–10% of the soft tissue sarcomas, most common in patients aged 20–50 years. Patients may present with neurologic deficit secondary to impingement of the associated nerves. On MRI, MPNST will appear as an invasive mass that is iso or hyperintense on T1WI and hyperintense on T2WI. Heterogeneity can be present secondary to internal necrosis, hemorrhage, and cellularity. The classic target sign of neurofibromas is absent (Fig. 11 a). On CT surveillance imaging, MPNST should be suspected if there is a change in size of a neurofibroma or heterogeneous attenuation is identified. PET imaging will demonstrate heterogeneous hypermetabolism secondary to the presence of necrosis and hemorrhage (Fig. 11 b).

### Expanding the clinical phenotype of individuals with a 3-bp in-frame deletion of the NF1 gene (C.2970_2972del): an update of genotype-phenotype correlation [^17edfbc2]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas are benign tumors located on or just under the skin, typically developing around puberty, and almost all NF1-affected adults have at least several of them. Over the course of time, the number of neurofibromas usually increases, varying from hundreds to thousands. Plexiform neurofibromas may be recognized earlier as they may occur congenitally, but most of them grow slowly, with externally visible plexiform neurofibromas becoming apparent in the early years of life. Plexiform neurofibromas arise in peripheral nerves and are clinically suspected in 15–30% of the NF1-affected general population, but the prevalence of the internal tumors is higher. Moreover, plexiform and subcutaneous neurofibromas are associated with an increased lifetime risk for the development of MPNSTs, resulting in significant morbidity for these individuals. – From a clinical point of view, it is important to identify early those individuals with an increased risk to develop malignancies so as to provide them personalized management and genetic counseling.

In the current study, we confirmed the paucity of superficial plexiform (0/84 ≥ 9 years) and cutaneous neurofibromas (0/38 ≥ 19 years), in line with the original report. None of the individuals had externally visible plexiform neurofibromas or histopathologically confirmed cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas (all P < 0.0001, statistically significant at FDR of 0.01 after B–H correction when compared with the cohort of individuals with the NF1 missense pathogenic variants affecting codons 844–848 and the "classic" NF1-affected population, Table 2). Combining data from this and previous studies, for plexiform (0/127 ≥ 9 years), cutaneous, and subcutaneous neurofibromas (0/59 and 0/37 ≥ 19 years, respectively), we estimate in post hoc power calculation that these sample sizes would allow to detect the presence of plexiform, cutaneous, and subcutaneous neurofibromas with a prevalence of at least 3%, 7%, and 10%, respectively with a power of 95%. However, we cannot speculate about the risk for internal neurofibromas in this cohort as MRI screening was not routinely done in most of the asymptomatic individuals.

### Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomics characteristics for differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^6e6bf5fb]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

In this study, we exclusively evaluated texture parameters. In contrast to morphological features such as size and shape, a texture-based approach might allow better generalizability due to less susceptibility to data acquisition-related constraints. For example, during MRI data acquisition large plexiform neurofibromas, which can often be delineated along the entire plexus, are not completely captured within one stack in a cranial or caudal direction. Artifact-free fusion of these stacks is also not always possible.

Analysis of tumor volumes extracted from segmentation revealed that malignant tumors were significantly larger than benign tumors (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < .001; Table 1). This observation is in line with previous work. For example, Martin et al.reported a pooled accuracy of 0.71 sensitivity and 0.85 specificity in their meta-analysis with respect to the tumor size criterion which was derived from investigations from Ahlawat et al. Karsy et al. and Matsumoto et al. To investigate how well tumor size can discriminate between benign and malignant nerve sheath tumors a similar methodological setup was used to train a logistic regression model to differentiate between MPNST and BPNST based on only the tumor size. The corresponding ROC AUC was 0.69 (sensitivity: 65%, specificity: 92%), hence lower compared to the texture-based radiomics signature. Premalignant tumors were also significantly larger than benign tumors (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < .001; Table 1). The AUC for differentiation between ANF and BPNST based on only the tumor size was 0.75 (sensitivity: 88%, specificity: 66%) and for differentiation of lesions in need for further classification (ANF, BPNST) and benign tumors 0.72 (sensitivity: 64%, specificity: 88%). Again, the values are lower compared to radiomics signature-based differentiation. Size differences between premalignant and malignant tumors were not significant in our population (P = 0.26).

### ERN GENTURIS tumour surveillance guidelines for individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^36cbc191]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Plexiform neurofibromas are benign, diffuse or nodular growing tumours of the nerve sheath arising in approximately 40–60% of patients with NF1, depending on the use of WB-MRI to identify clinically undetectable plexiform neurofibromas (Table 7), Plexiform neurofibromas involving the eyelid, orbit, and periorbital structures have been labelled orbital and periorbital plexiform neurofibromas and have an incidence of less than 10% in children with NF1. Orbital and periorbital plexiform neurofibromas frequently cause vision loss secondary to deprivational or anisometropic amblyopia as well as glaucoma (Table 8). Orbital and periorbital plexiform neurofibromas usually cause aesthetic disfigurement and functional impairment.

At transition from childhood to adulthood, brain and WB-MRI is recommended to screen for possible brain tumours and to evaluate the internal plexiform neurofibroma tumour burden respectively (Table 1, Table 5, Table 7). Surgery should be considered for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas, and increased monitoring is recommended. For symptomatic, inoperable symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1 MEK inhibitors may be considered. Plexiform neurofibromas are associated with an increased risk for malignant transformation to MPNSTs, and an intermediate (premalignant) stage between plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs exists, called ANNUBP. Almost half of the ANNUBPs are palpable lesions and about 80% cause clinical symptoms (Table 9). In case of a suspected ANNUBP or MPNST, primary resection is recommended if safe and feasible. Otherwise, radiologically (preferably 18 FDG PET MRI) guided diagnostic biopsy should be performed. This biopsy should be taken at the discretion of a (sarcoma) multidisciplinary team, as tumours can be heterogeneous, with the potential for a false negative result by missing malignant parts of the tumour (Table 9). Early detection and resection of these premalignant lesions seems to prevent further malignant transformation as subtotal resection of ANNUBPs did not result in recurrence (Table 9).

### Extraaxial neurofibromas versus neurilemmomas: discrimination with MRI [^1861ddd5]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether MRI can discriminate between extraaxial neurofibromas and neurilemmomas.

Materials and Methods

MR images of 52 patients with a pathologically proven extraaxial neurofibroma or neurilemmoma were retrospectively reviewed by observers who were unaware of the surgical results, regarding the presence or absence of individual imaging criteria. MRI findings in 12 patients with a localized neurofibroma and 40 patients with a neurilemmoma were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.

Results

MRI findings suggestive of neurofibroma (p < 0.05) were a target sign on T2-weighted images (58% in neurofibromas vs 15% in neurilemmomas), central enhancement (75% vs 8%), and a combination of both findings (63% vs 3%). MRI findings suggestive of a neurilemmoma (p < 0.05) were a fascicular appearance on T2-weighted images (25% vs 63%), a thin hyperintense rim on T2-weighted images (8% vs 58%), a combination of both findings (8% vs 48%), and diffuse enhancement (13% vs 67%). No significant difference was seen between neurofibromas and neurilemmomas for a centrally entering and exiting nerve (42% in neurofibromas vs 23% in neurilemmomas), a peripherally entering and exiting nerve (58% vs 77%), a cystic area (38% vs 64%), a low-signal margin (100% vs 100%), peripheral enhancement (13% vs 26%), or a target sign on contrast-enhanced images (11% vs 31%).

Conclusion

MRI shows features helpful for differentiating extraaxial neurofibromas from neurilemmomas; however, no single finding or combination of findings allows definitive differentiation.

### Imaging of thoracic hernias: types and complications [^c4dd8d6d]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Spinal hernia: thoracic meningocele

The contents of the spinal canal can herniate into the chest wall, pleura or posterior mediastinum, forming an intrathoracic meningocele. Congenital meningocele is seen in patients with neurofibromatosis, while acquired meningocele occurs after laminectomy or associated with musculoskeletal deformities. These are often asymptomatic. CXR can identify a soft tissue lesion in the posterior mediastinum. On CT and MRI, the herniation of meninges and CSF through an intervertebral foramen with cyst formation can be identified. MRI is superior to CT in identification of the neural placode, which is present in myelomeningoceles but not in meningoceles (Fig. 10).

### Current state of spinal nerve sheath tumor management and future advances [^2d43be47]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Neurofibromas

Neurofibromas may be spontaneous, solitary lesions, or multiple and associated with NF-1. They can be categorized into cutaneous neurofibromas, peripheral nerve fibromas, and plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas involve multiple nerve fascicles and are pathognomonic for NF-1, occurring in 40%–60% of NF-1 patients. Most importantly, these tumors, while benign, have the potential to transform into MPNSTs. Within the spine, neurofibromas have a predilection for the cervical region and tend to be intraforaminal with extension into the extradural space.MRI studies of NF-1 patients have revealed that while many have spinal tumors, about one-third of patients are asymptomatic. In one series of 66 surgical cases, most patients presented with radicular pain (84%), 25% complained of sphincter dysfunction, and 30% had motor symptoms. As with plexiform neurofibromas that develop elsewhere, the development of pain, new neurological symptoms, or growth in the setting of a known spinal plexiform neurofibroma may be an indication of malignant transformation into an MPNST.

### Neurofibromas with imaging characteristics resembling vascular anomalies [^54acd389]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Although neurofibromas are rare, their initial clinical and imaging presentation can mimic those of vascular anomalies, particularly if the characteristic clinical features of neurofibromatosis are not present. The diagnostic challenges encountered in five cases of histologically proven neurofibromas, initially diagnosed as vascular anomalies, are reviewed and discussed.

Conclusion

The clinical and imaging differences between neurofibromas and vascular anomalies are detailed with the histopathologic features to better understand why some neurofibromas are diagnosed as vascular anomalies.

Imaging and Pathology

PNs on MRI are isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, demonstrate a target sign on fluid sensitive sequences, and demonstrate variable enhancement, but typically demonstrate no early arterial enhancement. A target sign is seen as a high signal intensity periphery due to myxoid paucicellular and central intermediate-to-dark signal intensity due to cellular areas.

MRI findings can be useful at identifying higher risk radiologic features ominous for MPNST including tumor depth below the fascia (highly sensitive, but not specific), presence of necrosis more than 25%, and tumor size (> 5 cm). Ill-defined or infiltrative margins, perilesional edema, absent target sign, and early arterial enhancement have also been reported for MPNST. Utilization of MRI diffuse-weighted sequences has demonstrated significantly lower diffusivity in MPNST compared to benign PN (likely correlating to higher cellularity in cases of malignancy on pathology). In the same study, the authors looked at morphological criteria and reported that peritumoral edema was the most common feature seen in MPNST.

### Neurofibromatosis type 1-associated MPNST state of the science: outlining a research agenda for the future [^62c679b2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Heightened surveillance is required when risk factors for MPNST are present. These include whole NF1 gene deletion, family history of MPNST, prior radiation therapy, large plexiform neurofibroma burden or multiple distinct nodular lesions on magnetic resonance imagining (MRI), neurofibromatous neuropathy, and atypical neurofibroma(s). Painful, firm, and rapidly-growing masses require investigation for potential malignancy. MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging have a role in the diagnosis of malignant transformation. Standardization of imaging protocols is needed to define the diagnostic utility of both approaches and to permit meaningful comparisons across institutions. Whole-body MRI (WBMRI) is potentially useful to detect MPNST and for surveillance after therapeutic intervention, but WBMRI protocols are needed that are cost-efficient and covered by insurance carriers (imaging studies are billed based on number of body parts imaged in many institutions).

It was concluded that a diagnostic biopsy is required for masses concerning for high-grade MPNST to facilitate optimal surgical planning. Ideally these biopsies should be performed or directed by the team performing the surgery. Conversely, a mass likely to be a low-grade/atypical neurofibroma may not require biopsy prior to resection because this would not affect surgical management.

### Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours in neurofibromatosis type 1: MRI supports the diagnosis of malignant plexiform neurofibroma [^c1503122]. Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) is a typical feature of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). About 10% of patients with NF1 develop malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumours (MPNST), usually arising from PNF, and this is the major cause of poor survival. A better prognosis can be achieved if the tumours are diagnosed at an early stage. Our objective was to establish MRI criteria for MPNST and to test their usefulness in detecting early malignant change in PNF. MRI was performed on 50 patients with NF1 and nerve-sheath tumours, of whom seven had atypical pain, tumour growth or neurological deficits indicative of malignancy; the other 43 were asymptomatic. On MRI all seven symptomatic patients had inhomogeneous lesions, due to necrosis and haemorrhage and patchy contrast enhancement. In one patient, the multiplicity of confluent tumours with inhomogeneous areas in addition to central lesions did not allow exclusion of malignancy. Only three of the 43 asymptomatic patients had comparable changes; the other 40 patients had tumours being of relatively homogeneous structure on T1- and T2-weighted images before and after contrast enhancement. All three asymptomatic patients with inhomogeneous lesions were shown to have MPNST.

Role of Screening and Surveillance for Intra-abdominal Neoplasms in NF1 Patients

NF1 is associated with reduced life expectancy, reported to be between 8 and 15 years below that of the general population. Premature death is primarily attributed to the development of malignant neoplasms, particularly MPNSTs. In a study of US death certificates, people with NF1 were 34 times more likely to have a malignant connective or other soft tissue neoplasm listed on their death certificate compared to those without the condition.

Vigilant longitudinal care of NF1 patients is important for the early detection and management of associated intra-abdominal neoplasms. Annual clinical examination by clinicians familiar with the wide spectrum of NF1-associated disease, and ideally in the multidisciplinary setting of highly specialized centers, remains the recommended approach for early detection of both NF1 complications and neoplastic transformation. Physicians not familiar with NF1 may not associate intra-abdominal neoplasms with the syndrome, as they are less common and not part of the diagnostic criteria. Whole-body or site-specific screening for neoplasm in NF1 is not currently recommended by guideline groups, except by some in the setting of optic pathway glioma in the pediatric population. In asymptomatic patients, many centers monitor PN with targeted MRI. Symptomatic patients should have directed imaging with MRI and/or PET/CT. Routine screening with whole-body MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging can also be performed for patients who are deemed high risk (ie, NF1 gene microdeletion, family or personal history of atypical neurofibroma or MPNST, prior radiation therapy, or high internal PN burden). In a case series of 152 patients with NF1 followed between 1988 and 1992, ad hoc (physician discretion) screening for intra-abdominal manifestations, using abdominal ultrasound and urinary catecholamine levels, did not offer any benefit in terms of earlier diagnosis compared to annual clinical examination, with investigations offered only for concerning history and physical exam findings. However, imaging modalities have improved substantially since then, and this question needs to be reevaluated in the modern era of CT, MRI, and/or PET. An analogous hereditary syndrome with a high propensity to develop multiple cancer types that has been definitively shown to benefit from a screening approach is Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Here, long-term compliance with a comprehensive surveillance protocol (which included biochemical tumor markers, whole-body MRI, brain MRI, breast MRI mammography, abdominopelvic ultrasound, and colonoscopy) for early tumor detection was associated with improved long-term survival. Based on the frequency of neoplasms in the NF1 population, similar screening approaches may reduce the premature cancer-related mortality associated with the condition; however, this approach is not yet proven.

### Current state of spinal nerve sheath tumor management and future advances [^d3a43a5b]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Plexiform neurofibromas, which are exclusive to NF-1 patients, are associated with malignancy risk. European consensus guidelines for management of NF-1 patients have recommended a whole-body MRI during adolescence to assess for tumor burden and risk of MPNST development. Frequency of repeat imaging should be tailored to the individual's risk and managed by a multidisciplinary team. In patients with an existing plexiform neurofibroma, new rapid growth, development of new neurological symptoms, worsening pain, or change in consistency of the lesion raises the possibility of transformation, and the tumor should be further investigated. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment and is strongly considered for symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas. Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor that has demonstrated partial efficacy in symptomatic inoperable pediatric plexiform neurofibromas, was recently approved as the only systemic therapy for plexiform neurofibromas.

Radiotherapy for benign spinal nerve sheath tumors is less established than that for intracranial lesions. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) regimens remain physician- and institution-specific, with no specific guidelines. Indications and considerations described include residual or recurrent tumors after surgery, patient comorbidities, patient age, patient/clinician preference, and anatomic relationship to the spinal cord.SBRT has been reported in retrospective series to be effective for pain relief (42%–73%) and tumor control in post-surgical residual tumors, recurrent tumors, and as an alternative to surgery in select patients. It is also viable strategy for multiple spinal nerve sheath tumors in the setting of neurofibromatosis or Schwannomatosis. Tumor regression in 2 of the largest series of SBRT on schwannomas (n = 47, n = 47) occurred in about half of lesions (47%–55%) with a local control maintained in 91%–95% over median follow-up periods of 43 and 29 months, respectively. The effectiveness of SBRT on neurofibromas appears to be lower, with 20%–33% of patients experiencing worsening symptoms or radiographic progression despite treatment. The ideal dose is currently uncertain, and this has been previously reviewed. Longer-term studies, especially those assessing SBRT on neurofibroma and patients with neurofibromatosis, need to be conducted to understand characteristics associated with radiation response and to develop clearer patient selection criteria and treatment regimens.

### Therapy for plexiform neurofibromas in children with neurofibromatosis 1: an overview [^81436cd4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Plexiform neurofibromas are one of the most common and disabling features of neurofibromatosis 1. Treatment options for patients with plexiform neurofibromas have been limited, with surgery being the primary option for patients with progressive lesions causing significant morbidity. Trials have evaluated other treatment approaches, including the use of antihistamines, maturation agents, and antiangiogenic agents. The design of such trials and entry criteria have been quite variable, and results have been difficult to interpret. As more is understood concerning the molecular genetic underpinnings of plexiform neurofibromas, new avenues of treatment are being explored. Evaluation of clinical trials is challenging because of the unpredictable nature of plexiform neurofibromas and difficulties in measuring objective responses. The use of innovative neuroimaging techniques and other outcome measures may greatly improve the design of trials and evaluation of potential effective agents.

### Association of plexiform neurofibroma volume changes and development of clinical morbidities in neurofibromatosis 1 [^cc9045e7]. Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) can cause substantial morbidities. Clinical trials targeting PN have recently described decreases in PN volumes. However, no previous study has assessed the association between changes in PN volumes and PN-related morbidities. Our objective was to assess if increasing PN volume in NF1 is associated with increasing PN-related morbidity.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of patients enrolled on the NCI NF1 natural history study with ≥ 7 years of data available. Morbidities including pain, motor dysfunction, vision loss, and PN-related surgery were assessed at time of baseline PN MRI with volumetric analysis and time of MRI with maximum PN volume.

Results

Forty-one patients (median age at baseline 8 y) with 57 PN were included. At baseline, 40 PN had at least 1 PN-associated morbidity. During the observation period, 27 PN required increasing pain medication, and these PN grew faster per year (median difference 8.3%; 95% CI: 2.4, 13.8%) than those PN which did not. PN resulting in motor impairment at baseline (n = 11) had larger volumes compared with those that did not (median difference 461 mL; 95% CI: 66.9, 820).

Conclusions

Many NF1 PN were associated with clinically significant morbidity at baseline, highlighting the need for longitudinal morbidity evaluations starting at an early age to capture changes in PN-associated morbidities. Prospective evaluation of standardized patient reported and functional outcomes in clinical trials are ongoing and may allow further characterization of the association of PN volume increase or decrease and clinical changes.

### NF1 plexiform neurofibroma growth rate by volumetric MRI: relationship to age and body weight [^1df83807]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To longitudinally analyze changes in plexiform neurofibroma (PN) volume in relation to age and body growth in children and young adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable, symptomatic, or progressive PNs, using a sensitive, automated method of volumetric MRI analysis.

Methods

We included patients 25 years of age and younger with PNs entered in a natural history study or in treatment trials who had volumetric MRI over ≥ 16 months.

Results

We studied 49 patients (median age 8.3 years) with 61 PNs and a median evaluation period of 34 months (range 18 to 70). The PN growth rates varied among patients, but were constant within patients. Thirty-four patients (69%) experienced ≥ 20% increase in PN volume during the observation period. PN volume increased more rapidly than body weight over time (p = 0.026). Younger patients had the most rapid PN growth rate.

Conclusions

Volume increase of plexiform neurofibromas is a realistic and meaningful trial endpoint. In most patients plexiform neurofibroma growth rate exceeded body growth rate. The youngest patients had the fastest plexiform neurofibroma growth rate, and clinical drug development should be directed toward this population. Age stratification for clinical trials for plexiform neurofibromas should be considered.

### Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomics characteristics for differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^66c5fb50]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Radiomics allows for sensitive and specific differentiation between BPNSTs and MPNSTs.
ANFs show intermediate radiomic feature characteristics between BPNSTs and MPNSTs.

Importance of the Study

Malignant transformation of peripheral nerve sheath tumors represents a major life-limiting factor for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Therefore, early detection of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and their premalignant precursor, atypical neurofibromas, is of great importance. The exclusive use of morphologic tumor characteristics determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has limited diagnostic accuracy. We, therefore, assessed the value of radiomics for automatic classification of benign, atypical, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients. In summary, MRI-based radiomics allows sensitive and specific distinction of benign versus malignant, and of benign versus (pre-)malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients. Hence, MRI-based radiomics machine learning classification represents a promising noninvasive diagnostic radiological imaging tool to be investigated in a larger study population in the near future.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited neurogenetic disorder caused by a mutation of the cell growth regulating protein neurofibromin in the NF1 gene at 17q11.2. With an incidence of about 1:2500–1:3000 NF1 is considered one of the most common hereditary neurocutaneous diseases.

Typically, patients have a predisposition to develop benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (BPNSTs) of the skin (= cutaneous neurofibromas), the subcutis, and the deeper soft tissue (= plexiform neurofibromas). The latter are composed of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, perineurial cells, and a rich network of collagen fibers. Based on their morphological appearance, different subtypes of internal BPNSTs have been described, namely discrete (involving only one nerve fascicle) and plexiform (involving multiple nerve fascicles) neurofibromas. Due to their increased risk of malignant transformation, plexiform neurofibromas are of particular clinical relevance. Malignant tumors develop in about 8%–16% of NF1 patients during lifetime. Since malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) tend to metastasize early and are often resistant to chemotherapy, their occurrence serves as the most important life-limiting factor in NF1 patients. Therefore, early detection and resection is of high relevance.

### The tip of the iceberg: lipomatous tumours presenting as abdominal or pelvic wall hernias [^72a0ad0e]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of gadolinium contrast when performing an MR for the characterisation of a soft tissue tumour and in our case more specifically a lipomatous tumour, ESSR guidelines specify that static postcontrast sequences should be performed in two planes. Subtraction images and dynamic contrast enhancement may be added to this protocol but are not mandatory.

Comparing the T1 fat suppressed sequences performed pre- and post-intravenous gadolinium, enhancement of nodular, dedifferentiated components or septations within a lipomatous tumour can be assessed; however, the exact additional value of contrast in comparison to a non-enhanced fat-suppressed sequence remains unclear. A practical approach could be to schedule patients with lipomatous tumours as supervised MRIs. As soon as the fat-suppressed sequences have been obtained, the radiologist assesses the lesion and in case of a homogeneous fatty lesion (in comparison with the subcutaneous fat) with only thin internal septations, no contrast is needed. If however there is oedema in the lesion, or nodularity or thicker septations are seen, the protocol can be extended with post contrast series.

### Right-sided intrathoracic renal ectopia with bochdalek's hernia [^13c05851]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old woman was evaluated for right flank pain of one year duration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 6 cm defect in the right hemidiaphragm with herniation of the right kidney, adrenal gland, and posterior right hepatic lobe consistent with a congenital right Bochdalek hernia. Computed tomography (CT) urogram confirmed lack of masses, hydronephrosis, and renal calculi and defined vascular and ureteral anatomy through the diaphragmatic hernia. Intrathoracic kidney is rare and is usually discovered incidentally. In the absence of other renal pathology it requires no surgical intervention.

### Fat-containing lesions of the chest [^cf282cd0]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Although most lesions that occur in the chest have a nonspecific soft-tissue appearance, fat-containing lesions are occasionally encountered at cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. The various fat-containing lesions of the chest include parenchymal and endobronchial lesions such as hamartoma, lipoid pneumonia, and lipoma. Endobronchial hamartoma usually appears at CT as a lesion with a smooth edge, focal collections of fat, or fat collections that alternate with foci of calcification. Mediastinal fat-containing lesions include germ cell neoplasms, thymolipomas, lipomas, and liposarcomas. The most frequent CT manifestation of the germ cell neoplasm teratoma is a heterogeneous mass with soft-tissue, fluid, fat, and calcium attenuation. Cardiac lesions with fat content include lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Diagnosis of the former is made with CT when a smooth, nonenhancing, well-marginated fat-containing lesion is identified in the interatrial septum. Finally, fat may herniate into the chest at several characteristic locations. When such a lesion is identified, the time required for differential diagnosis is significantly reduced, often allowing a definitive radiologic diagnosis. Sagittal and coronal reformatted images can add valuable information by showing diaphragmatic defects and hernia contents.

### Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomics characteristics for differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^a92e3efe]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The presented results do not allow to draw conclusions on whether the performance of ML allows a more reliable diagnosis than that of a radiologist. In the future, prospective studies must therefore evaluate the clinical value of radiomics and investigate if it significantly improves radiological diagnosis.

### Imaging of abdominal wall masses, masslike lesions, and diffuse processes [^f3deddff]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal wall masses, masslike lesions, and diffuse processes are common and often incidental findings at cross-sectional imaging. Distinguishing among these types of masses on the basis of imaging features alone can be challenging. The authors present a diagnostic algorithm that may help in distinguishing different types of abdominal wall masses accurately. Hernias may mimic discrete masses at clinical examination, and imaging is often ordered for evaluation of a possible abdominal wall mass. Once a discrete mass is confirmed to be present, the next step is to determine if it is a fat-containing, cystic, or solid mass. The most common fat-containing masses are lipomas. Fluid or cystic masses include postoperative abscesses, seromas, and rectus sheath hematomas. Solid masses are the most common abdominal wall masses and include desmoid tumors, sarcomas, endometriomas, and metastases. Multiple masses and other diffuse abdominal wall processes are often manifestations of an underlying condition or insult. The most frequently found diffuse processes are multiple injection granulomas from administration of subcutaneous medication. This article offers an algorithmic approach to characterizing abdominal wall masses on the basis of their composition and reviews abdominal wall diffuse processes.

### Discrimination of benign, atypical, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis type 1 using diffusion-weighted MRI [^3be3a4a4]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Malignant transformation of nerve sheath tumors is an important cause of death in NF1.
Diffusion-weighted MRI using the ADC separates benign from atypical and malignant tumors.
The ADC is a noninvasive marker for malignant transformation of nerve sheath tumors.

Importance of the Study

Atypical neurofibromas (ANFs) are considered pre-malignant precursor lesions to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Unlike MPNSTs, ANFs do not show local recurrence after previous resection nor the ability to metastasize. MPNSTs have a dismal prognosis due to their high resistance to chemotherapy and tendency to metastasize at an early stage. Therefore, specific, and ideally noninvasive techniques are needed for early detection of such a transformation process. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is a user-independent noninvasive functional imaging technique. DW-MRI has shown promise in discriminating benign from malignant nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients. We therefore evaluated the utility of DW-MRI for the discrimination of benign, atypical, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. In summary, the use of diffusion-weighted MRI allows to specifically discriminate benign from atypical and malignant nerve sheath tumors, both of which require further diagnostic workup such as FDG-PET/CT or biopsy.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited disorder caused by a mutation of the cell growth regulating protein neurofibromin in the NF1 gene at 17q11.2.NF1 is one of the most common hereditary neurocutaneous diseases with an estimated incidence of 1:2500–1:3000.

Development of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (BPNSTs) is a typical feature of NF1. BPNSTs can either appear as discrete nodules along the peripheral nerves or grow to large sizes across multiple nerve fascicles presenting as bulging and deforming plexiform neurofibromas typically located in the deep soft tissues. Plexiform neurofibromas affect about 30–60% of NF1 patients and can cause pain and neurological dysfunction. Plexiform neurofibromas are of particular clinical significance due to their inherent risk of malignant transformation. Transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) is observed in 8–16% of NF1 patients and is a major cause of mortality. Since MPNST are highly resistant to chemotherapy and metastasize at an early stage, early detection and resection are of critical importance for treatment success.

### Multidetector CT and MRI findings in periportal space pathologies [^6c71ecf4]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Periportal region is an anatomic space around portal vein comprising hepatic artery, bile duct, nerves, lymphatics and a potential space. Periportal pathologies may involve any of these structures diffusely or focally with characteristic radiologic findings. Radiologic findings can be helpful in differential diagnosis of pathologies of periportal structures including periportal cavernomatous transformation, hepatic artery aneurysm, biliary diseases, neurofibromatosis, lymphoma, langerhans' cell histiocytosis, periportal fatty infiltration and other causes of periportal halo in adult and pediatric patients. Lobar/segmental intrahepatic involvement can be seen in neurofibromatosis, cavernomatous transformation, fatty infiltration and periportal edema. In this review, we discuss CT and MRI findings of periportal pathologies which can be in the form of diffuse or segmental/lobar involvement.

### Genotype-phenotype correlation in NF1: evidence for a more severe phenotype associated with missense mutations affecting NF1 codons 844–848 [^34a74124]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

45% of the individuals ≥ 9 years had known plexiform neurofibromas (41/92 ≥ 9 years; 47/143 all ages), including externally visible (n = 36) and internal (n = 5) tumors. For six case subjects, the information was not provided whether plexiform neurofibromas were identified clinically or by MRI. Among all individuals with plexiform neurofibromas, 31/47 presented with one plexiform tumor and 16/47 with ≥ 2 plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform tumors were found in the head, face, and neck area (35.7%, 25/70), limbs (34.3%, 24/70), trunk (17.1%, 12/70), back (n = 3), abdomen (n = 3), pelvis (n = 2), and chest (n = 1).

Symptomatic spinal neurofibromas visible by MRI were found in 15.2% of individuals (12/79 ≥ 9 years; 13/127 all ages). Forty asymptomatic individuals received MRI screening, leading to the identification of another seven case subjects with spinal tumors (Table S6). Approximately one-third of the individuals with spinal tumors (6/20) had fewer than 6 CALMs and no skinfold freckling, whereas in 60% (12/20) plexiform neurofibromas were observed (with 11/12 being externally visible).

Symptomatic OPGs, confirmed by MRI imaging, were found in 11/104 of individuals older than 5 years (10.6%), whereas asymptomatic OPGs were present in 16/52 additional individuals who underwent MRI examination (30.8% ≥ 5 years). In 19 of 27 symptomatic and asymptomatic OPGs, the detailed information about the tumor's location was collected, involving optic nerves (2 symptomatic OPGs and 7 asymptomatic OPGs), chiasm (1 symptomatic OPG and 1 asymptomatic OPG), or both locations (6 symptomatic OPGs and 2 asymptomatic OPGs). Three children were diagnosed with a symptomatic OPG (PAD-R300) or asymptomatic OPGs (UAB-R3714 and UAB-R3513) before age 4 years (Table S7).

### Assessment of benign tumor burden by whole-body MRI in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 [^caafc520]. Neuro-Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

People with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) have multiple benign neurofibromas and a 10% lifetime risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Most MPNSTs develop from benign plexiform neurofibromas, so the burden of benign tumors may be a risk factor for developing MPNST. We studied 13 NF1 patients with MPNSTs and 26 age- and sex-matched controls (NF1 patients who did not have MPNSTs) with detailed clinical examinations and whole-body MRI to characterize their body burden of internal benign neurofibromas. Internal plexiform neurofibromas were identified in 22 (56%) of the 39 NF1 patients studied. All six of the NF1 patients with MPNSTs under 30 years of age had neurofibromas visualized on whole-body MRI, compared to only 3 of 11 matched NF1 controls under age 30 (p < 0.05). Both the median number of plexiform neurofibromas (p < 0.05) and the median neurofibroma volume (p < 0.01) on whole-body MRI were significantly greater among MPNST patients younger than 30 years of age than among controls. No significant differences in whole-body MRI findings were observed between NF1 patients with MPNSTs and controls who were 30 years of age or older. Whole-body MRI of NF1 patients allows assessment of the burden of internal neurofibromas, most of which are not apparent on physical examination. Whole-body imaging of young NF1 patients may allow those at highest risk for developing MPNST to be identified early in life. Close surveillance of these high-risk patients may permit earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of MPNSTs that develop.

### Masses of developmental and genetic origin affecting the paediatric craniofacial skeleton [^e831434f]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Although rare, masses and mass-like lesions of developmental and genetic origin may affect the paediatric craniofacial skeleton. They represent a major challenge in clinical practice because they can lead to functional impairment, facial deformation and disfigurement. The most common lesions include fibrous dysplasia, dermoid cysts, vascular malformations and plexiform neurofibromas. Less common lesions include torus mandibularis and torus palatinus, cherubism, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, meningoencephalocele and nasal sinus tract. This article provides a comprehensive approach for the evaluation of children with masses or mass-like lesions of developmental and genetic origin affecting the craniofacial skeleton. Typical findings are illustrated and the respective roles of computed tomography (CT), cone beam CT (CBCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences and ultrasonography (US) are discussed for the pre-therapeutic assessment, complex treatment planning and post-treatment surveillance. Key imaging findings and characteristic clinical manifestations are reviewed. Pitfalls of image interpretation are addressed and how to avoid them. TEACHING POINTS:
- Masses of developmental and genetic origin may severely impair the craniofacial skeleton.
- Although rare, these lesions have characteristic imaging features.
- CT, MRI and ultrasonography play a key role in their work-up.
- Recognition of pivotal imaging pearls and diagnostic pitfalls avoids interpretation errors.

### Masses of developmental and genetic origin affecting the paediatric craniofacial skeleton [^830a774b]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Although rare, masses and mass-like lesions of developmental and genetic origin may affect the paediatric craniofacial skeleton. They represent a major challenge in clinical practice because they can lead to functional impairment, facial deformation and disfigurement. The most common lesions include fibrous dysplasia, dermoid cysts, vascular malformations and plexiform neurofibromas. Less common lesions include torus mandibularis and torus palatinus, cherubism, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, meningoencephalocele and nasal sinus tract. This article provides a comprehensive approach for the evaluation of children with masses or mass-like lesions of developmental and genetic origin affecting the craniofacial skeleton. Typical findings are illustrated and the respective roles of computed tomography (CT), cone beam CT (CBCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences and ultrasonography (US) are discussed for the pre-therapeutic assessment, complex treatment planning and post-treatment surveillance. Key imaging findings and characteristic clinical manifestations are reviewed. Pitfalls of image interpretation are addressed and how to avoid them.

Teaching points

- Masses of developmental and genetic origin may severely impair the craniofacial skeleton.

- Although rare, these lesions have characteristic imaging features.

- CT, MRI and ultrasonography play a key role in their work-up.

- Recognition of pivotal imaging pearls and diagnostic pitfalls avoids interpretation errors.

### Mirdametinib (Gomekli) [^be47a9b1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Associated Plexiform Neurofibromas

The efficacy of GOMEKLI was evaluated in the ReNeu study (NCT03962543), a multicenter, single-arm study in 114 patients ≥ 2 years of age with symptomatic, inoperable neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated plexiform neurofibromas (PN) causing significant morbidity. An inoperable PN was defined as a PN that cannot be completely surgically removed without risk for substantial morbidity due to: encasement of or close proximity to vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity of the PN. Patients received GOMEKLI 2 mg/m2orally twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed overall response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (disappearance of the target PN) or partial response (≥ 20% reduction in PN volume). Responses were assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis per Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) criteria modified to be confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment within 2 to 6 months during the 24-cycle treatment phase. A secondary efficacy outcome measure was duration of response for patients who achieved a confirmed response.

### Imaging characteristics of common suprasellar lesions with emphasis on MRI findings [^b2877c6b]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Suprasellar masses are varied in aetiology and can present diagnostic problems for a radiologist. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has largely replaced computed tomography (CT) as a diagnostic tool for these lesions, although CT can provide complementary information in some conditions. In this article, we review imaging features of common suprasellar lesions with emphasis on MRI features.

### Superficial neurofibroma: a lesion with unique MRI characteristics in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^f38b3cd7]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), superficial plexiform neurofibromas have different MRI characteristics than deep plexiform neurofibromas.

Subjects and Methods

Sixty-six patients (median age, 15 years) with superficial plexiform neurofibromas were compared with 56 patients with deep plexiform neurofibromas (median age, 12 years). All patients underwent axial STIR and coronal or sagittal STIR images.

Results

Superficial neurofibromas were more likely to be asymmetric (p = 0.004) and extend to the skin surface (p < 0.001). Lesion borders were poorly defined with similar frequency in both superficial and deep groups (77% vs 68%, p = 0.31). The morphology of superficial neurofibromas was more likely diffuse (64% vs 11%, p < 0.001), whereas deep neurofibromas were more likely nodular or fascicular. Of neurofibromas that were nodular or fascicular in morphology, superficial lesions had a smaller maximal fascicle-nodule diameter (mean, 10.3 mm) than deep lesions (mean, 13.4 mm) (p = 0.013). Signal characteristics of deep neurofibromas were more likely to be targetlike (75%) compared with superficial neurofibromas (21%) (p < 0.001). Superficial neurofibromas had a smaller mean volume than deep neurofibromas (180 vs 444 cm(3), p = 0.002).

Conclusion

Unlike the typical targetlike lesions along the course of major nerves seen in deep plexiform lesions, superficial plexiform neurofibromas in NF1 tend to be asymmetric, have nontargetlike signal intensity, lack nodular or fascicular morphology, and are likely to involve skin.

### Longitudinal study of neurofibromatosis 1 associated plexiform neurofibromas [^8d3911fa]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Plexiform neurofibromas are benign tumours that occur in more than half of people with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). These tumours can cause serious complications and can also progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), one of the leading causes of death among NF1 patients. Plexiform neurofibromas are clinically heterogeneous, and knowledge of their natural history is limited. In order to characterise the growth of plexiform neurofibromas better, we performed serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NF1 patients with such tumours.

Methods

MRI was done on 44 plexiform neurofibromas in 34 NF1 patients (median age 10 years; range 1–47 years). Each tumour was measured in two dimensions from the MRI scan, and the area and growth rate were calculated. The median length of follow-up was 6 years, with an average interval of 3 years between scans.

Results

36 tumours remained stable in size throughout the period of follow-up. 8 tumours increased in size; all occurred in patients who were under 21 years of age when first studied. The single exception was a man who developed rapid tumour growth and pain in a plexiform neurofibroma that had been followed for 10 years. Biopsy showed the presence of an MPNST.

Conclusion

Longitudinal MRI is a valuable means of monitoring the growth of plexiform neurofibromas in individuals with NF1.

### Spectrum of fat-containing soft-tissue masses at MR imaging: the common, the uncommon, the characteristic, and the sometimes confusing [^16a365b3]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Fat-containing tumors are the most common soft-tissue tumors encountered clinically. The vast majority of fat-containing soft-tissue masses are benign. Lipomas are the most common benign fat-containing masses and demonstrate a characteristic appearance at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Less common benign soft-tissue masses include lipoblastoma, angiolipoma, spindle cell lipoma/pleomorphic lipoma, myolipoma, chondroid lipoma, lipomatosis of nerve, lipomatosis, hibernoma, and fat necrosis. Well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLPSs)/atypical lipomatous tumors (ALTs) are locally aggressive soft-tissue masses that do not metastasize. Biologically more aggressive liposarcomas include myxoid, pleomorphic, and dedifferentiated liposarcomas. At MR imaging, lipomas typically resemble subcutaneous fat but may contain a few thin septa. The presence of thick, irregular, enhancing septa and nonfatty soft-tissue mass components suggests liposarcoma rather than lipoma. However, benign lipomatous lesions and WDLPS/ALT often have overlapping MR imaging findings. Distinguishing WDLPS/ALT from a benign lipomatous lesion or from fat necrosis at imaging can be challenging and often requires histologic evaluation. We present the spectrum of fat-containing masses, using the World Health Organization classification of adipocytic tumors, with an emphasis on commonly encountered lesions, characteristic MR imaging findings associated with specific tumors, and overlapping MR imaging findings of certain tumors that may require histologic sampling. We also briefly discuss the role of molecular markers in proper characterization and classification of fat-containing soft-tissue masses. (©)RSNA, 2016.

### Chest wall tumors: radiologic findings and pathologic correlation: part 1. benign tumors [^0aaeedfc]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Benign chest wall tumors are uncommon lesions that originate from blood vessels, nerves, bone, cartilage, or fat. Chest radiography is an important technique for evaluation of such tumors, especially those that originate from bone, because it can depict mineralization and thus indicate the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are helpful in further delineating the location and extent of the tumor and in identifying tumor tissues and types. Although the radiologic manifestations of benign and malignant chest wall tumors frequently overlap, differences in characteristic location and appearance occasionally allow a differential diagnosis to be made with confidence. Such features include the presence of mature fat tissue with little or no septation (lipoma), the presence of phleboliths and characteristic vascular enhancement (cavernous hemangioma), evidence of neural origin combined with a targetlike appearance on MR images (neurofibroma), well-defined continuity of cortical and medullary bone with the site of origin (osteochondroma), or fusiform expansion and ground-glass matrix (fibrous dysplasia). Both aneurysmal bone cysts and giant cell tumors typically manifest as expansile osteolytic lesions and occasionally show fluid-fluid levels suggestive of diagnosis.

### Hemorrhagic complication in surgical resection for massive plexiform neurofibroma in body trunk: the flow-void sign as a predictor and preoperative embolization as prevention [^9acf30a6]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are highly vascularized and potentially malignant tumors. Surgical resection of a PN can be complicated by perioperative hemorrhagic events (PHE), including excessive intraoperative blood loss and postoperative hematoma at the surgical site. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive factors of PHE and the usefulness of preoperative embolization for PN.

Materials and Methods

Consecutive surgical resections of 24 massive PNs in the body trunk with a maximum diameter > 5 cm in 22 patients between January 2015 and December 2020 were reviewed. Patient demographics, laboratory analyses, MRI findings, preoperative transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE), and pathological findings were evaluated between PNs with and without PHE, which consists of intraoperative blood loss over 15% of their estimated total blood volume and/or postoperative hematoma requiring surgical intervention or blood transfusion.

Results

PHE was observed in 7 out of 24 PNs (29.2%), with 5 events of excessive intraoperative bleeding and 2 postoperative hematomas. The PHE group (n = 7) showed a significantly higher flow-void effect inside the tumor on preoperative MRI than the non-PHE group (n = 17) (P = 0.0186). Preoperative TAE was not associated with PHE occurrence for the 24 PNs; however, it significantly reduced the PHE risk by 12 PNs with a flow-void sign (P = 0.00126). Other characteristics showed no significant differences between groups.

Conclusion

The flow-void sign on MRI can be the only predictive factor of PHE in surgical resection for massive PNs in the body trunk. Preoperative TAE can reduce the PHE risk for PNs with a flow-void sign.

### Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomics characteristics for differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in neurofibromatosis type 1 [^943f996d]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, ML using MRI-based radiomics allows sensitive and specific differentiation of benign and malignant and benign versus (pre-)malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients and represents a promising noninvasive diagnostic augmented radiological imaging tool. Feature expression distributions of premalignant atypical tumors illustrate biological plausibility of the considered radiomics characteristics. The presented techniques should be combined with established clinical and further image-based biomarkers and further validated in larger, prospective multi-center studies.

### Orbital tumours and tumour-like lesions: exploring the armamentarium of multiparametric imaging [^8ee75513]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Although the orbit is a small anatomical space, the wide range of structures present within it are often the site of origin of various tumours and tumour-like conditions, both in adults and children. Cross-sectional imaging is mandatory for the detection, characterization, and mapping of these lesions. This review focuses on multiparametric imaging of orbital tumours. Each tumour is reviewed in relation to its clinical presentation, compartmental location, imaging characteristics, and its histological features. We herein describe orbital tumours as lesions of the globe (retinoblastoma, uveal melanoma), optic nerve sheath complex (meningioma, optic nerve glioma), conal-intraconal compartment (hemangioma), extraconal compartment (dermoid/epidermoid, lacrimal gland tumours, lymphoma, rhabdomysarcoma), and bone and sinus compartment (fibrous dysplasia). Lesions without any typical compartmental localization and those with multi-compartment involvement (veno-lymphatic malformation, plexiform neurofibroma, idiopathic orbital pseudotumour, IgG4 related disease, metastases) are also reviewed. We discuss the role of advanced imaging techniques, such as MR diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging, fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography CT (FDG-PET CT), and positron emission tomography MRI (MRI PET) as problem-solving tools in the evaluation of those orbital masses that present with non-specific morphologic imaging findings. Main messages/Teaching points
- A compartment-based approach is essential for the diagnosis of orbital tumours.
- CT and MRI play a key role in the work-up of orbital tumours.
- DWI, PET CT, and MRI PET are complementary tools to solve diagnostic dilemmas.
- Awareness of salient imaging pearls and diagnostic pitfalls avoids interpretation errors.

### Pediatric brain MRI in neurofibromatosis type I [^b9d041c2]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Neurofibromatosis (NF) is the most common of the phakomatoses, with a prevalence of 1 in 3–4,000. Many organ systems can be affected. In addition to multiple peripheral neurofibromas, NF I predisposed to CNS tumors including optic glioma, astrocytoma and plexiform neurofibroma. The purpose of this pictorial review is to illustrate characteristic brain MR imaging lesions in children with NF I and to give some recommendations about diagnostic imaging procedures in children suffering from NF I. Typical findings in brain MRI are hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted images, so-called unknown bright objects, which may be useful as an additional imaging criterion for NF I. Contrast administration is necessary in MR studies to maximize tumor detection and characterization, to add confidence to the diagnosis of benign probable myelin vacuolization, and to document stability of neoplasm on follow-up examinations. We recommend to perform serial MR imaging in children every 12 months. The frequency of follow-up in children with known brain tumors will vary with the tumor grade, biological activity and treatment.

Conclusion

We report a rare case of a left-sided Bochdalek hernia in an adult who was treated via VATS. People with a Bochdalek hernia may not have any symptoms and the disorder may be detected unexpectedly, or the symptoms and expressions may vary from mild to serious complications. Even though rare, this disorder should be recognised, examined and treated appropriately to avoid complications.

In adulthood the risk of developing MPNSTs, atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biologic potential (ANNUBPs, formally called atypical neurofibromas), cutaneous neurofibromas, breast cancer, GISTs, glomus tumours of the digits, phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas increases. This guideline recommends that adults with NF1 should be assessed clinically, at least once every three years (Table 1, Table 2). Every visit should consist of history taking, examination for signs/symptoms of brain tumours or MPNSTs, examination of the skin for cutaneous neurofibromas, and screening for/monitoring of plexiform neurofibromas. Repeat WB-MRI imaging for monitoring plexiform neurofibromas should be determined according to the risk and on an individual basis, after consultation with a multidisciplinary team (Table 1, Table 7). Symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas should be monitored at shorter intervals with regional MRI. When malignancy is suspected based on clinical or imaging (MRI) signs, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography magnetic resonance imaging (18 FDG PET MRI) (preferred) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (18 FDG PET CT) (if 18 FDG PET MRI is not available) combined with regional MRI is advised. In case of a suspected ANNUBP or MPNST, primary resection is recommended when safe and feasible. Otherwise, radiologically (preferably 18 FDG PET MRI) guided diagnostic biopsy should be performed. Additionally, screening for breast cancer in patients with NF1, preferably with annual breast MRI, should begin at 30 years (Table 1, Table 11). When MRI is not available mammography can be used.

### Hoffa's fat pad abnormalities, knee pain and magnetic resonance imaging in daily practice [^4379cd93]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Masses and pseudo-masses

Masses or mass-like abnormalities rarely occur within the HFP, the most common being ganglia (Fig. 19).

Patients with oedema or abnormalities of the HFP on MRI are often symptomatic; however, oedema and abnormalities are also present in patients without symptoms. For this reason, a careful correlation with clinical findings is required to avoid unnecessary treatments in asymptomatic patients. The reason why some subjects do not feel pain, even though they present MRI findings which are similar to those in patients with local pain, is still unknown.

### Differentiation of soft tissue benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with magnetic resonance imaging [^2c88ff2c]. Clinical Imaging (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to differentiate the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) from that of malignant PNSTs.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-six patients who underwent MR imaging and had a histologic diagnosis of benign (schwannoma, n = 16; neurofibroma, n = 1) or malignant (n = 9) PNST were retrospectively reviewed. The size, location, shape, margin, and signal intensities of the tumors on precontrast and gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging were analyzed. In each patient, the presence or absence of split fat, target, and fascicular signs was determined.

Results

The mean size of the benign PNSTs (3.4 cm, S.D. = 2.5 cm) was significantly smaller than that of the malignant tumors (8.2 cm, S.D. = 3.1 cm) (P < .001). Seventeen (65.4%) of the 26 tumors were spindle shaped or ovoid (12 benign and 5 malignant tumors). Contiguity with specific nerves was identified in 15 (88.2%) of the 17 benign PNSTs but in none of the malignant tumors (P < .05). Well-defined margins were noted in all 17 benign PNSTs but in only 3 (33.3%) of the 9 malignant tumors (P < .001). Five (55.6%) of the 9 malignant PNSTs but none of the benign tumors showed signal intensity change in adjacent soft tissue (P < .05). There was no significant difference in signal intensity between the benign and malignant tumors on T(1)-weighted, T(2)-weighted, and contrast-enhanced MR images. The split fat and target signs were present more frequently in the benign PNSTs than in the malignant PNSTs (P < .05).

Conclusions

Benign and malignant PNSTs are often spindle shaped. Recognition of contiguity with adjacent nerves, a well-defined margin, and the presence of the split fat sign may suggest benignity. Imaging features suggestive of malignancy can be a larger size and an infiltrative margin.

Sciatic hernias

Case 8

A 58-year-old woman who had an incidental finding of a lipomatous mass on an MRI of the rectum which was performed for unrelated reasons, presented to our clinic with newly developed right-sided sciatica. Clinically, she had a palpable fullness in the right gluteal region.

On MRI, a herniating fatty tumour is seen extending through the greater and lesser sciatic foramina (Fig. 12).

Right panel: Axial proton density fat sat weighted image of the pelvis confirms the lesion is predominantly fat containing as it supresses on fat saturated sequences. High signal septations which do not supress can also be visualised. Red arrows outline the greater sciatic notch

Miscellaneous: ischiorectal fossa and iliopsoas compartment 'hernias'

Case 9

A 38-year-old lady presented to her GP with a history of intermenstrual bleeding. A pelvic ultrasound performed as part of the workup showed a mass, suspicious for an ovarian tumour. A pelvic MRI was then performed which revealed a large left ischiorectal fossa mass which extended into the perineum. Excision and histological examination followed which confirmed the presence of a lipomatous lesion with no MDM2 or CDK4 amplification (Fig. 13).

### ACR-ASNR-SABI-SSR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the adult spine [^7f5042aa]. ACR/ASNR/SABI/SSR (2023). High credibility.

MRI of the adult spine — sequence selection and postoperative/tumor protocols: MR imaging of any portion of the spine should include T1- and T2-weighted sequences, preferably in 2 planes with slice thickness dependent on the area to be imaged (usually up to 5 mm). T2✱ sequences can be helpful, especially in the thoracic and cervical spine, and T2✱ or gradient-echo images are less sensitive to CSF flow–induced artifacts and can be useful to distinguish disc versus osteophyte. In the cervical spine, direct oblique imaging or a T2 isotropic acquisition with reformations may improve detection and characterization of neural foraminal pathology; CT provides additional information about bony proliferation, and newer MR techniques such as Zero-Echo-Time may improve visualization of bony neural foraminal stenosis and potentially obviate the need for concurrent CT. In postoperative cases differentiating scar from disc, postcontrast T1- weighted sequences, with or without fat suppression, are useful, and coronal sequences may also be helpful; images with fat suppression are sometimes acquired both before and after administration of the intravenous contrast agent. For tumor assessment, sagittal T1-weighted sequences should be performed and chemical shift imaging can be helpful; fat-suppressed T2-weighted or STIR sequences can make focal lesions more conspicuous, an axial fluid–sensitive sequence may be helpful for soft-tissue processes, and a contrast-enhanced study may be helpful to further define extraosseous extension.

### Health supervision for children with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^ed4ec206]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Summary and recommendations about malignancies related to NF1 — malignancy patterns and imaging guidance are outlined as follows: malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) most often develop within a plexiform neurofibroma, and diagnostic imaging is an option to assess the extent of a plexiform neurofibroma at the time of diagnosis and is clinically indicated for signs and symptoms outlined in this section above and/or in Table 3; a fludeoxyglucose PET-CT scan may be useful in detecting malignant transformation of a plexiform neurofibroma. Pheochromocytomas can lead to increased catecholamine concentrations and consequent hypertension but are rare in children with NF1, and most experts recommend screening for pheochromocytoma if there is an acute and dramatic increase in heart rate and/or blood pressure; hypertension may be an indicative of pheochromocytoma, but most hypertension is detected incidentally. Breast cancer occurs more frequently in young adults with NF1 than in the general population, and other types of malignancy may occur in NF1.

We retrospectively analyzed MR images obtained for 41 histologically diagnosed cases of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and 20 cases of neurofibroma that had been treated at four tertiary institutions. Twenty of the patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and 14 patients with neurofibromas developed the disease in association with neurofibromatosis 1. The MR images were evaluated with regard to tumor size, signal intensity, heterogeneity of T1- and T2-weighted MR images, enhancement pattern, definition of margins, presence of perilesional edemalike zone, and presence of intratumoral cystic lesions.

Results

Significant differences between malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and neurofibromas were noted for the largest dimension of the mass, peripheral enhancement pattern, perilesional edemalike zone, and intratumoral cystic lesion. In cases associated with neurofibromatosis 1, heterogenicity on T1-weighted images was also significant in differentiating neurofibroma from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The presence of two or more of the four features suggestive of malignancy indicated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 90%.

Conclusion

The MR features described in this study are useful for distinguishing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors from neurofibromas. If a tumor has two or more of the four statistically significant features, it can be considered to be highly suspicious of malignancy and should be subjected to a biopsy for early diagnosis.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is one of the best known malformations requiring surgical repair in newborns and young infants. Two main types are posterolateral, Bochdalek hernia accounting for the majority (90%) and about 80% being left sided, and anterior Morgagni hernia which is more common on the right side. Depending on the location and size of the hernia abdominal organs move into the chest cavity compressing and displacing normal structures. Since this compression is already present in fetal life normal genesis of both ipsi- and contralateral lung is altered. The degree of consequent lung hypoplasia is the major determinant of postnatal prognosis. Clinical signs of severe respiratory distress are present from birth in severe cases, while mild cases may manifest later. Prenatal ultrasound has variable performance, it can detect about 60% of the cases by the 24th gestational week. Prenatal MRI enables better differentiation of abdominal structures herniated in the chest. The severity of pulmonary hypoplasia is most reliably assessed by lung volume measurement which is currently most accurately measured on MRI images. After birth conventional radiography of the chest and abdomen shows partial opacification of a hemithorax with contralateral shift of the mediastinum with displaced NG tube. Later when the GI tract is air-filled bowel loops or stomach are identified in the chest instead of the normal intraabdominal location. CT or postnatal MRI is seldom performed in CDH, mainly in cases where differential diagnostic information is needed.

Imaging the small Airways in Children: why, when and how?

Why and When?

Diseases affecting the small airways in children can be difficult to detect when using traditional diagnostic tests. Indeed widespread airway involvement is usually present before we are able to demonstrate either clinical symptomatology, abnormalities on basic pulmonary function testing, or abnormal plain chest radiographs. Bronchiolar obstruction may be detected indirectly, by computed tomography (CT), manifest as regional under-ventilation and air trapping. This in turn will result in the body's homeostatic mechanisms then causing reduced pulmonary arterial perfusion to these nonfunctional (area of obstructive over inflated) airways. On CT this is manifest as oligaemia and more hyper lucent lung contributing to the 'mosaic attenuation' within the lung parenchyma.

### Current state of spinal nerve sheath tumor management and future advances [^338d41da]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The differentiation of MPNSTs from neurofibromas on MRI is challenging and generally unreliable, but some associated features have been described.MPNSTs are often larger in size, have increased peripheral enhancement, more perilesional edema, poorly defined margins, poor contiguity with a single nerve, and more intratumoral cystic changes. The target sign, although sometimes present in MPNST, is more predictive of neurofibromas. On 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18 FDG-PET) imaging, MPNST are also more likely to demonstrate FDG uptake compared to benign nerve sheath tumors, with one study describing an overall sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.95, and a sensitivity of 1.0 for high-grade MPNSTs.DWI sequences may also be helpful in identifying MPNSTs, which have a higher apparent diffusion coefficient. A machine learning approach was recently developed with only post-gadolinium T1 sequences and outperformed human experts who had access to all available sequences. With further optimization and validation, such artificial intelligence tools may be useful adjuncts to help differentiate MPNSTs from benign lesions.

### Mesenchymal extratesticular tumors and tumorlike conditions: from the radiologic pathology archives [^d0a37e97]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Both benign and malignant tumors and tumorlike conditions can arise from the nonepididymal extratesticular tissues. Benign tumors are far more common than malignant tumors, with lipoma being the most common lesion found at this site. Several imaging features can help narrow the differential diagnosis of these lesions, including the presence of fat and imaging features suggestive of fibrous tissue. Lesions that contain fat represent lipoma, liposarcoma, or angiomyofibroblastoma (AMF)-like tumor. If enhancing soft tissue is present in conjunction with fat, the differential diagnosis narrows further to just liposarcoma and AMF-like tumor. Lesions that display magnetic resonance imaging characteristics compatible with fibrous tissue are likely to be fibrous pseudotumor. However, many of the lesions in this location have overlapping imaging findings, and surgical excision is most often necessary for accurate diagnosis. The ability to narrow the differential diagnosis with imaging, however, is helpful for the clinician for both treatment planning and patient counseling.

### Multinodular / plexiform (multifascicular) schwannomas of major peripheral nerves: an underrecognized part of the spectrum of schwannomas [^f1d64b62]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Object

In clinical practice, schwannomas are among the most common types of nerve sheath tumors. Their clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, and operative features are well known. Over the past 20 years, clinical outcomes have improved due to resection of these tumors at a fascicular level. Despite these advances, a subgroup of patients with schwannomas is associated with a disappointing neurological outcome following resection. The purpose of this study was to correlate the imaging and histological features in this group of patients with more anatomically complex forms of schwannomas.

Methods

In a retrospective review performed at their institution over a 10-year period, the authors found a subgroup of patients with complex multinodular/plexiform schwannomas affecting major peripheral nerves. Eleven patients were identified, and the clinical, imaging, and pathological features of their disease were reviewed.

Results

The clinical presentation of multinodular/plexiform schwannomas of major peripheral nerves may be similar to that of conventional schwannomas, but their imaging features, operative appearance, and outcomes differ.

Conclusions

Preoperatively and intraoperatively, the distinguishing features of multinodular/plexiform schwannomas of major peripheral nerves may be subtle and can easily go unrecognized, thus explaining the often suboptimal surgical results. Familiarity with the imaging and operative features of multinodular/plexiform schwannomas will no doubt alter treatment approaches and improve neurological function in this subgroup of patients.

### The tip of the iceberg: lipomatous tumours presenting as abdominal or pelvic wall hernias [^3fdb6b6b]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Liposarcomas are the most common soft tissue sarcoma. They occur mainly in the thigh or retroperitoneum. Due to their size, lipomatous tumours can herniate either through the abdominal wall or in the groin. The part of the tumour that herniates represents only the 'tip of the iceberg', as the main part of the tumour is not detectable clinically and is often underestimated. Due to their deep location, lipomatous tumours are often large at the time of presentation and therefore their surgical management can be challenging. Furthermore, due to their delayed presentation, there is a higher risk of de-differentiation. In this pictorial review, we discuss different presentations of herniating lipomatous tumours according to the location of the abdominal wall defects. We aim to cover a wide spectrum of hernia defects including inguinal, ventral, lumbar, sciatic and ischiorectal hernias. We also present cases of tumours within the psoas compartment 'herniating' from the pelvis into the thigh. In case of a palpable lump, the first diagnostic step is to perform an ultrasound. If the herniating tissue is not fully accessible with ultrasound, additional cross-sectional imaging by CT or MRI is warranted. In this article, CT and MRI findings in lipomatous tumours are addressed and the use of contrast enhanced sequences in MRI is discussed. Patients' outcome depends not only on adequate diagnosis but also on the correct route of tissue sampling for histology and oncological resection to prevent local recurrence and loss of function. Therefore, referral to a specialised sarcoma treatment centre is key and needs to be done before biopsy.

### A case of posterior mediastinal myelolipoma and a literature review of its imaging manifestations [^8bd91667]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CT is a common diagnostic method for mediastinal myelolipoma. CT and MRI can effectively diagnose adrenal myelolipoma, but they cannot diagnose mediastinal myelolipoma. Even if the disease cannot be accurately diagnosed, it can be judged whether the disease is benign or malignant by using imaging. Different tumors can be distinguished by their occurrence in distinct locations and the different tissue components present within a tumor. In particular, mediastinal myelolipoma needs to be differentiated from teratoma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, malignant nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, thymolipoma, angiolipoma, and epidural lipomatosis.

Adrenal myelolipoma is relatively common. It often occurs unilaterally, with a small volume, clear boundary, circular homogeneous mass, and often contains fat. It is notable that the amount of fat is much less in mediastinal myelipoma than in adrenal myelipoma.

When a paraspinal posterior mediastinal mass is found, especially if the mass is located in the right posterior mediastinum, in addition to the clear boundary and regular shape of the benign tumor signs, if the mass contains fat density, the possibility of myelolipoma should be considered first. Except for special situation such as extremely large masses, internal bleeding, and compression symptoms, radiologists should recommend follow-up rather than biopsy or surgery.

General laboratory tests for myelolipoma show no abnormalities, and CT and MRI are the most important preoperative diagnostic methods; CT is more commonly used than MRI. In this study, some radiographic signs were characteristic, with the main radiographic sign being a heterogeneous mass in the right posterior mediastinum near the spine, including fat density. When the imaging features of the lesions are not typical, they mainly need to be differentiated from neurogenic tumors, extramedullary hematopoiesis, lymphadenopathy, and pleural mesothelioma.
