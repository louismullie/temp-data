## Question

What is the Cullen sign?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Cullen's sign is, including its mechanism, associated conditions, and clinical significance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the core definition and anatomic location. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology. Next, I will review the major associated etiologies across contexts (pancreatitis, trauma, iatrogenic, neonatal). After that, I should consider its clinical implications and differential with related ecchymotic signs. Finally, I will synthesize a succinct, accurate definition grounded in the cited literature [^113Wum1C].

> Let me first confirm the term and its basic meaning: Cullen's sign classically refers to periumbilical ecchymosis, i.e., bruising around the umbilicus; wait, I should verify whether the hemorrhage source is typically intra- or retroperitoneal before I lock that in, because I recall both being discussed historically [^116DdnfE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the neonatal neuroblastoma/adrenal hemorrhage report explicitly lists umbilical bruising (Cullen's sign) among cutaneous manifestations of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which supports retroperitoneal origin rather than intraperitoneal as the proximate driver of the periumbilical discoloration, and the oocyte-retrieval cases directly equate Cullen's sign with periumbilical hematoma reflecting a retroperitoneal hematoma, so I should anchor the mechanism in retroperitoneal bleeding rather than intraperitoneal per se [^116DdnfE] [^1152JTtJ].

> I need to check the path of blood tracking to explain the periumbilical location: retroperitoneal blood can dissect along fascial planes to the anterior abdominal wall and into the subcutaneous tissues around the umbilicus, producing ecchymosis; the pancreatitis case with a positive Cullen's sign fits this mechanism as hemorrhage from a retroperitoneal pancreas can track to the umbilicus, which aligns with the concept that the visible bruise is a delayed cutaneous marker of a deeper retroperitoneal bleed [^114F3yps] [^1152JTtJ] [^116DdnfE].

> Next, I should review associated clinical contexts; let me think about the classic and the broader differential: acute pancreatitis is a canonical setting where Cullen's sign may appear, particularly in severe hemorrhagic disease, and the BMJ review underscores the spectrum and severity of pancreatitis even if it does not list the eponym explicitly, while the pediatric surgery case directly documents Cullen's sign in acute severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis; in trauma, Cullen's sign is listed among visible external signs that may accompany penetrating abdominal injuries; iatrogenic retroperitoneal hemorrhage after transvaginal oocyte retrieval can present with Cullen's sign; and in neonates, spontaneous adrenal hemorrhage or neuroblastoma may manifest with umbilical ecchymosis via the same retroperitoneal mechanism [^114F3yps] [^114F3yps] [^113Wum1C] [^1152JTtJ] [^116DdnfE].

> But wait, what if I'm overgeneralizing the etiologies; I should double-check the broader hemorrhagic causes that produce related flank bruising (Grey Turner sign) since the pathoanatomy overlaps: reviews of Grey Turner sign enumerate ruptured aneurysms, pancreatic hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, and spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage among others; given the shared retroperitoneal bleed-to-subcutaneous tracking mechanism, Cullen's sign may similarly accompany these catastrophic retroperitoneal events, though the strength of association varies and Cullen's is not pathognomonic for any single diagnosis [^111eqQUK] [^116DdnfE].

> I will now examine the clinical significance; let me reconsider whether this is an early or late sign: periumbilical ecchymosis generally develops over hours to days, so it tends to be a relatively late and uncommon physical finding signaling substantial retroperitoneal blood loss; in pancreatitis, its presence points toward hemorrhagic/necrotizing severity; in trauma or iatrogenic settings, it should trigger urgent evaluation for retroperitoneal hematoma even though, as in the oocyte-retrieval cases, the ultimate course can occasionally be benign; regardless, its detection warrants expedited imaging and hemodynamic assessment because it is a marker of significant bleeding rather than a diagnosis itself [^114F3yps] [^1152JTtJ] [^113Wum1C].

> Hold on, I should verify related signs to avoid mislabeling: Grey Turner sign denotes flank ecchymosis, Fox sign the upper thigh, Stabler sign the pubis/groin, and Bryant sign the scrotum, all tied to retroperitoneal hemorrhage; I need to ensure the definition I give for Cullen's sign remains confined to periumbilical ecchymosis so as not to conflate distributions that imply slightly different tracking pathways of the same underlying bleed [^116DdnfE].

> Putting it all together, and correcting my earlier inclination to frame it as intraperitoneal bleeding rather than the better-supported retroperitoneal source, I should state: Cullen's sign is periumbilical ecchymosis caused by retroperitoneal hemorrhage that dissects through fascial planes to the subcutaneous tissue around the umbilicus; it is most classically described in severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis, but can also occur with penetrating abdominal trauma, iatrogenic retroperitoneal hematoma, and neonatal adrenal hemorrhage or neuroblastoma, and it signals significant underlying bleeding that warrants urgent evaluation rather than serving as a disease-specific diagnosis [^114F3yps] [^113Wum1C] [^1152JTtJ] [^116DdnfE].

Cullen sign is a **periumbilical ecchymosis** indicating **intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage**. It is most commonly associated with acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis [^114F3yps], ruptured ectopic pregnancy [^111eqQUK], abdominal trauma [^113Wum1C], ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, and coagulopathies [^111eqQUK]. The sign appears after **24–48 hours** due to blood tracking along fascial planes, and its presence signals severe underlying pathology with **high morbidity and mortality**. Immediate evaluation with laboratory tests and imaging (ultrasound, CT) is essential to identify the cause and guide **urgent management** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical appearance and pathophysiology

**Appearance**: Cullen sign presents as a bluish-purple discoloration around the umbilicus due to subcutaneous infiltration of blood or hemoglobin breakdown products. **Pathophysiology**: It develops when blood from intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage tracks along fascial planes (particularly via the falciform ligament) to the periumbilical subcutaneous tissue, typically becoming clinically apparent after 24–48 hours.

---

## Associated medical conditions

- **Associated conditions**: Cullen sign is linked to several serious medical conditions, including:

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis | - Severe inflammation and hemorrhage of the pancreas <br/> - Often associated with alcohol use or gallstones [^111SdqrS] |
| Ruptured ectopic pregnancy | - Life-threatening condition where a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus <br/> - Typically in the fallopian tube <br/> - Leading to rupture and hemorrhage [^111eqQUK] |
| Abdominal trauma | Blunt or penetrating trauma causing intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage [^113Wum1C] |
| Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) | - Catastrophic rupture of the abdominal aorta <br/> - Leading to massive hemorrhage [^111eqQUK] |
| Coagulopathies | - Disorders of blood clotting <br/> - Such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or anticoagulant therapy complications [^111eqQUK] |

---

## Diagnostic significance and clinical implications

**Diagnostic significance**: Cullen sign is a critical indicator of severe intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage and necessitates immediate medical evaluation and intervention [^111eqQUK]. **Clinical implications**: Its appearance signals significant blood loss and is associated with high morbidity and mortality; prompt recognition and management are essential to improve patient outcomes.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation and management

- **Evaluation and management**: Upon identifying Cullen sign, the following steps are recommended:

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, serum amylase and lipase levels [^111SdqrS], liver function tests, and pregnancy test (in women of reproductive age).

- **Imaging studies**: Abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan to identify the source of hemorrhage and assess the extent of bleeding [^115Dd149].

- **Management**: Immediate stabilization of the patient, including fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion if necessary, and surgical or interventional radiology procedures to control the source of bleeding [^113Wum1C].

---

## Prognosis and clinical outcomes

**Prognosis**: Cullen sign indicates severe underlying pathology with significant morbidity and mortality; prognosis depends on the underlying cause, extent of hemorrhage, and timeliness of intervention [^111SdqrS]. **Clinical outcomes**: Early recognition and prompt management markedly improve outcomes, whereas delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to catastrophic complications, including shock, organ failure, and death [^113Wum1C].

### Prospective evaluation of two diagnostic apprehension signs for posterolateral instability of the elbow [^111C3fJx]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) of the elbow occurs due to attrition of the lateral ulnohumeral collateral ligament following elbow dislocation. Diagnosis through physical examination can be challenging in awake patients. The study aimed to define two active apprehension signs for diagnosing PLRI and to perform a prospective evaluation of these signs in patients with PLRI.

Eight patients undergoing surgical reconstruction of the lateral ulnocollateral ligament were prospectively included. Preoperative evaluation involved physical examination using two active apprehension signs — the chair sign and the pushup sign — as well as the pivot-shift sign. Results were compared with repeat physical examinations post-reconstruction.

Of the 8 patients, 3 demonstrated a positive pivot-shift sign while awake, but all showed a positive pivot-shift sign under anesthesia. Seven patients exhibited a positive chair sign, and seven showed a positive pushup sign. At the 2-year follow-up, 7 patients remained stable and asymptomatic, with negative pushup sign, chair sign, and pivot-shift sign results.

The study demonstrated that both the pushup and chair signs effectively aid in diagnosing PLRI. These signs are more sensitive than the pivot-shift sign in awake patients and can be easily performed in an office environment.

### Chest imaging using signs, symbols, and naturalistic images: A practical guide for radiologists and non-radiologists [^112jgfMh]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The "headcheese" sign was introduced to the literature by Patel et al. in 2000 as a typical feature of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This imaging pattern may be produced on CT images by the simultaneous presence of ground glass opacities, air-trapping areas, and healthy lung regions (Fig. 19) and is normally seen on expiratory CT images. It can be observed when obstructive small-airway disease coexists with an alveolar inflammatory infiltration component. Although it has been considered pathognomonic of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), this sign may actually occur in other pathological conditions, such as infections associated with bronchiolitis or atypical cases of sarcoidosis with alveolar involvement. The "headcheese" sign derives its definition from the CT appearance of the pulmonary parenchyma, where lobular areas with differing densities resemble the typical European meat dish.

- **Figure 19: Headcheese sign**: This sign consists of a mixed pulmonary pattern with areas of various attenuation. It is characterized by the presence of areas of ground glass attenuation (black peripheral arrowheads, due to infiltrative diseases), air-trapping (black arrows), and healthy lung zones. This pattern resembles the appearance of headcheese, as demonstrated in a patient with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

### Does this patient have pheochromocytoma? A systematic review of clinical signs and symptoms [^114s5Mfx]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Patients highly suspected to have pheochromocytoma were those in whom the diagnosis was ruled out by negative arteriograms and no evidence of disease after at least 18 months of follow-up.

A total of 213 patients were screened for resistant or markedly accelerated hypertension, paroxysmal hypertension, and "flushes", and in a small proportion, for adrenal incidentaloma or genetic predisposition to pheochromocytoma, in whom diagnosis was not confirmed by long-term follow-up or by the use of imaging techniques.

Based on our definition of heterogeneity, all of our data in groups were heterogeneous, except for the negative LR of hypertension, with an I² of 43.2%. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis with a random effect model. The number of studies that reported sensitivity of signs and symptoms, pooled sensitivity with the random effect method, and its 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table 3.

- **Table 3**: Sensitivity of signs and symptoms.

The definition of orthostatic hypotension varied among studies. The sensitivity based on the definition is shown in Table 4.

- **Table 4**: Sensitivity of orthostatic hypotension based on different definitions in studies.

Abbreviations: OH, orthostatic hypotension; SBP, systolic blood pressure; DBP, diastolic blood pressure.

Based on the funnel plot and Egger test, paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs and symptoms found to have publication bias.

As mentioned previously, seven of the articles included a control group and could be used for calculating the LR of signs and symptoms. Seven of the symptoms were evaluated in these articles: palpitation, diaphoresis, classic triad, hypertens

### Quantitative assessment of the Group of Seven's collaboration in sustainable development goals [^1162vGpj]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

To define the direction of change, we introduce the following sign function. The output from the sign function is then compared to the expected direction of the SDG indicator to determine the sign of synergy. A positive sign for synergy indicates that the member countries are improving the SDG indicator together along its expected direction (shown in Table 1), while a negative sign implies a collective movement towards the opposite direction.

In addition to gross synergy, it is also important to measure the contributions of individual countries to the gross synergy to better understand their roles in the group. We use a notation to indicate the contribution from country j to the gross synergy from year t to year t + 1, which can be calculated as follows: the sign indicates whether country j is contributing positively or negatively to the group synergy. Note that the synergy contribution of an individual country for a specific indicator can exceed the range of -100% to +100%; however, the sum of contributions from all countries for this indicator should always equal 100% (for positive gross synergy) or -100% (for negative gross synergy).

	(1) The parallel lines sign is a characteristic indicator for diagnosing patients with a mild disease. The grid sign is a characteristic indicator for diagnosing patients with a moderate disease. The lymphatic lake sign and crescent sign are characteristic indicators for diagnosing patients with a severe disease, while the honeycomb sign and band sign are characteristic indicators for diagnosing patients with a moderate to severe disease.

	(2) The thickness of the skin, band sign, and crescent sign gradually increased with increasing disease severity.

	(3) The efficacy of the diameter and area of subcutaneous fat for PLEL grading is optimal.

	(4) Nonenhanced MRI can be a better and standardized tool for grading PLEL.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: A review [^114KoAL9]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism can be associated with various clinical signs and symptoms. These include Palla's sign, cancer, COPD, hemoptysis, hypotension, obesity, and increased pulsus paradoxus. Patients may experience poorly localized abdominal pain, chest pain, cough, increased plasma D-dimer, dyspnea, deep vein thrombosis, T wave inversion, respiratory alkalosis, and Westermark sign. Additional symptoms include anxiety, normal plasma D-dimer, sweating, palpitations, association with estrogens, cigarette smoking, decreased SpO2, lightheadedness, immobility, and findings such as ovarian torsion.

More conditions related to pulmonary embolism are LUQ pain, varicose veins, dizziness, subpleural infarct, PR depression or diffuse ST elevation, hemoptysis, Hampton's hump, low voltages, leg edema, and personal or family history of blood clots. Blood clots could also relate to Crohn's disease, the S1Q3T3 pattern, tachycardia, acute cough, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiac chest pain. Other signs include McConnell's sign, cardiac arrhythmias, RUQ pain, stroke, hypertension, fainting, heart failure, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and sudden-onset chest pain.

### I saw the "atoll SIGN" - and now I need a tropical vacation [^115fJtLU]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

The atoll sign describes ring-shaped opacities surrounding central ground glass attenuation as seen on chest CT and was first associated with organizing pneumonia. The name is derived from the Maldives' language, denoting a ring or crescentic-shaped coral reef island surrounding a central lagoon. Although biopsy is usually required for diagnosis, understanding some of the more common pathologies associated with the atoll sign may help narrow a differential and guide management.

### Recurrent painful ecchymosis in an adolescent female [^115AYDER]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: Which of the following is an appropriate intervention in the management of this condition?

	- A. Avoidance of skin biopsy
	- B. Psychiatric evaluation
	- C. Autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test
	- D. Referral for malignancy workup
	- E. Oral corticosteroids

- **Answers**:

	- A. Avoidance of skin biopsy – Incorrect. Skin biopsy of ecchymosis will show extravascular erythrocytes and edema in the epidermis or dermis. Histopathologic examination can be useful to help exclude vasculitis.

	- B. Psychiatric evaluation – Correct. PP can present in patients with an underlying psychiatric disorder. A detailed evaluation should be considered, as this may lead to a psychoemotional diagnosis that may otherwise go untreated. Because there is no confirmatory test, the diagnosis of PP is largely one of exclusion. Medication review and laboratory studies would be appropriate to rule out disorders that could predispose patients to ecchymosis.

	- C. Autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test – Incorrect. An autoerythrocyte sensitization skin test is positive if an ecchymosis develops at the site of injected autologous erythrocytes. Historically, this test was used for diagnosis of PP; however, its utility is now controversial because of lack of standardization and data on its validity.

	- D. Referral for malignancy workup – Incorrect. An association between PP and an underlying malignancy has not been reported. Hematologic malignancy may present with ecchymosis; however, prodromal symptoms and lack of trauma in the area prior to the development of ecchymosis may not be present.

### Prodromal signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis: A systematic review [^111zLzbN]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

We aimed to extract the percent of signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis from published studies and to pool these using meta-analytic techniques.

- **Background**: Delayed or misdiagnosis of chronic pancreatitis may occur because the signs and symptoms are nonspecific and varied.

- **Study**: We performed a systematic review of studies reporting the signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis at diagnosis. The percentage of patients with each sign and symptom was extracted, and random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled percentages.

- **Results**: In total, 22 observational studies were included. Across 14 studies, 55% of chronic pancreatitis patients were classified as having alcoholic etiology. Abdominal pain was the most common symptom (76%), and weight loss was reported in 22% of patients. Jaundice occurred in 11% of patients and steatorrhoea in 3%. Half of the patients had a history of acute pancreatitis, and 28% had diabetes mellitus at diagnosis. Heterogeneity between the studies was high for all signs and symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: This research has identified some common features of patients with chronic pancreatitis, but the high heterogeneity makes it difficult to draw solid conclusions. Carefully designed studies to examine the signs and symptoms leading up to a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, and common combinations, are required. These would enable the development of a tool to aid in the early identification of chronic pancreatitis in the primary care setting, with potential for improved short-term and long-term outcomes for patients.

### Clinical correlations of cervical myelopathy and the Hoffmann SIGN [^112gscTP]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2008). Low credibility.

The Hoffmann sign is commonly used in clinical practice to assess cervical spine disease. It is unknown whether the sign correlates with the severity of myelopathy, and no consensus exists regarding the significance of a positive sign in asymptomatic individuals.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective review of cervical spine surgeries for myelopathy due to cervical spondylosis, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, or disc herniation performed at a tertiary center, the authors compiled data on the presence of hyperreflexia, the Hoffmann and Babinski signs, and modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scale scores. In a prospective evaluation, new patients with lumbar spine complaints were examined for the presence of a Hoffmann sign. If present, a cervical MR imaging study was assessed for cord compression.

- **Results**: Of the 225 surgically treated patients, a Hoffmann sign occurred in 68%, hyperreflexia in 60%, and a Babinski sign in 33%. In patients with milder disability (mJOA scores 14–16), the Hoffmann sign was present in 46%, whereas a Babinski sign occurred in 10%. In those with severe myelopathy and mJOA scores of ≤ 10, the Hoffmann sign was present in 81% and the Babinski sign in 83%. Of 290 patients presenting exclusively with lumbar spine-related complaints, 36 (12%) had a positive Hoffmann sign. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated spinal cord compression in 91% when the sign was present bilaterally and 50% when positive unilaterally.

- **Conclusions**: In patients surgically treated for cervical myelopathy, the Hoffmann sign is frequently observed.

### Significance of the 'line SIGN' in the diagnosis of congenital imperforate anus on prenatal ultrasound [^112wTYNP]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The prenatal diagnosis of foetal imperforate anus is challenging, with most previous studies presented as case reports. A retrospective review of diagnostic approaches was conducted to provide useful information for diagnosing this condition. Ultrasonography was performed in 19 cases of foetal imperforate anus from 2016 to 2019 at our prenatal diagnostic centre. The prenatal sonographic features and outcomes of each case were collected and evaluated.

- **Result**: The anal sphincter of a normal foetus shows the 'target sign' on cross-sectional observation. Of the 19 cases of imperforate anus, 16 were diagnosed by the ultrasound image feature called the 'line sign'. One case with tail degeneration was a low-type imperforate anus with an irregular 'target sign', not a true 'target sign'. There were two false-negative cases, in which the 'target sign' was found but irregular.

- **Conclusion**: In this study, we find that the anus of a foetus with imperforate anus presents a 'line sign' on sonographic observation. The absence of the 'target sign' and the presence of the 'line sign' can assist in the diagnosis of imperforate anus. The 'line sign' can be used as a secondary assessment to determine the type of malformation following non-visualization of the 'target sign'. The higher the position of the imperforate anus, the more obvious the 'line sign'. It is worth noting that finding a short 'line sign' and irregular 'target sign' should not overlook the low-type imperforate anus.

### Pregnant woman awareness of obstetric danger signs in developing country: Systematic review [^116ZWXsB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

The operation definition of knowledge level details the level of knowledge report, previously found in Table 3. Eight articles report three knowledge levels of obstetric danger signs, while others report two levels or summarize the three categories. The method used to measure the level of knowledge involved asking respondents to mention obstetric danger signs. If respondents could mention a certain number of danger signs above the benchmark, they were rated as knowledgeable or having good knowledge. The benchmark values used were slightly different across studies. The majority used the number of danger signs, such as ≥ 4, ≥ 3 obstetric danger signs, ≥ 2, and ≥ 1. Three other studies used different measurement methods; two used the mean as the limit of assessment, and two used a percentage of more than 75%.

- **The mother level of awareness according to the knowledge level**: The categories used by each study to describe the level of knowledge differ, so the authors report based on the operational definitions used. Studies using the "understand 4 danger signs" measure show that 31% have a good knowledge level, while the remaining 69% have low or no knowledge. When using the "3 danger sign" measure, the highest percentage of good knowledge is 71.4% regarding danger signs during pregnancy, and the lowest is 22.1% concerning postpartum danger signs. Additionally, a 100% knowledge level was found for overall danger sign awareness within this category.

### Acute pancreatitis with Cullen's SIGN presentation in a case of mixed type I and II choledochal cyst [^114F3yps]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

A 3-year-old girl initially presented with acute severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis, diagnosed by clinical features including a positive Cullen's sign and raised serum amylase. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan corroborated these findings and also reported a type I choledochal cyst. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) 2 months later indicated a type II choledochal cyst and a persistent pseudo-pancreatic cyst. Intraoperative features and detailed examination of the CECT and MRCP films revealed the presence of mixed type I and II choledochal cysts. The case is notable for its presentation of Cullen's sign, combined CECT and MRCP features of a mixed type I and II choledochal cyst, and successful surgical outcome. It appears to be only the fifth case of mixed type I and II choledochal cyst in world literature within the pediatric age group, following four previous cases in children reported from Japan.

### Validation of computed tomographic middle cerebral artery "dot" SIGN: an angiographic correlation study [^115PAbbL]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

The middle cerebral artery (MCA) "dot" sign consists of hyperdensity of an arterial structure, seen as a dot in the sylvian fissure. The MCA dot sign has been proposed to indicate thrombosis of M2 or M3 MCA branches, analogous to the hyperdense middle cerebral artery (HMCA) sign indicating M1 thrombosis. The MCA dot sign has not been validated previously against the gold standard of conventional cerebral angiography.

- **Methods**: Noncontrast CT scans and immediately subsequent cerebral angiograms from 54 acute stroke patients within 8 hours of symptom onset were analyzed. CT films were inspected for the MCA dot sign and HMCA sign. Vascular findings on CT were compared with findings at angiography.

- **Results**: Mean patient age was 71 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16.5. Mean time from symptom onset to CT was 125 minutes, and that from CT to angiography was 117 minutes. All patients had arterial occlusion at angiography. Of the anterior circulation occlusions, M1 occlusions were noted in 28 patients, isolated M2 in 15, and isolated M3 in 4. One definite MCA dot sign was observed in 16.7% of patients, and an HMCA sign was observed in 13.9%. MCA dot sign performance in predicting the presence of M2 or M3 clot at angiography was as follows: sensitivity 38%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 68%, and overall accuracy 73%.

- **Conclusions**: The MCA dot sign is a highly specific and moderately sensitive indicator of acute thrombus in the M2/M3 MCA branches, as validated by catheter angiography.

### Stabler's SIGN revisited in a spontaneously ruptured neuroblastoma of the newborn [^116DdnfE]. American Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Retroperitoneal hemorrhage is known to cause bruising of the flanks (Turner's sign), umbilicus (Cullen's sign), pubis and groin (Stabler's sign), upper thigh (Fox's sign), or scrotum (Bryant's sign). Spontaneous adrenal hemorrhage is the most common cause of nontraumatic parietal ecchymosis sign in neonates. Only 20 such neonatal cases have been reported in the literature. Because all of them were of benign etiology, conservative management is generally recommended in the presence of this sign. We report the sign for the first time in a case of spontaneously ruptured adrenal neuroblastoma in a newborn. Perinatal physicians need to be aware of this unusual presentation of neonatal neuroblastoma.

### Classifying signs and symptoms of dry eye disease according to underlying mechanism via the Delphi method: The DIDACTIC study [^113G1U17]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Dry eye disease (DED) is categorized by pathophysiology as aqueous deficient dry eye (ADDE), evaporative dry eye (EDE), or mixed. Treatment should be tailored to DED pathophysiology; however, determining this is challenging. This Delphi consultation aimed to categorize and weight signs and symptoms to help identify the evaporative or aqueous deficient DED origin.

- **Methods**: A panel of French DED experts created an initial list of 77 DED signs and symptoms. In a Delphi consultation, experts categorized items by DED pathophysiology. Likert scoring was employed to determine whether items were strongly or moderately indicative of ADDE or EDE. Additionally, items could be judged non-applicable to DED, with the opportunity to suggest alternative diagnoses.

- **Results**: Experts attributed 19 items to the pathophysiology of EDE (11 strongly indicative) and 12 items to ADDE (four strongly indicative). Items scored strongly indicative with agreement > 90% for EDE included previous chalazia, rosacea/rhinophyma, telangiectasias of eyelid margin, and thick non-expressible meibomian gland secretions. For ADDE, strongly indicative items were Sjögren syndrome or associated disease and Schirmer < 5 mm after 5 min (without anesthesia). Seventeen items indicated neither pathophysiology, and 18 items were found to be suggestive of alternative diagnoses.

- **Conclusions**: This Delphi consultation categorized signs and symptoms, employing an innovative weighting system to identify DED pathophysiology. Developing an algorithm integrating the weighting of each sign and symptom of an individual patient would be valuable.

### Radiological manifestations of thoracic hydatid cysts: Pulmonary and extrapulmonary findings [^111zZVB2]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

- **Complete rupture signs**: Axial CT images of different patients on the lung window demonstrate various features: a. Cumbo sign (red arrow), b. Mass within cavity sign (red arrow), c. Waterlily sign (red arrow), d. Whirl sign (red arrow), and e. Empty cyst sign (red arrow).

- **Cumbo sign (double arch sign, onion peel)**: At this stage, the endocyst shrinks and ruptures due to the increasing amount of air. An air-fluid level is seen in the endocyst and the pericyst.

- **Whirl sign (serpent sign)**: This sign features collapsed membranes within the cyst after expectoration of cyst fluid.

- **Waterlily sign (camolette sign)**: With the complete collapse of the endocyst, wrinkled floating membranes are observed in the remaining fluid.

- **Rising sun sign**: The rupture of the endocyst may lead to the appearance of daughter cysts, which manifest as round radio-opacities at the bottom of the cysts.

- **Mass within cavity sign (incarcerated membrane sign)**: This sign occurs when the fluid is completely evacuated by expectoration, and the remaining solid components settle at the dependent part of the cavity.

- **Dry cyst sign (empty cyst sign)**: As a result of cyst content expectoration, the pericyst appears empty and filled with air.

Additionally, the rupture of the endocyst can extend to the parenchyma, main bronchus, and pleural cavity. Rupture of the cyst into the parenchyma can cause consolidation around the cyst, and centrilobular opacities may become apparent due to endobronchial extensions of hydatid cysts (Fig. 7).

### Pushing beyond the limit: A novel clinical sign of thoracic aortic dissection [^116Whhfk]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Prompt recognition of acute aortic dissection is key to optimizing outcomes for what is the most common lethal aortic pathology. The ability to diagnose this condition is often confounded by unreliable symptomatology and a lack of reproducible, sensitive clinical signs. While the tearing pleuritic chest pain associated with aortic dissection has been well-described, clinical examination findings seldom contribute to the diagnosis of aortic syndromes. Instead, diagnosis relies principally on echocardiography and CT imaging. Here, we present a clinical case demonstrating a novel sign of thoracic aortic dissection: thoracic pain reproduced by abdominal palpation.

### Clinical analysis of the "small plateau" sign on the flow-volume curve followed by deep learning automated recognition [^115rsv5k]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with the small plateau (SP) sign had higher rates of chronic cough in bronchial provocation test (BPT) groups (both P < 0.0001). In addition, patients with the sign were more likely to show evidence of wheezing in both positive and/or negative BPT and bronchodilator test (BDT) groups (P = 0.033, P < 0.0001, P = 0.011, and P = 0.014, respectively).

- **Pre-PFT questionnaires**: Data from pre-pulmonary function test (PFT) questionnaires show that in negative-BPT groups, patients with the SP sign were more likely to demonstrate indications of cough, bronchiectasis, rhinitis (sinusitis), gastroesophageal reflux, and pneumonia (all P < 0.0001). In contrast, in positive-BDT groups, PFT indications of asthma and rhinitis (sinusitis) were more frequent.

Indications include hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and studies without documented indication (Tables 4 and 5).

- **Notes**:
	- **PFT**: Pulmonary function test
	- **COPD**: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
	- **ILD**: Interstitial lung disease

### The "extracapsular cystic" SIGN in pancreatic serous cystic neoplasms: A clinicopathologic study of 177 patients with cystic pancreatic lesions [^116J5mq7]. European Journal of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess a new imaging feature, named the extracapsular cystic sign, which can constructively contribute to differentiating serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs) from other pancreatic cystic lesions.

The material and methods involved a retrospective review of 177 CT/MRI scans of patients who underwent pancreatic resection of cystic lesions at two institutions between January 2011/2013 and September 2017. For each patient, demographic information and clinical presentation, especially imaging features, were carefully investigated by two experienced abdominal radiologists. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V.23.0.

Results revealed that twenty-one lesions exhibited extracapsular cystic signs. Among these, 17 (28.3%) were from 60 SCNs, and 4 (3.4%) from 117 non-SCNs, indicating that the extracapsular cystic sign was more often detected in SCNs. Of the 21 lesions, 86% (n = 18) were females, and the mean age at diagnosis was 51.2 years. Notably, 71% (n = 15) were located in the pancreatic body and tail. The average size was 27.2 mm (ranging from 23.7 to 53.4 mm), and the mean (SD) ratio of the largest daughter cyst to the mother cyst was 0.51 [0.14] (p = 0.99). The average (SD) angle between them was 105.5° [14.9] (p = 0.84). The average time interval between the last imaging examination and surgery was 8.4 days.

In conclusion, the newly identified extracapsular cystic sign in SCNs may aid in differentiating SCNs from other pancreatic cystic lesions. Furthermore, this study supports an original diagnosis of SCNs when this sign is observed.

### The clothes maketh the SIGN [^115qkcp1]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

In the neurologic system, ribbon ribs of neurofibromatosis type I are a notable feature. In the thorax, one of the most common skeletal manifestations of neurofibromatosis type I involves the ribs. Characteristic rib abnormalities include well-defined erosions of either the superior or inferior margins of one or more ribs with separation of adjacent ribs secondary to plexiform neurofibromas. This can result in marked deformity of the ribs due to either primary bony dysplastic changes or severe destruction, which resembles "ribbons" on the chest radiograph, known as the "ribbon ribs" deformity.

The chest radiograph and coronal CT of the thorax in a 25-year-old woman with cutaneous lesions demonstrate bilateral rib deformities that resemble ribbons. Well-defined erosions of either the superior or inferior margins of ribs are secondary to plexiform neurofibromas and are a common manifestation of neurofibromatosis type I. The coronal CT reconstruction delineates a neurofibroma replacing the intercostal fat.

### Clinical and radiological diagnosis of gallstone ileus: a mini review [^116Ur8Ps]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of gallstones is notoriously non-specific. Symptoms and signs differ depending on the site of gallstone impaction, and the duration of symptoms can vary significantly, ranging from hours to weeks. Most commonly, gallstone ileus resembles small bowel obstruction of any cause. Symptoms and signs are often intermittent and may include the following:

- **Abdominal pain**: Usually generalized and colicky owing to bowel obstruction.
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Often follow abdominal pain. The vomitus may be bilious (small bowel obstruction, SBO), feculent (large bowel obstruction, LBO), or may appear "coffee-ground".
- **Abdominal distension**: A highly variable sign. Clinical examination may elicit tinkling or high-pitched bowel sounds.
- **Constipation**: This can vary; patients may initially pass stool or flatus, but this can progress to absolute constipation.
- **Signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding**: These may include hematemesis, coffee-ground vomitus, or melena due to the erosion of the gastroduodenal artery.
- **Signs of bowel perforation ± peritonitis**: These are extremely rare as a first presentation of gallstone ileus.

Patients may also report a history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, anorexia, or early satiety. Acute cholecystitis is present in 10–30% of patients at the time of gallstone ileus. Rare presentations of gallstone ileus reported in the literature include gangrenous appendicitis with a gallstone impacted at the base of the appendix or intussusception with the stone serving as a lead point.

### Comparison between dedicated MRI and symphyseal fluoroscopic guided contrast agent injection in the diagnosis of cleft SIGN in athletic groin pain and association with pelvic ring instability [^111RJwbN]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The study focuses on comparing the presence of cleft signs in MRI and fluoroscopy following the injection of iomeprol, which consists of 300 mg of iodine/ml as a contrast agent.

In 14 patients, no cleft sign was found in MRI, and none of these patients had a cleft sign in fluoroscopy. In contrast, among the 24 patients without a cleft sign in fluoroscopy, 10 exhibited a cleft sign in MRI. The distribution was as follows: 2 cases of isolated superior clefts, 2 isolated secondary clefts, and 6 patients with an atypical cleft sign.

In 13 patients, an isolated superior cleft sign was diagnosed with MRI, which was also evident in 10 patients in fluoroscopic examinations. For 2 of these patients, a corresponding cleft sign was not found in fluoroscopy. Furthermore, one patient showed an isolated superior cleft sign in MRI and an isolated secondary cleft in fluoroscopy. All 10 patients with an isolated superior cleft sign in fluoroscopy exhibited the same pattern in MRI.

Of the 15 patients with an isolated secondary cleft sign in MRI, 13 also displayed that injury in fluoroscopy, while 2 did not show any cleft sign in fluoroscopy. In comparison, with 21 patients showing an isolated secondary cleft sign in fluoroscopy, MRI examinations of these patients revealed 13 isolated secondary cleft signs, 7 combined cleft signs, and 1 patient with an isolated superior cleft sign in MRI, the same patient mentioned earlier.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: A review of the recent literature [^1124tJA8]. The Open Orthopaedics Journal (2012). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome can be associated with various clinical signs and symptoms. These include the flick sign, positive Phalen's test, and Tinel's sign. Patients may also experience decreased threshold in the terminal digit pad of finger 3 while the terminal digit pad of finger 5 remains normal. Other symptoms include wrist pain, hand swelling, thumb pain, thenar atrophy, tingling in the fingers, and numbness in the fingers. Additionally, there may be decreased pinprick sensation, clumsiness, thenar hypotrophy, wrist stiffness, hand pain, tingling in the hand, and decreased threshold or absent sensation in any of the first three terminal finger pads, as well as numbness in the hand.

### Sensory cueing of autobiographical memories in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: A comparison between visual, auditory, and olfactory information [^111sRi5A]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Plus and minus signs ("+", "-") indicate a gain and a disruption in retrieval performance, respectively, compared with the expected values. The plus-minus sign (" ± ") indicates expected performance. As two Fisher's exact tests were computed (i.e. with and without group as a factor, see Methods), a single sign indicates a significant effect in at least one analysis, whereas a double sign indicates a significant effect in both analyses.

These patterns lead to several interpretations. First, our data globally fit the "visual dominance hypothesis" and especially the proposal of Willander and colleagues suggesting that visual information contributes more to retrieval than auditory information. Interestingly, our cross-generational approach allows us to make some assumptions about the evolution of the mechanisms underpinning sensory cueing and its effects on autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval in normal and pathological aging.

### Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease presenting with alien limb SIGN [^117XKo7m]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a fatal spongiform encephalopathy, which typically presents with rapidly progressing dementia and additional neurological findings that can be quite variable and diverse. Here, we report the unusual case of a patient who presented with left alien limb sign without overt cognitive impairment and was ultimately diagnosed with pathologically confirmed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

### Does this patient have pheochromocytoma? A systematic review of clinical signs and symptoms [^116HJn2d]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Patients highly suspected to have pheochromocytoma, in whom the diagnosis was ruled out by negative arteriograms and no evidence of disease after at least 18 months of follow-up.

A total of 213 patients were screened for resistant or markedly accelerated hypertension, paroxysmal hypertension, and 'flushes' and, in a small proportion, for adrenal incidentaloma or genetic predisposition to pheochromocytoma, in whom the diagnosis was not confirmed by long-term follow-up or use of imaging techniques.

Based on our definition of heterogeneity, all our data groups were heterogeneous (except negative LR of hypertension with an I² of 43.2%); therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis with a random effect. The number of studies that reported the sensitivity of signs/symptoms, pooled sensitivity with the method of random effect, and its 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table 3.

Table 3
Sensitivity of signs and symptoms

The definition of orthostatic hypotension varied among studies. The sensitivity based on different definitions is shown in Table 4.

Table 4
Sensitivity of orthostatic hypotension based on different definitions in studies

- **Abbreviations**: OH, orthostatic hypotension; SBP, systolic blood pressure; DBP, diastolic blood pressure.

Based on the funnel plot and Egger test, paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias.

As mentioned previously, seven of the articles had a control group and, therefore, could be used for calculating the LR of signs/symptoms. Seven symptoms were evaluated in these articles: palpitation, diaphoresis, classic triad, hypertension, weakness/fatigue.

### Definitions for warning signs and signs of severe dengue according to the who 2009 classification: Systematic review of literature [^111LwbEg]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Since warning signs and signs of severe dengue are defined differently between studies, we conducted a systematic review on how researchers defined these signs. We conducted an electronic search in Scopus to identify relevant articles, using keywords including dengue, "warning signs", "severe dengue", and "classification". A total of 491 articles were identified through this search strategy and were subsequently screened by two independent reviewers for definitions of any of the warning or severe signs in the 2009 WHO dengue classification. We included all original articles published in English after 2009, classifying dengue by the 2009 WHO classification or providing the additional definition or criterion of warning signs and severity (besides the information of 2009 WHO).

Analysis of the extracted data from 44 articles showed wide variations among definitions and cutoff values used by physicians to classify patients diagnosed with dengue infection. The establishment of clear definitions for warning signs and severity is essential to prevent unnecessary hospitalization and harmonize the interpretation and comparability of epidemiological studies dedicated to dengue infection.

### Cholecystitis [^1158hYTB]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). High credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is commonly associated with various clinical signs and risk factors. **Common symptoms include**: Murphy's sign, fever, right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness, and RUQ pain. Conditions such as pregnancy, immunocompromised states, obesity, trauma, chronic diseases, and diabetes mellitus also contribute to its occurrence. **Demographic factors**: Female sex, Native American and Hispanic ethnicity, and elderly age increase the risk. **Additional symptoms often observed are**: Jaundice, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, shock, epigastric abdominal pain, cardiac chest pain, and a feeling of being unwell.

- **Diagnostic and clinical features encompass**: An increased gallbladder diameter, increased gallbladder wall thickness, pericholecystic fluid, inflammation, and an increased white blood cell (WBC) count. **Specific signs to note include**: Sonographic Murphy's sign and Boas' sign. **Other associated factors include**: The presence of gallstones, infection, and rare cases of cancer potentially linked to estrogens. Furthermore, weight changes, sweating, and malnutrition are also noted, enhancing the clinical impression of acute cholecystitis.

### Cullen's SIGN following ultrasound-guided transvaginal oocyte retrieval [^1152JTtJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

To describe two cases of periumbilical hematoma (Cullen's sign) following ultrasound-guided transvaginal oocyte retrieval, case reports were conducted at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Two patients, aged 34 and 32, developed Cullen's sign after the procedure. Interventions included a workup for pancreatitis and coagulopathies, and laparoscopy was performed in one patient.

The main outcome measure was the resolution of symptoms. Results showed that pancreatitis, coagulopathy, and massive hemoperitoneum were ruled out, and symptoms resolved within two weeks. It was concluded that the appearance of a periumbilical hematoma (Cullen's sign) following ultrasound-guided transvaginal oocyte retrieval reflects a retroperitoneal hematoma of a benign course.

### The string SIGN for diagnosis of mucinous pancreatic cysts [^114vjvqd]. Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

The pancreas cyst fluid analysis does not provide optimal discrimination between mucinous and nonmucinous cysts. The aim of this study was to assess the performance characteristics of the "string sign" — a test performed at the time of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), for the diagnosis of mucinous pancreatic cysts, including branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (bIPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients undergoing EUS-FNA of pancreatic cystic lesions at one referral center between 2003 and 2012 were included. The string sign was performed prospectively, considered positive if a string of ≥ 1 cm formed in the cyst fluid and lasted for ≥ 1 second. Performance characteristics of the string sign and a sequential cyst fluid test interpretation model were assessed.

- **Results**: For 98 histologically proven cases, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the string sign for diagnosis of mucinous cysts were 58% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44%-70%), 95% (83%-99%), 94% (81%-99%), and 60% (46%-72%), respectively. When string sign results and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration (≥ 200 ng/mL) were combined, diagnostic accuracy improved from 74% and 83%, respectively, to 89% (P ≤ 0.03). Among bIPMN, a positive string sign was associated with gastric and intestinal epithelial subtypes. The sequential cyst fluid test interpretation model, including cytology, mucin stain, CEA, and string sign, yielded an overall sensitivity for mucinous lesions of 96%.

### Analysis of clinical motor testing for adult patients with diagnosed ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [^111QqZin]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the dichotomous results for seven ulnar nerve clinical motor tests — Froment's sign, Wartenberg's sign, finger flexion sign, Jeanne's sign, crossed finger test, Egawa's sign, and the presence of clinical fasciculations — with motor nerve conduction velocity findings.

The design employed a static group comparison to assess differences among dichotomous test outcomes with respect to motor nerve conduction velocity. Data was collected from five medical facilities throughout the United States.

Participants included records from 26 individuals diagnosed with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. No interventions were applicable.

- **Main outcome measures**: Demographic data encompassed age, sex, handedness, duration of symptoms, and the number of days between the clinical and electrodiagnostic examinations. Other dependent variables included motor conduction velocity of the ulnar nerve, compound muscle action potential amplitude, and the outcomes of dichotomous clinical motor tests.

Results indicated that two motor signs — the presence of clinical fasciculations and a positive finger flexion sign — were identified more frequently, each present in 11 patients, than other motor signs. An analysis of covariance revealed significant differences in motor nerve conduction velocity between positive and negative results for all the clinical motor tests, except for the finger flexion sign. Significant chi-square analyses were found for comparisons between the presence of clinical fasciculations and Froment's sign, as well as between the finger flexion sign and the crossed finger test.

### Diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted imaging in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [^1117oP8n]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

In the probable and definite vCJD cases, where both FLAIR and DWI sequences were available, FLAIR sequences identified the pulvinar sign in 16 of the 22 cases, whilst DWI identified it in nine cases (sensitivity of 73% vs. 41% respectively, p-value < 0.001).

In this study's analysis of cases, the pulvinar sign demonstrated an overall specificity of 98.9% in the radiological diagnosis of vCJD.

- **Cases with serial imaging**: Four probable cases had serial imaging; three with two scans and one with four. Two of the four probable cases were positive for the pulvinar sign on initial scans and subsequent scans (based on FLAIR, with one having a corresponding pulvinar sign on DWI in both). The other two cases with serial scans were both negative for the pulvinar sign on initial imaging. One of these cases had a positive pulvinar sign detected on subsequent imaging (FLAIR only). The other case had four serial scans that were all negative for the pulvinar sign.

- **Definite cases with serial scans**: In definite cases, three neuropathologically confirmed cases had two serial scans each. Two of these cases were positive for the pulvinar sign on FLAIR images (one having a corresponding pulvinar sign on DWI) on both the initial and subsequent scans. Of these two cases, one was classified as vCJD based on image appearance alone, and the other as sporadic, due to the presence of cortical hyperintensities on DWI (bilateral cingulate and insular).

### Fincher syndrome: Insights into a rare neurosurgical condition [^114M14Mw]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of Fincher syndrome varies among patients due to differences in tumor dimensions, location, and the degree of bleeding observed. Patients usually present with sudden, acute sciatica, lower back pain, and headache. Neurological malfunctions such as numbness, muscle weakness, and in extreme cases, paralysis, may be observed and can vary based on the size and location of the tumor.

Brown and Roberts (2019) report that severe occurrences of this condition may lead to bladder function issues due to spinal cord compression. Additionally, Garcia and Wilson (2020) note that meningeal irritation may manifest as neck stiffness, light sensitivity, changes in reflexes, and feelings of nausea. These symptoms may overlap, making it prudent to commence additional investigation, especially if the patient has no history of trauma or recognized vascular complications.

### Cutaneous signs of systemic disease [^114viE3A]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011).

Commonly used dermatologic eponyms and characteristic skin signs are enormously helpful in guiding a diagnosis, even though they may not be pathognomonic. They include the following:

- **Nails**:
	- Aldrich-Mees' lines (syn.: Mees' lines) are often associated with arsenic poisoning.
	- Beau's lines relate to acute stress or systemic illness.
	- Muehrcke's lines indicate severe hypertension.
	- Terry's nails are associated with liver disease.
	- Half and half nails suggest uremia.

- **Around the nails**:
	- Braverman's sign is associated with collagen-vascular disease.

- **Elsewhere on the body**:
	- The Asboe-Hansen and Nikolsky's signs are indicative of the pemphigus group of diseases.
	- Auspitz's sign is a classic finding in psoriasis.
	- Borsieri's and Pasita's signs are seen in early scarlet fever.
	- The butterfly rash is indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus.
	- The buffalo hump is seen in Cushing's disease and also in more common corticosteroid toxicity.
	- Gottron's papules and the heliotrope rash are signs of dermatomyositis.
	- Janeway's lesions and Osler's nodes are seen in bacterial endocarditis.
	- A Dennie-Morgan fold under the eye is seen in association with atopic disease.
	- Koplik's spots are an early sign of rubeola.
	- Fitzpatrick's sign indicates a benign lesion (dermatofibroma).
	- Hutchinson's sign suggests a malignant lesion (subungual melanoma).

- **Skin markings**:
	- Petechiae are seen in many diseases, including fat embolization, particularly from a large bone fracture following trauma.
	- Palpable purpura indicates leukocytoclastic vasculitis and is an early, critical sign in Rickettsial diseases, including Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

### Value of the short time inversion recovery sequence of magnetic resonance imaging in the staging of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome complicated with lymphedema [^112ejVnx]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Aström et. al believe that subfascial effusion (i.e. the crescent sign) can be used as an indicator to determine the severity of LE. Similarly, Cellina et. al believe that suprafascial effusion (i.e. the band sign) can be used as an indicator for determining the clinical stage of LE. Some researchers also suggest that the parallel line sign is a characteristic manifestation of mild PLE. However, the results showed no statistically significant difference in the three symptoms mentioned above among the three periods. Therefore, we believe that when lower limb edema is PhLE, the crescent sign, band sign, and parallel line sign cannot be used as indicators to determine the severity of KTS-LE.

This study found a statistically significant difference (P < .05) in the honeycomb sign among the three stages. The specificity of the honeycomb sign in stage II was 63.2%, the sensitivity was as high as 87.5%, and the accuracy was as high as 67.4%. This finding indicates that the honeycomb sign can be used as an imaging indicator for KTS-LE staging and is a relatively specific sign of KTS-LE stage II. The pathological manifestation of the honeycomb sign involves the infiltration of lymph and various tissue factors into the interstitial space. These factors work together to cause abnormal proliferation of adipose tissue and fibrous tissue, leading to deformation of the subcutaneous soft tissue structure, eventually resulting in honeycomb-like changes.

### Interesting signs in nuclear medicine [^115piJZt]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Classic radiological and nuclear medicine signs have been reported extensively due to a myriad of pathophysiological processes. When encountered, these signs aid in the diagnosis of conditions and enhance reader confidence, sometimes even suggesting a specific diagnosis. The naming of signs is commonly associated with everyday objects to establish familiarity with visual findings. Regular practice in associating signs with diseases improves understanding of the images and their underlying causes. In this article, we have collated nuclear medicine signs reported in the literature since 1970.

### Evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma [^115Dd149]. Clinics in Sports Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Blunt abdominal trauma is a disease that can be associated with various clinical signs and symptoms, including altered mental status, abdominal pain, rebound and abdominal tenderness, tachycardia, pneumoperitoneum, costal margin tenderness, hypotension, shock, and the seat belt sign. It may also be accompanied by a concomitant femur fracture, an increase in white blood cell count, a decrease in hematocrit, free intraperitoneal fluid, microscopic hematuria, a decrease in serum base deficit, abdominal guarding, and an abnormal chest radiograph.

Further observations include a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14, elevated liver enzymes such as AST or ALT greater than 130 U/L, increased serum lactate, peritoneal findings, abdominal distension, and microscopic hematuria. Additionally, patients may present with hematocrit changes and symptoms of abdominal guarding.

### Do intracerebral hemorrhage nonexpanders actually expand into the ventricular space [^116mQYyW]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

The computed tomographic angiography spot sign as a predictor of hematoma expansion is limited by its modest sensitivity and positive predictive value. It is possible that hematoma expansion in spot-positive patients is missed because of decompression of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) into the ventricular space. We hypothesized that revising hematoma expansion definitions to include intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) expansion will improve the predictive performance of the spot sign. Our objectives were to determine the proportion of ICH nonexpanders who actually have IVH expansion, determine the proportion of false-positive spot signs that have IVH expansion, and compare the known predictive performance of the spot sign to a revised definition incorporating IVH expansion.

- **Methods**: We analyzed patients from the multicenter PREDICT ICH spot sign study. We defined hematoma expansion as ≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% ICH expansion or > 2 mL IVH expansion and compared spot sign performance using this revised definition with the conventional 6 mL/33% definition using receiver operating curve analysis.

- **Results**: Of 311 patients, 213 did not meet the 6-mL/33% expansion definition (nonexpanders). Only 13 of 213 (6.1%) nonexpanders had ≥ 2 mL IVH expansion. Of the false-positive spot signs, 4 of 40 (10%) had > 2 mL ventricular expansion. The area under the curve for spot sign to predict significant ICH expansion was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.58–0.72), which was no different than when IVH expansion was added to the definition (area under the curve, 0.66; 95% confidence interval).

### Different criteria for defining "spot SIGN" in intracerebral hemorrhage show different abilities to predict hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132EeVW]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

The "spot sign" is a well-known radiological marker used for predicting hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We performed a meta-analysis to assess the predictive accuracy of the spot sign depending on the criteria used to identify them. We conducted a systematic review of clinical studies that clearly stated their definition of the spot sign and were indexed in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data were collected on computed tomography (CT) parameters, spot sign diagnostic criteria, hematoma expansion, and clinical outcomes.

Based on the eligibility criteria, we included 17 studies in this systematic review. CT imaging modality, type, time from symptom onset to CT, time from contrast infusion to scan, slice thickness, tube current, and tube electric discharge showed variation across studies. Three different definitions of the spot sign were applied:

- **Hyperdense spot within the hematoma**: Defined as a distinct hyperdense area within the hemorrhage.
- **Focal areas/regions of contrast pooling**: One or more areas of any size and morphology occurring within a hemorrhage, discontinuous from normal or abnormal vasculature adjacent to the hemorrhage, showing an attenuation rate ≥ 120 UH.
- **Serpiginous or spot-like contrast density on CTA**: Occurred within the hematoma margin, showed twice the density of the hematoma background, and did not contact vessels outside the hematoma.

Three definitions for the spot sign were identified, all of which were associated with hematoma expansion, mortality, and unfavorable clinical outcomes.

### International consensus definitions of video signs of concussion in professional sports [^116UvidE]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Use of video to assist professional sporting bodies with the diagnosis of sport-related concussion (SRC) has been well established; however, there has been little consistency across sporting codes regarding which video signs should be used and the definitions of each of these signs.

- **Aim**: The aims of this study were to develop a consensus for the video signs considered to be most useful in the identification of a possible SRC and to develop a consensus definition for each of these video signs across the sporting codes.

- **Methods**: A brief questionnaire was used to assess which video signs were considered most useful in the identification of a possible concussion. Consensus was defined as > 90% agreement by respondents. Existing definitions of these video signs from individual sports were collated, and individual components of the definitions were assessed and ranked. A modified Delphi approach was then used to create a consensus definition for each of the video signs.

- **Results**: Respondents representing seven sporting bodies (Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, Major League Baseball, NFL, NHL, National Rugby League, World Rugby) reached consensus on eight video signs of concussion. Thirteen representatives from the seven professional sports ranked the definition components. Consolidation and refinement of the video signs and their definitions resulted in consensus definitions for six video signs of possible concussion: lying motionless, motor incoordination, impact seizure, tonic posturing, no protective action-floppy, and blank/vacant look.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^112QDC5r]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis and investigation of FACP in primary care**: When evaluating functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) in primary care, the first step is to rule out "red flags" (alarm signals) of structural organic disease, which necessitate referral to a specialist.

- **Ruling out organic pathology**: When a patient first presents to primary care with symptoms of FACP, the first step is to rule out potentially serious organic disease. Key red flag signs and symptoms that could indicate structural disease include:

	- Significant unintentional weight loss
	- Persistent fever
	- Gastrointestinal bleeding
	- Persistent vomiting
	- Age of onset after 50 years

	- Patients presenting with any indicators of organic disease require referral to a specialist for further investigation.

- **Investigations and diagnosis**: A detailed evaluation of family history, medication, characteristics of pain, and eating/bowel habits should be undertaken for all patients presenting to primary care with symptoms of FACP. In selected cases and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and psychosocial assessment may also be appropriate. Abdominal ultrasound investigations may be helpful.

### A systematic review of the utility of the Hoffmann SIGN for the diagnosis of degenerative cervical myelopathy [^113VkN8a]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review aimed to determine the validity of the Hoffmann sign for detecting degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) in patients presenting with cervical complaints. Physical examination maneuvers are often employed to diagnose DCM, but no previous review had synthesized diagnostic accuracy data.

Medline, Embase, and HealthStar were searched for articles from January 1, 1947, to March 1, 2017, using the following terms: spinal cord diseases, spinal cord compression, cervical vertebrae, signs and symptoms, physical examination, epidemiologic studies, epidemiologic research design, predictive value of tests, and myelopathy. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) checklist was applied to determine the level of evidence. Articles included for review were published in English or French, rated as QUADAS level 3 or higher, with a minimum of 10 patients presenting with cervical complaints who had undergone the Hoffmann sign. Studies were excluded if they recruited patients with a nondegenerative type of cervical myelopathy and/or had no evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging.

A total of 589 articles were initially selected. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 45 articles were analyzed using the QUADAS checklist. Only three articles met the quality criteria of QUADAS level 3 or higher. Analysis of combined data from 2 of these 3 studies indicated that the Hoffmann sign has a positive likelihood ratio of 2.2 (95% CI 1.5–3.3) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.63 (95% CI 0.5–0.8).

### Integration of imaging signs into RadLex [^111bXr6J]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Imaging signs form an important part of the language of radiology but are not represented in established lexicons. We sought to incorporate imaging signs into RSNA's RadLex® ontology of radiology terms. Names of imaging signs and their definitions were culled from books, journal articles, dictionaries, and biomedical websites. Imaging signs were added into RadLex as subclasses of the term "imaging sign", which was defined in RadLex as a subclass of "imaging observation".

A total of 743 unique imaging signs were added to RadLex, along with their 392 synonyms, resulting in a total of 1,135 new terms. All included definitions and related RadLex terms, including imaging modality, anatomy, and disorder, when appropriate. The information will allow RadLex users to identify imaging signs by modality (e.g. ultrasound signs) and to find all signs related to specific pathophysiology. The addition of imaging signs to RadLex augments its use in indexing the radiology literature, creating and interpreting clinical radiology reports, and retrieving relevant cases and images.

### Depen [^113wABnG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria may develop during therapy and can be warning signs of membranous glomerulopathy, which can progress to a nephrotic syndrome. Close observation of these patients is essential. In some cases, the proteinuria disappears with continued therapy; in others, penicillamine must be discontinued. When a patient develops proteinuria or hematuria, the physician must determine whether it is a sign of drug-induced glomerulopathy or is unrelated to penicillamine.

Rheumatoid arthritis patients who develop moderate degrees of proteinuria may continue cautiously on penicillamine therapy, provided that quantitative 24-hour urinary protein determinations are obtained at intervals of one to two weeks. The penicillamine dosage should not be increased under these circumstances. Proteinuria exceeding 1 g/24 hours, or proteinuria that is progressively increasing, requires either discontinuance of the drug or a reduction in the dosage. In some patients, proteinuria has been reported to clear following a reduction in dosage.

In rheumatoid arthritis patients, penicillamine should be discontinued if unexplained gross hematuria or persistent microscopic hematuria develops.

In patients with Wilson's disease or cystinuria, the risks of continued penicillamine therapy in those manifesting potentially serious urinary abnormalities must be weighed against the expected therapeutic benefits. When penicillamine is used in cystinuria, an annual x-ray for renal stones is advised, as cystine stones can form rapidly, sometimes within six months.

### Rapidly enlarging nontender lesion on a child's face [^114ceRMk]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the classical clinical sign for this lesion?
	- A. Darier's sign
	- B. Antenna sign
	- C. Tent sign
	- D. Auspitz sign
	- E. The ugly duckling sign

- **Answers**:
	- A. Darier's sign – Incorrect. Darier's sign is seen in cutaneous mastocytosis. Positive Darier's sign is characterized by elicitation of urticaria on or around the affected area after scratching or rubbing the lesion, indicating the presence of mast cells.
	- B. Antenna sign – Incorrect. Antenna sign is seen in keratosis pilaris. Upon examination with tangential lighting, lesions exhibit long strands of keratin resembling an antenna.
	- C. Tent sign – Correct. Tent sign is classic for pilomatricomas and results from stretching of skin over calcification.
	- D. Auspitz sign – Incorrect. Auspitz sign is seen in psoriasis. This sign is elicited when the scales are removed from a psoriatic plaque, resulting in pinpoint bleeding.
	- E. The ugly duckling sign – Incorrect. The ugly duckling sign is used to describe cutaneous melanoma. Nevi on an individual tend to resemble one another (AKA "signature nevus"), and any atypical nevus raises suspicion for melanoma.

### Fine wigns [^111eKgqo]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

There are three categories of diagnostic data collected during the physical examination: sign, symptom, and that in between — but only two words to describe them. To fill that gap, I modestly propose here that examination responses that are vocalized (and thus symptom-like) yet thought to be specific (hence signifiers) be classified as wigns. I define a wign as the subjective reaction to a provocative examination maneuver deemed to have some valid relationship to the underlying pathology. This word is pronounced "whine" to remind us it is a spoken response, and its spelling echoes that of sign, reminding us likewise that a wign is more definitive than a generalized complaint.

The distinctions between sign, symptom, and wign are worthy of preservation, particularly regarding their probative value. Treatments offered on the basis of signs can be said to be most rigorously indicated, as symptoms, unlike signs, pass through (and are affected by) the prism of patients' perceptions. Remaining skeptical about the value of information provided by our patients is in the interest of these patients, as our skepticism might save them from unnecessary treatments and procedures.

### Heparin sodium [^114PofBP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

An overdose requires immediate medical attention and treatment.

- **Symptoms**: Bleeding is the chief sign of heparin overdosage. Early signs include easy bruising, petechial formations, nosebleeds, and blood in urine or tarry stools. In the event of a symptomatic heparin overdose, consider stopping heparin infusion.

- **Treatment**: Neutralization of the heparin effect is essential. When clinical circumstances (such as bleeding) require reversal of heparinization, protamine sulfate (1% solution) by slow infusion will neutralize heparin sodium. Administer no more than 50 mg of protamine sulfate very slowly within any 10-minute period. Each mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes approximately 100 USP Heparin units. The amount of protamine required decreases over time as heparin is metabolized. Although the metabolism of heparin is complex, for the purpose of choosing a protamine dose, it may be assumed to have a half-life of about 30 minutes after intravenous injection.

	- Ideally, the dose required to neutralize the action of heparin should be guided by blood coagulation tests or calculated from a protamine neutralization test. Due to the possibility of fatal reactions resembling anaphylaxis, protamine sulfate should only be administered when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactoid shock are readily available.

	- For additional information, consult the prescribing information for Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary; these dilute but do not neutralize heparin.

### Depen [^116ZNnNe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis - The principal rule of treatment with Depen in rheumatoid arthritis is patience, as the onset of therapeutic response is typically delayed. It may take two or three months before the first evidence of a clinical response is noted (see Clinical pharmacology).

When treatment with Depen has been interrupted due to adverse reactions or other reasons, the drug should be reintroduced cautiously by starting with a lower dosage and increasing slowly.

- **Initial therapy**: The currently recommended dosage regimen in rheumatoid arthritis begins with a single daily dose of 125 mg or 250 mg, which is thereafter increased at one to three-month intervals by 125 mg or 250 mg per day, as patient response and tolerance indicate. If a satisfactory remission of symptoms is achieved, the dose associated with the remission should be continued (see Maintenance therapy). If there is no improvement and there are no signs of potentially serious toxicity after two to three months of treatment with doses of 500–750 mg per day, increases of 250 mg per day at two to three-month intervals may be continued until a satisfactory remission occurs (see Maintenance therapy) or signs of toxicity develop (see Warnings and precautions). If there is no discernible improvement after three to four months of treatment with 1000 to 1500 mg of penicillamine per day, it may be assumed the patient will not respond, and Depen should be discontinued.

### Brain structural correlates of schizotypal signs and subclinical schizophrenia nuclear symptoms in healthy individuals [^1151J3KG]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Suspiciousness, paranoid thinking, as well as feelings of alienation and isolation are key symptoms of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. However, it is well-established that reports of psychotic-like experiences (PLE) are also frequently found in the general population, sparking a continuum model of psychosis-proneness [Claridge]. In contrast to the schizophrenia prevalence of approximately 1% [Simeone, Ward, Rotella, Collins, & Windisch], psychotic phenomena (e.g. hallucinations) in the absence of the disorder have a lifetime prevalence of about 6–7% in the general population [Linscott & van Os; McGrath et al.]. A considerable 34% of healthy individuals between the ages of 20 and 41 report at least mild psychotic signs [Rössler et al.], with child cohorts reporting even higher rates, up to over 60% [Downs, Cullen, Barragan, & Laurens].

A continuous phenotypic marker of psychosis-proneness is schizotypy, a multidimensional set of schizophrenia-like personality traits that — similar to the manifest disorder — comprises positive (magical thinking, unusual perceptions and beliefs), negative (introversion, anhedonia), and disorganized (cognitive disorganization, eccentricity) dimensions [Barrantes-Vidal, Grant, & Kwapil; Debbané & Barrantes-Vidal; Grant]. Schizotypy can be conceptualized as a stable, underlying predisposition [Kwapil & Barrantes-Vidal; Kwapil, Chapman, & Chapman] for more state-like phenomena like PLE, the momentary expression of psychotic experiences in non-clinical populations [Chapman & Chapman; van Os, Linscott, Myin-Germeys, Delespaul, & Krabbendam].

### Branched oligosaccharide structures on HBV prevent interaction with both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN [^115qrMEX]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that primarily targets the liver. Currently, a high-affinity receptor for HBV remains unidentified. The dendritic cell specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN is involved in pathogen recognition through mannose and fucose-containing carbohydrates, leading to the induction of an antiviral immune response. Many glycosylated viruses subvert this immune surveillance function and exploit DC-SIGN as a port of entry for trans-infection of target cells. The glycosylation pattern on HBV surface antigens (HBsAg), together with the tissue distribution of HBV, suggests potential interaction between HBV and both DC-SIGN and its liver-expressed homologue, L-SIGN. Therefore, a detailed study was undertaken to investigate the binding of HBV to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN.

For HCV, both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are known to bind the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. Soluble DC-SIGN and L-SIGN specifically bound HCV virus-like particles, although no interaction with either HBsAg or HepG2.2.15-derived HBV was detected. Additionally, neither DC-SIGN nor L-SIGN transfected Raji cells bound HBsAg. In contrast, highly mannosylated HBV obtained by treating HBV-producing HepG2.2.15 cells with the alpha-mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine is recognized by DC-SIGN. Alpha-mannosidase I trimming of N-linked oligosaccharide structures prevents recognition by DC-SIGN. Based on these findings, it is plausible to speculate that HBV exploits mannose trimming as a strategy to evade recognition by DC-SIGN, thereby subverting a possible immune activation response.

### Towards universal health coverage in the who African region: Assessing health system functionality, incorporating lessons from COVID-19 [^111ARQAS]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

The method section involved deriving scores for each vital sign based on indicators related to it. To ensure accuracy, multiple indicators were used for each vital sign, reducing the influence of any single indicator and ensuring that the score and resulting capacity index reflect the multiple actions needed for improvement. Given data challenges across 47 countries, the proxy indicators were selected based on three criteria: thematic relevance to the vital sign, availability of country-level data, and the public accessibility of the data from reputable sources. These proxy indicators represent the closest available data related to specific vital signs.

For data sources, preference was given to primary data, including household surveys and facility assessments. Additional data were obtained from publicly available sources such as the WHO Health Observatory, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals database, and the World Bank World Development Indicators. Non-specific resilience was the only vital sign without data from these sources; it was derived from health facility resilience assessments conducted during routine disease surveillance activities in the region. The data used reflect the latest available values for each country between 2010 and the present.

### Disseminated tense bullae on newborn [^114iscDz]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the name of the pathognomonic clinical sign of the disease?

- **A. Nikolsky sign** – Incorrect. The Nikolsky sign is a useful tool in diagnosing skin diseases. It is characterized by the dislodgement of the epidermis due to the application of tangential or lateral pressure on the skin or the border of a blister. The Nikolsky sign allows the differentiation of intraepidermal blisters from subepidermal blisters. It can often be observed in patients with staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and pemphigus. However, a negative Nikolsky sign can be observed in some skin diseases, such as bullous pemphigoid, which is characterized by pruritic and tense blisters.

- **B. Asboe-Hansen sign** – Incorrect. The Asboe-Hansen sign, also called the blister-spread sign, reflects the ability to extend a blister in the direction of the periphery through mechanical pressure applied to the roof of the intact blister. It is important to analyze conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, pemphigus, severe bullous drug reactions, and other blistering diseases. This sign is similar to the Nikolsky sign.

- **C. Pseudo-Darier sign** – Incorrect. Pseudo-Darier sign reflects temporary induration or piloerection on rubbing the lesions. It is elicited through transient induration with piloerection caused by stroking and is present in many conditions, including Becker nevus and smooth muscle hamartoma.

- **D. Cluster of jewels sign** – Incorrect. T
