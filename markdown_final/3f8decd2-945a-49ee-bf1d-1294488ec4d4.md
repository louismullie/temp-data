## Question

newborn baby very large ear pinna folding over

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a newborn with a very large ear pinna that is folding over. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate physical examination and standardized documentation. Then, I should classify whether this is a deformation versus a malformation. Next, I will build a differential diagnosis and screen for syndromic associations. After that, I need to outline an evaluation plan, especially hearing screening. Then, I should decide on management options based on age and cartilage pliability, including observation versus ear molding, and discuss timing for surgery if needed. Finally, I will cover parent counseling, follow-up, and special considerations such as genetics, imaging indications, health equity, and early detection strategies.

> Let me first confirm the initial clinical assessment elements and documentation. I need to measure auricular length and width against normative expectations for the newborn period, assess degree of folding or lidding, determine ear position and posterior angulation, and check symmetry, while palpating cartilage pliability because that directly informs whether molding will work right now. I should photograph the ears with standardized positioning to allow objective comparison at follow-up, and I should complete a head and neck exam as part of the routine newborn assessment while noting any birth trauma or positional contributors. Wait, I should also verify that I'm not missing scalp or retroauricular bruising that could hint at subgaleal concerns, but here the presentation sounds cosmetic rather than traumatic. I will document all findings carefully for trajectory tracking over the first 6 weeks of life [^113mwJWY] [^116nM1vM] [^1156puXS] [^1178z24Z].

> Next, I need to classify this as a deformation versus a malformation. Hold on, let me verify definitions: deformations have normal skin and cartilage amounts but abnormal shape from extrinsic forces, whereas malformations have intrinsic deficiency or abnormal development of tissue. Given the description of a "very large" pinna with folding over, that often represents lidding or a prominent ear phenotype due to antihelical underfolding rather than true macrotia. In contrast, a constricted ear implies helical rim tissue deficiency and height loss and behaves like a malformation. I should confirm there is no tissue deficit, which would shift management away from simple molding. Let me think about this carefully, because misclassifying a constricted ear as lidding would delay the right plan. On balance, the scenario most likely reflects a deformation, but I need to ensure there is no structural deficiency or cryptotia component on exam [^11684AS7] [^116doGbB] [^11246no7].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis. The leading consideration is a lidding deformity of the upper helix due to positional pressure, with the alternative of a prominent or protruding ear if antihelical flattening and conchal depth make the ear appear larger and folded. But wait, I should also consider Stahl's ear if there is a third crus or abnormal superior helix shape, and cryptotia if the superior pole is tucked under the scalp skin. I need to check for syndromic features because low-set or posteriorly angulated ears with facial dysmorphism or other anomalies could point toward Noonan syndrome or CHARGE, and unilateral microtia or ear tags with mandibulofacial asymmetry would raise concern for OAVS. The key decision point is whether this is isolated versus part of a multisystem pattern, which will direct genetic workup and subspecialty referral [^113Az51m] [^114sKzeN] [^113hUimM] [^112HVtnK].

> Let me first confirm the essential evaluation and screening steps. I need to ensure the infant completes a universal newborn hearing screen per local program, and if the screen is failed, proceed to diagnostic testing such as ABR with ENT/audiology referral. Hold on, I should verify preauricular tags or pits; if present, the risk of permanent hearing impairment is increased nearly fivefold, mandating close audiologic follow-up. Next, I should screen the rest of the infant for associated anomalies including facial symmetry, ocular findings, cardiac murmurs, vertebral and neck findings, and genital anomalies; if two or more anomalies or a syndromic gestalt are present, I should consider a genetics consult and microarray or targeted panels. Imaging is not routine for simple lidding; I will reserve CT or MRI for suspected malformations, failed hearing screens, or complex anatomy that could alter management [^111vezbR] [^115FaQMr] [^113mQmPS] [^116ESxDi].

> Now, I should decide on management for an isolated lidding deformity in an infant younger than approximately 6 weeks. The cartilage is pliable due to maternal estrogens, so this is the critical window for nonsurgical correction. I can offer observation with close follow-up or initiate ear molding immediately if parents prefer active correction; efficacy is highest when started in the first 1–2 weeks and declines afterward. Devices such as EarWell or Earbuddies have shown high success, with treatment typically ranging 2–4 weeks when begun early. I need to check skin integrity weekly and adjust the device to avoid pressure sores, and I should counsel parents that treatment duration and success are inversely related to age at initiation [^1171Ah4S] [^111KVM3b] [^112HqUKx] [^114wihEy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about spontaneous resolution. At first glance, I might say "90% resolve by about 40 days" based on a small prospective series of lidding, but wait, let me verify broader data. That study was only 10 observed infants with complete resolution, which may overestimate self-correction. Other cohorts report variable spontaneous correction rates around 30–70% overall by 1–12 months, and some reports even suggest most deformities do not self-correct, though evidence quality is low and heterogeneous. I should therefore present a balanced view: many mild lidding cases can improve spontaneously, but prediction is unreliable, and early molding remains reasonable for families prioritizing a predictable cosmetic outcome within the brief window of cartilage pliability [^113Az51m] [^114HZonR] [^1156puXS] [^11246no7].

> For infants older than about 6 weeks, I need to reassess cartilage flexibility and family goals. Let me consider whether molding can still be attempted; some series show meaningful correction beyond 6 weeks but with longer duration and lower success, which I should explain transparently to parents. If the cartilage becomes rigid or if a malformation persists, surgical options such as otoplasty are generally deferred until around 5–6 years when auricular cartilage can hold sutures reliably and the ear has approached adult size. I should confirm that prominent ear and residual lidding can be addressed with cartilage-sparing or cartilage-cutting techniques, tailored to the deformity pattern and surgeon expertise [^111KVM3b] [^112HqUKx] [^116ypMQr] [^116doGbB].

> Next, I should review parent counseling in a structured way. Let me explain natural history versus the time-sensitive window for nonsurgical correction, the typical duration and maintenance of molding, and the possibility of skin irritation, which is usually mild and manageable with temporary device removal and protective measures. I need to ensure they understand that early molding can reduce the likelihood of later surgery and potential psychosocial impacts from ear shape differences, though evidence quality varies. Cost and access issues should be discussed openly, including that some devices may not be covered and that domestic or simplified systems can be effective in experienced hands [^113wvqY1] [^11246no7] [^11684AS7] [^113hhxMN].

> I will now outline follow-up and longer-term care. If observing, I should recheck at about 2 weeks and again near 6 weeks with standardized photos to document any change and to catch the last window for molding. If molding is chosen, I will arrange weekly adjustments and skin checks until stable correction is achieved, typically in 2–5 weeks depending on age at initiation, then monitor at 1 and 3 months post-completion. I should confirm hearing follow-up per local protocols if the newborn screen was failed or risk factors are present, and I will remain attentive to evolving psychosocial concerns as the child approaches school age [^113t9F5W] [^111vezbR] [^11246no7].

> Let me consider genetics and subtle inner ear associations that might change management. Most isolated lidding or prominent ear presentations are deformations without a syndromic basis, but I should keep in mind that variation in external ear morphology can be influenced by common variants in EDAR and TBX15, while duplications in an enhancer cluster near HMX1 have been causally linked to constricted ears. If there are atypical features, tissue deficiency, asymmetry with other anomalies, or a family pattern, a genetics referral is prudent. Imaging of the temporal bone is not indicated for simple lidding but may be necessary if hearing loss is confirmed or inner ear malformation is suspected on audiology or exam [^1122ycWZ] [^115aGZ3c] [^111ytrMM] [^116x9d9K].

> But wait, what about health equity and early detection logistics. Access and insurance coverage can limit the timely use of ear molding systems, and families may face out-of-pocket costs that delay care beyond the optimal window. I should offer pragmatic solutions, including rapid referral pathways, consideration of lower-cost or domestically produced systems where appropriate, and even emerging AI-assisted identification tools that may help non-experts and families recognize deformities early, though such tools require further validation before routine clinical adoption [^11684AS7] [^113hhxMN] [^117WDaiG].

> Let me double-check the final decision pathway to ensure no red flags are missed. First, I confirm an isolated lidding-type deformation without tissue deficiency and complete the newborn hearing screen; if the screen fails or preauricular anomalies exist, I escalate audiology. Second, I counsel today on natural history versus time-sensitive molding, emphasizing that initiating within 1–2 weeks maximizes success and shortens treatment, but that observation remains reasonable for mild cases with planned reassessment by 6 weeks. Third, if older than 6 weeks, I reassess cartilage pliability and discuss tempered expectations for molding, with surgical options usually deferred until 5–6 years. Throughout, I remain vigilant for syndromic clues necessitating genetics and multidisciplinary care. The key takeaway is that this presentation is most consistent with a benign deformational lidding or prominence pattern with excellent prognosis, but action within days is needed if families desire predictable nonsurgical correction while the cartilage remains estrogen-pliable [^113Az51m] [^1171Ah4S] [^111KVM3b] [^111vezbR].

A newborn with a very large ear pinna folding over most likely has a **benign deformational anomaly** such as prominent ear, cup ear, or lidding, which are common [^1156puXS] and often correctable with early nonsurgical molding [^113Az51m] [^11246no7]. Early molding within 2–3 weeks achieves **> 90% success** [^1171Ah4S] and avoids surgery; after 6 weeks, cartilage stiffens and results decline [^111KVM3b]. If the ear is very large or asymmetric, evaluate for syndromic causes (e.g. Noonan [^114sKzeN], OAVS [^112HVtnK], CHARGE) and arrange genetic testing [^113mQmPS] and audiology [^112WhuWq]. Most isolated deformities do not affect hearing, but persistent anomalies may cause psychosocial distress [^11246no7], so early intervention is recommended [^113Az51m].

---

## Clinical significance and potential complications

- **Hearing impairment**: Most isolated pinna deformities do not cause hearing loss, but associated anomalies (e.g. preauricular pits/tags) increase risk [^115FaQMr] and warrant screening [^112WhuWq].

- **Psychosocial impact**: Persistent deformities can lead to teasing, anxiety, and social difficulties [^11246no7], supporting early correction [^113Az51m].

- **Medical complications**: Large or folded pinnae may predispose to otitis externa or trauma, though risk is generally low.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical examination**: Assess ear size, shape, symmetry, and associated anomalies; document findings [^112jatUt] with standardized descriptors.

- **Audiological assessment**: Perform newborn hearing screening [^112WhuWq] [^111ZDVZD]; if abnormal or risk factors are present, obtain diagnostic ABR.

- **Imaging studies**: Reserve CT/MRI [^116ESxDi] for suspected syndromic or structural anomalies involving middle/inner ear [^116x9d9K] or adjacent structures.

- **Genetic testing**: Consider when syndromic features [^114sKzeN] are present or family history suggests a genetic disorder [^113mQmPS].

---

## Management strategies

### Non-surgical management

Ear molding initiated within 2–3 weeks is **highly effective (> 90%)** [^1171Ah4S] for deformational anomalies, with success declining after 6 weeks as cartilage stiffens. Observation may be reasonable for **mild deformities that may self-correct** [^113Az51m], but prominent or cup ears have low rates of spontaneous resolution and benefit from molding [^114HZonR].

---

### Surgical management

Otoplasty is reserved for **persistent deformities after molding** [^1155USzt] and is typically performed after age 5–6, when cartilage matures. Surgical techniques include **cartilage-sparing, cartilage-cutting, and combined methods** tailored to the specific deformity [^1155USzt] [^116doGbB].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

- **Non-surgical outcomes**: Early molding yields excellent long-term results [^1171Ah4S] with low recurrence and high satisfaction.

- **Surgical outcomes**: Otoplasty provides durable correction but carries risks of hematoma [^116aZTt1], infection, and asymmetry [^1155USzt].

- **Psychosocial outcomes**: Early correction improves self-esteem and reduces psychosocial distress [^11246no7].

---

Parents and caregivers should **initiate molding within the first 2–3 weeks of life** [^112AkqGY] for best results [^1171Ah4S]. During molding, they should watch for skin irritation or device displacement [^114wihEy] and follow provider instructions closely. Providing emotional support and counseling can help address psychosocial concerns. A very large, folded pinna in a newborn is usually a benign deformational anomaly; **early molding** is effective [^113t9F5W] and prevents surgery, while persistent or syndromic cases need further evaluation and targeted management [^113mQmPS].

### Deformations of the ear and their nonsurgical correction [^11246no7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The incidence of congenital ear deformities has been documented to be as high as 58% of all newborns. Unfortunately, the majority of these deformations do not spontaneously self-correct, leaving the child with a permanent deformity that can only be corrected through surgery. With the evolving simplicity of ear molding that can be done in the office, unnecessary surgery, which comes with its own set of complications and higher costs, can be avoided. Early detection and early treatment are key for successful ear molding.

The purpose of this article is to review the types of deformational ear deformities and the most up-to-date literature on ear molding. It aims to increase awareness of this topic and ultimately enhance patient and parental satisfaction with their overall care.

### New insights on Noonan syndrome's clinical phenotype: a single center retrospective study [^114sKzeN]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Noonan syndrome (NS) is one of the most common genetic disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 1,000 to 2,500 newborns. NS is part of the "RASopathies", a group of genetic syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which plays a critical role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. NS is mostly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with variable expression and penetrance. In more than 50% of cases, missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12 are responsible for this condition. Other well-known causative genes include SOS1, RAF1, RIT1, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and LZTR1. LZTR1, for example, has been identified in up to 10% of NS individuals, showing either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance. Knowledge of the NS basis is steadily expanding, and more genes, such as RRAS2, MRAS, SPRED2, and SOS2, have now been included in its genetic spectrum. Nevertheless, approximately 10% of patients tested for NS lack a genetic diagnosis, suggesting that other genes might be involved. In any case, the diagnosis remains clinical and is based on the Van der Burgt criteria.

- **Common clinical features**:
	- Craniofacial dysmorphisms, such as a triangular-shaped face, tall forehead, hypertelorism, ptosis, and low-set, posteriorly angulated ears. NS with PTPN11 mutation is most strongly related to these features.
	- Growth defects. Birth weight and length might be within the normal range for newborns.

### Spontaneous resolution of ear lidding in newborns: A prospective observational cohort study [^113Az51m]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Ear lidding is a cosmetic outer ear shape deformity commonly observed in newborns. Although lidding is considered a benign condition, psychological concerns such as bullying and depression have been observed in older children, supporting correction of the condition. Nonsurgical correction of lidding using molding and splinting techniques has become increasingly popular, achieving successful outcomes in the majority of cases. Spontaneous resolution of the condition has also been reported in the literature; however, there is minimal prospective data available on the natural progression of ear lidding.

In our case series of 11 closely followed newborns, we aimed to characterize the natural progression and resolution of lidding. Ten consecutive newborns participated in the observation plan, and all 10 experienced complete spontaneous resolution of lidding within an average of 40 days. One other newborn's parents self-selected to have molding and splinting treatment. These results suggest that cosmetic treatment for less severe cases of ear lidding may be unnecessary, as they have the potential to resolve on their own.

Future research in this area could include controlled study designs, and more work is needed to identify which infants will require treatment. Our study may provide helpful reassurance to families and physicians that many newborns may see complete resolution of lidding without intervention.

### A prospective study on non-surgical correction of protruding ears: The importance of early treatment [^111KVM3b]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2012). High credibility.

Splinting is an elegant method to correct ear deformities in newborns. However, evidence is lacking on the relation between age, efficacy, and duration of treatment. We prospectively studied these questions on protruding ears in 132 babies.

- **Methods**: A splint in the scaphal hollow was used in combination with tape (Earbuddies®). The treatment continued until the desired shape persisted. Results were judged from photographs, and mastoid-helical distance was measured.

- **Results**: In 132 babies, 209 ears were treated. Twenty-four patients had no follow-up, and 27 stopped therapy due to skin irritation and fixation problems. In the remaining patients, results were good in 28%, fair in 36%, and poor in 36%. Efficacy deteriorates with age, with fair or good results in 66.7% if therapy started before the sixth week. Older children needed to be splinted longer. The anti-helical fold was easier to correct than a deep concha (correction in 69.8% versus 26.8%).

- **Conclusions**: Considering splinting therapy for protruding ears, a reasonable chance of success can only be offered to parents of children up to six weeks of age. It is favorable if the deformity is mainly due to a flat antihelix.

### Prevalence, prenatal diagnosis and clinical features of oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum: a registry-based study in Europe [^112HVtnK]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum is a complex developmental disorder characterized mainly by anomalies of the ear, hemifacial microsomia, epibulbar dermoids, and vertebral anomalies. The etiology is largely unknown, and the epidemiological data are limited and inconsistent.

This study presents the largest population-based epidemiological analysis at the time of writing, using data from a large network of congenital anomalies registries in Europe. The study population included infants diagnosed with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum during the 1990–2009 period from 34 registries active in 16 European countries.

Of the 355 infants diagnosed with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, 95.8% (340/355) were live born, 0.8% (3/355) fetal deaths, 3.4% (12/355) terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly, and 1.5% (5/340) neonatal deaths. In 18.9% of cases, there was prenatal detection of anomalies associated with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum; 69.7% were diagnosed at birth, 3.9% in the first week of life, and 6.1% within one year of life.

- **Microtia, hemifacial microsomia, and ear tags**: Microtia was present in 88.8% of cases, hemifacial microsomia in 49.0%, and ear tags in 44.4%.
- **Atresia/stenosis of external auditory canal, vertebral and eye anomalies**: Atresia/stenosis of the external auditory canal occurred in 25.1% of cases, with diverse vertebral and eye anomalies present in 24.3%.
- **Associated anomalies**: There was a high rate (69.5%) of associated anomalies of other organs/systems, with congenital heart defects being the most common, present in 27.8% of patients.

The prevalence of oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, defined as microtia/ear anomalies and at least one major characteristic anomaly, was 3.8 per 100,000 births.

### A practical, systematic approach to genetic diagnosis in a fetus or neonate with congenital anomalies [^113mQmPS]. NeoReviews (2024). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies significantly contribute to perinatal, neonatal, and infant morbidity and mortality. The causes of these anomalies vary, ranging from teratogen exposure to genetic disorders. A high suspicion for a genetic condition is crucial because a genetic diagnosis carries a risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. Various methods are available for genetic testing, each playing a role in establishing a genetic diagnosis. This review summarizes a practical, systematic approach to diagnosing genetic conditions in a fetus or neonate with congenital anomalies.

### The newborn butterfly project: A shortened treatment protocol for ear molding [^1171Ah4S]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Secondary to circulating maternal estrogens, a baby's ear cartilage is unusually plastic during the first few weeks of life, providing an opportunity to correct ear deformities by molding. If molding is initiated during the first days of life with a more rigid molding system than previously described in the literature, the authors hypothesized that treatment time would be reduced and the correction rate would increase.

- **Methods**: An interdisciplinary team identified and assessed all infants born with ear deformities at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. The authors conducted a prospective, institutional review board-approved study on the first consecutive 100 infants identified. Parents were surveyed initially, immediately after treatment, and at 6 and 12 months.

- **Results**: One hundred fifty-eight ears in 96 patients underwent ear molding using the EarWell Infant Ear Correction System. Eighty-two percent of the children had the device placed in the newborn nursery and 95 percent had it placed before 2 weeks of life. Average treatment time was 14 days, and 96 percent of the deformities were corrected. Complications were limited to mild pressure ulcerations. Ninety-nine percent of parents stated that they would have the procedure repeated.

- **Conclusions**: The molding period can be reduced from 6 to 8 weeks to 2 weeks by initiating molding during the first weeks of life and using a more secure and rigid device. Through an interdisciplinary approach, the authors were able to identify patients and correct the deformity earlier and faster than previously possible.

### Coexistence of coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear anomalies (CHARGE) syndrome and heterotaxy in a newborn with athymia [^113hUimM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

Coexistence of coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear anomalies (CHARGE) syndrome is a disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the CHD7 gene, which is located on chromosome 8q12.2. Patients typically present with ocular coloboma (75%-90%), heart defects (50%-85%), atresia choanae (35%-65%), retardation of growth and development, and ear anomalies (> 90%).

Although CHARGE syndrome has various associated anomalies, there are no previously documented cases of CHARGE syndrome associated with heterotaxy. Heterotaxy is defined as an abnormal configuration of the thoracic and abdominal organs from the normal arrangement that is caused by disrupted left-right axis orientation during early embryonic development.

The diagnosis of heterotaxy is clinically important, as it is often associated with many anomalies, resulting in high morbidity and mortality, including but not limited to congenital heart defects, structural lung abnormalities, intestinal malrotation, liver dysfunction, and immunodeficiency.

The objectives of this case report are to describe a unique presentation of CHARGE syndrome associated with heterotaxy and establish a possible association between two well-known patterns of malformation.

### Subtle malformation of the cochlear apex and genetic abnormalities: Beyond the "thorny" cochlea [^116x9d9K]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

With the routine use of high-resolution heavily T2-weighted sequences to evaluate patients with hearing deficits, new, subtle phenotypes of cochlear malformations are being discovered, and an increasing number of genotype-phenotype correlations are being found through a reverse phenotype approach, which can help guide geneticists. In this brief report, we present subtle malformations of the apical turn of the cochlea related to three genetic mutations, emphasizing the importance of a careful assessment of the cochlear apex.

### Artificial intelligence-based diagnosis in fetal pathology using external ear shapes [^115hSU2D]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Low credibility.

Here, we trained an automatic phenotype assessment tool to recognize syndromic ears in two syndromes in fetuses — CHARGE and Mandibulo-Facial Dysostosis Guion Almeida type (MFDGA) — versus controls.

- **Method**: We trained an automatic model on all profile pictures of children diagnosed with genetically confirmed MFDGA and CHARGE syndromes, and a cohort of control patients, collected from 1981 to 2023 at Necker Hospital in Paris with a visible external ear. The model involved extracting landmarks from photographs of external ears, applying geometric morphometry methods, and performing a classification step using machine learning. The model was then tested on photographs of two groups of fetuses: controls and fetuses with CHARGE and MFDGA syndromes.

- **Results**: The training set contained a total of 1,489 ear photographs from 526 children. The validation set contained a total of 51 ear photographs from 51 fetuses. The overall accuracy was 72.6% (58.3%-84.1%, p < 0.001), with accuracies of 76.4%, 74.9%, and 86.2% for CHARGE, control, and MFDGA fetuses, respectively. The area under the curves were 86.8%, 87.5%, and 90.3% for CHARGE, controls, and MFDGA fetuses, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: We report the first automatic fetal ear phenotyping model, demonstrating satisfactory classification performances. Further validations are required before using this approach as a diagnostic tool.

### The developmental origin of the auricula revisited [^113U9qPc]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS), alternately known as craniofacial microsomia or Goldenhar syndrome, frequently exhibit microtia together with facial asymmetry (hemifacial microsomia). Often, this is accompanied by cervical vertebral anomalies, although they can also have a wider range of defects. Some authors suggest microtia to be the mildest expression of OAVS. Microtia is a broad term that encapsulates a diverse array of abnormal appearances of the auricle and is one of the most common external ear abnormalities. Microtia can range from grade I, defined as the presence of all the normal ear components and the median longitudinal length more than 2 standard deviations below the mean, to grade III, defined as the presence of some auricular structures, but none of these structures conform to recognized ear components.

Patients with OAVS can present with grade III microtia, normal facial nerve function, and mandibular hypoplasia. One can argue that the clinical manifestations of OAVS are in contradiction with our research when regarding OAVS as a PA1 syndrome. However, multiple researchers have considered the OAVS as a PA1 and PA2 syndrome. The clinical findings in OAVS are therefore in agreement with recent findings.

### A simplified nonsurgical method for the correction of neonatal deformational auricular anomalies [^113wvqY1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the reported success of early nonsurgical splinting of congenital ear deformities, the technique has not been widely utilized due to the difficulty with application and positional maintenance of these devices. Delay in treatment can result in unnecessary surgery for the child later in life. In response to this need, we developed a simplified system consisting of Velcro, conformers, and polysiloxane gel that can be applied in three steps. Before and after photos following the application of the device were graded by a plastic surgeon independent of the study. A total of 33 ear deformities were treated. In all, 92.3% of ears achieved significant improvement and normalization after therapy. This device allows for a more straightforward and individualized application than products currently available. Our hope is that practitioners involved early in the infant's care will utilize this technology, resulting in improved outcomes and avoiding unnecessary surgery.

### Newborn hearing screening programme in Belgium: A consensus recommendation on risk factors [^112WhuWq]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

It is important to note that the studies retrieved through the literature review were mostly observational, and thus started at a 'low' level of evidence quality. Nonetheless, the GRADE system is flexible, as the quality of evidence can be rated on the basis of methodological criteria. Indeed, we uprated the quality of evidence for some risk factors even though the studies were exclusively observational. However, rating the quality of evidence involves making a judgment to choose the best classification, whereas quality generally appears to be distributed in a continuum. This arbitrariness implies subjectivity. The transparency of the process and the detailed summary of findings and arguments that arose when rating the levels of evidence helped reduce this subjectivity. With the aim of transparency, we mentioned the arguments for the levels of evidence quality (see Additional file 1: Table S1).

The GRADE system is usually used in the clinical management of therapies but can also be used in all healthcare management decision-making. Our research objective did not focus on therapy or diagnostic tests. However, the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre used the GRADE system to identify risk factors for a breast screening programme, which bolsters our confidence in the application of the GRADE system in the present study. Nonetheless, the panel of experts was not always comfortable with the application of the GRADE system. They were all clinicians, and the conflict between the evidence-based (i.e. epidemiological) approach and their clinical experience (i.e. individual approach) was palpable.

### Ear bruising in a newborn [^1178z24Z]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Subgaleal hemorrhages are a rare complication of birth that can have severe sequelae. Differentiating them from other birth-related extracranial trauma can be difficult but is important for further management and monitoring. Retro-auricular bruising is a rare physical examination finding in infants with subgaleal hemorrhages due to the expansive subgaleal space. Regardless, an infant with ear bruising should prompt consideration of further evaluation for child abuse.

### Ear malformations: What do radiologists need to know [^116ESxDi]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Ear malformations represent 50% of ear, nose, and throat malformations. These malformations can cause conductive hearing loss (CHL) and/or sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), resulting in significant childhood disability worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment are mandatory to enhance language and speech development. Understanding the embryology of the ear is crucial as it explains the outcome of ototoxic prenatal insult according to the affected gestational age and the incidence of association among inner, middle, and external ear malformations.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of the temporal bone are used in the evaluation of ear malformations. This review article discusses the spectrum of ear malformations in detail, with insights into ear embryology, ear radiological anatomy, and radiological determinant factors influencing the operative reconstruction of ear anomalies.

### Audiologic changes after pinna augmentation [^112z4sWm]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2016). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, no studies have objectively assessed whether pinna morphology affects sound intensity detected within the external auditory canal (EAC). Commonly performed procedures on the EAC are carried out for acquired and congenital pathology, together with the correction of ear deformities. Our aim was to use an experimental model to identify whether a relationship exists between pinna shape and its subsequent effect on the hearing subject.

An anatomically accurate and life-size model made of rubber composite was used for this study. Serial sections (small wedge, defect open; small wedge, defect closed; large wedge, defect open; large wedge, defect closed [equivalent to a protruding ear]; and pinnectomy) were undertaken, and the sound intensity changes assessed at the junction between the EAC and middle ear (tympanic membrane position) using an AURICAL Plus (Otometrics; Taastrup, Denmark) sound processor. A statistically significant loss was demonstrated for wedge-excised models, which was greatest at 180° azimuth. This loss was significantly reduced when the wedge defects were closed. A statistically significant improvement was demonstrated in the protruding ("bat") ear model compared with the normal ear at 0° azimuth. In this model, gain in sound intensity is adversely affected by pinna wedge resection.

Because this change may be increased in those with protruding ears, this factor is important to consider for all cosmetic and non-cosmetic operations to the pinna. This finding supports the notion that the pinna is not a simple funnel.

### The advantages of domestic ear molding system in molding bilateral neonatal congenital auricular deformities [^11684AS7]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Congenital auricular anomalies can be classified into malformations and deformities. Malformations are usually characterized as undeveloped pinnae with missing or misshapen extra skin or cartilage. Deformities are characterized by an abnormal ear shape without deficiencies in skin or cartilage of the pinna. These anomalies may have a lasting psychosocial impact due to teasing during childhood. Generally, malformations require surgery, while most deformities can be corrected via ear molding early in life.

There is no consensus on the exact incidence of congenital auricular deformities (CAD), which varies racially from 6 to 57%. A Canadian study followed infants with CAD whose parents refused ear molding therapy and reported that 67% did not correct spontaneously. Currently, ear molding with an external device is the safest and most effective nonsurgical therapy for newborns with CAD. With a favorable prognosis and fewer complications, ear molding provides the opportunity to prevent the development of associated psychological distress, avoid trauma, and reduce the cost of later surgical otoplasty.

- **Ear molding devices**: There are different types of ear molding devices on the market, mainly represented by the EarWell correction system, which was first introduced to China in 2015. Recently, some domestic ear molding systems for correcting CAD have been developed in China and are cheaper than the EarWell device. It is worth noting that neither the EarWell nor domestic ear molding system can be covered by any medical insurance in China.

### A newborn with three cochlear turns: Case report and literature review [^113J7nPk]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

The human cochlea is most commonly considered to have two and a half turns. Although the causes of cochlear hypoplasia are well described, cochlear hyperplasia is a rarer entity that is poorly understood. We describe rare anatomic cochlear malformations identified in a 4-month-old male originally referred for evaluation following a failed newborn hearing screening. The full diagnostic evaluation, imaging findings, treatment, and follow-up are described in detail. Cochleae with three turns are an uncommon malformation that is not included in classification schemes and may represent a distinct type of anomaly not caused by developmental arrest.

### Defining the protruding ear [^112vKvoe]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Although protruding ears are one of the most frequently occurring congenital deformities in the craniofacial area, there is no clear consensus in the literature as to their definition. Our aim was to provide a clear delineation for the definition of prominent ears, deduced from the anthropometry of normal (non-protruding) ears.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study to assess the anatomy of the normal auricle in children using computer-assisted anthropometry in photographs of 102 children aged 5 to 18 years. We compared the anatomy to retrospectively assess photographs of 44 patients who were listed for prominent ear correction.

- **Results**: Our results show that protrusion differs statistically between sexes. In view of these data, an ear could be defined as prominent when the upper protrusion exceeds 21.5 mm or the lower protrusion exceeds 20.0 mm in boys, and the upper protrusion exceeds 17.5 mm or the lower protrusion exceeds 15.5 mm in girls. Using these demarcations, 87.5% of our operated prominent ears would qualify as a prominent ear. In addition, we found that prominent ears have larger auricular lengths and consequently larger surface measurements compared with normal ears (P = 0.001). Up to 19.3% of the normal ears showed an asymmetry of more than 3 mm concerning protrusion.

- **Conclusions**: Protrusion differs significantly between sexes. This indicates that different criteria should be used to judge protrusion in boys and girls. None of our prominent ears exceeded only the demarcation in the lower protrusion, suggesting that upper protrusion plays a larger role in defining prominent ears.

### Auricular malformations are driven by copy number variations in a hierarchical enhancer cluster and a dominant enhancer recapitulates human pathogenesis [^111ytrMM]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

This study examines the genomes of seven human pedigrees, whose members present with constricted ears. All affected individuals showed a duplication of a genomic region termed the BCE locus near the HMX1 gene. We present compelling evidence that the duplication of regulatory elements in the BCE locus erroneously modulates the spatiotemporal expression characteristics of HMX1, leading to the ear developmental abnormality.

The evolutionarily conserved region (ECR) downstream of HMX1 has been implicated in eye and external ear malformations across multiple species and linked to human isolated bilateral concha-type microtia. However, the explicit pathogenic mechanism in BCE patients remained unclear. This uncertainty was due to observations of larger genomic duplications extending beyond the single ECR element in previously reported pedigrees and in our seven newly analyzed pedigrees. We have identified a minimal critical region, the 'BCE core locus', encompassing three distinct cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that this locus is the causative factor for bilateral constricted ear by employing transgenic cell and mouse models.

In many CNV-related developmental abnormalities, distinct cis-regulatory elements are organized as a cluster in the mutation interval. The deletion or duplication of these elements induces morphological variations, stemming from differential gene expression. Our mouse models reveal that the morphology of the pinna is particularly sensitive to changes in HMX1 gene expression due to variation in the copy numbers of enhancer sequences.

### A genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci for variation in human ear morphology [^115aGZ3c]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we have identified the first genetic variants influencing normal variation in human pinna morphology. It will be important to further evaluate the role of these regions in ear development and its disorders. Since pinna morphology in mammals shows extensive evidence of evolutionary adaptation, particularly concerning thermoregulation, acoustic perception, and sound localization, it will be interesting to examine whether variation in these genomic regions relates to adaptive changes in the pinna across species. Finally, there is increasing interest in the use of pinna variation in forensics, and the development of such applications may benefit from a refined knowledge of the genetic determinants of pinna morphology.

### Earfold: A new technique for correction of the shape of the antihelix [^116ypMQr]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Selection of the appropriate technique for correction of prominence depends on many factors. These include the specific wishes of the patient, previous surgical intervention, the specific shape of the pinna, the patient's age, the elasticity of the patient's cartilage (i.e. soft, moderate, or firm), and the surgeon's personal experience and expertise. Each of these factors must be considered before selecting a particular technique. Patient requirements are best considered by placing the patient in front of a mirror and asking them how they wish to look after the correction is performed. Differences in the symmetry of the ears and details such as the prominence of the earlobes should also be noted at this stage. Previous surgical correction of the pinna may limit the options for remedial surgery, depending on whether there is residual prominence, asymmetry, or iatrogenic deformity, as well as the presence and type of complications from any prior procedure.

The age at which treatment is performed is important. It has been shown that early treatment has a positive impact on psychological well-being and development. Moreover, in the first few weeks of life (up to 6 months), nonsurgical molding or splinting techniques can be effective while the cartilage remains pliable. However, after 6 months (and certainly after 5 years), the auricular cartilage becomes increasingly rigid and more resistant to molding. For patients more than 6 months of age, for whom cartilage molding is no longer an option, surgical intervention after the age of 5 or 6 years becomes necessary.

### The international standard set of outcome measures for the assessment of hearing in people with osteogenesis imperfecta [^111vezbR]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

Rules and schedules regarding neonatal hearing screening might vary depending on the country. If children pass the neonatal hearing screening, a follow-up hearing assessment around the age of 3.5 and 5.5 years is recommended. The assessment should ideally be performed before the child starts preschool or primary school. Starting at the age of 3.5 years, ear-specific pure-tone audiometry can be performed reliably. If testers are unable to assess the child using pure-tone (play) audiometry, visual reinforcement audiometry should be performed. In cases of suspected hearing loss or delayed speech and language development, an assessment at an age under 3.5 years is required. For children with confirmed hearing loss, at least annual assessments in a pediatric audiological center are recommended. Audiological assessments may be scheduled more frequently considering the progression of hearing loss in first-degree relatives.

Adults without a hearing loss or with nonprogressive hearing loss are recommended to have an audiological assessment every 5 years. In cases of progressive hearing loss, testing should be conducted at least annually.

- **Genetic testing**: The expert team recommends genetic testing for everyone with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), as genetic factors may influence the occurrence or progression of hearing loss. This will also provide more data required for such research. The outcome of the genetic testing may support better hearing loss management through early recognition of "at-risk" individuals.

- **Follow-up after middle ear surgery**: Audiological assessment is recommended before an individual's condition progresses or after surgical interventions.

### The newborn examination: Part I. Emergencies and common abnormalities involving the skin, head, neck, chest, and respiratory and cardiovascular systems [^113mwJWY]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The routine newborn assessment should include an examination for size, macrocephaly or microcephaly, changes in skin color, signs of birth trauma, malformations, evidence of respiratory distress, level of arousal, posture, tone, presence of spontaneous movements, and symmetry of movements. A newborn with one anatomic malformation should be evaluated for associated anomalies. Total and direct bilirubin levels should be measured in newborns with jaundice, and a complete blood count should be obtained in those with pallor or a ruddy complexion.

Neurosurgical consultation is necessary in infants with craniosynostosis accompanied by restricted brain growth or hydrocephalus, cephaloceles, or exophytic scalp nodules. Neck masses can be identified by their location and include vascular malformations, abnormal lymphatic tissue, teratomas, and dermoid cysts. Most facial nerve palsies resolve spontaneously. Conjunctivitis is relatively common in newborns. Infants with chest abnormalities may need to be evaluated for Poland's syndrome or Turner's syndrome. Murmurs in the immediate newborn period are usually innocent and represent a transition from fetal to neonatal circulation. Because cyanosis is primarily secondary to respiratory or cardiac causes, affected newborns should be evaluated expeditiously with the involvement of a cardiologist or neonatologist.

### Neonatal hairy ear pinnae and gestational diabetes: Just a coincidence [^1138xsrW]. Pediatric dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

A newborn girl of 36 weeks gestation was noted to have several anomalies, including bilateral low ear attachment with ear pinnae hypertrichosis, left preauricular pit, micrognathia, short lingual frenulum, and short neck. Pregnancy history revealed poorly controlled maternal gestational diabetes (GD). Localized hypertrichosis of the ear pinnae may represent a potential marker of GD and thereby alert physicians to suspect other potentially GD-associated conditions such as macrosomia, asphyxia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and congenital anomalies, particularly those involving the central nervous system.

### Earfold: A new technique for correction of the shape of the antihelix [^1155USzt]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past five decades, many surgical techniques have been described for the treatment of the antihelix. No single technique has emerged as the gold standard, and all have potential advantages and drawbacks. However, all the techniques aim to create an aesthetically pleasing, gently curved antihelical fold. By doing so, they may simultaneously reduce the prominence of the ear.

The techniques can be grouped into three categories: those that are cartilage sparing (Figure 2), those that involve cutting and/or sculpting of the cartilage (Figure 3), and those that involve a combination of these approaches. Recently, a first‐in‐class implantable device, Earfold®, has been added to the list of cartilage-sparing methods available to assist with reshaping the antihelix (Figure 2).

- **Cartilage-sparing methods**: These methods create an antihelical fold and reduce ear prominence. The posterior suture method (A) places permanent sutures between the upper scapha and fossa triangularis, and between the lower scapha and the concha. With the Earfold® system (B), a permanent nitinol implant is fixed to the cartilage in the region of the planned antihelix, causing the ear to fold back. The black curved arrow in the center-left illustration indicates the posterior sutures behind the antihelical fold. H-M = helical-mastoid.

- **Cartilage-cutting and sculpting methods**: These methods also aim to create an antihelical fold and reduce ear prominence. (A) The desired outcome is shown. (B) This can be achieved with minimally invasive approaches.

### Expanded newborn screening: Reducing harm, assessing benefit [^115VYum4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Achieving the goals of newborn screening is, as with any screening, a balancing act: obtaining the maximum benefit while minimizing harm. The advent of "expanded" newborn screening, which allows for the detection of a large number of disorders using a single test, has introduced challenges, not new, but now more apparent. One issue is the increased detection of cases, particularly those with attenuated phenotypes who may remain asymptomatic for many years or even a lifetime. These individuals may not require active management in the short term but do need lifelong awareness. Furthermore, some disorders included in screenings are now considered benign or largely so, leading to the risk of unnecessary medicalization of babies.

Assessing outcomes presents difficulties due to the rarity of some disorders and the impracticality of conducting randomized controlled trials. Valid studies require case definitions, comparable comparison groups, and possibly assessment on a population-wide basis. An Australia-wide study of tandem mass spectrometry newborn screening, involving 2 million screened and unscreened babies, demonstrated overall benefits to screened patients at age 6 years. However, the study was too small to provide conclusions for individual disorders beyond medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.

### Neonatal ear molding: Timing and technique [^112AkqGY]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of auricular deformities is believed to be approximately 11.5 per 10,000 births, excluding children with microtia. Although not life-threatening, auricular deformities can cause undue distress for patients and their families. Surgical procedures have traditionally been used to reconstruct congenital auricular deformities. However, ear molding has been gaining acceptance as an effective, noninvasive alternative for the treatment of newborns with ear deformations. We present the successful correction of bilateral Stahl's ear deformity in a newborn through a straightforward, nonsurgical method implemented on the first day of life. The aim of this report is to make pediatric practitioners aware of an effective and simple molding technique appropriate for the correction of congenital auricular anomalies. Additionally, it stresses the importance of very early initiation of ear cartilage molding to achieve the desired outcome.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Turner syndrome, more specifically with respect to otologic surveillance, ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining newborn hearing screening. If the screening is normal, an age-appropriate behavioral audiometric evaluation should be conducted every 2–3 years in childhood and adolescence, starting as soon as the patient is developmentally able (1–2 years of age). For adult patients, evaluations are recommended every 5 years and any time decreased hearing is suspected.

### Treatment of prominent and constricted ear anomalies [^116doGbB]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Although the physiologic effects of ear deformity are negligible, the aesthetic and psychological impact on the patient can be profound. Significant ear malformations are prevalent in today's society and affect more than 5 percent of the population. While the prominent ear results from either underdevelopment of the antihelix or an enlarged conchal bowl, the constricted ear is a product of helical down-folding and height deficiency. After a thorough evaluation, surgical management of the prominent ear must be approached in a careful, rational fashion. Although the surgeon may enjoy the wide latitude that hundreds of corrective techniques offer, they must always proceed with an algorithmic application of the technique best suited to the specific auricular deformity. By using this approach, correction of the prominent ear can go beyond patient satisfaction to predictably maximize outcomes in both form and symmetry. From the clinical evaluation and anatomical basis to surgical management of the deformed ear, the true art of otoplasty lies in the surgeon's ability to thoroughly understand auricular structure and appropriately apply technique for maximal aesthetic outcome.

### Surgical management of polyotia [^1111VwB8]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Polyotia is an extremely rare type of congenital external ear malformation, which is defined as an accessory ear that is large enough to resemble an additional pinna. The terms 'mirror ear' or 'accessory ear' are sometimes used. We present our methods in correcting this malformation and summarize the etiology.

- **Methods**: The posterior part of the polyotia may present with a normal ear, a constricted ear, or a microtic ear. Free auricular composite tissue transplantation was used to correct the constricted ear. Ear reconstruction was applied in cases of microtia. The anterior auricle was mainly used to form the tragus.

- **Results**: Seven cases of polyotia were treated between 2004 and 2008. After free auricular composite tissue transplantation, the size of the constricted ear and the contralateral ear was similar. In microtia cases, the reconstructed ears were natural-looking and had a satisfactory three-dimensional contour. The extra tissue of the anterior ear was excised and the tragus was reconstructed.

- **Conclusions**: Through operative intervention tailored to the individual case, natural-looking and symmetric ears were acquired. The etiology of polyotia probably relates to abnormal migration of neural crest cells.

### Congenital aural atresia reconstruction: A surgical procedure with a long history [^113wBwbt]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Pinna deformities, combined with congenital aural atresia, have been a matter of serious debate in the literature as they are associated with major aesthetic and functional problems that are difficult to manage. These problems have been described as early as 2000 BC. The aim of the present article is to approach the whole problem as one (pinna malformation and aural atresia) and present the history as well as the approaches in reconstruction.

- **Methods**: Extensive literature search and medical history books were used as scientific sources.

- **Results**: For many centuries, the prevalent view was that any surgical attempts to reconstruct the pinna and the ear canal were of little value. In addition, the aesthetic result of these early surgical procedures was mostly unacceptable. Over time, new surgical techniques and synthetic materials were used, leading to satisfactory and lasting aesthetic and functional results in selected patients, improving their quality of life, while reducing the complication rate. However, many cases are still challenging for plastic surgeons and ENT surgeons alike.

- **Conclusions**: Despite significant progress in the field, surgery for pinna deformities combined with congenital aural atresia still remains one of the most challenging and risky procedures. Accurate audiological evaluation of newborns as well as assessment of their craniofacial development is necessary and can help plastic surgeons and otologists choose proper candidates for surgical repair and a suitable and age-appropriate therapeutic plan.

### A morphometric study of the newborn ear and an analysis of factors related to congenital auricular deformities [^1156puXS]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of neonatal ear deformities varies widely in the literature, and the incidence of those that correct spontaneously is largely unknown. To address these questions, the authors analyzed the auricles of 1500 newborns from the Pearl River Delta within the first 7 days of life and again at 30 days of age.

- **Methods**: Using a combination of direct measurement and digital image measurement, the authors measured physiognomic ear length, physiognomic ear breadth, morphologic ear length, vertical distance between head and ear, and auriculocephalic angle of the newborns. The first measurement was within 1 week of birth, whereas the second measurement was performed for the same newborns 1 month after birth.

- **Results**: Among 1500 newborns, 862 had various forms of auricular deformities. The incidence of neonatal auricular deformity in the Pearl River Delta area was 57.46 percent, and the self-healing rate was 31.55 percent by the 30-day follow-up. Seven factors were found to be statistically significant: mother's delivery situation, mother's hepatitis history, abnormal pregnancy, abnormal labor, cephalopelvic disproportion, premature rupture of membranes, and neonatal weight. Birth by cesarean delivery and mother with no abnormal pregnancy or no history of hepatitis were protective factors against the newborn's auricular deformity.

- **Conclusions**: Newborns have a high incidence of auricular deformities, and different types of auricular deformities have distinct incidences. Auricular deformities are caused by the interactions of a number of factors.

### The Liberfarb syndrome, a multisystem disorder affecting eye, ear, bone, and brain development, is caused by a founder pathogenic variant in the PISD gene [^112Q4enC]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The five patients shared a similar clinical pattern. One component was a progressive disease of bone and connective tissue. At birth, there was no scoliosis and no overt joint dislocations. During childhood, the combination of epiphyseal dysplasia and joint laxity resulted in luxation of the femoral head and, more significantly, in progressive, severe spinal deformation with lumbar hyperlordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and variable degrees of scoliosis (Fig. 2). Joint laxity at the knee joint resulted in severe genua valga. Luxation of the radial head also developed in the first decade. Essential radiographic features included delayed vertebral ossification (but no platyspondyly), markedly delayed ossification of all epiphyses contributing to joint instability and retarded bone age, and fine metaphyseal striations observed in childhood x-rays, especially at the knees (Fig. 2f–k).

The formal classification is that of a spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with predominantly epiphyseal involvement; however, as confirmed by the follow-up of patient 5, severe joint instability with joint dislocations and progressive severe spinal deformation were clinically more significant than the skeletal dysplasia.

The second cardinal feature in affected individuals was retinal degeneration. This became clinically apparent in childhood. Detailed ophthalmological evaluation was available for patients 1, 2, and 5 (the findings in patient 5 were published in 1986). Patients 3 and 4 had optic atrophy on MRI. The fundus findings were pale optic disks, RPE mottling, and a severely reduced caliber of the retinal vessels.

### Congenital aural atresia [^115ABWhD]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Congenital aural atresia is a spectrum of ear deformities present at birth that involves some degree of failure in the development of the external auditory canal. This malformation may be associated with other congenital anomalies. It occurs as a result of abnormal development of the first and second branchial arches and the first branchial cleft and most often occurs sporadically, although the disease may manifest in different syndromes. Congenital aural atresia is considered one of the most difficult and challenging surgeries for the otologic surgeon.

The goals of atresia surgery are to restore functional hearing, preferably without the requirement of a hearing aid, and to reconstruct a patent, infection-free external auditory canal. Repair is usually conducted at the age of 6 years, so children with bilateral atresia may need hearing amplification in the first few weeks of life until the age of surgery.

- **Preparation**: To optimize the surgical outcome, careful audiological and radiological evaluation of the patient should be performed preoperatively.

- **Follow-up care**: Postoperative frequent packing and regular follow-up are mandatory to avoid restenosis and infection of the newly created canal. With careful intraoperative dissection and regular follow-up, complications of surgery can be avoided.

### A longitudinal study of changes of congenital auricular deformity regarding self-correction [^114HZonR]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with congenital auricular deformities and evaluate the long-term frequency of their self-correction. Ninety newborns were enrolled in the study, and data were collected within 2 weeks after birth and at 1 year. The shape of the auricle was classified into seven categories using a digital image.

At 2 weeks after birth, several birth-related factors were evaluated in both the auricular deformity and normal groups. At 1 year after birth, the images of auricles were compared with the images taken at birth, and the changes in auricle shape were investigated. Congenital auricular deformities were observed in 139 out of 180 ears. The major type noted was helix rim deformity (47 ears), followed by normal ears (41 ears), and cup ears (33 ears). Male sex was found to have a statistically significant association with the occurrence of auricular deformity.

In the longitudinal study, among 43 neonates (86 ears) followed up 12 months later, the self-correction rate was approximately 50%. The normal auricle and prominent ear increased, while helix rim deformity and cup ear decreased significantly. The prognosis of deformity varied depending on the type of deformity. Considering the low self-correction rate in prominent and cup ears, newborns with these deformities might be recommended to undergo management such as the auricle molding technique, as required.

### Orthopaedic conditions in the newborn [^114oG6eG]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Consultations on neonates can be unfamiliar territory for many orthopaedic surgeons. Just as children are not simply little adults, newborns are not just little children; they have unique physiology affecting the presentation of their orthopaedic concerns. A careful physical examination, with an appropriate understanding of neonatal development, is essential for making the proper diagnosis.

A flail extremity in the newborn is most commonly attributed to fracture or brachial plexus palsy. However, infection must also be considered and ruled out to prevent long-term morbidity. Metatarsus adductus is the most common foot abnormality, but clubfoot, calcaneovalgus deformity, and congenital vertical talus may also be encountered.

Joint contractures that spontaneously improve are normal in the newborn. Nonetheless, it is important to identify and institute proper treatment for early developmental dysplasia of the hip, congenital knee dislocation, and torticollis. Clavicular pseudarthrosis and periosteal reactions may be discovered on radiographic examination. A basic understanding of these conditions will aid the orthopaedist in the initial diagnosis and management of orthopaedic issues in the newborn.

### A genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci for variation in human ear morphology [^114uR9Kr]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

SNPs in this region show a genome-wide association with antihelix folding and antitragus size. This region extends over approximately 800 kb and overlaps the gene encoding transcription factor TBX15, a key regulator of cartilaginous and skeletal development in the mouse. A spontaneous Tbx15 mouse mutant, called 'droopy ears', is characterized by altered positioning, projection, and shape of the pinnae. In humans, mutations of TBX15 result in Cousin syndrome, a disorder characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism, including a dysplastic pinna. The strongest association in this region was observed for intergenic SNP rs17023457 (P value 2 × 10⁻⁸ for antitragus size and 1 × 10⁻¹¹ for antihelix folding). Conditioning on this SNP abolishes the signal of association at other markers. Interestingly, rs17023457 is located in a highly conserved binding site for transcription factor CART1 (cartilage paired-class homeoprotein 1), mutations of which have been shown to result in a range of craniofacial and cartilage abnormalities in the mouse. The location of rs17023457 in a CART1-binding site strongly suggests that this SNP could directly influence the expression of neighboring genes involved in cartilaginous development, such as TBX15.

The need for artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing auricular deformities arises from several factors: the high prevalence of these conditions, the limited time window for non-surgical treatment, the shortage of medical resources, and the desire to optimize both physical appearance and mental health outcomes. Although approximately 30% of these congenital deformities can resolve spontaneously, it remains impossible to predict which cases will self-correct without intervention and which will not. Given the narrow time window available for effective ear molding, clinical guidelines generally follow the principle of "early diagnosis, early treatment".

However, auricular deformity falls under a specialized niche within otology, and most otologists do not focus on this area. Similarly, in neonatology, diagnosing auricular deformities is only one of many prenatal assessments, and most practitioners lack systematic training in this specific field. In regions with limited healthcare resources, providing additional training for doctors may be impractical due to financial constraints. Thus, implementing a deep learning model offers an efficient and cost-effective solution.

Moreover, auricular deformity diagnosis is highly subjective, lacking objective metrics for evaluating auricular morphology, leading to frequent discrepancies even among experienced experts (as shown in Supplemental Fig. S1). A well-trained AI model, however, could potentially synthesize expert opinions, providing an accurate, reliable, and reproducible objective standard.

### A genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci for variation in human ear morphology [^1122ycWZ]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

Here, we report a genome-wide association study for non-pathological pinna morphology in over 5,000 Latin Americans. We find genome-wide significant association at seven genomic regions affecting lobe size and attachment, folding of antihelix, helix rolling, ear protrusion, and antitragus size (linear regression P values 2 × 10⁻⁸ to 3 × 10⁻¹⁴). Four traits are associated with a functional variant in the Ectodysplasin A Receptor (EDAR) gene, a key regulator of embryonic skin appendage development. We confirm expression of Edar in the developing mouse ear and note that Edar-deficient mice have an abnormally shaped pinna.

Two traits are associated with SNPs in a region overlapping the T-Box Protein 15 (TBX15) gene, a major determinant of mouse skeletal development. The strongest association in this region is observed for SNP rs17023457, located in an evolutionarily conserved binding site for the transcription factor Cartilage Paired-Class Homeoprotein 1 (CART1), and we confirm that rs17023457 alters in vitro binding of CART1.

### A study on the nonsurgical correction treatment age window and long-term follow-up of infants with congenital ear anomalies in China [^112dTBEY]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that in cases where infants exceed the optimal treatment period, various factors may contribute to extended treatment durations and less successful outcomes. As the ear cartilage gradually becomes harder and resistance against the appliance increases, there is an accompanying increase in skin erosion. In this case, the treatment can be temporarily suspended until the skin condition of the ear improves; this is likely to occur repeatedly. With prolonged treatment duration and unpredictable outcomes, many parents choose to discontinue treatment. As the infant gets older, there are more opportunities for them to grasp the appliance with their hands or engage in outdoor activities. This may lead to sweat-soaked tape, which can cause the appliance to detach before the scheduled review. This poses significant challenges for caregivers.

Concerns about complications can deter parents from opting for ear molding. **Mild complications**: In our practice, these were limited to skin conditions in 3% of infants, which required the application of antibiotic ointment or suspending treatment for 2 to 3 days. Only one patient discontinued treatment in our study. Over the course of the study, we found that most pressure sores occurred in the ear helix, where the retractor and the posterior conformer applied force against each other, and in the Conchal cavity, where the Conchal former directly contacted the skin. In many cases, this could be avoided by wrapping the retractors in hypoallergenic double-sided adhesive tapes and placing a small amount of cotton on them.

### A unique anomaly of the ear: Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum or an isolated disruption [^113ZKCFf]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

We present a rare case of a neonate with an isolated congenital condition affecting the right ear. This condition involves the outer ear, middle ear, eustachian tube, and facial nerve, with an external opening into the skull that connects to the oropharynx. Considering the unusual nature of the exterior lesion and its communication with the oropharynx, we believe this condition to be the first of its kind resulting from a vascular disruption.

### The advantages of domestic ear molding system in molding bilateral neonatal congenital auricular deformities [^113hhxMN]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

The cup ear is characterized by the auricle leaning forward, resembling a cup with an opening on the top when observed in the decubitus position. Meanwhile, the auricular rim is constricted, crimped, and adherent, with the length of the auricle becoming shorter. The triangular fossa becomes narrower but does not disappear. In this study, a total of 3 cases (6 ears) of cup ears were corrected with excellent outcomes (Fig. 6).

- **Figure 6**: A 4-day-old girl with bilateral cup ear - preoperative (A right, B left); components in place (C); correction in place (D); postoperative with favorable outcome after 47 days (E right, F left).

Complications were few and mild in all cases. In our study, most infants only presented with periauricular redness and lesions immediately when the ear molding devices were removed, caused by local traction and friction. Individually, we trained the parents to remove the correction one day in advance to allow the lesion to heal without delayed treatment. There were no complications such as eczema, pressure ulcers, or exposed cartilage in our cases.

### An introduction to standardized clinical nomenclature for dysmorphic features: the elements of morphology project [^112jatUt]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Human structural malformations (anomalies, or birth defects) exhibit a broad and complex range of manifestations and severities. Describing these findings can be challenging because the variation of features is continuous, and only some can be objectively assessed (that is, measured). Different specialties, such as embryologists, developmental biologists, surgeons, and clinical geneticists, have developed descriptors for these findings based on mechanistic, etiologic, or management considerations. These descriptors are laden with meaning, which can be invalidated by changing knowledge. Some terms have disparate definitions even within a specialty. Furthermore, a number of terms previously in common clinical use were disparaging (e.g. mongoloid slant, arachnodactyly, devil ear) and needed to be replaced with more neutral terms.

### Efficacy and timing of neonatal ear correction molding [^112HqUKx]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Given the incidence of congenital auricular anomalies varies racially, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy and timing of ear correction molding in infants with auricular anomalies.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 141 auricular anomalies in 100 infants less than 4 months of age were treated using the Earlimn molding system. Treatment outcomes were graded into three categories in terms of auricular morphology. The efficacy and outcomes of modeling were evaluated in infants according to age and anomaly type.

- **Results**: The mean age at which correction was initiated was 35.13 days of life, and the average treatment duration was 17.81 days. Of all anomalies, 86% were corrected. Both deformations and certain malformations were satisfactorily corrected. The outcomes of children with conchal crura and mixed anomalies were relatively poor. Although no differences in treatment efficiency were evident among the three age groups, infants younger than 6 weeks old showed the best results. The only complications were mild skin ulcers.

- **Conclusions**: Ear correction molding is remarkably effective for infants with auricular deformations and malformations. Molding efficacy depends on the type of anomaly. Initiation of molding at less than 6 weeks of age is essential to minimize treatment duration.

### Rapidly declining unilateral hearing within 1 month in a newborn with internal auditory canal stenosis and facial palsy [^112bFHgg]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Most newborns with congenital unilateral facial palsy are expected to recover; however, when a patient has hearing loss, underlying developmental ear structure abnormalities should be investigated, particularly when the patient has internal auditory canal stenosis, which is rarely reported in newborns. All cases of internal auditory canal stenosis are accompanied by concomitant unilateral or bilateral hearing loss, but none with progressive hearing loss has been reported. We present the case of a newborn with rapidly declining hearing in the left ear within 1 month after birth. The hearing decline was associated with unilateral facial palsy. Using high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone, we diagnosed the patient with congenital internal auditory canal stenosis. This is the first case detected with progressive hearing loss after birth, which implies that prompt diagnosis and early habilitation are warranted, even when the hearing loss is initially mild.

### Molding the ears after anterior scoring and concha repositioning: A combined approach for protruding ear correction [^116aZTt1]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The goal of otoplasty for correction of prominent ears is the normalization of shape and position of both pinnas with a certain symmetry. Recreating the antihelical fold and lowering the auriculocephalic angle are the basic processes for achieving a normal-looking ear. Various methods have been described to recreate the antihelical fold. In addition to anterior scoring or abrasion, many involve the placement of permanent or absorbable sutures to reform the cartilage to the proper shape to correct the deformity.

In this study, the use of a custom-made silicone mold was described after anterior scoring to recreate the antihelical fold, without using any suture material. Silicone molds provide good shaping of the antihelical fold, scapha, and helical rim while the tissue is healing. Fourteen patients underwent bilateral otoplasty for prominent ears in our clinic over a four-year period. The antihelical fold was created by anterior scoring, and the concha-mastoid angle was lowered and sutured. After completing the surgical procedure for both ears, custom-made silicone molds were worn by the patients for the first two weeks to maintain proper position. During the third week, the patient wore the mold for half a day. A head dressing was used for two days, and the ears were subsequently supported using a headband.

Follow-up ranged from fourteen months to four years. One patient developed a postoperative hematoma in one ear that resorbed spontaneously. Patient satisfaction with the procedure was generally high. Using a shape mold following a combination of anterior scoring and concha repositioning gives predictable results.

### Development of the ear and hearing [^113NZ9kM]. Journal of Perinatology (2000). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the development of the peripheral auditory system, especially the middle ear and inner ear (cochlea), contributes to meaningful interpretation of audiologic measures in infants, including newborn screening outcomes. An understanding of the effects of noise on the neonatal auditory system and hearing function is also dependent on maturational factors. This paper provides a brief overview of principles and trends in the development of the middle and inner ear. The emphasis is on the maturation of human peripheral auditory system structure and function, although reference is also made to animal research.

### Microtia, branchial cleft fistula, and tetralogy of Fallot: a possible association [^114xjKXp]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the external ear are common birth defects, with an incidence of approximately 6% to 8% in newborns. These anomalies can present as isolated defects or in conjunction with other abnormalities. Microtia, a specific type of congenital malformation, arises from the disrupted development of the first sulcus and the first and second arches during the embryonic stage. It encompasses a range of phenotypic deformities of the outer ear. The incidence of microtia varies, ranging from 0.83 to 17.4 cases per 10,000 newborns, and it more commonly affects the right side and is more prevalent in males. Often associated with hearing loss and mandibular and facial soft tissue dysplasia, microtia frequently co-occurs with hemifacial microsomia, a significantly related diagnosis.

Branchial cleft anomalies are the second most frequent congenital condition encountered in pediatric otolaryngology, accounting for about 20% of neck and head lesions. The prevailing theory suggests that these anomalies are residual formations from the abnormal development of the embryonic branchial (or gill) apparatus. Five types of anomalies have been classified based on the six branchial arches, noting that the fifth type does not exist. Among these arches, anomalies related to the second arch are the most common, comprising 95% of cases, followed by anomalies of the first arch, which account for 1% to 4%. These anomalies typically present as cysts, sinuses, and fistulae, which are relatively rare occurrences. A common symptom associated with these anomalies is mucoid discharge in the anterior neck region.

### One-year outcomes of ear molding for infants with constricted ear [^114eKDVq]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Neonatal auricular anomalies are a significant pediatric public health issue, with the reported incidence of congenital auricular anomalies ranging from approximately 6.0% to 57.5%. Although ear deformities are not life-threatening, even minor ear deformities can result in psychological distress, social avoidance, and behavioral problems.

Ear anomalies are categorized into two primary groups: deformations and malformations. Malformations are characterized by a partial absence of the skin or cartilage, leading to a constricted or underdeveloped pinna. In contrast, deformations are characterized by a misshaped but fully developed pinna. The constricted ear is considered a major type of ear malformation and significantly impacts the aesthetic appearance of the auricle. The term "constricted ear" was first introduced by Tanzer in 1975 and refers to various degrees of helical and antihelical constriction, shortened auricular longitudinal axis, flattened or absent superior crus, decreased or obliterated scapha, and prominence.

### The developmental origin of the auricula revisited [^113BAopp]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Low credibility.

To gain an overview of the available literature concerning the theories on the developmental origin of the auricle, we performed queries in PubMed and reviewed 69 case reports, case series, laboratory research, and literature reviews from 1844 to 2018, including theories about the embryology of the auricle, congenital auricular anomalies, and pharyngeal arch anomalies. References of the included papers were reviewed; five additional case reports and literature reviews were included. We reviewed the knowledge about the embryology of the auricle and congenital auricular anomalies as written in embryological textbooks over the last 150 years.

### The normal newborn exam, or is it [^115ugJAW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Despite the broad technological advancements in medicine, screening for illness in infants is highly reliant on a complete physical exam. For this reason, it is critical that the examining physician not only has a thorough understanding of abnormal findings but also recognizes normal findings and their variants. The vast majority of infants are healthy, and findings predictive of future health problems are subtle and infrequent, yet outcomes can be devastating. Therefore, it is critical the physician remains diligent when screening for these issues. It is our hope that this article will assist you in this task and allow for more accurate and timely diagnoses that prevent or minimize long-term health problems in children.

### Efficacy of ear molding in infants using the EarWell Infant Correction System and factors affecting outcome [^114wihEy]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

One-third of infants have ear anomalies, and less than one-third self-correct. Correction of ear deformities by molding exploits the plasticity of the auricular cartilage because of circulating maternal estrogen during infancy. In this study, the authors assess the efficacy of the EarWell Infant Correction System in the correction of ear deformities, and determine the factors that affect its outcome.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a single-center prospective study over a 3-year period. Consecutive full-term infants who underwent ear molding with the EarWell system were recruited. The primary outcome was the successful correction of ear anomalies. Secondary outcomes included complications and maintenance of ear shape. Factors identified included the type of anomaly, age at application, duration of application, and breastfeeding.

- **Results**: Sixty-seven patients with a total of 105 ears were recruited. The anomalies were classified into deformations (66.7 percent) and malformations (33.3 percent). The median age group at presentation was 0 to 7 days (67 percent). The average duration of application was 4.1 weeks. Successful correction was achieved in 86 percent of patients. Ear deformations achieved a significantly higher rate of successful outcomes (98 percent) compared with malformations (64 percent) (p < 0.001). Skin complications were common (46 percent) and attributed to our tropical climate. Patients with complications were of a higher mean age (22.1 days) compared with patients with no complications (10.6 days) (p = 0.037).

- **Conclusions**: The EarWell system is an effective non-surgical method for correcting ear anomalies in infants.

### Customized orthosis for nonsurgical correction of congenital auricle deformities in newborns [^1161U6nN]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

A misshaped pinna, caused by extrinsic pressures such as birth canal extrusion or incorrect positioning, is a common congenital auricular deformity in newborns. Surgery is a routine option to address this deformity, but it is traumatic and may lead to unacceptable aesthetic outcomes. Commercial ear mold orthoses with uniform size have been used for nonsurgical orthotic treatment, but they are not applicable in all cases, depending on the auricle morphology. The authors used computer-aided design and three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to develop a novel customized orthosis for congenital auricular deformities.

3D ear models were constructed using computer-aided design software, and a novel customized orthosis model was established following a process of correction, adjustment, and construction, with precise matching to allow tight attachment to the outer ear, free from uneven skin pressing. After 3D-printing a customized orthosis injection mold, medical silicone injection molding was used to produce the customized orthoses. Clinical application was conducted in 3 newborns and achieved satisfactory results. This novel customized auricle orthosis is an effective option for nonsurgical correction of a misshaped pinna.

### A study on the nonsurgical correction treatment age window and long-term follow-up of infants with congenital ear anomalies in China [^115ebnUU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Our research represents one of the most comprehensive studies on standard ear molding treatment, encompassing a significant cohort of full-term newborns with congenital ear deformities or less severe malformations. It is distinguished by a wider initial treatment window and the longest follow-up duration at the time of writing. Although achieving normal auricular morphology through ear molding is possible even beyond 42 days of age, we still recommend early initiation of corrective treatment.

The younger the age of the infant, the stronger the plasticity of the ear and the higher the compliance of parents, making it easier for the infants to be cared for during the treatment period, resulting in the best treatment outcomes. Improving the success rate of correction treatment in "older infants" is crucial, but our primary focus should be on efforts to enhance parental awareness and early acceptance of this treatment approach.

### Coexistence of coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear anomalies (CHARGE) syndrome and heterotaxy in a newborn with athymia [^117L61k9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, we explore the coexistence of CHARGE syndrome and heterotaxy in a newborn with athymia. CHARGE syndrome is a complex disorder that includes coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear anomalies. Heterotaxy refers to the abnormal arrangement of internal organs across the left-right axis of the body.

- **Overview of CHARGE syndrome**: Patients with CHARGE syndrome present with a wide range of anomalies. This study describes the case of a newborn who exhibits both CHARGE characteristics and features of heterotaxy.

- **Discussion**: The occurrence of both conditions in a single patient suggests a potential genetic or developmental correlation. Further research is essential to determine the underlying mechanisms that cause such complex presentations.

- **Conclusion**: This case contributes to the understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of CHARGE syndrome and highlights the need for comprehensive genetic and clinical investigations in similar cases.

The authors declare that they have no relevant conflicts of interest.

### Preauricular skin tags and ear pits are associated with permanent hearing impairment in newborns [^115FaQMr]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: Our goals were to (1) study the prevalence of hearing impairment in a large cohort of infants with preauricular skin tags or ear pits and compare it with that among all other newborns participating in our universal newborn hearing screening program during the same period, and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions as a hearing-screening tool in this population.

- **Patients and methods**: During the study period of 7.5 years, 68,484 infants were screened for hearing impairment, of whom 637 (0.93%) had preauricular skin tags and/or ear pits. The population was divided into three groups: (1) a low-risk group for hearing impairment; (2) a high-risk group for hearing impairment; and (3) a very high-risk group for hearing impairment. The screening results and audiological follow-up for these infants were examined retrospectively.

- **Results**: A significantly higher prevalence of permanent hearing impairment was found among infants with preauricular skin tags or ear pits (8 of 1000), compared with infants without tags or pits (1.5 of 1000). In the low-risk group, the prevalence was 3.4 of 1000, compared with 0.5 of 1000 in infants with and without preauricular tags or pits, respectively. In the high-risk group, the prevalence was 77 of 1000, compared with 20 of 1000 in infants with and without preauricular tags or pits, respectively. The odds ratio for hearing impairment associated with preauricular skin tags and/or ear pits, after adjusting for risk group level, was 4.9. All infants diagnosed with permanent hearing impairment, with the exception.
