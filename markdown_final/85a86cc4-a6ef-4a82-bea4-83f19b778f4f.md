## Question

Mechanism of action of mannitol in reducing intracranial pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of action of mannitol in reducing intracranial pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core osmotic mechanism and the role of the blood–brain barrier. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic/rheologic effects and their time course. Next, I will examine the pharmacokinetics and distribution that underpin duration of effect. After that, I need to check the rebound phenomenon and its clinical implications. Finally, I will integrate comparative data with hypertonic saline and synthesize practical clinical takeaways with dosing and monitoring guidance.

> Let me first confirm the primary mechanism: mannitol, a small extracellular solute, increases plasma osmolarity and draws water from brain parenchyma into the intravascular space via osmosis, thereby reducing brain water and intracranial volume; this requires a functional blood–brain barrier to sustain the gradient, so I need to ensure I don't overstate efficacy when the barrier is disrupted [^111Xyikw] [^111k7dJt] [^113Rz2En].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic contribution because I initially thought mannitol might directly reduce cerebral blood volume; on second thought, the immediate ICP drop within minutes is partly explained by reduced blood viscosity and improved microcirculatory flow, which triggers reflex pial arteriolar vasoconstriction and lowers cerebral blood volume and ICP, though one PET study did not show an acute CBV reduction after a 1 g/kg bolus, so I should be cautious and frame this as a plausible, context-dependent mechanism rather than a universal effect [^116XCZ5v] [^1159gUFe] [^114PoQ67].

> I will now examine the time course to align bedside expectations: the rheologic/vasoconstrictive effect is rapid and transient, often within 0–15 minutes, whereas the osmotic dehydration of brain tissue accrues over roughly 15–30 minutes and can persist up to several hours, which matches the clinical observation of a biphasic response; I should double-check that pediatric guidance aligns with this, and yes, it does describe an immediate viscosity effect and a slower osmotic effect persisting up to 6 hours [^113Rz2En] [^114PnYin].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetics to understand duration and accumulation risks: mannitol distributes largely to the extracellular space with a Vd around 17 L, is minimally metabolized, and is cleared renally with a half-life of 0.5–2.5 hours in normal renal function; in renal impairment, elimination is markedly prolonged, increasing the risk of accumulation and rebound, so I need to ensure renal function is monitored closely during therapy [^111Xyikw] [^111k7dJt].

> Hold on, I should verify the rebound phenomenon and its mechanism: with repeated or prolonged dosing, mannitol can cross a compromised blood–brain barrier and raise CSF osmolarity, diminishing and then reversing the osmotic gradient, leading to water retention and a rebound ICP increase several hours after infusion; this is particularly concerning with sustained therapy, so I need to check CSF osmolarity if mannitol is used beyond 24–48 hours and consider tapering or switching agents if CSF osmolarity rises [^112dBdQK] [^111THcAB] [^113Rz2En].

> Let me consider comparative effectiveness with hypertonic saline, because mechanism alone doesn't dictate clinical choice: multiple meta-analyses and RCTs suggest hypertonic saline may achieve a greater or more durable ICP reduction than equiosmolar mannitol in some contexts, though results are heterogeneous and long-term neurological outcomes are generally not different; I should confirm that guidelines reflect this uncertainty, and yes, contemporary guidance acknowledges both agents reduce ICP but does not endorse a universal first-line preference, emphasizing individualized selection and monitoring [^116cFYR7] [^115gzgnV] [^116taJ1E] [^115STnfU].

> I need to ensure dosing and safety monitoring are explicit: typical mannitol dosing for ICP control is 0.25–1 g/kg IV over about 10–30 minutes, repeated every 6–8 hours as needed, with close tracking of serum osmolarity, electrolytes, renal function, and volume status; many centers use a serum osmolarity ceiling near 320 mOsm/kg to mitigate renal and rebound risks, and I should confirm that labels and guidelines align with this approach, which they do [^116nRryk] [^113Rz2En] [^1165tEND].

> But wait, what if the blood–brain barrier is severely disrupted or the patient is hemodynamically unstable; I should double-check the practical implications: in compromised barriers, mannitol may be less effective and more prone to rebound, so hypertonic saline is often favored; conversely, mannitol's diuretic effect can worsen hypovolemia and hypotension, so in unstable patients, hypertonic saline's volume-expanding properties may be advantageous, reinforcing the need to tailor the agent to physiology and pathology [^111F8EJQ] [^113Rz2En] [^112gh6PD].

> Let me synthesize: mannitol lowers ICP through two coordinated mechanisms — an immediate hemodynamic/rheologic effect reducing cerebral blood volume and a delayed osmotic effect reducing brain water — with the osmotic component requiring an intact blood–brain barrier and carrying a risk of rebound if mannitol accumulates in brain or CSF; clinically, ICP reductions are proportional to baseline ICP and typically peak within 30–60 minutes, with effects lasting up to several hours, so careful selection, dosing, and monitoring are essential to balance benefit and risk [^111Xyikw] [^114PnYin] [^113Rz2En].

Mannitol lowers intracranial pressure (ICP) by **creating an osmotic gradient** that draws water from brain tissue into the vasculature, reducing cerebral edema and intracranial volume [^111Xyikw]. It also causes **transient vasoconstriction** by reducing blood viscosity and improving microcirculatory flow, thereby decreasing cerebral blood volume and ICP [^116XCZ5v]. These effects are rapid (within minutes) and peak at 30–60 minutes, but repeated dosing risks rebound ICP if mannitol accumulates in the brain or if the blood–brain barrier is disrupted [^114Twzsj] [^112dBdQK]. Clinically, mannitol is effective for acute ICP control, though hypertonic saline may offer a more sustained effect in some settings [^115STnfU] [^114te1xa].

---

## Primary mechanism: osmotic dehydration

- **Osmotic gradient**: Mannitol, a non-permeable solute, increases plasma osmolarity, creating a gradient that shifts water from brain interstitium and cells into vessels, reducing brain water and volume [^111Xyikw].

- **Blood–brain barrier dependence**: Effectiveness depends on an intact BBB; in injured regions, mannitol may leak in, causing rebound edema and ICP rise on repeated dosing [^112dBdQK].

- **Duration**: Osmotic effect peaks at 30–60 minutes and can last 2–6 hours, depending on dose and renal clearance [^113Rz2En].

---

## Secondary mechanism: hemodynamic effects

Mannitol reduces blood viscosity, which **improves microcirculatory flow** and triggers reflex pial arteriolar vasoconstriction, decreasing cerebral blood volume and ICP [^116XCZ5v]. This **transient vasoconstriction** contributes to the early ICP drop and is most pronounced shortly after infusion [^115K9yEy].

---

## Clinical implications and limitations

- **Rebound phenomenon**: Prolonged or repeated dosing can increase CSF osmolarity, reversing the gradient and raising ICP; monitor serum/CSF osmolarity and taper if CSF osmolarity rises [^111THcAB].

- **Renal considerations**: Mannitol is renally excreted; impaired function delays clearance and increases toxicity risk, so monitor renal function and osmolar gap [^111Xyikw].

- **Comparative efficacy**: Hypertonic saline may provide a more sustained ICP reduction in some settings, though evidence is mixed and agent choice should be individualized [^114te1xa] [^1164USip].

---

Mannitol reduces ICP primarily via **osmotic dehydration** and secondarily through hemodynamic effects; its rapid onset and established efficacy support its use in acute ICP management, but clinicians must monitor for rebound and renal effects and consider alternatives like hypertonic saline when appropriate [^111Xyikw] [^112dBdQK].

### Hypertonic saline versus mannitol for the treatment of elevated intracranial pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^116cFYR7]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Randomized trials have suggested that hypertonic saline solutions may be superior to mannitol for the treatment of elevated intracranial pressure, but their impact on clinical practice has been limited, partly by their small size. We therefore combined their findings in a meta-analysis.

Data Sources

We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge.

Study Selection

Randomized trials were included if they directly compared equiosmolar doses of hypertonic sodium solutions to mannitol for the treatment of elevated intracranial pressure in human subjects undergoing quantitative intracranial pressure measurement.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently reviewed potentially eligible trials and extracted data using a preformed data collection sheet. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third investigator if needed. We collected data on patient demographics, type of intracranial pathology, baseline intracranial pressure, osms per treatment dose, quantitative change in intracranial pressure, and prespecified adverse events. Our primary outcome was the proportion of successfully treated episodes of elevated intracranial pressure.

Data Synthesis

Five trials comprising 112 patients with 184 episodes of elevated intracranial pressure met our inclusion criteria. In random-effects models, the relative risk of intracranial pressure control was 1.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.33), and the difference in mean intracranial pressure reduction was 2.0 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -1.6 to 5.7), with both favoring hypertonic saline over mannitol. A mild degree of heterogeneity was present among the included trials. There were no significant adverse events reported.

Conclusions

We found that hypertonic saline is more effective than mannitol for the treatment of elevated intracranial pressure. Our meta-analysis is limited by the small number and size of eligible trials, but our findings suggest that hypertonic saline may be superior to the current standard of care and argue for a large, multicenter, randomized trial to definitively establish the first-line medical therapy for intracranial hypertension.

### Mannitol [^111Xyikw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Mannitol, when administered intravenously, exerts its osmotic diuretic effect as a solute of relatively small molecular size largely confined to the extracellular space. Mannitol hinders tubular reabsorption of water and enhances excretion of sodium and chloride by elevating the osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate.

This increase in extracellular osmolarity affected by the intravenous administration of mannitol will induce the movement of intracellular water to the extracellular and vascular spaces. This action underlies the role of mannitol in reducing intracranial pressure, intracranial edema, and intraocular pressure.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

Mannitol distributes largely to the extracellular space within 20 to 40 minutes after intravenous administration. The volume of distribution of mannitol is approximately 17 L in adults.

Elimination

In subjects with normal renal function, the total clearance is 87 to 109 mL/minute. The elimination half-life of mannitol is 0.5 to 2.5 hours

Metabolism

Only a relatively small amount of the mannitol dose is metabolized after intravenous administration to healthy subjects.

Excretion

Mannitol is eliminated primarily via the kidneys in unchanged form. Mannitol is filtered by the glomeruli, exhibits less than 10% of tubular reabsorption, and is not secreted by tubular cells. Following intravenous administration, approximately 80% of an administered dose of mannitol is estimated to be excreted in the urine in 3 hours with lesser amounts thereafter.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment, the elimination half-life of mannitol is prolonged. In a published study, in patients with renal impairment including acute renal failure and end stage renal failure, the elimination half-life of mannitol was estimated at about 36 hours, based on serum osmolarity. In patients with renal impairment on dialysis, the elimination half-life of mannitol was reduced to 6 and 21 hours during hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, respectively [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6), OVERDOSAGE (10)].

### Evidence for mannitol as an effective agent against intracranial hypertension: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^114PnYin]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Mannitol is currently used to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP), but the evidence supporting its usefulness has been questioned. We aim to meta-analyze the effectiveness of mannitol in reducing ICP in adult patients with cerebral injuries and its dependency on baseline ICP values, comparing findings from individual patient data (IPD) and aggregated data (AD) meta-analysis performed on the same studies. We searched the Medline database, with no time limitation, through March 1, 2019. We selected studies for which IPD were available, with a before-after design, concerning adult patients with traumatic cerebral hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhages, or hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, treated with mannitol for increased intracranial hypertension. We extracted ICP values at baseline and at different time-points, and mannitol doses. We used a multilevel approach to account for multiple measurements on the same patient and for center variability. The AD meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted using random-effects models. Three studies published IPD, and four authors shared their datasets. Two authors did not own their datasets anymore. Eight authors were unreachable, while 14 did not answer to our request. Overall, 7 studies provided IPD for 98 patients. The linear mixed-effects model showed that ICP decreased significantly after mannitol administration from an average baseline value of 22.1 mmHg to 16.8, 12.8, and 9.7 mmHg at 60, 120, and 180 min after mannitol administration. ICP reduction was proportional to baseline values with a 0.64 mmHg decrease for each unitary increment of the initial ICP value. Dose did not influence ICP reduction. The AD meta-analysis, based on data collected between 30 and 60 min from mannitol administration not accounting for multiple time-point measurements, overestimated ICP reduction (10 mmHg), while meta-regression provided similar results (0.66 mmHg decrease for each unitary increase of initial ICP). Mannitol is effective in reducing pathological ICP, proportionally to the degree of intracranial hypertension. IPD meta-analysis provided a more precise quantification of ICP variation than the AD approach.

### Management of raised intracranial pressure and hyperosmolar therapy [^117RAC1P]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of raised intracranial pressure is undergoing rapid change. The choice of medical treatments to reduce intracranial pressure varies between institutions and regions of the world. The mainstay of therapy, however, continues to be the infusion of a hyperosmolar solution to achieve an osmotic gradient to force the exit of water from the brain. This review introduces the basic concepts of raised intracranial pressure, summarises several recent studies that have challenged dogma in the field, and provides practical advice on hyperosmolar treatment, based on personal experience and a critical reading of the literature.

### Mannitol [^117EGyfB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal function worsens [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

5.3 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity

CNS toxicity manifested by, e.g., confusion, lethargy, coma, has been reported in patients treated with mannitol, some resulting in death, in particular in the presence of impaired renal function CNS toxicity may result from high serum mannitol concentrations, serum hyperosmolarity resulting in intracellular dehydration within CNS, hyponatremia or other disturbances of electrolyte and acid/base balance secondary to mannitol administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

At high concentrations, mannitol may cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with the ability of the brain to maintain the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid especially in the presence of acidosis.

In patients with pre-existing compromise of the blood brain barrier, the risk of increasing cerebral edema (general and focal) associated with repeated or continued use of Mannitol Injection must be individually weighed against the expected benefits.

A rebound increase of intracranial pressure may occur several hours after the infusion. Patients with a compromised blood brain barrier are at increased risk.

### Mannitol for acute traumatic brain injury [^112bW3xy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Mannitol is sometimes dramatically effective in reversing acute brain swelling, but its effectiveness in the on-going management of severe head injury remains open to question. There is evidence that, in prolonged dosage, mannitol may pass from the blood into the brain, where it might cause reverse osmotic shifts that increase intracranial pressure.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different mannitol therapy regimens, of mannitol compared to other intracranial pressure (ICP) lowering agents, and to quantify the effectiveness of mannitol administration given at other stages following acute traumatic brain injury.

Search Strategy

The review drew on the search strategy for the Injuries Group as a whole. We checked reference lists of trials and review articles, and contacted authors of trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of mannitol, in patients with acute traumatic brain injury of any severity. The comparison group could be placebo-controlled, no drug, different dose, or different drug. Trials where the intervention was started more than eight weeks after injury, and cross-over trials were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewers independently rated quality of allocation concealment and extracted the data. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial on an intention to treat basis.

Main Results

Overall there were few eligible trials. In the pre-operative management of patients with acute intracranial haemorrhage the administration of high-dose mannitol resulted in reduced mortality (RR = 0.55; 95%CI 0.36, 0.84) and reduced death and severe disability (RR = 0.58; 95%CI 0.45, 0.74) when compared with conventional-dose mannitol. One trial compared ICP-directed therapy to 'standard care' (RR for death = 0.83; 95%CI 0.47,1.46). One trial compared mannitol to pentobarbital (RR for death = 0.85; 95% CI 0.52, 1.38). No trials compared mannitol to other ICP-lowering agents. One trial tested the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol against placebo (RR for death = 1.75; 95% CI 0.48, 6.38).

Reviewer's Conclusions

High-dose mannitol appears to be preferable to conventional-dose mannitol in the pre-operative management of patients with acute intracranial haematomas. However, there is little evidence about the use of mannitol as a continuous infusion in patients with raised intracranial pressure in patients who do not have an operable intracranial haematoma. Mannitol therapy for raised ICP may have a beneficial effect on mortality when compared to pentobarbital treatment. ICP-directed treatment shows a small beneficial effect compared to treatment directed by neurological signs and physiological indicators. There are insufficient data on the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol to preclude either a harmful or a beneficial effect on mortality.

### Hypertonic saline for treating raised intracranial pressure: literature review with meta-analysis [^113ADBVg]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Object

Currently, mannitol is the recommended first choice for a hyperosmolar agent for use in patients with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Some authors have argued that hypertonic saline (HTS) might be a more effective agent; however, there is no consensus as to appropriate indications for use, the best concentration, and the best method of delivery. To answer these questions better, the authors performed a review of the literature regarding the use of HTS for ICP reduction.

Methods

A PubMed search was performed to locate all papers pertaining to HTS use. This search was then narrowed to locate only those clinical studies relating to the use of HTS for ICP reduction.

Results

A total of 36 articles were selected for review. Ten were prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was prospective and nonrandomized, 15 were prospective observational trials, and 10 were retrospective trials. The authors did not distinguish between retrospective observational studies and retrospective comparison trials. Prospective studies were considered observational if the effects of a treatment were evaluated over time but not compared with another treatment.

Conclusions

The available data are limited by low patient numbers, limited RCTs, and inconsistent methods between studies. However, a greater part of the data suggest that HTS given as either a bolus or continuous infusion can be more effective than mannitol in reducing episodes of elevated ICP. A meta-analysis of 8 prospective RCTs showed a higher rate of treatment failure or insufficiency with mannitol or normal saline versus HTS.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116XCZ5v]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar therapy — mechanisms and agent-specific considerations note that mannitol and hypertonic saline are routinely employed hyperosmolar agents in North America, that hypertonic saline administration may be hazardous for a hyponatremic patient, and that although mannitol can be used as a resuscitation fluid, its eventual diuretic effect is undesirable in hypotensive patients and attention needs to be paid to replacing intravascular volume loss; both mannitol and hypertonic saline work to reduce intracranial pressure, at least in part, through reducing blood viscosity, leading to improved microcirculatory flow of blood constituents and consequent constriction of the pial arterioles, resulting in decreased cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure.

### Salt or sugar for your injured brain? A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of mannitol versus hypertonic sodium solutions to manage raised intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury [^115GTAXz]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rising intracranial pressure (ICP) is a poor prognostic indicator in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Both mannitol and hypertonic sodium solutions are used to treat raised ICP in patients with TBI.

Objective

This meta-analysis compares the use of mannitol versus hypertonic sodium solutions for ICP control in patients with TBI.

Data Sources and Study Eligibility

Randomised clinical trials in adults with TBI and evidence of raised ICP, which compare the effect on ICP of hypertonic sodium solutions and mannitol.

Methods

The primary outcome measure is the pooled mean reduction in ICP. Studies were combined using a Forest plot.

Results

Six studies were included, comprising 171 patients (599 episodes of raised ICP). The weighted mean difference in ICP reduction, using hypertonic sodium solutions compared with mannitol, was 1.39 mm Hg (95% CI -0.74 to 3.53).

Limitations

Methodological differences between studies limit the conclusions of this meta-analysis.

Conclusions

The evidence shows that both agents effectively lower ICP. There is a trend favouring the use of hypertonic sodium solutions in patients with TBI.

### Dose-response relationship of mannitol and intracranial pressure: a metaanalysis [^115K9yEy]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Brain edema can increase intracranial pressure (ICP), potentially leading to ischemia, herniation, and death. Edema and elevated ICP are often treated with osmotic agents to remove water from brain tissue. Mannitol is the osmotic diuretic most commonly used in the intensive care unit; however, despite its clinical importance, treatment protocols vary from center to center, and the dose-response relationship is not understood. The goal of this metaanalysis was to aggregate and analyze data from studies in which authors have described the dose-response relationship between mannitol and ICP.

Methods

The authors identified 18 studies that quantitatively characterized the dose-response relationship of mannitol and ICP. We also examined study designs and mannitol administration protocols.

Results

Meta-regression found a weak linear relationship between change in ICP (delta ICP) and dose (delta ICP = 6.6 x dose - 1.1; p = 0.27, R(2) = 0.05). The lack of statistical significance could reflect the variation in protocols among studies and the variation in patients both within and among studies. However, the authors found a highly significant difference (p < 0.001) in decrease in ICP when the initial ICP was higher or lower than 30 mm Hg. Nonlinear regression suggested that ICP decrease is greatest shortly after mannitol is given (R(2) = 0.63). Finally, the authors found that recent studies tend to include fewer patients and set a lower ICP threshold for mannitol administration but report more parameters of interest; the duration of mannitol's effect was the most frequently unreported parameter.

Conclusions

Despite its clinical importance, the determination of the mannitol dose-response curve continues to be challenging for many reasons. This metaanalysis highlights the need for a consensus of methods and results required to determine this important relationship.

### Hyperosmolar therapy for intracranial hypertension [^114PoQ67]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The use of hyperosmolar agents for intracranial hypertension was introduced in the early 20th century and remains a mainstay of therapy for patients with cerebral edema. Both animal and human studies have demonstrated the efficacy of two hyperosmolar agents, mannitol and hypertonic saline, in reducing intracranial pressure via volume redistribution, plasma expansion, rheologic modifications, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, because of physician and institutional variation in therapeutic practices, lack of standardized protocols for initiation and administration of therapy, patient heterogeneity, and a paucity of randomized controlled trials have yielded little class I evidence on which clinical decisions can be based, most current evidence regarding the use of hyperosmolar therapy is derived from retrospective analyses (class III) and case series (class IV). In this review, we summarize the available evidence regarding the use of hyperosmolar therapy with mannitol or hypertonic saline for the medical management of intracranial hypertension and present a comprehensive discussion of the evidence associated with various theoretical and practical concerns related to initiation, dosage, and monitoring of therapy.

### Osmotic therapies added to antibiotics for acute bacterial meningitis [^111nQxGx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

How the intervention might work

All osmotic therapies have slightly different and poorly understood mechanisms of action. The osmotic drug's mechanism of action causes dehydration of central nervous system (CNS) cells, lowering intracranial pressure (ICP). However this effect may only be temporary and lead to a rebound phenomenon where cells subsequently draw in too much water, increasing the oedema. Mannitol has this mechanism of action but acts primarily by erythrocyte deformity through increases in intravascular water, allowing increased tissue oxygenation in the CNS. Mannitol produces a large diuresis through this effect, which causes a reflex cerebral vasoconstriction, temporarily reducing ICP. However, there is a significant risk of subsequent rebound raised ICP and mannitol is now used sparingly due to this concern. The main mechanism of action of glycerol in humans is unknown but there are some data to suggest that the addition of glycerol in meningitis could potentially improve cerebral blood flow and metabolism (Mathew 1972; Meyer 1972). Glycerol also has a mild effect on serum osmolality (Singhi 2008).

Hypertonic saline and sodium lactate appear to have direct osmotic actions on cells and they do not cause diuresis. These drugs may therefore be better than mannitol in reducing ICP (Ichai 2009). Osmotic diuretics such as mannitol and sorbitol could potentially also have a clinical benefit in meningitis through reduction in ICP but may risk volume depletion in the febrile patient. All osmotic therapies ideally require an intact blood brain barrier to exert their effects. Bacterial meningitis causes disruption of the barrier due to intense inflammation in the subarachnoid space and therefore it cannot be assumed that osmotic therapies would be beneficial. Table 2 gives details of all the properties of currently available osmotic therapies.

Why it is important to do this review

To date, there have been a few placebo‐controlled studies using osmotic therapies in meningitis published in different settings in children and adults. A systematic review and meta‐analysis would help to decide if these studies have demonstrated clinical benefit either by improvement in mortality or long‐term neurological disabilities from the use of these treatments. This review aimed to encompass all types of osmotic therapies to investigate whether the principle of osmotic pressure change in the CNS is of benefit in people with meningitis and to demonstrate whether osmotic therapies should be recommended in principle, or if a particular therapy should be recommended in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.

### Mannitol for acute traumatic brain injury [^112r2UEE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Mannitol is sometimes effective in reversing acute brain swelling, but its effectiveness in the ongoing management of severe head injury remains unclear. There is evidence that, in prolonged dosage, mannitol may pass from the blood into the brain, where it might cause increased intracranial pressure.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different mannitol therapy regimens, of mannitol compared to other intracranial pressure (ICP) lowering agents, and to quantify the effectiveness of mannitol administration given at other stages following acute traumatic brain injury.

Search Strategy

The review drew on the search strategy for the Injuries Group as a whole. We checked reference lists of trials and review articles, and contacted authors of trials. The searches were last updated in April 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of mannitol, in patients with acute traumatic brain injury of any severity. The comparison group could be placebo-controlled, no drug, different dose, or different drug. We excluded cross-over trials, and trials where the intervention was started more than eight weeks after injury.

Data Collection and Analysis

The reviewers independently rated quality of allocation concealment and extracted the data. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial on an intention to treat basis.

Main Results

In the acute management of comatose patients with severe head injury, the administration of high-dose mannitol resulted in reduced mortality (RR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.79) and reduced death and severe disability (RR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.72) when compared with conventional-dose mannitol. One trial compared ICP-directed therapy to 'standard care' (RR for death = 0.83; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.46). One trial compared mannitol to pentobarbital (RR for death = 0.85; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38). One trial compared mannitol to hypertonic saline (RR for death = 1.25; 95% CI 0.47 to 3.33). One trial tested the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol against placebo (RR for death = 1.75; 95% CI 0.48 to 6.38).

Authors' Conclusions

High-dose mannitol may be preferable to conventional-dose mannitol in the acute management of comatose patients with severe head injury. Mannitol therapy for raised ICP may have a beneficial effect on mortality when compared to pentobarbital treatment, but may have a detrimental effect on mortality when compared to hypertonic saline. ICP-directed treatment shows a small beneficial effect compared to treatment directed by neurological signs and physiological indicators. There are insufficient data on the effectiveness of pre-hospital administration of mannitol.

### Hypertonic saline versus other intracranial-pressure-lowering agents for patients with acute traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Q91Bt]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. In the United Kingdom, TBI is the most common cause of death in patients under 40 years of age. Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to TBI increases the risk of brain herniation and is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Thus, lowering ICP is a critical management priority in patients with moderate to severe acute TBI.

Hyperosmolar therapies, such as hypertonic saline (HTS) and mannitol, are in routine clinical use for lowering ICP in TBI. Historically, both agents were thought to produce an ICP-lowering effect by drawing interstitial fluid within edematous brain tissue intravascularly. More recently, their mechanism of action is increasingly understood to involve complex alterations in blood viscosity and microcirculatory changes resulting in pial arteriolar constriction, decreased cerebral blood volume, and reduced ICP. Despite increasing popularity of HTS in this setting and positive results from previous studies suggesting potential clinical benefits, the most recent Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines (2016) state that there was "insufficient evidence available from comparative studies to support a formal recommendation" for its use. Severe hypernatremia has been noted as a potential adverse effect associated with HTS use. Moreover, a recent Cochrane review concluded that there was weak evidence to suggest HTS has no effect on long-term neurological outcome compared with mannitol, although this review was released prior to publication of the largest randomized trial investigating HTS infusion in patients with acute TBI (the continous hyperosmolar therapy for traumatic brain-injured patients (COBI) trial). The COBI trial included 370 adults with moderate to severe TBI and found no evidence of an effect of a continuous HTS infusion compared with standard care on long-term neurological function.

Therefore, it remains unclear whether HTS offers any clinical benefit over other ICP-lowering methods in terms of long-term functional outcome, all-cause mortality, ICP control, and adverse effects. This review seeks a definitive answer to this question to guide clinical practice and inform future research.

### Effect of mannitol on cerebral blood volume in patients with head injury [^1159gUFe]. Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mannitol has traditionally been the mainstay of medical therapy for intracranial hypertension in patients with head injury. We previously demonstrated that mannitol reduces brain volume in patients with cerebral edema, although whether this occurs because of a reduction in brain water, blood volume, or both remains poorly understood.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that mannitol acts by lowering blood viscosity leading to reflex vasoconstriction and a fall in cerebral blood volume (CBV).

Methods

We used O positron emission tomography to study 6 patients with traumatic brain injuries requiring treatment for intracranial hypertension. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), CBV, and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) were measured before and 1 hour after administration of 1.0 g/kg 20% mannitol.

Results

CBV rose from 4.1 ± 0.4 to 4.2 ± 0.2 mL/100 g (P = .3), while intracranial pressure fell from 21.5 ± 4.9 to 13.7 ± 5.1 mm Hg (P < .003) after mannitol. Blood pressure, PaCO2, oxygen content, CBF, and CMRO2 did not change.

Conclusion

A single bolus of 1 g/kg of 20% mannitol does not acutely lower CBV. Another mechanism, such as a reduction in brain water, may better explain mannitol's ability to lower intracranial pressure and reduce mass effect.

### Effect of mannitol and furosemide on plasma osmolality and brain water [^111WcKJn]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Mannitol and furosemide are used to reduce increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and to reduce brain bulk during neurosurgery. One mechanism by which these changes might occur is via a reduction in brain water content. Although mannitol and furosemide are commonly used in combination, there has been no formal evaluation of the interactive effects of these two drugs on brain water. The effect of mannitol and furosemide alone and in combination on water content of normal rat brain was examined.

Methods

The lungs of rats anesthetized with halothane were mechanically ventilated to maintain normal physiologic parameters. After baseline measurement of plasma osmolality, mannitol (1, 4, or 8 g/kg), furosemide (2, 4, or 8 mg/kg), or a combination of furosemide (8 mg/kg) and mannitol (1, 4, or 8 g/kg) was administered intravenously over approximately 15 min. One hour later, plasma osmolality was measured, the animals were killed, and brain water content was determined by wet and dry weight measurements.

Results

Mannitol produced a dose-dependent increase in plasma osmolality and reduction of brain water content. There was a linear relation between plasma osmolality and brain water content. Furosemide alone did not affect plasma osmolality or brain water at any dose. The combination of furosemide with mannitol resulted in a greater increase in plasma osmolality than seen with mannitol alone and a greater decrease in brain water at 4 and 8 g/kg of mannitol.

Conclusions

The doses of mannitol and furosemide utilized were much larger than clinically applicable doses and were selected to maximize the ability to detect effect on brain water. The combination of mannitol and furosemide resulted in greater reduction of brain water content than did mannitol alone. Furosemide enhanced the effect of mannitol on plasma osmolality, resulting in a greater reduction of brain water content. Potential interaction (if any) of smaller, clinically used doses of mannitol and furosemide cannot be surmised from the current study.

Key messages

- 	7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 is more effective than mannitol in the treatment of increased ICP

- 	A dose of 1.4 ml/kg 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 can be recommended as an initial dose

- 	The local dehydration of brain tissue after application of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 seems to be the primary mechanism for the improved CPP

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^111MPf2F]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The various treatments for ICP or cerebral edema reviewed in this guideline are used in patients with critical intracranial pathologies worldwide. Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials. The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments. The concepts of hyperosmotic therapy have been entrenched in the critical care management of patients with neurological injuries for years, yet there is limited evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal practical use of mannitol or hypertonic saline. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema. The goals of research activities in this area should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures. Basic criteria of research efforts should include a definition of how cerebral edema is being measured, the specific purpose of any intervention (e.g. resuscitation, management of ICP, effect on physiological parameters), and what outcome measures will be assessed. In addition, research efforts should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on designated outcomes. Finally, while the goal of all interventions in the management of neurological injuries is to improve survival and minimize disability, it must be acknowledged that a single intervention to address a specific physiological variable may have limited impact on the multiple factors that contribute to both short- and long-term outcomes.

Mannitol in pediatric traumatic brain injury — mechanisms, timing, and renal risk are described as follows: "Mannitol can reduce ICP by two distinct mechanisms", including an immediate blood viscosity effect whose impact on viscosity "is transient (< 75 min)", and an osmotic effect that "develops more slowly (over 15–30 min)" with an effect that "persists up to 6 hours and requires an intact blood-brain barrier". Accumulation in injured regions may lead to a reverse osmotic shift "possibly increasing ICP", particularly "when mannitol is used for extended periods of time". A renal risk threshold noted in adults is that risk has been "suggested… when serum osmolarity levels greater than 320 mOsm in adults".

### Progressing haemorrhagic stroke: categories, causes, mechanisms and managements [^11211pQm]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Osmotherapy

Osmotherapy with mannitol is often applied in the acute phase of ICH to control the increased intracranial pressure. However, mannitol may have the possibility of aggregating haematoma expansion or perihaematomal oedema, because it may open the blood–brain barrier or reverse the osmotic concentration gradient between the oedematous brain and plasma. In a randomised controlled trial, 128 patients with ICH were treated either with mannitol or sham infusion in their early stage of hospitalisation, and the result showed no difference in one-month mortality and secondary outcome. The Cochrane systemic review, including two trials of mannitol for ICH, did not find significant differences in mortality and morbidity between treatment groups and controls. In those without significant intracranial hypertension or mass effect, mannitol should not be used but close monitoring should be applied.

For a patient with an increased ICP, elevating the head to 30 degrees, giving 1.0–1.5 g/kg of 20% mannitol by a rapid infusion, and hyperventilating the patient to a pCO 2 of 28–32 mmHg are the usual management protocols. Hypertonic saline is an alternative choice for decreasing intracranial pressure. Wagner et al. treated ICH patients with spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia/thalamic bleeding with continuous hypertonic saline infusion within 72 h, and the relative oedema volume and the occurrence of intracranial pressure crisis had significantly decreased.

This review examines the available data on the use of osmotic agents in patients with head injury and ischemic stroke, summarizes the physiological effects of osmotic agents, and presents the leading hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which they reduce ICP. Finally, it addresses the validity of the following commonly held beliefs: mannitol accumulates in injured brain; mannitol shrinks only normal brain and can increase midline shift; osmolality can be used to monitor mannitol administration; mannitol should be not be administered if osmolality is > 320 mOsm; and hypertonic saline is equally effective as mannitol.

### Hypertonic saline infusion for treating intracranial hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury [^113Eo2r6]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major causes of death and disability, and contributes to 30% of all injury-related mortality. After severe TBI, prompt surgical and medical management of patients reduces mortality. Guidelines for the management of severe TBI have been formulated and published for the past two decades by the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF), and adherence to these has resulted in a significant reduction in mortality.

The primary interventions that have maximal impact and have led to the several-fold reduction in mortality from severe TBI over the past decades are immediate surgical intervention and subsequent care by specialist intensivists. In a majority of patients who have undergone craniotomy for surgical evacuation of an extra-axial clot or rarely decompressive craniectomy for severe swelling, as well as in patients who may not have a surgical lesion, post-traumatic intracranial hypertension (ICH) poses a threat to life and quality of life after survival. There are few proven therapies for the efficient treatment of ICH, yet there is a paucity of prospective randomized clinical trials for those agents.

Hypertonic solutions such as mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS) are recommended early in the management of ICH after severe TBI. They provide therapeutic benefit along with a wide therapeutic margin. The most recent BTF guidelines stated "although hyperosmolar therapy may lower intracranial pressure, there was insufficient evidence about effects on clinical outcomes to support a specific recommendation, or to support use of any specific hyperosmolar agent". The current recommendation for the use of mannitol to treat ICH is carried from the previous edition of the guidelines "to maintain sufficient recognition of the potential need for hyperosmolar therapy to reduce intracranial pressure, while acknowledging that more research is needed to inform more specific recommendations". While mannitol has been the traditional agent of choice supported by older studies, the use of HTS is increasing and is supported by several recent studies, albeit small or heterogeneous ones. Reduction in intracranial pressure (ICP) has been consistently demonstrated with both mannitol and HTS, but there is a suggestion that HTS provides a more robust and durable effect in lowering ICP. Recent research has now focused on establishing superiority between HTS and mannitol administered as bolus therapy.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [^112yefzX]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Our results showed that bolus application of either study medication, mannitol 15% or hypertonic saline 7.2%, significantly decreases ICP and increases CPP (Table 2). The effect of hypertonic saline on ICP was significantly better than that of mannitol. Clinically important effects of both drugs on MAP could not be determined, although some statistically significant differences were observed at a few measurement points. Therefore, it can be concluded that local cerebral dehydration is the main mechanism of both substances in decreasing ICP and optimizing CPP. The higher potency of hypertonic saline suggests that its local effect is more clearly pronounced.

However, the mechanisms whereby hypertonic solutions reduce ICP are multifactorial and are still discussed with some controversy. The main principle seems to be the 'local dehydration' of brain tissue drawing water from parenchyma to the intravascular space following an osmotic gradient. Comparing this with the osmotic effect of mannitol, a second mechanism to explain the effect of the ICP-reduction must exist. This hypothesis is supported by the results of Berger et al. He found, in rats with induced head injury, a similar positive effect on ICP with regards to the amount and duration of the decrease, but a higher CPP in the rats receiving mannitol. Contrary to our results, the MAP increased after hypertonic saline, whereas the MAP temporarily decreased after mannitol. The authors hypothesized that the different effects of the two solutions are the result of a selective permeability of the BBB and/or the different reflection coefficients. A disrupted BBB would have to be the result of an accumulation of both solutions in the brain tissue. Therefore different mechanisms of local cerebral dehydration must exist. These hypotheses are supported by the results of Worthley et al. and Kaufmann et al. Both working groups demonstrated that the ICP-decreasing effect is limited after repeated bolus applications of mannitol, but a further application of hypertonic saline lead to a further ICP reduction. However, a direct vasodilatation of pial vessels, the reduction of blood viscosity due to enhancement of the intravascular volume, the rapid absorption of cerebrospinal fluid and restoration of the normal membrane potentials are other effects to positively affect the ICP. Our results only support the hypothesis about the local dehydration of brain tissue. Systemic hemodynamic effects for the given dosage couldn't be demonstrated, but the decreased ICP leads to the improved CPP. All homeostatic side effects after hypertonic saline, for instance hypernatriemia and increased serum osmolarity, are temporary and without systemic hemodynamic side effects. Such complications as described in the literature, emphasize cardiac failure with lung edema, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathia subdural hematoma and central pontine myolysis as the most important. With the intention of limiting the side effects of changes in electrolytes and osmolarity, a standardized laboratory measurement procedure is needed.

### Comparison of intracranial pressure measurements before and after hypertonic saline or mannitol treatment in children with severe traumatic brain injury [^115QFudo]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How commonly are hyperosmolar therapies used in the management of severe traumatic brain injury in children, and which agent — mannitol or hypertonic saline solution — is associated with greater decreases in intracranial pressure (ICP) and/or increases in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness research study of 1000 consecutive children with traumatic brain injury, more than 77% of the study population received hyperosmolar therapies during the ICP treatment phase of their care, and almost 2500 bolus administrations of 3% hypertonic saline and mannitol were analyzed. Hypertonic saline was associated with decreased ICP, whereas hypertonic saline and mannitol had similar observed effectiveness for CPP.

Meaning

This study of children with severe traumatic brain injury found that bolus administration of hypertonic saline was associated with superior ICP and CPP outcomes.

### Hyperosmolar agents in neurosurgical practice: the evolving role of hypertonic saline [^117D3Aaj]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Medical management of cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a critical component of perioperative care in neurosurgical practice. Traumatic brain injury, arterial infarction, venous hypertension/infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, tumor progression, and postoperative edema can all generate clinical situations in which ICP management is a critical determinant of patient outcomes. Although osmotic agents are among the most fundamental tools to control ICP, prospective data to establish clear guidelines on their use are lacking. Hypertonic saline is emerging as an alternative to mannitol. Early data suggest that indications for each agent may ultimately depend on ICP etiology.

### Randomized, controlled trial on the effect of a 20% mannitol solution and a 7.5% saline / 6% dextran solution on increased intracranial pressure after brain injury [^116ZXYdP]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this pilot study was to compare the effects of equimolar doses of hypertonic saline and dextran solution (HSD, Rescueflow) with 20% mannitol solution for reduction of increased intracranial pressure.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover trial in the intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital.

Setting

Academic hospital and tertiary referral center for neuroscience.

Patients

Nine patients with an intracranial pressure of > 20 mm Hg were recruited and received two treatments of each, HSD and 20% mannitol, in a randomized order.

Intervention

Equimolar, rapid intravenous infusions of either 200 mL of 20% mannitol or 100 mL of 7.5% saline and 6% dextran-70 solution (HSD) over 5 mins.

Measurements

Intracranial pressure, blood pressure, serum and urine sodium and osmolality, and urine output.

Main Results

Treatments reduced intracranial pressure with both mannitol (median decrease, 7.5 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval, 5.8–11.8) and HSD (median decrease, 13 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, 11.5–17.3). HSD caused a significantly greater decrease in intracranial pressure than mannitol (p = .044). HSD had a longer duration of effect than mannitol (p = .044).

Conclusion

When given in an equimolar, rapid, intravenous infusion, HSD reduces intracranial pressure more effectively than mannitol.

### Agreement of measured and calculated serum osmolality during the infusion of mannitol or hypertonic saline in patients after craniotomy: a prospective, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^114tgnDG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Brain edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) are potentially devastating complications following various types of intracranial operations, and appropriate treatments improve cerebral perfusion and reduce damage by local compression of brain tissue. Hyperosmolar agents have been used to ameliorate brain edema and intracranial hypertension during and after craniotomy, where mannitol and hypertonic saline (HS) are the two most extensively studied and most frequently used in the clinical practice. Although recent meta-analyses suggested that HS might be more effective than mannitol in controlling intracranial hypertension, no significant differences have been found in neurological outcome and side effects between the two agents.

The primary mechanism of hyperosmolar agents to control brain edema is based on the increased osmotic gradient across blood–brain barrier during drug infusion, and this helps in the removal of water from brain tissue to the intravascular space. Clinical studies showed that an osmotic gradient between blood and brain of just above 10 mOsmol/kg was effective in reducing ICP. In clinical practice, serum osmolality can be used as a surrogate measure of the effect of hyperosmolar agents, with either mannitol or HS. The initial target of serum osmolality is often set slightly above the upper limit of normal range. Acute renal failure might develop when serum osmolality exceeds 320 mOsmol/kg during mannitol infusion. Therefore, measurement of serum osmolality during hyperosmolar agent infusion is of clinical importance to determine clinical efficacy, adjust dosage and avoid side effects.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring and management in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^11397mFm]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Osmotherapy

Osmotherapy is frequently used in patients with SAH. The optimal osmotherapy agent in SAH is debated, and the main agents used are mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS). The supposed mechanism of action is to improve blood rheology and cerebral microvascular flow and create an osmolar gradient across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), favoring cerebral edema reabsorption. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic, and at doses of 0.25 to 1 g/kg, it has been associated with effective ICP reduction in patients with brain injury, although there is little evidence of its use specifically in SAH. HTS has a minimal diuretic effect, unlike mannitol. It can expand the intravascular volume and increase blood pressure and serum sodium levels. The HTS concentrations reported were between 3 and 23.5%. Equimolar doses decrease ICP similarly. The upper safety limit is often reported as either a serum sodium level of 155–160 mEq/L or a serum osmolality of 320 mOsm. According to guidelines for treating cerebral edema in SAH, a symptom-based bolus dosing is suggested rather than a sodium-target-based dosing.

In a retrospective cohort analysis of 68 patients with multiple intracranial pathologies, Koenig et al. reported that in 75% of cases, 30–60 mL of 23.4% NaCl was sufficient to reverse transtentorial herniation, and this was associated with a > 5% mEq/L rise in the serum sodium concentration or an absolute serum sodium level of > 145 mEq/L within 1 h after HTS administration. A recent review on HTS confirmed its efficacy in reducing refractory ICP in patients with SAH, although no recommendation on the dose, volume, and concentration was made. In addition, Bentsen et al. found osmotherapy with HTS to attenuate both static ICP and ICP wave amplitude; of note, they report that in the majority of HTS infusions, the ICP wave amplitude target was not reached even though ICP and CPP targets were, a finding consistent with an unfavorable intracranial compliance state despite normal static values.

### Mannitol in critical care and surgery over 50 + years: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and complications with meta-analysis [^113a9kH4]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite clinical use spanning 50+ years, questions remain concerning the optimal use of mannitol. The published reviews with meta-analysis frequently focused on mannitol's effects on a specific physiological aspect such as intracranial pressure (ICP) in sometimes heterogeneous patient populations. A comprehensive review of mannitol's effects, as well as side effects, is needed.

Methods

The databases Medline (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), and NLM PubMed were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mannitol to a control therapy in either the critical care or perioperative setting. Meta-analysis was performed when feasible to examine mannitol's effects on outcomes, including ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), brain relaxation, fluid intake, urine output, and serum sodium. Systematic literature search was also performed to understand mannitol-related complications.

Results

In total 55 RCTs were identified and 7 meta-analyses were performed. In traumatic brain injury, mannitol did not lead to significantly different MAP (SMD [95% confidence interval (CI)] = -3.3 [-7.9, 1.3] mmHg; P = 0.16) but caused significantly different serum sodium concentrations (SMD [95% CI] = -8.0 [-11.0, -4.9]mmol/L; P < 0.00001) compared with hypertonic saline. In elective craniotomy, mannitol was less likely to lead to satisfactory brain relaxation (RR [95% CI] = 0.89 [0.81, 0.98]; P = 0.02), but was associated with increased fluid intake (SMD [95% CI] = 0.67 [0.21, 1.13]L; P = 0.004), increased urine output (SMD [95% CI] = 485 [211, 759]mL; P = 0.0005), decreased serum sodium concentration (SMD [95% CI] = -6.2 [-9.6, -2.9]mmol/L; P = 0.0002), and a slightly higher MAP (SMD [95% CI] = 3.3 [0.08, 6.5]mmHg; P = 0.04) compared with hypertonic saline. Mannitol could lead to complications in different organ systems, most often including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. These complications appeared dose dependent and had no long-term consequences.

Conclusions

Mannitol is effective in accomplishing short-term clinical goals, although hypertonic saline is associated with improved brain relaxation during craniotomy. Mannitol has a favorable safety profile although it can cause electrolyte abnormality and renal impairment. More research is needed to determine its impacts on long-term outcomes.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1164USip]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure is a common issue in patients with neurological injury. Practical recommendations regarding selection and monitoring of therapies for initial management of cerebral edema for optimal efficacy and safety are generally lacking. This guideline evaluates the role of hyperosmolar agents (mannitol, HTS), corticosteroids, and selected non-pharmacologic therapies in the acute treatment of cerebral edema. Clinicians must be able to select appropriate therapies for initial cerebral edema management based on available evidence while balancing efficacy and safety.

Methods

The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacy to create a panel in 2017. The group generated 16 clinical questions related to initial management of cerebral edema in various neurological insults using the PICO format. A research librarian executed a comprehensive literature search through July 2018. The panel screened the identified articles for inclusion related to each specific PICO question and abstracted necessary information for pertinent publications. The panel used GRADE methodology to categorize the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the findings of each publication approximate the true effect of the therapy.

Results

The panel generated recommendations regarding initial management of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, bacterial meningitis, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing ICP elevations or cerebral edema in patients with SAH, TBI, AIS, ICH, and HE, although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected. Corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH. Differences in therapeutic response and safety may exist between HTS and mannitol. The use of these agents in these critical clinical situations merits close monitoring for adverse effects. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for individualized care of patients with cerebral edema.

### 23.4% sodium chloride versus mannitol for the reduction of intracranial pressure in patients with traumatic brain injury: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^111H142M]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intermittent doses of mannitol or hypertonic saline are recommended to treat elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). However, it is unclear if one agent is more effective than the other. Previous studies have compared mannitol and hypertonic saline in reduction of ICP, with conflicting results. However, no study thus far has compared 23.4% sodium chloride with mannitol.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the difference in absolute reduction of ICP 60 minutes after infusion of 23.4% sodium chloride versus mannitol.

Methods

This was a single-center retrospective cohort study that included patients at least 16 years old admitted to the trauma/surgical intensive care unit between August 8, 2016, and August 30, 2018, who received either 23.4% sodium chloride 30 mL and/or mannitol 0.5 g/kg and had an ICP monitor or external ventricular drain in place. The primary outcome was absolute reduction in ICP 60 minutes after infusion of hyperosmolar therapy.

Results

In all, 31 patients and 162 doses of hyperosmolar therapy were included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary end point of absolute reduction of ICP 60 minutes after infusion of hyperosmolar therapy comparing 23.4% sodium chloride 30 mL with 0.5 g/kg mannitol (P = 0.2929). There was no statistically significant difference found for any secondary end points.

Conclusion and Relevance

No difference was found for absolute reduction of ICP at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, respectively, after infusion of hyperosmolar agent or time to next elevated ICP. Patient-specific parameters should be used to guide the choice of hyperosmolar agent to be administered.

### Emerging roles for dynamic aquaporin-4 subcellular relocalization in CNS water homeostasis [^116pTVRu]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Current available therapies for the treatment of brain oedema are hypertonic mannitol or saline, steroids for tumour-induced brain swelling and, once the oedema becomes life-threatening, decompressive craniotomy. The reliability and validity of the results of high-dose mannitol trials in the treatment of traumatic brain injury have been questioned; a Cochrane review concluded that insufficient evidence was available to recommend mannitol for the management of traumatic brain injury patients. Although hypertonic saline is used to treat brain oedema following ischaemic stroke, a Cochrane review similarly reported that conclusions could not be drawn about the efficacy and safety of hypertonic saline or other intracranial pressure‐lowering agents in the management of acute traumatic brain injury. While the use of steroids did not reduce oedema following stroke, some success was reported in reducing brain tumour-associated oedema with dexamethasone. However, the molecular pathogenesis of tumour-associated oedema is quite different from that of trauma or stroke-associated oedema, as it is primarily driven by neoangiogenesis of vessels under-expressing tight junction proteins within the tumour. A recent study suggested that loss of AQP4 assembly into OAPs may facilitate evasion of apoptosis and enhanced migration in glioma cells, but how this interacts with tumour-associated oedema or AQP4 localization remains unexplored.

Little is known about mechanisms controlling the resolution of brain oedema. Early experiments showed that increased AQP4 expression was associated with oedema resolution, and in a vasogenic oedema model, Aqp4 −/− mice developed significantly increased intracranial pressure compared to wild-type mice, confirming a role for AQP4 in oedema resolution. Understanding this dynamic mechanism, including the role of the glymphatic system, will guide the development of new therapeutic approaches to treating oedema.

### Randomized clinical trial of 20% mannitol versus 3% hypertonic saline in children with raised intracranial pressure due to acute CNS infections [^111vCNEx]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Mannitol is a commonly used osmotherapy agent in raised intracranial pressure. However, the side effects of mannitol are significant. In traumatic brain injury (adult and pediatric), hypertonic saline (3%) shows varied results in comparison with 20% mannitol. We compared the effect of 3% hypertonic saline versus 20% mannitol (using common dosing strategies) on raised intracranial pressure in pediatric acute CNS infections.

Design

Open-label randomized controlled trial.

Setting

PICU of a quaternary care academic institute.

Patients

Children 1–12 years old, with raised intracranial pressure and modified-Glasgow Coma Scale scores less than or equal to 8, were enrolled.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to 20%-mannitol (n = 28), 0.5 gram/kg/dose versus 3%-hypertonic saline (n = 29), 10mL/kg loading followed by 0.5–1mL/kg/hr infusion. An intraparenchymal catheter was used to monitor the intracranial pressure. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieved target average intracranial pressure less than 20mm Hg during 72 hours. Secondary outcomes were interventions, morbidity, and mortality.

Measurements and Main Results

The proportion of patients with target average intracranial pressure (< 20mm Hg) was higher in hypertonic saline-group as compared to mannitol-group (79.3% vs 53.6%; adjusted hazard ratio 2.63; 95% CI: 1.23–5.61). Mean (± SE) reduction of intracranial pressure (-14.3 ± 1.7 vs -5.4 ± 1.7mm Hg; p ≤ 0.001) and elevation of cerebral perfusion pressure (15.4 ± 2.4 vs 6 ± 2.4mm Hg; p = 0.007) from baseline were significant in hypertonic saline-group. Mean (± SE) intracranial pressure over 72 hours was lower (14 ± 2 vs 22 ± 2mm Hg; p = 0.009), and cerebral perfusion pressure was higher (65 ± 2.2 vs 58 ± 2.2; p = 0.032) in hypertonic saline-group. Hypertonic saline-group had higher modified-Glasgow Coma Scale score at 72 hours (median, interquartile range 10; 7–11 vs 7; 3–9; p = 0.003), lower mortality (20.7% vs 35.7%; p = 0.21), shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (5 vs 15 d; p = 0.002), and PICU stay (11 vs 19 d; p = 0.016) and less severe neurodisability at discharge (31% vs 61%; p = 0.049).

Conclusions

In pediatric acute CNS infections, 3%-hypertonic saline was associated with a greater reduction of intracranial pressure as compared to 20% mannitol.

### Mannitol (Osmitrol) [^112dBdQK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity

CNS toxicity manifested by, e.g., confusion, lethargy, coma has been reported in patients treated with mannitol, some resulting in death, in particular in the presence of impaired renal function CNS toxicity may result from high serum mannitol concentrations, serum hyperosmolarity resulting in intracellular dehydration within CNS, hyponatremia or other disturbances of electrolyte and acid/base balance secondary to mannitol administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

At high concentrations, mannitol may cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with the ability of the brain to maintain the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid especially in the presence of acidosis.

In patients with preexisting compromise of the blood brain barrier, the risk of increasing cerebral edema (general and focal) associated with repeated or continued use of OSMITROL must be individually weighed against the expected benefits.

A rebound increase of intracranial pressure may occur several hours after the infusion. Patients with a compromised blood brain barrier are at increased risk.

Concomitant administration of neurotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides) with OSMITROL may potentiate neurotoxicity. Avoid concomitant use of neurotoxic drugs, if possible [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue OSMITROL if CNS toxicity develops [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Osmotherapy in brain edema: a questionable therapy [^113iMZ3C]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that it has been used since the 1960s in diseases associated with brain edema and has been investigated in > 150 publications on head injury, very little has been published on the outcome of osmotherapy. We can only speculate whether osmotherapy improves outcome, has no effect on outcome, or leads to worse outcome. Here we describe the action and potentially beneficial and adverse effects of the 2 most commonly used osmotic solutions, mannitol and hypertonic saline, and present some critical aspects of their use. There is a well-documented transient intracranial pressure (ICP)-reducing effect of osmotherapy, but an adverse rebound increase in ICP after its withdrawal has been discussed extensively in the literature and is an expected pathophysiological phenomenon. From side effects related to renal and pulmonary failure, electrolyte disturbances, and a rebound increase in ICP, osmotherapy can be negative for outcome, which may explain why we lack scientific support for its use. These drawbacks, and the fact that the most recent Cochrane meta-analyses of osmotherapy in brain edema and stroke could not find any beneficial effects on outcome, make routine use of osmotherapy in brain edema doubtful. Nevertheless, the use of osmotherapy as a temporary measure may be justified to acutely prevent brain stem compression until other measures, such as evacuation of space-occupying lesions or decompressive craniotomy, can be performed. This article is the Con part in a Pro-Con debate in the present journal on the general routine use of osmotherapy in brain edema.

### Equimolar doses of mannitol and hypertonic saline in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure [^116xR6A7]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of equimolar doses of 20% mannitol solution and of 7.45% hypertonic saline solution (HSS) in the treatment of patients with sustained elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).

Design

Parallel, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Two intensive care units in a university hospital.

Patients

A total of 20 stable patients with a sustained ICP of > 20 mm Hg secondary to traumatic brain injury (n = 17) or stroke (n = 3).

Interventions

A single equimolar infusion (255 mOsm dose) of either 231 mL of 20% mannitol (mannitol group; n = 10 patients) or 100 mL of 7.45% hypertonic saline (HSS group; n = 10 patients) during 20 mins of administration.

Measurements

ICP, arterial blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, blood flow velocities of middle cerebral artery using continuous transcranial Doppler, brain tissue oxygen tension, serum sodium and osmolality, and urine output during a study period of 120 mins.

Main Results

The two treatments equally and durably reduced ICP during the experiment. At 60 mins after the start of the infusion, ICP was reduced by 45% ± 19% of baseline values (mean ± sd) in the mannitol group vs. 35% ± 14% of baseline values in the HSS group. Cerebral perfusion pressure and diastolic and mean blood flow velocities were durably increased in the mannitol group, resulting in lower values of pulsatility index at the different times of the experiment (p < .01 vs. HSS). No major changes in brain tissue oxygen tension were found after each treatment. Mannitol caused a significantly greater increase in urine output (p < .05) than HSS, although there was no difference in the vascular filling requirement between the two treatments. HSS caused a significant elevation of serum sodium and chloride at 120 mins after the start of the infusion (p < .01).

Conclusions

A single equimolar infusion of 20% mannitol is as effective as 7.45% HSS in decreasing ICP in patients with brain injury. Mannitol exerts additional effects on brain circulation through a possible improvement in blood rheology. Pretreatment factors, such as serum sodium, systemic hemodynamics, and brain hemodynamics, thus should be considered when choosing between mannitol and HSS for patients with increased ICP.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [^116fvbwG]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 and mannitol 15% are effective and safe drugs in the treatment of increased ICP, although 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 is more effective than mannitol. A dose of 1.4 ml/kg can be recommended as an initial dose. The advantage of hypertonic saline can be explained by individual local osmotic effects, because no relevant systemic changes occur. The observed effects on electrolytes and plasma osmolarity are not significantly different between the two osmotic drugs and have no clinical relevance here. Further experimental and clinical research is required to evaluate the optimal administration regime, the best treatment strategies adapted to the individual patient's needs and the impact on patients' morbidity and mortality.

### Mannitol (Osmitrol) [^113Q2biz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances, Hyperosmolarity

Depending on dosage and duration, administration of OSMITROL may result in hypervolemia leading to or exacerbating existing congestive heart failure. Accumulation of mannitol due to insufficient renal excretion increases the risk of hypervolemia. Mannitol-induced osmotic diuresis may cause or worsen dehydration/hypovolemia and hemoconcentration. Administration of OSMITROL may also cause hyperosmolarity [see Description (11)].

Depending on dosage and duration of administration, electrolyte and acid/base imbalances may also result from transcellular shifts in water and electrolytes, osmotic diuresis and/or other mechanisms. Such imbalances may be severe and potentially fatal.

Imbalances that may result from OSMITROL administration include:

Hypernatremia, dehydration and hemoconcentration
Hyponatremia, which can lead to headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, coma, cerebral edema, and death. Acute symptomatic hyponatremic encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency.
Hypo/hyperkalemia. The development of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypokalemia) associated with mannitol administration may result in cardiac adverse reactions in patients receiving drugs that are sensitive to such imbalances (e.g., digoxin, agents that may cause QT prolongation, neuromuscular blocking agents) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].
Other electrolyte disturbances
Metabolic acidosis/alkalosis

Pediatric patients less than two years of age, particularly preterm and term neonates, may be at higher risk for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities following OSMITROL administration due to decreased glomerular filtration rate and limited ability to concentrate urine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor fluid and electrolyte status and discontinue OSMITROL if imbalances occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

5.5 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

During and following OSMITROL infusion for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor:

serum osmolarity, serum electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate) and acid base balance,
the osmol gap
signs of hypo- or hypervolemia, including urine output
renal, cardiac and pulmonary function
intracranial pressure

Discontinue OSMITROL if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see Contraindications (4)].

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — hyperosmolar therapy selection: While the overall quality of evidence in this area is very low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across published studies to suggest that HTS is effective in reducing ICP elevations and cerebral edema. Given these concerns, along with the lack of published articles assessing the impact of mannitol on short-term outcomes, the panel was unable to recommend use of mannitol in this population at this time. Thus, the panel favored HTS over mannitol.

### Hypertonic saline or mannitol for treating elevated intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115gzgnV]. Neurosurgical Review (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperosmolar therapy is regarded as the mainstay for treatment of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in traumatic brain injury (TBI). This still has been disputed as application of hypertonic saline (HS) or mannitol for treating patients with severe TBI. Thus, this meta-analysis was performed to further compare the advantages and disadvantages of mannitol with HS for treating elevated ICP after TBI. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Wan Fang Data, VIP Data, SinoMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Studies were included or not based on the quality assessment by the Jadad scale and selection criteria. Twelve RCTs with 438 patients were enrolled for the meta-analysis. The comparison of HS and mannitol indicated that they were close in field of improving function outcome (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.54, p = 0.258) and reducing intracranial pressure (MD = -0.16, 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.27, p = 0.473) and mortality (RR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.16, p = 0.216). The pooled relative risk of successful ICP control was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.13, p = 0.044), demonstrating that HS was more effective than mannitol in ICP management. Both serum sodium (WMD = 5.30, 95% CI: 4.37 to 6.22, p < 0.001) and osmolality (WMD = 3.03, 95% CI: 0.18 to 5.88, p = 0.037) were increased after injection of hypertonic saline. The results do not lend a specific recommendation to select hypertonic saline or mannitol as a first-line for the patients with elevated ICP caused by TBI. However, for the refractory intracranial hypertension, hypertonic saline seems to be preferred.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [^111NTGQT]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

This prospective randomized clinical study investigated the efficacy and safety of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 (7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5) in comparison with 15% mannitol in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

Methods

Forty neurosurgical patients at risk of increased ICP were randomized to receive either 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 or 15% mannitol at a defined infusion rate, which was stopped when ICP was < 15 mmHg.

Results

Of the 40 patients, 17 patients received 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 and 15 received mannitol 15%. In eight patients, ICP did not exceed 20 mmHg so treatment was not necessary. Both drugs decreased ICP below 15 mmHg (p < 0.0001); 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 within 6.0 (1.2–15.0) min (all results are presented as median (minimum-maximum range)) and mannitol within 8.7 (4.2–19.9) min (p < 0.0002). 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 caused a greater decrease in ICP than mannitol (57% vs 48%; p < 0.01). The cerebral perfusion pressure was increased from 60 (39–78) mmHg to 72 (54–85) mmHg by infusion with 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 (p < 0.0001) and from 61 (47–71) mmHg to 70 (50–79) mmHg with mannitol (p < 0.0001). The mean arterial pressure was increased by 3.7% during the infusion of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 but was not altered by mannitol. There were no clinically relevant effects on electrolyte concentrations and osmolarity in the blood. The mean effective dose to achieve an ICP below 15 mmHg was 1.4 (0.3–3.1) ml/kg for 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 and 1.8 (0.45–6.5) ml/kg for mannitol (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 is more effective than mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased ICP. A dose of 1.4 ml/kg of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 can be recommended as effective and safe. The advantage of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 might be explained by local osmotic effects, because there were no clinically relevant differences in hemodynamic clinical chemistry parameters.

Patient management — intracranial hypertension treatment parameters include a concentration at 0.5 mL/kg (up to 30 mL) over 10 to 20 minutes; less evidence supports the use of mannitol; additionally, a lower hyperventilation target of 28 to 34 mm Hg is recommended in the Tier Two interventions; and moderate prophylactic hypothermia (32–33°C) is not recommended over normothermia to improve overall outcomes, but is suggested for ICP control.

### A systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing hypertonic sodium solutions and mannitol for traumatic brain injury: implications for emergency department management [^117J3g8U]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To comparatively evaluate hypertonic sodium (HTS) and mannitol in patients following acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the outcomes of all-cause mortality, neurological disability, intracranial pressure (ICP) change from baseline, ICP treatment failure, and serious adverse events.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) were searched (inception to November 2015) using hypertonic saline solutions, sodium chloride, mannitol, osmotic diuretic, traumatic brain injury, brain injuries, and head injury. Searches were limited to humans. Clinical practice guidelines and bibliographies were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized trials comparing HTS and mannitol in adults (≥ 16 years) with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8) and elevated ICP were included. ICP elevation, ICP reduction, and treatment failure were defined using study definitions.

Data Synthesis

Of 326 articles screened, 7 trials enrolling a total of 191 patients met inclusion criteria. Studies were underpowered to detect a significant difference in mortality or neurological outcomes. Due to significant heterogeneity and differences in reporting ICP change from baseline, this outcome was not meta-analyzed. No difference between HTS and mannitol was observed for mean ICP reduction; however, risk of ICP treatment failure favored HTS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.18–0.81). Serious adverse events were not reported.

Conclusions

Based on limited data, clinically important differences in mortality, neurological outcomes, and ICP reduction were not observed between HTS or mannitol in the management of severe TBI. HTS appears to lead to fewer ICP treatment failures.

### PRO: osmotherapy for the treatment of acute intracranial hypertension [^114fN8vD]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Persisting severe brain edema causes intracranial hypertension and is associated with poor patient outcome. The treatment of acute intracranial hypertension is complex and multimodal. The most important options for medical treatment include controlled ventilation and osmotherapy, maintenance of brain and body homeostasis, and sedation. Osmotherapy is recommended in all relevant guidelines. The 2 osmotic agents most frequently used are mannitol and hypertonic saline. Both reduce intracranial pressure and improve cerebral perfusion and cerebral oxygen delivery. However, hypertonic saline seems advantageous over mannitol in many situations. In multitrauma patients, hypertonic saline contributes to hemodynamic stabilization and to the prevention of secondary insults. In addition, hypertonic saline has neurohumoral and immunologic effects, which may be beneficial in cerebral resuscitation.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Prior to administration of OSMITROL, evaluate renal, cardiac and pulmonary status of the patient and correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

The total dosage, concentration, and rate of administration depend on the age, weight, and condition of the patient being treated, including fluid requirement, electrolyte balance, serum osmolality, urinary output, and concomitant therapy.

The following outline of administration and dosage is only a general guide to therapy.

Reduction of Intracranial Pressure Usually a maximum reduction in intracranial pressure can be achieved with a dose of 0.25 gram/kg given intravenously as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes which may be repeated every six to eight hours.

During and following OSMITROL infusion, monitor fluid and electrolytes, serum osmolarity, and renal, cardiac and pulmonary function. Discontinue OSMITROL if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5)].

Reduction of Intraocular Pressure

The recommended dosage is 1.5 to 2 grams/kg of a 20% w/v solution (7.5 to 10 mL/kg) or as a 15% w/v solution (10 to 13 mL/kg) as a single dose administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. When used preoperatively, administer OSMITROL sixty to ninety minutes before surgery to achieve maximal reduction of intraocular pressure before operation.

5.5 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor:

serum osmolarity, serum electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate) and acid/base balance,
the osmol gap
signs of hypo- or hypervolemia, including urine output
renal, cardiac, and pulmonary function
intracranial pressure
Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].

5.6 Infusion Site Reactions

The infusion of hypertonic solutions through a peripheral vein, including Mannitol Injection, may result in peripheral venous irritation, including phlebitis. Other severe infusion site reactions, such as compartment syndrome and swelling associated with extravasation, can occur with administration of Mannitol Injection [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)]. Mannitol Injection is preferably administered through a central venous catheter [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)].

5.7 Interference with Laboratory Tests

High concentrations of mannitol can cause false low results for inorganic phosphorus blood concentrations [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.6)].

Mannitol may produce false positive results in tests for blood ethylene glycol concentrations [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.6)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis: Stop infusion immediately if hypersensitivity reactions develop. (5.1)
Renal Complications Including Renal Failure: Risk factors include pre-existing renal disease, conditions that put patients at risk for renal failure and concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs or other diuretics. Avoid use of nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal function worsens. (5.2, 8.6)
Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity: Confusion, lethargy, and coma may occur during or after infusion. Concomitant neurotoxic drugs may potentiate toxicity. Avoid use of neurotoxic drugs. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if CNS toxicity develops. (5.3)
Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances, Hyperosmolarity: Hypervolemia may exacerbate congestive heart failure; hyponatremia can lead to encephalopathy; hypo/hyperkalemia can result in cardiac adverse reactions in sensitive patients. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if fluid and/or electrolyte imbalances occur. (5.4)
Monitoring/Laboratory Tests: Monitor fluid and electrolytes, serum osmolarity and renal, cardiac, and pulmonary function. Discontinue if toxicity develops. (5.5)
Infusion Site Reactions: May cause irritation and inflammation, as well as severe reactions (compartment syndrome) when associated with extravasation. (5.6)
Interference with Laboratory Tests: High concentrations of mannitol may cause false low results of inorganic phosphorus blood concentrations. Mannitol may produce false positive results for blood ethylene glycol. (5.7, 7.6)

### Increases in spinal fluid osmolarity induced by mannitol [^111THcAB]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Mannitol is widely used in hospitals worldwide to treat patients with high intracranial pressure and/or cerebral edema. One of the mechanisms by which mannitol is thought to affect intracranial pressure is by increasing the patient's serum osmolarity, but not the osmolarity in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid. In this way, mannitol is thought to increase the osmolarity gap between the brain and the blood, which in turn leads to removal of excess water from the brain. However, relatively little is known regarding long-term effects of mannitol on osmolarity of cerebrospinal fluid. We therefore sought to determine the effects of mannitol administration on the osmolarity of cerebrospinal fluid.

Design

Controlled trial.

Setting

University teaching hospital.

Patients

Patients with severe head injury and patients with subarachnoid bleeding who required insertion of an intracranial probe.

Measurements and Main Results

Serum and cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity were measured before and during mannitol administration in ten patients treated with mannitol for ≥ 72 hrs (group 1), ten patients treated for 24 to 48 hrs (group 2), and ten controls (group 3). Serum osmolarity increased quickly in all patients receiving mannitol (groups 1 and 2), whereas remaining constant in controls. Average cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity slowly increased in all patients receiving mannitol; cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity increased from (mean ± sd) 291.5 ± 4.0 to 315.5 ± 4.5 mOsm/kg after 96 hrs in group 1 (p < .01), and from 288.9 ± 3.5 to 296.9 ± 6.2 mOsm/kg after 48 hrs in group 2 (p < .01). Cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity remained constant in controls (p < .01 for group 1 vs. group 3 and for group 2 vs. group 3, respectively). In group 1, the gap between serum and cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity initially increased (which was the desired effect), but later decreased first to baseline values and then to below-normal levels.

Conclusions

Long-term administration of mannitol can induce significant increases in cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage or severe head injury. This may be an undesirable and potentially dangerous effect. Therefore, cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity should be measured regularly in all patients receiving mannitol for longer than 24 hrs. If cerebrospinal fluid osmolarity increases, discontinuation or tapering of mannitol therapy should be considered.

Concomitant administration of neurotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides) with Mannitol Injection may potentiate neurotoxicity. Avoid concomitant use of neurotoxic drugs, if possible [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3)].

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if CNS toxicity develops [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

5.4 Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances, Hyperosmolarity

Depending on dosage and duration, administration of Mannitol Injection may result in hypervolemia leading to or exacerbating existing congestive heart failure. Accumulation of mannitol due to insufficient renal excretion increases the risk of hypervolemia. Mannitol-induced osmotic diuresis may cause or worsen dehydration/hypovolemia and hemoconcentration. Administration of Mannitol Injection may also cause hyperosmolarity [see DESCRIPTION (11)].

Depending on dosage and duration of administration, electrolyte and acid/base imbalances may also result from transcellular shifts in water and electrolytes, osmotic diuresis, and/or other mechanisms. Such imbalances may be severe and potentially fatal.

Imbalances that may result from administration of Mannitol Injection include:

Hypernatremia, dehydration, and hemoconcentration
Hyponatremia, which can lead to headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, coma, cerebral edema, and death. Acute symptomatic hyponatremic encephalopathy is considered a medical emergency.
Hypo/hyperkalemia. The development of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypokalemia) associated with mannitol administration may result in cardiac adverse reactions in patients receiving drugs that are sensitive to such imbalances (e.g., digoxin, agents that may cause QT prolongation, neuromuscular blocking agents) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.4)].
Other electrolyte disturbances
Metabolic acidosis/alkalosis
Pediatric patients less than two years of age, particularly preterm and term neonates, may be at higher risk for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities following administration of Mannitol Injection due to decreased glomerular filtration rate and limited ability to concentrate urine [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4)].
During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor fluid and electrolyte status and discontinue Mannitol Injection if imbalances occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^113ciAaA]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

The pharmacologic treatment of cerebral edema should be guided whenever possible by the underlying pathology. The available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing ICP elevations or cerebral edema in patients with SAH, TBI, AIS, ICH, and HE, although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected. This finding is consistent with many other interventions used in the acute care of patients with neurological conditions in that treatments may affect an immediate abnormality, but outcomes are often influenced by multiple factors that may be beyond the awareness or control of the treating team (e.g. comorbidities, associated injuries, rehabilitation availability, etc.). Corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH. Differences in therapeutic response and safety may exist between HTS and mannitol. The use of these agents in these critical clinical situations merits close monitoring for adverse effects.

Discussion

The strong relationship between incidence of increased ICP and outcome in patients with neuronal damage emphasizes the vulnerability of the injured brain and the need for adequate treatment. The management of severely injured neurosurgical patients has changed over recent decades, especially regarding the introduction and acceptance of clinical guidelines among neurosurgeons and intensivists. It has become a generally accepted treatment goal to keep the CPP above 70 mmHg, because episodes of CPP < 60 mmHg or ICP > 20 mmHg are associated with a worse outcome. These goals are incorporated into current treatment protocols, which are constantly analyzed with regards to their efficacy and feasibility, and updated accordingly. Osmotic agents are important components of all treatment protocols, especially mannitol as it is a well-established treatment for increased ICP following brain injury. Surveys of the critical care management of head-injured patients show that 83% of the centers in the United States and 100% of the centers in the United Kingdom used mannitol to control ICP. The clinical use of mannitol is, however, limited by renal complications and the fast increase of the osmotic gradient followed by its reversal due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, mannitol (at concentrations which may be reached in clinical conditions) and the hyperosmotic stress itself can activate the process of apoptotic cell death.

Acute ischemic stroke — hyperosmolar therapy and outcomes: The panel felt there was enough consistency across published studies to suggest that both hypertonic sodium solutions (HTS) and mannitol are effective in reducing intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations and cerebral edema in acute ischemic stroke (AIS), yet the overall evidence does not support routine hyperosmolar therapy to improve neurological outcome following AIS and the use of prophylactic mannitol may be associated with harm; supporting data include an outdated randomized controlled trial of 77 patients with AIS reporting no change in neurological outcome after a single daily dose of 0.8 to 0.9 g/kg mannitol for 10 days and two large retrospective cohorts reporting increased risk of death at 30 days and/or greater functional dependency with prophylactic scheduled mannitol doses.

### Comparison of intracranial pressure measurements before and after hypertonic saline or mannitol treatment in children with severe traumatic brain injury [^11792Hpk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

An unanticipated finding is that the overall association of hyperosmolar therapies with ICP and CPP appeared more modest than in previous studies, in which typical reductions in ICP after HTS or mannitol were approximately 5 mm Hg. Several factors may have contributed. Although we compared ICP and CPP in the hour before and after the bolus, the values were only collected hourly. Thus, we likely did not capture the most severe derangement that prompted the clinical response, leading to an underestimate of the treatment outcome. In addition, previous studies, have limited analyses to instances when ICP was generally greater than 20 mm Hg, which we observed for only 21.6% of boluses. It is possible that the care encompassed by ADAPT includes bolus hyperosmolar administration on a fixed schedule to prevent intracranial hypertension, again leading to a diminishment of the observed treatment outcome. When we examined the outcome of bolus administration of either agent in patients with intracranial hypertension (ICP > 20, > 25, or > 30 mm Hg), treatment outcomes consistent with prior studies, were observed. The use of decompressive craniectomy and cerebrospinal fluid diversion, both of which might affect the hyperosmolar therapies, was common. Lastly, the timing of the use of hyperosmolar therapy could also influence the magnitude of its effect. However, when we examined the first dose of hyperosmolar therapy, the associations with ICP and CPP mirrored those of the overall cohort.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. The marked practice variability in the use of hyperosmolar therapy (infusion, bolus, combination therapy, and concentrations) was so great that it was necessary to focus only on bolus administration of medications and only 3% HTS, limiting our ability to compare the various preparations used. We focused on hyperosmolar therapies during a 1-hour epoch, and although well supported, this approach may not fully capture acute vascular and more sustained parenchymal actions. Two centers contributed approximately 40% of the data on mannitol boluses, which could introduce bias. Finally, although ADAPT included valuable data on patients with abusive head trauma and penetrating TBI, these factors might alter the association between hyperosmolar therapy and ICP and CPP. Additional studies of these subgroups are warranted.

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^113pDEPU]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — evidence comparing hypertonic saline versus mannitol in traumatic brain injury reports that a Cochrane systematic review included six trials with 91% of participants having severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and, based on worst-case, best-case and per-protocol results, showed no difference in mortality at 6 months or for poor outcome, with both hypertonic saline and mannitol tending to be reported as effective in reducing elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and greater benefits noted in some studies with hypertonic saline; a rebound phenomenon following mannitol was reported and no other adverse effects were reported in remaining trials. In pediatric populations, a randomized trial of 200 intensive care unit patients with elevated ICP found that 3% sodium chloride decreased coma compared to mannitol without a mortality benefit and mannitol was associated with acute tubular necrosis, while another trial comparing bolus doses of 3% hypertonic saline versus mannitol included 518 children with severe TBI, showing a statistically significant decrease in ICP and increase in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) with hypertonic saline bolus administration and mannitol observed to increase CPP, with hypertonic saline associated with a greater reduction in ICP using unadjusted data but after adjusting for confounders the associations of both agents with ICP and CPP were not different; during periods of increased ICP, greater improvements were observed with 3% hypertonic saline than mannitol and this difference persisted for an ICP greater than 25 mmHg.

### The antiedematous effect of exogenous lactate therapy in traumatic brain injury: a physiological and mechanistic approach [^11395Gpy]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Brain edema is a major complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). It increases the risk of intracranial hypertension (ICH) and brain hypoxia, leading to an increase in mortality and poor neurologic outcome. Increased water content in the injured brain can be related to a vasogenic or cellular pathway. Osmotherapy, by using mannitol or hypertonic saline (HS), is recommended and currently administered for the treatment of ICH in this setting. Beside these two usual treatments, sodium lactate (SL), a metabolic and neuroprotective solution, has recently been described as having similar effects on lowering intracranial pressure (ICP). In a previous study, conducted in patients with severe TBI, Ichai et al. reported that a bolus of half-molar SL was more effective than equimolar doses of mannitol to reduce elevated ICP (less refractory ICH and higher and longer reduction of ICP). In another clinical trial, a continuous infusion of SL over the first 48 h was shown to prevent by 50% the number of raised ICP episodes after severe TBI. Although mannitol was responsible for plasma hyperosmolarity, no significant increase in plasma osmolarity was observed following SL perfusion. Moreover, in these studies, chloride balance in the SL-treated group was equivalent to that in the sodium chloride-treated group, suggesting that chloride excretion is possibly improved with SL infusion. Consequently, other mechanisms than those associated with a purely osmotic effect might be present.

ICP and CPP

Prior to administration of the study medication, the mean ICP was 23 (19–30) mmHg in the mannitol group and 22 (19–31) mmHg in the hypertonic saline group (p = NS). After infusion with mannitol, the ICP decreased to 14 (7–20) mmHg and after infusion with hypertonic saline it decreased to 15 (8–18) mmHg (p < 0.0001). This effect was achieved within 8.7 (4.2–19.9) min by mannitol and 6.0 (1.2–15.0) min by hypertonic saline (p < 0.0002) and maintained over the 1 h observation period. The lowest ICP was 12 (6–19) mmHg in the mannitol and 10 (6–14) mmHg in the hypertonic saline group (p < 0.05), observed 30 min after the end of infusion. Thus, the maximum decrease in ICP produced by hypertonic saline was 57% and that of mannitol 48%. Sixty minutes after the end of infusion, the ICP in the hypertonic saline group was still lower than that of the mannitol group (11 (5–18) mmHg; vs 14 (7–20) mmHg; p < 0.005) (Fig. 2, Table 2).

Prior to administration of study medication, the mean CPP was 61 (47–71) mmHg in the mannitol and 60 (39–78) mmHg in the hypertonic saline group (p = NS; Fig. 3). At the end of infusion, a significant increase of CPP to 70 (50–79) mmHg after mannitol infusion (p < 0.0001) and 72 (54–85) mmHg after hypertonic saline infusion (p < 0.0001) occurred. This improvement was maintained during the whole study period. The maximal increase in CPP occurred in both groups after 30 min (mannitol +18%; hypertonic saline +27%; p < 0.05). CPP was significantly higher in the hypertonic saline group (p < 0.01, Fig. 3, Table 2) 30 and 60 min after the end of infusion.

### Hypertonic saline versus other intracranial-pressure-lowering agents for patients with acute traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gBJA2]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key Findings

Our systematic review identified ten RCTs enrolling 760 patients of all ages with acute TBI. The main findings were the following: (1) there was no evidence of an effect of HTS compared with other agents (mainly mannitol) on long-term neurological outcome in patients with raised ICP; (2) similarly, there was no evidence of a beneficial effect of HTS on all-cause mortality, uncontrolled ICP, length of hospital or ICU stay, and ICP reduction; and (3) HTS may be associated with increased risk of adverse hypernatremia. However, 95% CIs were wide for all studied outcomes. Thus, it is difficult to elucidate clinically meaningful differences between HTS and other ICP-lowering strategies, including mannitol.

Overall, our results challenge previous studies that suggest HTS is more effective than its comparators (e.g. mannitol) and are congruent with findings of a recent Cochrane review that showed there is weak evidence that HTS is no better than mannitol for long-term management of TBI. Despite the finding that HTS is associated with adverse hypernatremia compared with other agents, this result should be interpreted with caution because one large multicenter trial accounts for the majority of the weighting for this point estimate. Importantly, this trial investigated the continuous infusion (at least 48 h) of a higher concentration of HTS (20%) than is normally used clinically (range 1.8–5%). Thus, it is possible that prolonged continuous infusion of concentrated HTS is largely responsible for the apparent increased risk of hypernatremia in the patients studied. On the contrary, other studies have reported no difference in plasma sodium concentration when comparing patients receiving HTS versus those receiving mannitol boluses, which might suggest a failure to achieve a hyperosmolar state when certain administration techniques are used. The effect of bolus versus continuous infusion of HTS on plasma sodium levels should be explored further to determine whether there is an optimum administration method to achieve a therapeutic hyperosmolar state without resulting in adverse hypernatremia.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [^116qQXUH]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

The 15 patients in the mannitol group had a total of 53 episodes of increased ICP exceeding 20 mmHg requiring infusion of study medication (3.5 treatments/patient). For 49 of these episodes (92.5%), infusion of mannitol was effective and reduced ICP to < 15 mmHg within 8.7 (4.2–19.9) min. For one episode, mannitol produced a delayed effect, appearing 20 min after application of a total of 235 mL mannitol (2.6 ml/kg). In three episodes, however, ICP could not be reduced below 15 mmHg by an infusion of up to 2.1 ml/kg of mannitol. In two of these patients, thiopental was given intravenously at up to 3 mg/kg and in one patient a unilateral decompressive craniectomy was performed.

In the 17 patients in the hypertonic saline group, 57 periods of increased ICP occurred (3.3 treatments/patient). 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 was effective in 55 episodes (96.5%), reducing ICP to < 15 mmHg within 6.0 (1.2–15.0) min. In one episode, hypertonic saline (3 ml/kg) was only effective after an additional bolus of thiopental 3 mg/kg was given and, in another episode, ICP could not be reduced below 15 mmHg by an infusion of up to 3.1 ml/kg of hypertonic saline. Finally, mild hyperventilation (etCO 2 ~28–30 mmHg) achieved the target ICP value < 15 mmHg.

The median dose of mannitol (145 (70–332) ml/application; 1.8 (0.45–6.5) ml/kg) required to reduce ICP below 15 mmHg was significantly higher than that of hypertonic saline (100 (35–250) ml/application; 1.4 (0.3–3.1) ml/kg). Repeated administration of mannitol caused an increase of the required single dose in six out of 15 patients (40%) and a decrease in two patients (13%). Repeated administration of hypertonic saline caused an increase of the required single dose in two patients (12%) and a decrease in seven patients (41%).

### Management of intracranial pressure in tuberculous meningitis [^113sTN2y]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) remains a common serious neurological emergency especially in the developing world. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is often a feature of severe TBM and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The pathology associated with TBM, such as cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, tuberculoma(s), and infarcts related to arthritis, contribute to increase in intracranial volume and, therefore, elevated ICP. The three types of edema (vasogenic, cytotoxic, and interstitial) may contribute to cerebral edema. The molecular mechanisms underlying the events that ultimately lead to brain damage and cerebral edema during infection are complex. Similarly to bacterial meningitis, cerebral blood flow autoregulation is probably impaired in TBM, and the mechanisms are unclear. Although no universal guidelines are available to institute ICP monitoring in patients with severe TBM, it is be prudent to monitor patients at risk for increases in ICP. Such an approach helps to detect the secondary brain insults, allowing for a more informed approach to treatment. Treatment of elevated ICP involves a multipronged approach. The first step should be to identify focal brain lesions and hydrocephalus (which require surgical intervention) by brain imaging. Cerebral edema is treated with hyperosmolar agents. Mannitol is currently the most commonly used agent. It appears that use of hypertonic saline as an osmotic agent in infection-related cerebral edema has certain advantages. However, this needs to be established by well-designed trials. Use of steroids reduces not only cerebral edema but also the production of cytokines and other chemicals involved in the immunopathogenesis of TBM. Fever associated with TBM should be aggressively treated, because fever can worsen the impact of elevated ICP. Hyponatremia may complicate TBM and requires appropriate correction because it can aggravate cerebral edema.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^117VGETw]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical Care Society guideline — acute treatment of cerebral edema states that the available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations or cerebral edema in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and hepatic encephalopathy (HE), although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected; corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH, and differences in therapeutic response and safety may exist between hypertonic saline (HTS) and mannitol, and the use of these agents in these critical clinical situations merits close monitoring for adverse effects. The panel generated recommendations regarding initial management of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, bacterial meningitis, and hepatic encephalopathy, and there is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for individualized care of patients with cerebral edema.

### Comparison of mannitol and hypertonic saline in the treatment of severe brain injuries [^116WZZmE]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Object

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of mannitol and hypertonic saline in doses of similar osmotic burden for the treatment of intracranial hypertension in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

Methods

The authors used an alternating treatment protocol to compare the effect of hypertonic saline with that of mannitol given for episodes of increased intracranial pressure in patients treated for severe head injury at their hospital during 2006–2008. Standard guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury were followed. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) was treated either with mannitol or hypertonic saline. Doses of similar osmotic burden (mannitol 20%, 2 ml/kg, infused over 20 minutes, or saline 15%, 0.42 ml/kg, administered as a bolus via a central venous catheter) were given alternately to the individual patient with severe brain injury during episodes of increased pressure. The dependent variables were the extent and duration of reduction of increased ICP. The choice of agent for treatment of the initial hypertensive event was determined on a randomized basis; treatment was alternated for every subsequent event in each individual patient. Reduction of ICP and duration of action were recorded after each event. Results obtained after mannitol administration were statistically compared with those obtained after hypertonic saline administration.

Results

Data pertaining to 199 hypertensive events in 29 patients were collected. The mean decrease in ICP obtained with mannitol was 7.96 mm Hg and that obtained with hypertonic saline was 8.43 mm Hg (p = 0.586, equal variances assumed). The mean duration of effect was 3 hours 33 minutes for mannitol and 4 hours 17 minutes for hypertonic saline (p = 0.40, equal variances assumed).

Conclusions

No difference between the 2 medications could be found with respect to the extent of reduction of ICP or duration of action.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [^1142r6bB]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Hypertonic saline has also been used to reduce ICP in patients with brain tumors or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Suarez et al. reported a significant decrease of ICP and increase of CPP in these patients, when application of mannitol had been previously unsuccessful. Similar results were observed by Horn et al. in patients with traumatic brain injury and subarachnoidal hemorrhage, where hypertonic saline 7.5% adequately reduced ICP after mannitol therapy had failed.

Based on these findings, patients with isolated head trauma can also be expected to benefit from hypertonic saline. This patient population covers some specific patho-physiological conditions, characterized by diffuse axonal injuries, hemorrhages, and necrotic and edematous tissue, which can lead to different therapeutic strategies and a failed positive effect of hypertonic saline compared with patients with other intracranial mass lesions. Munar et al. investigated the acute effects of 7.2% hypertonic saline on ICP, cerebral blood flow and systemic hemodynamics in patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury during the first 72 h after injury. Hypertonic saline significantly reduces ICP without changes in MAP and relative global cerebral blood flow, expressed as 1/AVDO 2. These results suggest that hypertonic saline decreases ICP by means of an osmotic mechanism.

Not all studies, however, reported positive effects of hypertonic saline on ICP, especially if hypertonic saline was infused continuously. Qureshi et al. analyzed the effect of continuous administration of hypertonic saline 2% or 3% in patients with head trauma. They reported a higher in-hospital mortality rate in patients receiving hypertonic solutions and described no favorable impact on the rate of necessary medical interventions during the patient's treatment in the ICU. The influence of hypertonic saline on the supposedly disrupted BBB after head injury was mainly used to explain the failed effect. A disrupted BBB can lead to an accumulation of sodium resulting in an reversal of the osmotic gradient with concomitant increase of ICP. However, Hartl et al. demonstrated a reduced water content in areas with a disturbed BBB in a model with or without a focal cryogenic brain lesion and hemorrhagic shock.

### The history of urea as a hyperosmolar agent to decrease brain swelling [^117Jwda8]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

In 1919, it was observed that intravascular osmolar shifts could collapse the thecal sac and diminish the ability to withdraw CSF from the lumbar cistern. This led to the notion that hyperosmolar compounds could ameliorate brain swelling. Since then, various therapeutic interventions have been used for the reduction of intracranial pressure and brain volume. Urea was first used as an osmotic agent for the reduction of brain volume in 1950. It was associated with greater efficacy and consistency than alternatives such as hyperosmolar glucose. Its use became the standard of clinical practice by 1957, in both the intensive care unit and operating room, to reduce intracranial pressure and brain bulk and was the first hyperosmolar compound to have widespread use. However, the prime of urea was rather short lived. Reports of side effects and complications associated with urea emerged. These included coagulopathy, hemoglobinuria, electrocardiography changes, tissue necrosis with extravasation, and a significant potential for rebound intracranial hypertension. Mannitol was introduced in 1961 as a comparable and potentially superior alternative to urea. However, mannitol was initially purported to be less effective at rapidly reducing intracranial pressure. The debate over the two compounds continued for a decade until mannitol eventually replaced urea by the late 1960s and early 1970s as the hyperosmolar agent of choice due to the ease of preparation, chemical stability, and decreased side effect profile. Although urea is not currently the standard of care today, its rise and eventual replacement by mannitol played a seminal role in both our understanding of cerebral edema and the establishment of strategies for its management.

### Comparison of intracranial pressure measurements before and after hypertonic saline or mannitol treatment in children with severe traumatic brain injury [^1128ypXf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Current Recommendations for Hyperosmolar Therapy

Current guidelines include a level 2 recommendation for a 3% HTS bolus at doses between 2 and 5 mL/kg for patients with intracranial hypertension, defined as an ICP greater than 20 mm Hg. In a subsequent literature search, we identified 8 additional studies on HTS. A single-center studycompared mannitol and HTS in 30 patients in India and reported a 5– to 7–mm Hg decrease in ICP and a 6–mm Hg increase in CPP that did not differ between groups. In contrast, a retrospective studyof 16 children did not detect a significant reduction or increase in CPP after administration of HTS or mannitol. A retrospective studycompared 3%, 6%, and 12% HTS in 43 children with sTBI and, surprisingly, found a concentration-dependent reduction in ICP of 4.5, 6.6, and 10.5 mm Hg, respectively, despite using equimolar doses of the medications. Three studies, addressed prehospital or emergency department use. Finally, 2 systematic reviews, concluded that there was a paucity of high-quality data, making it difficult to draw conclusions.

### Mannitol versus hypertonic saline for brain relaxation in patients undergoing craniotomy [^1111mJ3Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with brain tumour usually suffer from increased pressure in the skull due to swelling of brain tissue. A swollen brain renders surgical removal of the brain tumour difficult. To ease surgical tumour removal, measures are taken to reduce brain swelling, often referred to as brain relaxation. Brain relaxation can be achieved with intravenous fluids such as mannitol or hypertonic saline. This review was conducted to find out which of the two fluids may have a greater impact on brain relaxation.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to compare the effects of mannitol versus those of hypertonic saline on intraoperative brain relaxation in patients undergoing craniotomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 10), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1966 to October 2013) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1980 to October 2013). We also searched specific websites, such as www.indmed.nic.in, www.cochrane-sadcct.org and www. Clinicaltrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of hypertonic saline versus mannitol for brain relaxation. We also included studies in which any other method used for intraoperative brain relaxation was compared with mannitol or hypertonic saline. Primary outcomes were longest follow-up mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale score at three months and any adverse events related to mannitol or hypertonic saline. Secondary outcomes were intraoperative brain relaxation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standardized methods for conducting a systematic review, as described by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a fixed-effect model when no evidence was found of significant heterogeneity between studies, and a random-effects model when heterogeneity was likely.

Main Results

We included six RCTs with 527 participants. Only one RCT was judged to be at low risk of bias. The remaining five RCTs were at unclear or high risk of bias. No trial mentioned the primary outcomes of longest follow-up mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale score at three months or any adverse events related to mannitol or hypertonic saline. Three trials mentioned the secondary outcomes of intraoperative brain relaxation, hospital stay and ICU stay; quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. Brain relaxation was inadequate in 42 of 197 participants in the hypertonic saline group and in 68 of 190 participants in the mannitol group. The risk ratio for brain bulge or tense brain in the hypertonic saline group was 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.83, low-quality evidence). One trial reported ICU and hospital stay. The mean (standard deviation (SD)) duration of ICU stay in the mannitol and hypertonic saline groups was 1.28 (0.5) and 1.25 (0.5) days (P value 0.64), respectively; the mean (SD) duration of hospital stay in the mannitol and hypertonic saline groups was 5.7 (0.7) and 5.7 (0.8) days (P value 1.00), respectively

Authors' Conclusions

From the limited data available on the use of mannitol and hypertonic saline for brain relaxation during craniotomy, it is suggested that hypertonic saline significantly reduces the risk of tense brain during craniotomy. A single trial suggests that ICU stay and hospital stay are comparable with the use of mannitol or hypertonic saline. However, focus on other related important issues such as long-term mortality, long-term outcome, adverse events and quality of life is needed.

### Hypertonic saline in critical care: a review of the literature and guidelines for use in hypotensive States and raised intracranial pressure [^113BgkGP]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been in clinical use for many decades. Its osmotic and volume-expanding properties make it theoretically useful for a number of indications in critical care. This literature review evaluates the use of hypertonic saline in critical care. The putative mechanism of action is presented, followed by a narrative review of its clinical usefulness in critical care. The review was conducted using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network method for the review of cohort studies, randomised-controlled trials and meta-analyses. The review focuses specifically on blood pressure restoration and outcome benefit in both haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic shock, and the management of raised intracranial pressure. Issues of clinical improvement and outcome benefit are addressed. Hypertonic saline solutions are effective for blood pressure restoration in haemorrhagic, but not other, types of shock. There is no survival benefit with the use of hypertonic saline solutions in shock. Hypertonic saline solutions are effective at reducing intracranial pressure in conditions causing acute intracranial hypertension. There is no survival or outcome benefit with the use of hypertonic saline solutions for raised intracranial pressure. Recommendations for clinical use and future directions of clinical research are presented.

### The role for osmotic agents in children with acute encephalopathies: a systematic review [^115V82Dn]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is a recognized feature of both traumatic and non-traumatic encephalopathies. It impairs cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), leading to ischaemia, and may cause death by compressing the brainstem during intracranial herniation. Raised ICP has consistently been shown to be an important determinant of outcome in children with central nervous system (CNS) infections and traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Management of raised ICP is aimed at optimizing CPP and oxygen supply to the brain in addition to reducing ICP. Methods to reduce ICP include postural changes, temperature regulation, hyperventilation, sedation, drainage of cerebro-spinal fluid, operative decompression, and the most widely used, osmotherapy.

Osmotherapy entails the use of pharmacologically inert substances that increase the osmotic pressure of plasma, promoting movement of water from interstitial space to vascular space. Osmotic agents include mannitol, urea, sorbitol, glycerol and hypertonic saline (HS). Although these agents act mainly by reducing ICP via an osmotic gradient, they may have other beneficial effects. Thus, mannitol has been shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species, reduce the viscosity of blood, improving its flow through the circulation, and cause vasoconstriction, reducing cerebral blood volume. Hypertonic saline is an effective volume expander which improves systemic haemodynamics and increases CPP. In animal models, it has also been shown to enhance cerebral microcirculation by reducing adhesions of polymorphonuclear cells and by stimulating local release of nitric oxide.

Guidelines for use of osmotic agents have been developed from adult TBI studies. However, these have been adapted for children with minimal evidence obtained directly from children with TBI. Among children with non-traumatic encephalopathies, guidelines are virtually non-existent. In a postal survey of raised ICP management protocols in UK hospitals, practices varied greatly between hospitals. Monitoring for patients with non-traumatic encephalopathy was seldom considered and thus, little consideration was given for use of osmotic agents in this group.

We performed this review to determine the best available evidence on the effectiveness of various osmotic agents and their effect on resolution of coma and outcome (neurological sequelae and mortality) in children with acute encephalopathies.

Regarding specific circumstances for cerebral edema, more specifically with respect to patients with traumatic brain injury, BTF 2017 guidelines recommend to consider administering mannitol (0.25–1 g/kg body weight) to control raised ICP. Avoid arterial hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg).

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^114arBeE]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

While the use of a continuous infusion of HTS titrated to sodium goals is a common practice in neurocritical care, use of this strategy in AIS has only been evaluated in two studies which had conflicting results. One evaluation suggested that the use of continuous HTS to target a serum sodium concentration of 145–155 mEq/L may be associated with fewer ICP crises per patient, while the other demonstrated no difference. Based on the available evidence, the use of 3% NaCl to target a specific serum sodium concentration does not consistently demonstrate reductions in ICP crises and does not appear to improve neurological outcome in patients with AIS.

Overall, both mannitol and HTS appear to be effective in reducing ICP and cerebral edema in patients with AIS. Given the limitations of the above studies (small sample size, heterogeneous populations, insufficient information on osmolar load), we cannot definitively conclude that one hyperosmolar therapy agent is clearly superior to the other for ICP reduction. However, it appears HTS may have a more rapid onset of action, a more robust and durable ICP reduction, and may be advantageous for patients in whom mannitol failed.

After having established the potential benefits of hyperosmolar therapy in improving intracranial pressure, the panel next evaluated 10 studies that focused on hyperosmolar therapy to improve neurological outcome in AIS. Of these studies, only one was an RCT (which compared mannitol to no hyperosmolar therapy). Only two other studies classified outcomes separately between mannitol and HTS in AIS; however, these studies did not directly compare these treatments and therefore an analysis of the relative efficacy was not possible. Of these studies, hyperosmolar therapies were administered in a number of different ways, ranging from scheduled daily dosing, dosing to a specific serum sodium target (in the case of HTS), or intermittent dosing over the period of several days. The indication for hyperosmolar therapy was also variable: ICP elevation, cerebral edema, or prophylactic.

Intracranial Pressure

ICP was monitored in 7 studies; 2 RCTs, 4 observational studies and one case report. In one RCT, ringer's lactate was compared to HS for resuscitation of 32 children with traumatic brain injuries. More interventions for raised ICP were used in the Ringer's lactate group compared to the HS group (P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the mean ICPs between the two groups after the interventions. In a crossover trial that included 18 children with TBI, there was a significant drop from the initial ICP with use of HS(P = 0.003) compared to normal saline (P = 0.32).

Hypertonic saline given as a continuous infusion in a study of 10 children with TBI achieved a significant and sustained reduction of ICP that was maintained over 72 hours (P < 0.01). These children had raised ICP that was refractory to other management strategies including the use of bolus infusions of mannitol. Among 23 children with cerebral malaria, a dose-response effect with use of boluses of mannitol was observed in moderately raised ICP (ICP > 20 mmHg, CPP < 50 mmHg) but not with severely raised ICP (ICP > 40 mmHg, CPP < 40 mmHg). In a study of 3 children with TBI, oral glycerol was shown to reduce ICP by at least 50% within the first half hour of administration and maximally after 60 minutes. This reduction was not maintained beyond 90 minutes. A case report of two children with TBI showed a dose response relationship between both HS and mannitol, and ICP. However, mannitol appeared to cause a reduction in CPP.

All the five studies that investigated HS demonstrated a dose-response effect on ICP irrespective of the saline concentrations.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^116taJ1E]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel discussed at length the lack of high-quality evidence supporting preferential use of one hyperosmolar agent as first line treatment of elevated ICP in TBI. Several meta-analyses have reached conflicting conclusions; some found no difference in ICP-related outcomes in TBI patients, whereas others favored HTS. Differences in the statistical analysis across these meta-analyses may have accounted for the variance in results.

Some advantages of HTS over mannitol have been observed in direct comparison, crossover, and rescue therapy randomized studies. HTS may have a quicker onset of action, a more robust and durable ICP reduction, and may be advantageous in patients in whom mannitol failed. Hypertonic sodium solutions with either a chloride, lactate, or bicarbonate salt seem to all be effective. The panel felt that there was consistency across the numerous, lower-quality studies that HTS was more effective than mannitol for reducing ICP or cerebral edema in this population.

Several meta-analyses and RCTs have demonstrated no significant difference in neurological outcomes when comparing various hyperosmolar therapies. It is notable that two of the RCTs used equi-osmolar doses of HTS and mannitol, whereas the third used twofold higher osmolar dose of 7.5% NaCl compared to mannitol. Another prospective study pooled data from three separate trials and evaluated target-based infusions of 20% NaCl compared to standard care. Overall there was no difference in long-term neurological outcomes between groups, but patients who received 20% NaCl exhibited a reduced mortality rate at 90 days in a propensity-score-adjusted analysis (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.36–2.23). Nevertheless, the weight of the current evidence does not support the use of hyperosmolar therapies for the specific purpose of improving neurological outcomes.

### Superior effect of hypertonic saline over mannitol to attenuate cerebral edema in a rabbit bacterial meningitis model [^111zgzJh]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Adjunctive therapies that reduce the cerebral edema in bacterial meningitis include osmotic agents. There is a lack of information comparing mannitol vs. hypertonic saline as an osmotic agent for adjunctive therapy of bacterial meningitis. We attempted to elucidate the impact of hypertonic saline in cerebral edema in the setting of bacterial meningitis as well as to explore potential mechanisms of action.

Design

Randomized controlled in vivo study.

Setting

University research laboratory.

Subjects

Rabbits.

Interventions

A rabbit model of bacterial meningitis was used comparing 3% hypertonic saline with 20% mannitol as adjunctive therapy.

Measurements and Main Results

Adjunctive 3% hypertonic saline treatment persistently elevated mean arterial pressure as compared with the model or ampicillin group (p < .01). Although both 20% mannitol and 3% hypertonic saline efficiently elevated serum osmolality for almost 5 hrs (p < .01), 20% mannitol lowered intracranial pressure for only a short time (< 2 hrs) and did not elevate cerebral perfusion pressure. Three percent hypertonic saline treatment efficiently lowered intracranial pressure and elevated cerebral perfusion pressure for almost 5 hrs (p < .01). Furthermore, 3% hypertonic saline treatment efficiently elevated serum Na+ concentration for > 5 hrs (p < .01). Three percent hypertonic saline treatment was superior to 20% mannitol in lowering leukocyte number and protein content in cerebrospinal fluid (p < .01). Three percent hypertonic saline treatment reduced water content and Evans blue incorporation in the brain (p < .01). Three percent hypertonic saline treatment inhibited aquaporin 4 expression (p < .01) and attenuated pathologic brain damage more efficiently compared with adjuvant 20% mannitol treatment (p < .01).

Conclusions

Adjunctive 3% hypertonic saline treatment significantly elevated mean arterial pressure, reduced intracranial pressure, greatly improved cerebral perfusion pressure, inhibited brain aquaporin 4 expression, reduced cerebral edema, and attenuated brain damage with a superior effect over 20% mannitol in a rabbit bacterial meningitis model.

### Induced and sustained hypernatremia for the prevention and treatment of cerebral edema following brain injury [^112G77H3]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema develops in response to and as a result of a variety of neurologic insults such as ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and tumor. It deforms brain tissue, resulting in localized mass effect and increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) that are associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. When administered in bolus form, hyperosmolar agents such as mannitol and hypertonic saline have been shown to reduce total brain water content and decrease ICP, and are currently the mainstays of pharmacological treatment. However, surprisingly, little is known about the increasingly common clinical practice of inducing a state of sustained hypernatremia. Herein, we review the available studies employing sustained hyperosmolar therapy to induce hypernatremia for the prevention and/or treatment of cerebral edema. Insufficient evidence exists to recommend pharmacologic induction of hypernatremia as a treatment for cerebral edema. The strategy of vigilant avoidance of hyponatremia is currently a safer, potentially more efficacious paradigm.

### The role for osmotic agents in children with acute encephalopathies: a systematic review [^111aQJK5]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is known to complicate both traumatic and non-traumatic encephalopathies. It impairs cerebral perfusion and may cause death due to global ischaemia and intracranial herniation. Osmotic agents are widely used to control ICP. In children, guidelines for their use are mainly guided by adult studies. We conducted this review to determine the current evidence of the effectiveness of osmotic agents and their effect on resolution of coma and outcome in children with acute encephalopathy.

Methods

We searched several databases for published and unpublished studies in English and French languages, between January 1966 and March 2009. We considered studies on the use of osmotic agents in children aged between 0 and 16 years with acute encephalopathies. We examined reduction in intracranial pressure, time to resolution of coma, and occurrence of neurological sequelae and death.

Results

We identified four randomized controlled trials, three prospective studies, two retrospective studies and one case report. Hypertonic saline (HS) achieved greater reduction in intracranial pressure (ICP) compared to mannitol and other fluids; normal saline or ringer's lactate. This effect was sustained for longer when it was given as continuous infusion. Boluses of glycerol and mannitol achieved transient reduction in ICP. Oral glycerol was associated with lower mortality and neurological sequelae when compared to placebo in children with acute bacterial meningitis. HS was associated with lower mortality when compared to mannitol in children with non-traumatic encephalopathies.

Conclusion

HS appears to achieve a greater reduction in ICP than other osmotic agents. Oral glycerol seems to improve outcome among children with acute bacterial meningitis. A sustained reduction in ICP is desirable and could be achieved by modifying the modes and rates of administration of these osmotic agents, but these factors need further investigation.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^115TMHin]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) hyperosmolar therapy comparative efficacy — The panel stated that "HTS was more effective than mannitol for reducing ICP or cerebral edema in this population", but "meta-analyses and RCTs have demonstrated no significant difference in neurological outcomes when comparing various hyperosmolar therapies"; in pooled prospective data of 20% NaCl, "patients who received 20% NaCl exhibited a reduced mortality rate at 90 days in a propensity-score–adjusted analysis (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.36–2.23)", and overall "the weight of the current evidence does not support the use of hyperosmolar therapies for the specific purpose of improving neurological outcomes in TBI". The overall quality of evidence was low.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [^1123z9KU]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Recent data have demonstrated different osmotic effects of mannitol. Videen and co-workers observed that after administration of 1.5 g/kg bolus of mannitol in six patients with acute complete middle cerebral artery infarctions, the brain in the non-infarcted hemisphere shrank more than in the infarcted hemisphere. This may increase the inter-hemispheric pressure difference and worsen tissue shift.

Hypertonic saline is an interesting alternative to mannitol, because there is experimental and clinical evidence that it can reduce ICP and improve CPP. Experimental studies in animals suffering from a combination of hemorrhagic shock and head trauma demonstrated a significant reduction of ICP, an improvement of CPP and/or a reduction of brain edema.

The efficacy of hypertonic saline after isolated brain injury, however, has rarely been investigated. Qureshi et al. examined different concentrations of hypertonic saline (23.4%, 3.0%) versus mannitol after isolated experimental intracerebral hemorrhage in a canine model. The acute effects on ICP and CPP were most prominent after infusion of hypertonic saline 23.4%, but were better sustained after infusion of hypertonic saline 3%. The water content was highest after mannitol infusion in most regions of the brain, especially in the white matter ipsilateral to the hematoma. The authors speculated that these results were due to a certain permeability of the BBB. The most positive effect on water content was seen after hypertonic saline 3%.

### Hypertonic saline versus mannitol for traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^114te1xa]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mannitol and hypertonic saline are widely used to treat raised intracranial pressure (ICP) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the clinical superiority of one over the other has not been demonstrated.

Methods

According to the PRISMA statement, this meta-analysis reports on randomized controlled trials investigating hypertonic saline compared with mannitol in the treatment of elevated ICP following TBI. The protocol for the literature searches (Medline, Embase, Central databases), quality assessment, endpoints (mortality, favorable outcome, brain perfusion parameters), and statistical analysis plan (including a trial sequential analysis) were prospectively specified and registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42017057112).

Results

A total of 12 randomized controlled trials with 464 patients were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Although there was a nonsignificant trend in favor of hypertonic saline, there were no significant differences in mortality between the 2 treatments (relative risk [RR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45, 1.04; P = 0.08). There were also no significant differences in favorable neurological outcome between hypertonic saline (HS) and mannitol (RR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.86, 1.90; P = 0.23). There was no difference in ICP at 30 to 60 minutes after treatment (mean difference [MD]: -0.19mmHg, 95% CI: -0.54, 0.17; P = 0.30), whereas ICP was significantly lower after HS compared with mannitol at 90 to 120 minutes (MD: -2.33mmHg, 95% CI: -3.17, -1.50; P < 0.00001). Cerebral perfusion pressure was higher between 30 to 60 and 90 to 120 minutes after treatment with HS compared with after treatment with mannitol (MD: 5.48mmHg, 95% CI: 4.84, 6.12; P < 0.00001 and 9.08mmHg, 95% CI: 7.54, 10.62; P < 0.00001, respectively). Trial sequential analysis showed that the number of cases was insufficient to produce reliable statements on long-term outcomes.

Conclusion

There are indications that HS might be superior to mannitol in the treatment of TBI-related raised ICP. However, there are insufficient data to reach a definitive conclusion, and further studies are warranted.

### Mannitol as adjunct therapy for childhood cerebral malaria… [^112x9cX8]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Mannitol as Adjunct Therapy for Childhood Cerebral MalariaClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection accounting for significant morbidity and mortality in African children despite availability of quinine, the current drug of choice. The case fatality ranges from 5 to 40% with almost 10% of survivors experiencing neurological sequelae. Several reports have suggested that raised intracranial pressure may be a feature of cerebral malaria. There is evidence of brain swelling on computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and at necropsy. It has been postulated that raised intracranial pressure can cause death by transtentorial herniation or by compromising cerebral blood flow.

In fact, most children who died of cerebral malaria in a Kenyan study, had clinical signs compatible with transtentorial herniation and all those who had severe ICP either died or survived with neurological sequelae. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, effectively lowers ICP and is used to treat post traumatic raised intracranial pressure. There have been some case reports of reduction in mortality and morbidity in African children with cerebral malaria following administration of mannitol, but as these were not randomized controlled trials it is difficult to evaluate their significance. Currently the WHO contends that there is insufficient evidence for using mannitol as adjunct therapy for cerebral malaria. A recent Cochrane review found no randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trial to support or refute the use of mannitol as adjunct therapy for cerebral malaria.

Hypothesis: A single dose of intravenous mannitol given to children with cerebral malaria will reduce mean coma recovery time from 22. 5 to
13. 1 hours. We calculated a sample size of 78 patients in each group for 90% power and 95% confidence. In the calculation, we assumed that the children receiving intravenous mannitol would have a mean coma recovery time of 13. 1 hours and those receiving placebo would have a mean coma recovery time of
22. 5 hours, according to a recent study by Aceng, Byarugaba and Tumwine in the same hospital. Drug: Mannitol
