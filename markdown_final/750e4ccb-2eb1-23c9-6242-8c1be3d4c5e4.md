## Question

Right hip pain after motorcycle accident

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing right hip pain after a motorcycle accident. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and ATLS priorities. Then, I should verify the focused hip examination and what findings mandate emergent reduction. Next, I will review the imaging algorithm and when to escalate to CT or MRI. After that, I need to consider the differential diagnosis specific to high-energy trauma, including fractures, dislocations, and soft-tissue injuries. Finally, I will outline acute management, including analgesia, reduction, surgical indications, and follow-up planning, while double-checking for complications like AVN and compartment syndrome.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure, because motorcycle crashes are high-energy mechanisms with substantial risk for polytrauma, head, chest, abdominal, and pelvic injuries, and I need to ensure we do not miss life threats before focusing on the hip.

> Wait, let me verify the focused hip examination elements that change urgency: inspect for deformity, shortening, or external rotation suggesting posterior dislocation; palpate for tenderness over the femoral neck, greater trochanter, acetabulum, and pubic rami; range motion gently to avoid exacerbating injury; and perform a neurovascular check of the entire limb, including pulses, capillary refill, and motor/sensory function, because sciatic nerve injury and vascular compromise are time-sensitive complications after hip trauma [^112sqVdm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I should confirm the sequence: obtain AP pelvis and cross-table lateral hip radiographs immediately to screen for fracture or dislocation, and if radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high for occult fracture, proceed to MRI or CT within 24 hours because delays increase morbidity and missed fractures are common in this setting [^115B8ZpS] [^113XcgA8] [^113An53E].

> I need to check the imaging trade-offs: MRI is more sensitive for occult trabecular injuries and marrow edema, whereas CT is faster, more available, and better for cortical detail and preoperative planning. In many trauma centers, CT is a pragmatic first-line cross-sectional study when MRI is not promptly available, but a negative CT does not fully exclude occult injury, so persistent pain warrants MRI or repeat imaging [^116SjivX] [^112K3Pok] [^113An53E].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis specific to high-energy right hip trauma: posterior hip dislocation with or without acetabular or femoral head fracture; femoral neck or intertrochanteric fracture; acetabular fracture; femoral head impaction or osteochondral injury; labral tear with intra-articular fragments; sciatic nerve injury; and vascular injury including common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm or occlusion, all of which have been reported after motorcycle collisions and require targeted imaging and early intervention [^1116cWMd] [^111zaUW1] [^112sqVdm].

> I should confirm the red flags that mandate emergent action: any dislocation needs reduction within 6–12 hours to mitigate avascular necrosis risk, nonconcentric reduction suggests trapped tissue and requires open arthrotomy, expanding hematoma with neurovascular compromise suggests arterial injury or compartment syndrome, and open fractures or gross instability need urgent operative management. I need to ensure I do not delay these decisions for additional imaging when the clinical picture is clear [^1116cWMd] [^117SjAT6] [^112sqVdm].

> Next, I should review acute pain control while avoiding masking pathology: multimodal analgesia with acetaminophen and NSAIDs is reasonable if no contraindications, and regional anesthesia such as fascia iliaca or femoral nerve blocks can be effective for hip and femur trauma, but I must monitor for compartment syndrome risk and motor weakness that could obscure neurologic deficits [^114FtZQ8] [^111QQwmG].

> Let me think about reduction technique and timing: closed reduction under conscious sedation or general anesthesia in the ED or OR is first-line for dislocations, with the goal of achieving a concentric reduction; if closed reduction fails or if there is nonconcentric alignment, open reduction to remove interposed tissue is indicated, and I should document neurovascular status before and after any manipulation [^1116cWMd] [^117SjAT6].

> I should double-check post-reduction imaging: obtain AP pelvis and lateral hip radiographs immediately after reduction to confirm concentricity and screen for new fractures, and consider CT if there is any doubt about joint congruity or associated acetabular or femoral head injury, because missing a step-off or fragment can lead to early arthritis or persistent instability [^1116cWMd].

> For fractures, I need to ensure timely surgical consultation: femoral neck fractures in younger patients generally require internal fixation, intertrochanteric fractures are managed with dynamic hip screws or intramedullary nails, and acetabular fractures often need open reduction and internal fixation to restore joint congruity. Early operative management within 24–48 hours improves outcomes when medically feasible [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient reports severe pain with a normal radiograph? I should maintain a high index of suspicion for occult fracture or stress injury and escalate to MRI or CT without delay, because missing a femoral neck or acetabular fracture can have catastrophic consequences, and guidelines endorse cross-sectional imaging when suspicion remains high despite negative films [^113XcgA8] [^113An53E].

> I will now examine rehabilitation and follow-up planning: after reduction, non-weight-bearing for 4–6 weeks with gradual progression is typical, with serial radiographs to monitor for AVN and arthritis. I should counsel on signs of complications such as progressive pain, collapse, or mechanical symptoms and arrange orthopedic follow-up within 1–2 weeks [^1132qnXf] [^1116cWMd].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed special pitfalls: sciatic nerve palsy can be missed initially and may require EMG for prognosis, vascular injuries can present subtly with pain out of proportion and evolving pallor or pulse deficit, and compartment syndrome in the gluteal region, though rare, can cause devastating neurologic loss if not recognized early [^112sqVdm].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: stabilize the patient, obtain immediate radiographs, recognize dislocation or fracture patterns that demand urgent reduction or fixation, escalate to CT or MRI when radiographs are negative but suspicion persists, and deliver multimodal analgesia with close neurovascular monitoring, because delays in diagnosis or treatment after motorcycle trauma increase the risk of AVN, chronic pain, and permanent disability [^1116cWMd] [^115B8ZpS] [^113XcgA8].

Right hip pain after a motorcycle accident most often reflects **high-energy trauma** with a high risk of **hip dislocation, acetabular fracture, femoral head/neck fracture, or soft-tissue injury** [^1116cWMd] [^111zaUW1]. Immediate evaluation should include **AP pelvis and cross-table lateral hip radiographs** [^115B8ZpS]; if radiographs are negative but suspicion remains high, obtain **MRI or CT** within 24 hours to detect occult fractures or ligamentous injuries [^113XcgA8] [^113An53E]. Early reduction of dislocations within 6 hours reduces **avascular necrosis risk** [^1116cWMd]; fractures often require surgical fixation, and all patients need close follow-up for complications such as AVN, osteoarthritis, and sciatic nerve injury [^114xSwmg].

---

## Common injuries associated with right hip pain after motorcycle accident

Motorcycle accidents frequently cause **high-energy trauma** to the hip, leading to:

| **Injury type** | **Description** | **Frequency/severity** |
|-|-|-|
| Hip dislocation | Posterior most common; anterior less frequent [^1116cWMd] | High; risk of AVN increases with delay [^1116cWMd] |
| Acetabular fracture | Often associated with dislocation; complex anatomy complicates management [^111zaUW1] | High; may require surgical fixation [^1156Dqrn] |
| Femoral head/neck fracture | Intracapsular fractures with risk of AVN [^1116cWMd] | High; early fixation critical [^114xSwmg] |
| Soft-tissue injury | Labral tears, ligamentous injuries, muscle contusions | Common; may cause persistent pain [^117WRfkS] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize the **mechanism of injury** (speed, impact direction, ejection), document the **time of onset** and pain location (groin, lateral hip, buttock), and screen for associated symptoms such as inability to bear weight, deformity, numbness, or weakness [^117WRfkS].

---

### Physical examination

- **Inspection**: deformity, shortening, external rotation (suggests posterior dislocation) [^1123hkUK].
- **Palpation**: tenderness over femoral head, neck, greater trochanter, acetabulum.
- **Range of motion**: limited, painful, especially internal rotation/flexion.
- **Neurovascular assessment**: distal pulses, capillary refill, sensation, motor strength (sciatic nerve) [^1116cWMd].

---

## Imaging studies

### Initial imaging

Obtain **AP pelvis and cross-table lateral hip radiographs** as first-line imaging [^115B8ZpS] to assess for dislocation, fracture, or joint space asymmetry [^115G3Scm].

---

### Advanced imaging

If radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high, obtain **MRI or CT** within 24 hours to detect occult fractures, labral tears, or soft-tissue injuries [^113XcgA8] [^113An53E]. MRI is superior for marrow edema and soft tissues; CT better defines cortical bone and complex fractures [^116SjivX].

---

## Management strategies

### Non-surgical management

Non-surgical care includes **closed reduction** for dislocations within 6 hours to reduce AVN risk [^1116cWMd], non-weight-bearing for 4–6 weeks with gradual progression, and multimodal analgesia including NSAIDs and acetaminophen [^114FtZQ8].

---

### Surgical management

- **Indications**: irreducible dislocation, unstable fracture, displaced femoral neck fracture, acetabular fracture with joint incongruity [^1156Dqrn].
- **Procedures**: open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), total hip arthroplasty (THA), surgical hip dislocation for complex cases [^116ZWqwU].
- **Timing**: early surgery (within 24–48 hours) reduces complications and improves outcomes [^114xSwmg].

---

## Potential complications

- **Avascular necrosis (AVN)**: risk increases with delayed reduction or intracapsular fractures [^1116cWMd].
- **Post-traumatic osteoarthritis**: common after acetabular or femoral head injuries [^1116cWMd].
- **Sciatic nerve injury**: posterior dislocations can cause persistent neurological deficits [^112sqVdm].
- **Chronic pain and functional impairment**: frequent after complex injuries [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

Recovery depends on injury severity, patient age, and comorbidities. Dislocations managed promptly generally recover in 3–6 months, whereas fractures often require 6–12 months and may involve prolonged rehabilitation. Chronic pain and functional limitations are more likely with complex injuries or delayed treatment [^1116cWMd].

---

## Follow-up care and rehabilitation

Follow-up should include regular clinical and radiographic assessments to monitor healing and detect complications. Rehabilitation emphasizes **early mobilization**, physical therapy, and gradual return to weight-bearing. Patient education should cover signs of complications and adherence to weight-bearing restrictions.

Acute hip pain following injury more commonly originates locally in and around the hip joint rather than being referred from the lumbar spine, sacroiliac joints, groin, or pelvis. Clinical assessment can usually localize the pain source to the hip region. Thereafter, imaging helps define the precise cause of acute hip pain. This review discusses the imaging of common causes of acute hip pain following injury in adults, addressing injuries in and around the hip joint. Pediatric and postsurgical causes of hip pain following injury are not discussed.

Acute hip pain is a common presenting complaint among patients attending Emergency Departments particularly following a traumatic event. A proximal femoral fracture is the main consideration, which requires urgent confirmation and treatment; however, there are a number of conditions, which could mimic neck of femur fracture and the causes may not be directly related to the hip, so systematic and careful observation of pelvic MRI could shed light on the true culprit of acute hip pain.

Hip dislocations, most often caused by motor vehicle accidents or similar high-energy trauma, traverse a large subset of distinct injury patterns. Understanding these patterns and their associated injuries allows surgeons to provide optimal care for these patients both in the early and late postinjury periods. Nonoperative care requires surgeons to understand the indications. Surgical care requires the surgeon to understand the benefits and limitations of several surgical approaches. This article presents the current understanding of hip dislocation treatment, focusing on anatomy, injury classifications, nonoperative and operative management, and postinjury care.

Results

Case 1

This was a 30-year old female patient with a history of trochanteric bursitis of the right hip who presented to the interventional pain clinic with chronic low back pain that initially began following a cesarean-section in 2016 and was exacerbated by a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in 2018. Following the MVA, the patient reported exacerbated sharp, achy, chronic bilateral axial low back pain and new right hip pain. Upon initial presentation, the patient's back pain was rated at a 8/10 on visual analogue scale (VAS), a 3.5/10 at its best and a 10/10 at its worst. The patient reported minimal improvement with trigger point injections (TPI), ibuprofen, heating cream, and one scoop daily of ortho molecular's collagen powder. The patient underwent one greater trochanteric bursa injection, one lumbar epidural steroid injection at L5-S1, and two diagnostic right nervus femoralis trochanteric branch nerve blocks prior to undergoing RFA intervention.

The patient underwent right nervus femoralis to the trochanter nerve RFA under fluoroscopic guidance on October 28, 2020. 16 days following the procedure, the patient's right trochanteric pain improved from 8/10 prior to the procedure to less than 1/10 postprocedure, reporting a 95% improvement. The patient underwent one additional lumbar epidural steroid injection following the procedure; however, this was targeted at her axial low back pain, which persisted following RFA intervention. Overall, the patient reported an improvement in quality of life following RFA. The patient continues to report ongoing pain relief from the procedure.

Case presentation

A 24-year-old man was admitted after a high-speed car collision into a highway guardrail. The car was severely damaged and all airbags were out. Immediately after the collision he climbed out of his car by himself and started to walk around seemingly distraught and not adequately responding to questions from the paramedics.

He was assessed in a level 1 trauma centre in Amsterdam according the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles. During the primary survey there were no signs of airway problems and his C-spine was immobilised. He had no respiratory problems and with oxygen suppletion through a non-rebreathing mask he had a saturation of 99%. He had no clinical signs of a (tension)pneumothorax or haemothorax. On the left side of this chest a seat belt sign was seen. His pulse was 114/min with a blood pressure of 98/60 mm Hg. There were some excoriations on his abdomen, but when palpated it was non-rigid and not painful. There was no suspicion of a pelvic or femur fracture. He was sedated because of agitation due to possible head injury or drug or alcohol intoxication. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. Furthermore, during the log-roll and spinal palpation no haematoma or other signs of fractures were seen and our now lightly sedated patient did not have symptoms of pain and wounds were not seen.

During secondary survey a small head wound on the back of the head was seen, as well as multiple excoriations on the thorax, abdomen, pelvic area and right knee. A Morell-Lavallee lesion on the right hip was also noted. Because of the vertebral fractures and possible head injury a neurologist was consulted to perform a neurological examination at the trauma room during the secondary survey. The neurological examination took place after 5 mg midazolam was intravenously given because the patient was exhibiting motor restlessness. No major neurological deficit was found during the examination. It was noted that the patient moved his arms and legs spontaneously and that the plantar reflex was normal on both sides.

### ATHENA: a phase 3, open-label study of the safety and effectiveness of oliceridine (TRV130), A G-protein selective agonist at the µ-opioid receptor, in patients with moderate to severe acute pain requiring parenteral opioid therapy [^115CdsB6]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Broad Surgical, Medical, and Emergency Department Patient Population. Since the MedDRA hierarchy inadequately depicts the breadth of surgeries in the ATHENA study, the "reasons for receiving oliceridine" were also grouped following medical review. The most common reasons (> 5%) for receiving oliceridine (by procedure) were knee arthroplasty (127 patients [16.5%]), hysterectomy (72 patients [9.4%]), hip arthroplasty (58 patients [7.6%]), colectomy (54 patients [7.0%]), and mammoplasty (46 patients [6.0%]). Medical conditions included: left humerus fracture (2); radiculopathy (2); post-surgical capsulitis of right shoulder (1); sickle-cell anemia (1); Crohn's disease (1); post-laminectomy syndrome (1); lumbago with sciatica (1); nephrolithiasis (1); and pain in left hip (1). Thirty-three patients were from emergency settings (abdominal pain, n = 1; acute back pain, n = 6; shoulder pain, n = 1; flank pain, n = 5; biliary colic, n = 1; cervicalgia, n = 1; crohn's disease, n = 1; exacerbation of bilateral foot pain, n = 1; pancreatitis, n = 2; perianal abscess, n = 1; right-hand cellulitis, n = 1; right hip dislocation, n = 1; sickle-cell disease, n = 3; motor vehicle accident, n = 3; spinal stenosis, n = 1, systemic lupus erythematosus, n = 1, thrombosis of bypass graft, n = 1, tooth abscess, n = 1; urinary tract infection, n = 1; vertebral fracture, n = 1).

### Radicular pain after hip disarticulation: a clinical vignette [^116LVCUT]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 36-yr-old man with a history of industrial accident causing traumatic left hip disarticulation, pubic symphysis, and right sacroiliac joint fractures presented with a 3-yr history of left-sided lower back pain radiating down the amputated limb. Computed tomography lumbar spine showed osteophytes surrounding the sacroiliac joint bilaterally with reduced left L4-L5 foraminal space. A fluoroscopically guided left sacroiliac steroid injection led to mild improvement in low back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine without contrast showed transitional type L5 vertebral body with left-sided flowing osteophytes abutting the extraforaminal L4 and L5 nerves. Ultimately, multilevel left fluoroscopically guided transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L4-L5 and L5-S1 significantly improved symptoms. Although phantom radiculopathy is a rare entity, clinical suspicion of degenerative spine disease or other pathology contributing to nerve impingement in patients with amputations should remain; this unique case discusses bony osteophyte complex as the cause for phantom radiculopathy instead of previously described disc herniation. Magnetic resonance imaging remains a key tool in delineating causes of low back pain among patients with lower limb amputations.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute hip pain: 2024 update [^115G3Scm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute hip pain can be related to any combination of hip fracture, dislocation, and/or soft tissue injury. These injuries require timely diagnosis to avoid associated complications, such as osteonecrosis or prolonged immobility. Imaging plays a crucial role in the evaluation of these injuries, noting that hip fractures cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded via physical examination alone. Radiographs are the initial imaging modality of choice for acute hip pain. Several recent studies have evaluated specific scenarios in which cross-sectional imaging (CT and/or MRI) should also be obtained-these scenarios will be reviewed as separate variants within this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Long-term patient-reported quality of life and pain after a multidisciplinary clinical pathway for elderly patients with hip fracture: a retrospective comparative cohort study [^112ydCXr]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 65 years or older with a surgically treated low-energy proximal femur fracture (femoral neck) and or pertrochanteric fractures (AO/OTA type 31 A [trochanteric fracture] and 31 B [femoral neck fracture]) who underwent surgery in the Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, the Netherlands. Patients with a high-energy hip fracture (defined as motor vehicle and motorcycle accidents, a collision at a moped or bicycle > 35 km/h, pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle > 10 km/h, and fall from 2 times the body height), patients with an AO/OTA type 31 C (femoral head) proximal femoral fracture, patients with > 2 fractures, and patients not living in the hospital area were excluded. Data from both cohorts were separately collected and analyzed. The first cohort regarded the data of all patients treated during the year 2012, before implementation of MCPs. This cohort is therefore referred to as the cohort submitted to UC. The second cohort regarded the data of all patients treated during the year 2015, which is 2 years after the implementation of MCP. Therefore, this cohort is referred to as the MCP cohort. Surgical treatment was performed according to the Dutch Guidelines.

Usual care protocol includes standard traditional treatment by an orthopedic trauma surgeon at the trauma unit with a follow-up at the out-patient clinic. Physiotherapy is prescribed when the patient is discharged home. Multidisciplinary clinical pathways address the management of care that patients need from arrival in the emergency department until they are discharged to the rehabilitation unit or a nursing home. The multidisciplinary team consists of an orthopedic trauma surgeon, a geriatrician, an anesthesiologist, and a physiotherapist. These disciplines are all actively involved in the decision making process regarding the care that patients need from the first presentation at the emergency department until they are discharged from the hospital. Additional medical specialties remain available for consultation depending on the comorbidities of the patient. The aim of the team is to perform surgical treatment within 24 hours upon admission and to achieve discharge within 4 days. To achieve this goal, agreements have been set in place with rehabilitation facilities to transfer the surgically treated patients to a patient-centered destination as soon as possible. This may either be a rehabilitation center or nursing home with rehabilitation facilities. The postoperative protocol for both groups, MCP and UC, was early mobilization and early full weight bearing.

### Do we fix front and back of every APC pelvic injury? [^1137qpz8]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

HISTORY-A 47-year-old male was on a cliff when he jumped into the water below. He jumped about 50 feet. Upon landing in the water, he felt his legs separate and abduct violently. He was taken to the Emergency unit of the nearest trauma center and was found to have no injuries except to his pelvis. He could not weight bear because of pelvic pain but had normal distal sensory and motor exam and rectal exam. His-pelvis was painful to examination anteriorly with minor left-sided posterior SI pain, and he had no blood at his meatus. X-rays and CT were done, (Figures 1–5).

### Emergency department evaluation and treatment of acute hip and thigh pain [^114MSGsc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of hip fractures is decreasing, the overall prevalence continues to increase because of an aging population. People older than 65 suffer fractures at a rate of 0.6% per year — 2% per year for persons older than 85. One in 5 patients suffering a hip fracture will die within a year. Additionally, the emergency physician must consider entities such as avascular necrosis, compartment syndrome, and muscular disruption. This article reviews patterns and complications of acute hip and thigh injuries and clinically relevant diagnostic, anesthetic, and treatment options that facilitate timely, appropriate, and effective emergency department management.

Case presentation

A woman in her 50s, driver of the car, was brought by ambulance to the emergency department (ED) following a road traffic accident having sustained multiple injuries. She was immobilised in a spinal board. She was managed according to the advanced trauma life support protocol. As she was haemodynamically unstable (blood pressure 90/70 mm Hg and pulse rate 120 beats per minute), she received blood products and volume replacement. The patient was reporting bilateral groin pain, unable to move both hips, thoracic pain, difficulty in breathing and pain in her left heel. There was no neurovascular deficit in the lower extremities.

### Unique cause of chronic right hip pain and unilateral leg swelling 10 yrs following total hip arthroplasty [^1112sK5n]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Patient is a 64-yr-old female with a history of right total hip arthroplasty who presented with progressive, painful right lower extremity edema and chronic groin pain for 2 years. A computed tomography scan from October 2021 revealed an expanding, large iliopsoas bursal fluid collection that caused compression of the right common femoral artery and vein in June 2023. Further workup excluded deep venous thrombosis or infectious causes. Iliopsoas fluid collections can result from various conditions such as a rare complication of total hip arthroplasty. This is likely due to mechanical irritation from the prosthetic components and was confirmed with resolution of symptoms after undergoing revision of total hip arthroplasty in 2024. This case highlights iliopsoas hematoma as a rare but important consideration in patients with unilateral lower extremity edema after total hip arthroplasty.

Lateral Hip Pain The most common cause of lateral hip pain is greater trochanteric pain syndrome. 15 Although this syndrome may be associated with bursitis, gluteus medius tendinopathy or tears are now thought to be more common. 16, 31 Iliotibial band friction and external snapping hip can contribute to greater trochanteric pain syndrome.
15. If a patient with greater trochanteric pain syndrome does not improve with anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy, a gluteus medius tendon tear should be considered. MRI and musculoskeletal ultrasonography performed by an experienced sonographer are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosing a gluteus medius tendon tear.

15, 16, 21 Referral to an orthopedic hip specialist is often indicated for large partial or complete tears because surgery is typically associated with good outcomes in patients with this condition. 15, 16. PIRIFORMIS AND DEEP GLUTEAL SYNDROME Piriformis syndrome is thought to be a result of the piriformis muscle entrapping the sciatic nerve, causing hip and buttock pain and sciatica. Piriformis syndrome is a subset of deep gluteal syndrome, which includes entrapment of the sciatic nerve and/or pudendal nerve by the piriformis muscle, gemelliobturator internus, or proximal hamstrings. 17 Sacroiliac joint dysfunction and/or arthritis may also present as posterior hip pain. The most common physical examination finding is tenderness to palpation over the sacroiliac joint. Sacroiliac pain typically does not occur above the L5 level, which would indicate a lumbar spinal etiology of pain. 17 Radiography may show sacroiliac joint arthritis.

Image-guided injections may be a helpful diagnostic and therapeutic tool. If diagnosis is uncertain, MRI can show inflammation or arthritis at the sacroiliac joint.
17. HAMSTRING INJURIES Posterior hip/buttock pain around the ischium may be indicative of a hamstring strain, tear, or avulsion. Patients may have a history of a traumatic, sports-related, or overuse injury. A complete hamstring tear or avulsion often causes ecchymosis of the posterior thigh.

### Does this patient have hip osteoarthritis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^1144eJSj]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of pain and disability.

Objective

To identify the clinical findings that are most strongly associated with hip OA.

Data Sources

Systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception until November 2019.

Study Selection

Included studies (1) quantified the accuracy of clinical findings (history, physical examination, or simple tests) and (2) used plain radiographs as the reference standard for diagnosing hip OA.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Studies were assigned levels of evidence using the Rational Clinical Examination scale and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Data were extracted using individual hips as the unit of analysis and only pooled when findings were reported in 3 or more studies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Six studies were included, with data from 1110 patients and 1324 hips, of which 509 (38%) showed radiographic evidence of OA. Among patients presenting to primary care physicians with hip or groin pain, the affected hip showed radiographic evidence of OA in 34% of cases. A family history of OA, personal history of knee OA, or pain on climbing stairs or walking up slopes all had LRs of 2.1 (sensitivity range, 33%-68%; specificity range, 68%-84%; broadest LR range: 95% CI, 1.1–3.8). To identify patients most likely to have OA, the most useful findings were squat causing posterior pain (sensitivity, 24%; specificity, 96%; LR, 6.1 [95% CI, 1.3–29]), groin pain on passive abduction or adduction (sensitivity, 33%; specificity, 94%; LR, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.6–20]), abductor weakness (sensitivity, 44%; specificity, 90%; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 2.4–8.4]), and decreased passive hip adduction (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 81%; LR, 4.2 [95% CI, 3.0–6.0]) or internal rotation (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 79%; LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.7–6.0]) as measured by a goniometer or compared with the contralateral leg. The presence of normal passive hip adduction was most useful for suggesting the absence of OA (negative LR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.11–0.54]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Simple tests of hip motion and observing for pain during that motion were helpful in distinguishing patients most likely to have OA on plain radiography from those who will not. A combination of findings efficiently detects those most likely to have severe hip OA.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaChronic hip pain [^11716woS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic hip pain is a common clinical problem whose cause is often elucidated by imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria for chronic hip pain define best practices of image ordering. Clinical scenarios are followed by the imaging choices and their appropriateness. The information is in ordered tables with an accompanying narrative explanation to guide physicians to order the right test. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^114sFpCe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Lateral hip pain used to be a poorly defined entity, but advances in imaging and interest in sports medicine have led to a better understanding of the pathology, presentation and management of this cohort of patients. A thorough appreciation of the anatomy of the abductor musculature, specific clinical signs and imaging findings will lead to an appropriate diagnosis being made and management plan instituted. Finally, it should be noted that assessment of baseline psychological impairment is essential in this group of patients to optimise outcomes.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hip pain: 2022 update [^11369rqR]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic hip pain is a frequent chief complaint for adult patients who present for evaluation in a variety of clinical practice settings. Following a targeted history and physical examination, imaging plays a vital role in elucidating the etiologies of a patient's symptoms, as a wide spectrum of pathological entities may cause chronic hip pain. Radiography is usually the appropriate initial imaging test following a clinical examination. Depending on the clinical picture, advanced cross-sectional imaging may be subsequently performed for further evaluation. This documents provides best practice for the imaging workup of chronic hip pain in patients presenting with a variety of clinical scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Nonconcentric reduction by an inverted anterosuperior labrum with avulsed osteocartilaginous fragment in an anterior hip dislocation [^117SjAT6]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2008). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old man was involved in a motorcycle accident and presented with an anterior hip dislocation. After a closed reduction, the hip showed a nonconcentric reduction. With an open reduction, an inverted anterosuperior labrum with avulsed osteocartilage was found, which prohibited the concentric reduction of the hip joint. The inverted labrum, cartilage, and torn ligamentum teres were excised, the femoral head was reduced, and the capsule was reapproximated. Six months after surgery, the patient still complained of slight pain in the left hip, with 20- to 30-degree restriction of hip flexion relative to that of the normal side. A radiograph of the hip was normal.

### Imaging of occult hip fractures: CT or MRI? [^116SjivX]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients presenting with hip pain but normal plain radiographs may ultimately be shown on further investigation to have suffered an occult hip fracture (OHF). This diagnosis can be made with CT or MRI. Traditionally MRI has been considered a superior modality. We performed a retrospective review of all patients presenting to our service with a suspected OHF over a four-year period, investigated with either CT or MRI.

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Urban trauma centre.

Patients

Patients with suspected hip fractures and negative radiographs.

Intervention

CT or MRI.

Main Outcome Measures

Detection rate; delay in request for further imaging; delay to theatre; re-presentations with missed fractures.

Results

A total of 179 patients were investigated, with a mean age of 82 ± 13 years. The ultimate diagnosis was of an OHF in 71 cases and pelvic or acetabular fracture in 34. The average time from presentation plain radiograph to further imaging was 2.0 ± 2.7 days, but was significantly shorter for CT. No patient re-presented with unidentified fractures or other localised hip pathology within a 12-month period.

Conclusions

Modern imaging technology does not appear to miss clinically significant fractures. As CT is usually more accessible than MRI, the results of our study should encourage surgeons to consider CT as a first line investigation for occult hip fractures. We advocate a high index of suspicion and early imaging referral for elderly patients presenting with non-specific hip pain following a fall. Level 3 Evidence.

### Bilateral asymmetric hip dislocation: a case series and literature review of a rare injury pattern [^117UWmDj]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bilateral asymmetric hip dislocation, with one hip dislocated posteriorly and with anterior dislocation of the contralateral hip, is a rare injury pattern. A total of 34 cases have been reported in English literature, but only 24 cases detail injury mechanism and patient demographic factors, 3 of which reported bilateral asymmetric hip dislocation in female patients. Only one report describes more than one example. We describe four patients with bilateral asymmetric hip dislocation, including one example in a female patient, which represents the largest case series to date. Pertinent anatomy, injury mechanism, treatment options, and prognosis are also discussed.

Methods

A literature review was conducted via PubMed using the term bilateral asymmetric dislocation. Review of additional reports cited by articles found by our search resulted in what we think to be an exhaustive list of cases reported to date. A medical record review of four patients treated at our institution, a Level I trauma center, was performed to compare our treatment methods and outcomes to those previously described.

Results

All four patients in our case series had satisfactory outcomes. Motor vehicle collision is the most common cause of bilateral asymmetric hip dislocation.

Conclusion

Timely, accurate reduction of bilateral asymmetric hip dislocation is recommended for optimal outcomes. An understanding of pertinent anatomy about the hip joint allows the orthopedic surgeon to perform a safe, timely reduction. In the absence of an associated acetabular fracture, conservative management with weight-bearing restrictions typically leads to good outcomes without complications such as aseptic necrosis of the femoral head.

### Evaluation of the patient with hip pain… [^117WRfkS]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with hip pain should be asked about antecedent trauma or inciting activity, factors that increase or decrease the pain, mechanism of injury, and time of onset. Questions related to hip function, such as the ease of getting in and out of a car, putting on shoes, running, walking, and going up and down stairs, can be helpful. 3 Location of the pain is informative because hip pain often localizes to one of three basic anatomic regions: the anterior hip and groin, posterior hip and buttock, and lateral hip. 14, 15 In addition to the anteroposterior and lateral radiograph views, a Dunn view should be obtained to help detect subtle lesions.
16. HIP LABRAL TEAR Hip labral tears cause dull or sharp groin pain, and one-half of patients with a labral tear have pain that radiates to the lateral hip, anterior thigh, and buttock. The pain usually has an insidious onset, but occasionally begins acutely after a traumatic event.

About one-half of patients with this injury also have mechanical symptoms, such as catching or painful clicking with activity. ILIOPSOAS BURSITIS OCCULT OR STRESS FRACTURE Occult or stress fracture of the hip should be considered if trauma or repetitive weight-bearing exercise is involved, even if plain radiograph results are negative. 21 Clinically, these injuries cause anterior hip or groin pain that is worse with activity. 21 Pain may be present with extremes of motion, active straight leg raise, the log roll test, or hopping. 22 MRI is useful for the detection of occult traumatic fractures and stress fractures not seen on plain radiographs.
23. 43 Greater trochanteric pain syndrome refers to pain over the greater trochanter. Several disorders of the lateral hip can lead to this type of pain, including iliotibial band thickening, bursitis, and tears of the gluteus medius and minimus muscle attachment.

43–45 Patients may have mild morning stiffness and may be unable to sleep on the affected side. Gluteus minimus and medius injuries present with pain in the posterior lateral aspect of the hip as a result of partial or full-thickness tearing at the gluteal insertion. Most patients have an atraumatic, insidious onset of symptoms from repetitive use. 43, 45, 46.

### Inability to obtain formal informed consent in the face of a standard surgical indication [^115pihKw]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2001). Low credibility.

A thirty-eight-year-old intoxicated man was admitted to the surgical trauma service following a single motor-vehicle accident. He had a severe closed head injury, bilateral pulmonary contusions, a fracture-dislocation of the right acetabulum, and an open injury of the right knee joint. The acetabular fracture pattern was an associated both-column fracture with the femoral head dislocated into a widely displaced posterior-column fracture line. The treating physicians agreed that it would be in the patient's best interest to take him to the operating room for emergent debridement and irrigation of his knee wound. At surgery, the patient also underwent attempted closed reduction of the acetabular fracture and placement of a skeletal traction pin. Radiographs obtained with the patient in traction showed reduction of the femoral head beneath a displaced superior dome fragment, but there remained a 12-mm gap in the posterior column, greater than 3 mm of step incongruity, and a large articular fragment entrapped in the anterior aspect of the hip joint. The patient remained intubated and sedated for several days. Upon weaning from the ventilator, it became evident that his head injury would prevent him from being able to give informed consent in the foreseeable future. The patient's family members refused to become involved with his care or medical decision-making, as he had become completely estranged from them as a result of his chronic alcohol abuse. Further delay in surgical treatment for the acetabular fracture would be associated with greater difficulty in obtaining an anatomic reduction, the potential for additional articular damage to the femoral head, and an increased risk of surgical complications. The question that arises is whether it is in the patient's best interest for the surgeon to proceed with open reduction and internal fixation of the acetabular fracture without having had the opportunity to fully inform him of the treatment options or the risks associated with an extensive surgical exposure.

### Using a hybrid approach to management of a common femoral arterial dissection [^112sqVdm]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

What would you do?

A middle-aged (fifth decade) patient was brought to the emergency department after a motorcycle collision during which the lower abdomen-to-pelvis area was trapped between a traffic sign pole and the motorcycle. On admission, vital signs were normal. The patient complained of left groin and buttock pain. Primary and secondary evaluations revealed subcutaneous hematoma and tenderness in the groin bilaterally and left buttock. Left dorsal pedis arterial pulse was slightly diminished compared with that on the right. No neurological deficits were apparent in bilateral lower extremities (LEs). Laboratory test results were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a defect in the left common femoral artery (CFA) with normal runoff. Scans also identified a sacral bone fracture with contrast medium extravasation and a pseudoaneurysm with a large subcutaneous hematoma in the left gluteus maximus muscle (figure 1A, B).

Figure 1
(A) Contrast-enhanced CT shows that the left common femoral artery is not visible (circle). (B) Gluteal hematoma (thick arrow) with extravasation of contrast medium from the left inferior gluteal artery (thin arrow).

As the vascular surgery, interventional radiology, and orthopedic departments were planning treatment, the patient, now tachycardic and diaphoretic, complained of worsening pain and numbness in the left buttock and LEs. Examination showed that the subcutaneous hematoma in its left gluteal region had expanded significantly and was firmer. The left LE was cold and pale, with no palpable pulses or Doppler signals. Left ankle dorsal flexion was impaired. These neurological deficits were compatible with sciatic nerve palsy and ischemia. On palpation, left LE muscles were soft and tender. Since admission, the hemoglobin level decreased from 12.1 to 10.2 g/dL, and lactic acid level increased from 2.0 to 5.9 mmol/L. We suspected left LE ischemia secondary to left CFA occlusion and left gluteal compartment syndrome causing left sciatic nerve palsy due to the expanding gluteal hematoma and active arterial hemorrhage.

### Hip fractures in adults [^1123hkUK]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with hip fracture typically present to the emergency department or their physician's office after a fall. They are often unable to walk, and they may exhibit shortening and external rotation of the affected limb. Frequently, they have hip pain. In some instances, however, patients with hip fracture may complain only of vague pain in their buttocks, knees, thighs, groin, or back. Their ability to walk may be unaffected, and initial radiographic findings may be indeterminate. In these patients, additional studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging or bone scanning, may be necessary to confirm the presence of hip fracture. A high index of suspicion often is required for prompt diagnosis and treatment of an occult hip fracture. Even when a patient is able to walk and has no documented trauma, localized hip pain, or typical shortening and malrotation deformity, the family physician should be alert to the possibility of hip fracture, particularly in a patient who is older than 65 years, presents with nonspecific leg discomfort, and complains of difficulty bearing weight on the affected limb. A heightened suspicion for hip fracture should lead to further diagnostic evaluation, especially if the patient has additional risk factors, such as use of a complicated drug regimen, impaired vision, physical or neurologic impairment, or comorbid condition (e.g., osteoporosis, malignancy). When hip fracture is detected early, appropriate treatment can minimize morbidity and mortality and prevent the rapid decline in quality of life that often is associated with this injury.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of an 80-year-old man with progressively worsening left groin pain following a fall 1 week prior to presentation. Using questions, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Tenosynovial giant cell tumor mimicking acute septic arthritis of the hip: a case report [^113Dz38S]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 12-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department with a 5-day history of atraumatic, progressively worsening right hip pain. The patient and his parents recall a possible fall from a swing set around the time the pain started, but they were not able to definitively correlate this low-energy traumatic event with his symptoms. He was initially seen at an outside emergency department, where his erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), and radiographs of the hip were normal. He was subsequently diagnosed with transient synovitis. The night following this initial emergency department visit, he was awakened from sleep by his right hip pain and was unable to bear weight on the right lower extremity. He returned to the outside emergency department again the next day reporting of worsened right hip pain and was discharged with additional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. He was then seen by an outside orthopaedic surgeon, who recommended that the patient present to the pediatric emergency department (level 1 pediatric trauma center) for additional evaluation given the clinical concern for septic arthritis.

At the time of presentation to our institution's emergency department, the patient reported notable right hip pain making him unable to bear weight and waking him from sleep. Of note, he had been afebrile since the onset of his pain. On examination, the patient refused to bear weight on the right lower extremity and held the right hip in flexion, abduction, and external rotation. Interestingly, within a moderate arc of hip range of motion, he had minimal pain. However, at the extremes of internal rotation, especially with the hip flexed, he had increased pain. He was also acutely tender over the medial groin region and the adductor tendons. He was afebrile (T: 37°C), and his WBC count was within normal limits (6,050 WBCs/mm³). However, ESR and CRP were elevated to 42 mm/hr and 6.6 mg/dL, respectively (institutional reference ranges: ESR 1 to 15 mm/hr; CRP < 0.5 mg/dL).

### Acetabular fracture in a 16-year-old secondary to an all-terrain vehicle accident [^117BLbWr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

All-terrain vehicles have been associated with a large number of injuries in the pediatric age group. Despite strict regulations governing the sale and manufacture of these vehicles, they continue to be in widespread use. We report a case of a 16-year-old boy with an acetabular fracture secondary to being thrown from an all-terrain vehicle. Acetabular fractures are rare in the pediatric population and are most commonly associated with motor vehicle accidents and other high-energy trauma. Although the diagnosis is straightforward, delayed presentation is not uncommon.

### Rare case of a low energy traumatic anterior dislocation of the native hip [^1158Gatt]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Anterior dislocations of the native hip are rare injuries, and normally a result of high energy trauma such as road traffic accidents. Delays in reduction of over 12 hours have been shown to increase the risk of avascular necrosis to the head of the femur significantly. We report the case of an elderly man who sustained an anterior dislocation of his native hip following a fall. The case highlights that prompt appropriate management can lead to excellent clinical outcomes.

### Buttock pain: a missed diagnosis [^1137kBf1]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old school boy presented with right-sided buttock pain, features of sepsis and Staphylococcus aureus positive blood cultures. On examination, he was febrile and in severe pain, with limited hip rotation and positive sacroiliac stress tests. Initial imaging with pelvic x-ray, hip ultrasound and MRI were normal. Despite this, a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the hip was presumed, and the patient underwent a washout of the right hip. When the imaging was reviewed in more detail, it was noted that a section of the sacroiliac joint was abnormal. Subsequent pelvic MRI confirmed that this was, in fact, septic sacroiliitis. The patient made a good recovery following washout of the right sacroiliac joint and 6 weeks of antibiotics.

### Neck pain: revision 2017 [^116im6U2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Imaging conditions for suspected spine trauma — American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria — use a decision algorithm in which the presence of any high‑risk factor ("Age ≥ 65 y", "Dangerous mechanism (A)", or "Upper extremity paresthesia") leads to "Imaging (D)". If no high‑risk factor is present, assess for "Any low-risk factor allowing range-of-motion assessment"; if none are present, proceed to "Imaging (D)". If low‑risk factors are present, test rotation; inability to rotate the neck "45° left and right" prompts "Imaging (D)", whereas ability supports "No imaging (D)". Dangerous mechanism (A) is defined as "Fall from ≥ 3 ft/5 stairs, axial load, MVC at ≥ 60 mph or rollover or ejection, motorized recreational vehicle accident, bicycle collision", while for simple rear‑end motor vehicle collision (B) it "excludes pushed into on-coming traffic, hit by bus or large truck, rollover, hit by high speed vehicle", and delayed onset neck pain (C) means "No immediate onset after trauma".

### Traumatic hip dislocation with spontaneous incomplete reduction: a diagnostic trap [^112n9aYq]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

We are reporting three children and adolescents who presented with incongruous reduction of the hip following injury. In each case, the diagnosis was initially missed. None of the patients presented with a hip dislocation, but two gave a history consistent with transient hip subluxation or dislocation. Low-energy trauma was the cause in two cases. Treatment consisted of arthrotomy to remove interposed capsule and labrum to obtain concentric reduction. When reduction of a hip dislocation occurs spontaneously, the condition may be misjudged. Any child or adolescent who complains of hip pain following injury should have radiographs scrutinized for asymmetric widening of the hip joints. Any asymmetry should be evaluated by appropriate imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Removal of any interposed tissue is recommended, even when the diagnosis is delayed by several months.

### Rare case of posterior hip dislocation caused by low-energy trauma in a boy in early adolescence: acute and long-term management-review of the literature [^1132qnXf]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

The incidence of hip dislocations in teenagers caused by low-velocity trauma is a relatively rare finding and constitutes a true orthopaedic emergency. Prompt reduction is recommended to avoid long-term complications. On average, the non-weight-bearing period ranges from 4 to 6 weeks. Follow-up with radiographic imaging is necessary to evaluate for hip pathologies over time. In this paper, we will report the findings of a posterior hip dislocation in a healthy boy in early adolescence caused by a ground level fall on grass with review of the literature. Closed reduction of the right hip was performed within 4hours of the dislocation. A 6-week non-weight-bearing period was recommended before transitioning into a 2-week period of partial weight-bearing. At 12weeks, our patient returned to sports and had negative radiographic and clinical findings of hip pathology throughout the follow-up period.

### Occult fractures of the proximal femur: imaging diagnosis and management of 82 cases in a regional trauma center [^113An53E]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, any patient with a suspected hip fracture (meaning a patient with significant posttraumatic hip pain, spontaneous, on palpation, mobilization or gait) and negative X-rays should receive further imaging exploration in the first 24 h. If MRI is readily available it should be preferred as it has better accuracy in detecting occult hip fractures. If for whatever reason an MRI cannot be performed in the first 24 h, an emergency CT scan should be used instead. This is often easier to accomplish, as CT is available round the clock in trauma centers and from our experience sufficient for establishing a diagnosis for the majority of patients. However in the case of a negative 24 h CT the patient should be further investigated. Again the MRI should be the investigation of choice, and if not available followed by a repeat CT after 72 h.

### Three part posterior fracture dislocation of the hip without fracture of the femoral head: review of literature and a case report [^115j7sC2]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

This case report describes a rare posterior dislocation of the hip with fractures of the ipsilateral femoral neck and greater trochanter, without fracture of the femoral head, in a young adult male following a railway accident. This patient was managed within 6h of injury by open reconstruction. This unusual injury has not been reported previously. Cases of posterior fracture dislocation of the hip with a fracture of the femoral neck without fracture of the femoral head were reviewed from the literature. Mechanism of injury, controversies regarding operative procedures and appropriate surgical approach are discussed. The authors also believe that this injury pattern merits inclusion in the existing classification system of fracture dislocation of hip for management and prediction of outcome.

Abstract

The cause of acute onset hip pain in children can be difficult to determine. Once trauma is excluded, the workup revolves around determining whether there is a hip effusion and eliminating orthopedic emergencies. Point-of-care-ultrasound can be used as an adjunct in the workup. In this article, we review (1) differential diagnosis of hip pain, with a focus on toxic synovitis; (2) the evaluation of a hip for the presence of effusion, including the point-of-care ultrasound technique; and (3) the management of toxic synovitis.

Results and clinical course

Patients 1 and 2 became wheelchair-bound 2 years after sustaining unilateral injury to the lower extremity. Their vasomotor symptoms eventually spread to the opposite side. Both the patients developed intermittent dystonic posturing of the injured side (Figure 1). A computerized axial tomography scan of the brain in both of them was normal. Neither encountered protracted bureaucratic impediments in their job-related claims.

Patient 3, who developed type 2 CRPS secondary to injury of the superficial peroneal nerve, in a motor vehicle accident, experienced persistent swelling in the affected leg, skin fragility, and allodynia that spread to the uninjured side. A year and a half after the symptoms were diagnosed, an independent medical examiner (IME) recommended that further treatment should be discontinued. It was the opinion of the examiner that there were "no detectable signs" of CRPS and that the patient had achieved maximum medical improvement.

Patient 4 developed recurrent vasomotor symptoms and allodynia in the affected extremity that lasted for several years but was able to work on a limited basis. Interestingly, she developed transient symptoms of CRPS every time she sustained a minor injury or infection in other parts of her body.

Patient 5, who experienced some legal difficulties that were resolved following the presentation of photographical evidence of her intermittent vasomotor symptoms, demonstrated at the height of pain exacerbation, in the right lower extremity.

Patient 6 developed signs of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 2 months after the injury and the onset of CRPS. He was treated accordingly for RA by the rheumatologist, using methotrexate, adalimumab, and prednisone. The symptoms related to CRPS in the right hand persisted and remain unresolved. A causal relationship between CRPS and the onset of CRPS was disputed.

### The polytrauma clinical triad in patients with chronic pain after motor vehicle collision [^112fPGnx]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Descriptive statistics of the sample are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the overall sample was 43.3 years (SD = 12.7), and slightly more than half of the patients were female (n = 40; 56.3%). The mean duration from MVC to screening evaluation date was 753.6 days (SD = 653.3), and 69.0% of the study sample were screened more than 12 months after their MVC. Most patients were driving the vehicle involved (71.8%), and a rear impact was most common (47.9%). While the majority recalled experiencing one or more symptoms of concussion immediately following their collision (76.1%), only a minority recalled a loss of consciousness (18.0%). Within 24 hours of their MVC, 74.6% (n = 53) of the sample visited an emergency room, and nearly three-quarters of these patients (38 of 53) were given prescription analgesics. Upon receiving any medical care after MVC, whiplash-associated disorder was diagnosed in 40.8% of the sample, and 26.8% were told that they had likely sustained a concussion.

RPQ item scoring results are illustrated in Table 2. High item scores (defined as a score of ≥ 3) for measures relating to headaches, mood disturbances (irritability, depressed mood, restlessness, and frustration), cognitive disturbances (forgetfulness, poor concentration, and thought processing), and constitutional symptoms (fatigue, sleep quality, and restlessness) were present in almost all patients. In contrast, there were lower incidences of patients reporting high item scores on RPQ measures relating to visual disturbances (blurred, vision, light sensitivity, and double vision) and vestibular disturbances (dizziness, nausea/vomiting, and noise sensitivity). Mean scores were also lower for visual and vestibular symptoms (1.775 and 2.380, respectively) than those for headache (3.535), mood (3.146), cognitive (3.061), and constitutional (3.174) PCS symptoms.

### Traumatic hip dislocation: what the orthopedic surgeon wants to know [^1116cWMd]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Hip dislocation is an important orthopedic emergency usually seen in young patients who have experienced high-energy trauma, often resulting in significant long-term morbidity. Rapid identification and reduction is critical, as prolonged dislocation increases the risk of developing avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and posttraumatic osteoarthritis is a common complication, even in the absence of associated fractures. Identification and timely management of hip dislocation are highly dependent on imaging, both at presentation and after attempted reduction. It is imperative for the radiologist to understand imaging features that guide management of hip dislocation to ensure timely identification, characterization, and communication of clinically relevant results. Although the importance of prompt identification of hip dislocation is universally recognized, the significance of imaging features that guide correct management and are thought to prevent complications is less emphasized in the radiology literature. In this article, the authors review the anatomy of the hip, common injury mechanisms for various types of dislocations, and imaging findings for associated injuries. They review the most commonly used classification systems and propose a simplified checklist approach to hip dislocation to aid rapid interpretation and communication of the most clinically relevant imaging features to the treating orthopedic surgeon. © RSNA, 2017.

### A rare but radiographically recognizable cause of an irreducible hip fracture-dislocation [^1141XS86]. Clinical Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Hip dislocations are emergently reduced to decrease the chance of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. However, in some situations, the dislocation may be irreducible by a closed technique. Rarely, the fractured femoral head may become perched on an intact acetabulum, leading to an irreducible fracture-dislocation. This rare type of irreducible fracture-dislocation demonstrates unique physical and associated radiographic findings. These fractures are important to recognize early, as attempts at closed reduction can lead to femoral neck fractures.

### Surgical hip dislocation for osteochondral transplantation as a salvage procedure for a femoral head impaction fracture [^116ZWqwU]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2010). Low credibility.

Obturator anterior hip dislocation is very rare. Poor results are described in patients with additional large transchondral fractures and treatment of these injuries remains challenging. Appropriate treatment recommendations are missing in the literature. This case report introduces surgical hip dislocation for osteochondral autograft transplantation with graft harvest from the nonweightbearing area of the head-neck junction as a salvage procedure in a large femoral head defect. We report the treatment and outcome of a 48-year-old man who sustained an anterior dislocation of the left hip after a motorcycle accident. After initial closed reduction in the emergency room, imaging analysis revealed a large osteochondral defect of the femoral head within the weightbearing area (10 × 20 mm, depth: 5 mm). The hip was exposed with a surgical hip dislocation using a trochanteric osteotomy. An osteochondral autograft was harvested from a nonweightbearing area of the femoral head and transferred into the defect. The patient was prospectively examined clinically and radiologically. Two years postoperatively, the patient was free of pain and complaints. The function of the injured hip was comparable to that of the contralateral, healthy hip and showed satisfying radiologic results. Surgical hip dislocation with a trochanteric flip osteotomy is a simple, one-step technique that allows full inspection of the hip to treat osteochondral femoral defects by osteochondral transplantation. The presented technique, used as a salvage procedure in a large femoral head defect, yielded good clinical and satisfying radiologic outcomes at the midterm.

### A rare case of a non-traumatic neck of femur fracture in a 17-year-old boy associated with vitamin D deficiency [^116qFu3C]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Hip fractures in the young, healthy population are rare and often the result of high-energy trauma. A previously healthy 17-year-old patient presented to our institution with a 5-week history of left hip and knee pain in the absence of any trauma. Pelvic radiograph revealed a subacute left femoral neck fracture. He subsequently underwent surgical fixation and made an uneventful recovery. Further endocrine evaluation revealed isolated vitamin D deficiency to be the likely underlying cause for this fracture. Multiple previous opportunities were missed to identify the cause for this patient's symptoms. An intracapsular fracture in a young adult requires early recognition and prompt anatomical reduction. This case emphasises the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for atraumatic fractures in healthy adolescents with unexplained joint pain. Further endocrine and metabolic investigations are warranted, and isolated vitamin D deficiency must be considered as a potential causative factor.

A 16-year-old female patient showed up at the orthopaedics unit complaining of intolerable pain on her left hip. While being questioned and her clinical history written down, she shared that as part of her daily exercise routine, she ran 10 miles (16km) daily at a speed of 9.5–10.5 mph (15-17km/hour). MRI was consequently ordered, confirming the presence of a stress fracture. Therefore, immediate suspension of physical activity was indicated, followed by the prescription of crutches as well as restricted weight bearing. Gradually, she recovered complete functionality and approximately a month after she had entirely healed. While on a skiing trip, again she abruptly developed an acute pain on her right hip. Another MRI was ordered; its result confirmed a new stress fracture. Her previous treatment has proved so successful, a conservative approach was once again prescribed for her, showing optimum results 6 months later.

### Current concepts review: evaluation and management of posterior hip pain [^116RK2K8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the etiology of and evolving research on intra- and extra-articular hip complaints requires comprehensive diagnosis and management of the spectrum of posterior hip diseases. Interest in posterior hip disorders has increased in recent years as new studies and theories have emerged regarding the disease process. Although most of the differential diagnoses around the posterior hip have traditionally been considered uncommon, recent reports suggest that these complaints have instead been commonly overlooked. Failure to identify the cause of posterior hip pain in a timely manner can increase pain perception, deteriorate the patient's hope, and consequently affect quality of life. Posterior hip pain could be differentiated as intrapelvic and extrapelvic, and differential diagnosis is made based on a comprehensive history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Plain radiography, CT, MRI, 3T MRI, and imaging-guided injection tests are usually necessary for accurate diagnosis. Surgical intervention, whether endoscopic or open, is required for patients with long-standing symptoms for whom nonsurgical treatment has been unsuccessful and who have experienced temporary relief of their symptoms after injection. Orthopedic surgeons are uniquely trained in understanding the anatomy, biomechanics, clinical evaluation and treatment of all five layers of the hip.

### Avoiding anchoring bias in unexplained chronic pain: an unexpected diagnosis of synovial osteochondromatosis [^111jH8MR]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Unconscious biases may influence clinical decision making, leading to diagnostic error. Anchoring bias occurs when a physician relies too heavily on the initial data received. We present a 57-year-old man with a 3-year history of unexplained right thigh pain who was referred to a physiatry clinic for suggestions on managing presumed non-organic pain. The patient had previously been assessed by numerous specialists and had undergone several imaging investigations, with no identifiable cause for his pain. Physical examination was challenging and there were several 'yellow flags' on history. A thorough reconsideration of the possible diagnoses led to the discovery of hip synovial osteochondromatosis as the cause for his symptoms. Over-reliance on the referral information may have led to this diagnosis being missed. In patients with unexplained pain, it is important to be aware of anchoring bias in order to avoid missing rare diagnoses.

### Bilateral atraumatic femoral neck fractures resulting from transient osteoporosis of the hip [^1165Z58N]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her mid-30s presented to the orthopaedic team, unable to mobilise, shortly after her caesarean section. On questioning, she reported 10 weeks of atraumatic right hip pain. A radiograph revealed a displaced right subcapital neck of femur fracture. An MRI confirmed this, as well as identifying a minimally displaced left subcapital neck of femur fracture. She underwent a right total hip replacement and internal fixation of the left hip. A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan showed severe osteoporosis, and a diagnosis of transient osteoporosis of the hip was made. She was seen by the bone metabolism team and given calcium and vitamin D medication. Although atraumatic hip fractures are rare in young patients, disproportionate or persisting hip pain in pregnant patients should raise the index of suspicion and prompt further investigation in the form of an MRI. This will allow timely management of hip fractures and improve patient outcomes.

Study Design

Resident's case problem.

Background

Identifying stress fractures of the hip can be a challenging differential diagnosis. Pain presentation is not always predictable and radiographs may not show the fracture, especially during its early stages. Hip stress fractures left untreated can displace and necessitate open reduction internal fixation or total hip arthroplasty.

Diagnosis

A 70-year-old woman presented to the physical therapy clinic with complaints of right hip pain. She had been evaluated by a physician and radiographs of the hip, which revealed some arthritic changes, were otherwise normal. Upon examination, the physical therapist observed an antalgic gait, a noncapsular pattern of limitation of hip motion, an empty painful end feel at the end range of motion (ROM) for hip abduction, external rotation, and flexion, and extreme tenderness to palpation over the anterior hip region. The therapist suspected a more pernicious problem than osteoarthritis and discussed his suspicion with the physician. The physician subsequently requested an MRI that revealed a femoral neck and head stress fracture that was later confirmed with a bone scan. The patient was provided with a walker for ambulation with a non-weight-bearing status for 6 weeks, after which she returned to physical therapy for progressive weight bearing and strengthening. She was discharged with a relatively pain-free hip and was ambulating with a cane. A 2-month follow-up examination revealed a pain-free hip and a return to all premorbid activities, including ambulation without an assistive device.

Discussion

The presence of a normal radiograph of the hip should not be considered conclusive in ruling out a stress fracture in the hip region. The current case demonstrates how careful evaluation can reveal occult pathologies and prevent potentially catastrophic morbidity.

### Use of multislice CT for investigation of occult geriatric hip fractures and impact on timing of surgery [^112K3Pok]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We believe modern MSCT is a pragmatic investigation for suspected OHF in the vast majority of patients in situations where MRI is not promptly available, although the available literature remains contradictory. We have demonstrated that MSCT was unable to identify an acute fracture on the background of a previously healed ipsilateral hip fracture, suggesting it is unsuitable to rule out OHF in this uncommon situation. This may suggest MSCT is inappropriate in other causes of abnormal preexisting bony anatomy, such as previous hip surgery or pathological fractures. It therefore follows that persistent hip pain following a negative MSCT in this group of patients warrants further investigation with MRI. While the advantages of wider availability, speed, and decreased cost are clear with MSCT, further prospective randomized study of MSCT against MRI will be necessary to justify a change in best practice guidelines.

### Anterior hip dislocation: a current concepts review and proposal of management algorithm [^114A9aaT]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Anterior hip dislocations as compared to posterior, rarely occurs. Nevertheless, it is important to be prepared to manage it. Physical examination and imaging are crucial in detecting this type of dislocation and ruling out any associated fractures. The most important thing is not delaying reduction which is done in a closed manner preferably in the operating room and under general anesthesia. Post-operative complications should be monitored. As for rehabilitation it is still debated and no consensus was reached.

### Young man with sudden severe hip pain secondary to femoral neck stress fracture [^1124LQmE]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Femoral neck stress fractures have been described in military recruits and athletes. Early recognition and aggressive treatment are important, as femoral neck stress fractures have a high potential for complications and even uncomplicated fractures require an extensive course of rehabilitation. Tension-side (superolateral) stress fractures of the femoral neck are at high risk for complications such as displacement, non-union and avascular necrosis, and need to be treated surgically, while compression-side (inferomedial) fractures can be treated conservatively. We describe a case illustrating a typical presentation of insidious hip pain culminating in sudden onset of severe hip pain in a healthy young man. We perform a literature review of studies showing epidemiology, treatment algorithms and rehabilitation.

### Case report of a hip-protecting, wearable airbag contributing to a serious adverse event in an older adult [^1127HpJS]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

On a follow up call on day 2 (one day after first fitting, as per study protocol), the participant confirmed that she was wearing the airbag around her home, and that she had no problems in using or charging the device. On day 3, the participant, having fitted the airbag herself, attended her family doctor for a routine appointment. She would normally employ the use of a motorised mobility scooter when making this journey however on this day, her mobility scooter battery was not sufficiently charged so she attended by taxi instead. She opted for the use of two walking sticks for ease of travel by car instead of her 4-wheeled walking frame that she would normally use outdoors. On leaving the doctor's premises, she walked outside to a waiting taxi. The taxi driver observed her standing on the pavement and that she was wearing "a belt" (the Hip'Guard) which appeared to be falling down from her waist onto her upper thighs. He called out to alert her as she seemed unaware of it having slipped down but she did not hear what he was saying, she later reported. She reported that she was focused solely on using her two walking sticks as she was fearful of falling, and was anxious to make her way safely to the car. As she stepped forward the Hip'Guard impeded her stride and she immediately fell, sustaining an oblique, comminuted fracture of the right distal femur (Fig. 1).

The belt which is waist-worn (Fig. 2), was described as positioned just above her knees as she lay on the ground, with the snap buckle still closed without deployment of the airbag (Fig. 3).

The fracture was successfully repaired with internal fixation however the post-operative clinical course was complicated by a post-operative haematoma requiring transfusion, recurrent bowel ileus, delirium and a prolonged hospitalisation (Fig. 4).

Six months following the fracture, despite intensive rehabilitation efforts, she was only able to transfer with assistance on one person. She never returned to baseline mobility.
