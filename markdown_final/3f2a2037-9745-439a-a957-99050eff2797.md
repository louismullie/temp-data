## Question

How should low free testosterone be treated when total testosterone is normal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat low free testosterone when total testosterone is normal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the patient truly has androgen deficiency symptoms and how to confirm them. Then, I should verify the biochemical data with proper timing and methods, including how free testosterone was measured and whether SHBG is abnormal. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis for discordant total versus free testosterone, address reversible causes, and assess contraindications. Finally, I will weigh evidence for and against testosterone therapy, consider alternatives, and outline monitoring if treatment is initiated, all while checking the strength and applicability of the guidelines and studies cited [^116QUpQv] [^116yTpN9] [^114W9Cp4].

> Let me first confirm the clinical threshold for action, because a diagnosis of hypogonadism requires both compatible symptoms and unequivocally low testosterone measures, not symptoms alone; I need to ensure we are not over-interpreting nonspecific complaints such as fatigue or low mood without corroborative labs, and I should also avoid testing or diagnosing during acute intercurrent illness or when suppressive medications are on board that could transiently lower testosterone levels [^116QUpQv] [^112MVWjG] [^114N7HCt].

> Next, I should review the biochemical confirmation carefully; total testosterone must be measured on two separate fasting mornings between 7 and 10 AM because of diurnal and day-to-day variability, and a substantial minority of older men with an initially low value will normalize on repeat testing, so I must double-check that this foundational step has been done correctly before interpreting any free testosterone result [^111zq8AY] [^115LrmTB].

> Now, about free testosterone in the setting of a normal total testosterone — wait, I almost said that any direct free testosterone immunoassay would be acceptable, but that would be incorrect; I should correct myself and confirm that direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays are inaccurate and should not be used, whereas equilibrium dialysis (reference method) or a validated calculation using total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin (for example, Vermeulen-based) are recommended, particularly when SHBG is abnormal or total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal, so I need to verify both the assay method and the SHBG value to interpret the discordance appropriately [^116yTpN9] [^1138udww] [^1145zyce].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of SHBG in causing low free testosterone despite normal total testosterone; elevated SHBG in aging, hyperthyroidism, liver disease, HIV, anticonvulsant or estrogen use, or genetic variants can reduce the free fraction and create this discordant profile, so I need to check for and address those conditions specifically, whereas obesity and type 2 diabetes usually lower SHBG and often produce the opposite biochemical pattern (low total, normal free), which should not be confused with this case [^116yTpN9] [^1138udww].

> Let me consider whether low free testosterone with normal total testosterone actually correlates with clinical hypogonadal features; observational data suggest that men with normal total but low calculated free testosterone report more sexual and physical symptoms and have lower hemoglobin and adverse bone parameters compared with men with both normal total and free testosterone, which supports clinical relevance, but I should also acknowledge the limitations in free testosterone measurement standardization and reference ranges in older men when interpreting any single cutoff [^114XFAuG] [^1138udww].

> Before contemplating testosterone therapy, I need to ensure we have optimized reversible contributors; targeted weight loss, treatment of sleep apnea, aggressive management of cardiometabolic comorbidities, and removal of HPT-axis–suppressive drugs can raise testosterone by 10–30% on average and often improve overlapping symptoms, so I should prioritize these for 6–12 months in men 50 years and older unless there is clear organic hypogonadism, and reassess symptoms and labs thereafter [^114W9Cp4] [^113BAEvt].

> I should confirm the absence of contraindications prior to any trial of therapy; that means ruling out prostate or breast cancer, addressing a suspicious DRE or elevated PSA thresholds, ensuring hematocrit is not elevated, and avoiding therapy in untreated severe OSA, uncontrolled heart failure, recent MI or stroke, and known thrombophilia, while also discussing prostate risk assessment and monitoring if treatment is pursued, especially in men aged 55–69 with substantial life expectancy [^112uJAkp] [^11618rAB].

> Now I will examine the decision to treat when symptoms persist and free testosterone remains unequivocally low despite normal total testosterone and optimization of health; Endocrine Society guidance allows diagnosis based on unequivocally low free testosterone when indicated, and EAA supports therapy for sexual dysfunction in confirmed hypogonadism, while ACP suggests a shared decision conversation specifically for men with sexual dysfunction and age-related low testosterone and recommends discontinuation if goals are unmet, but I should caution that AUA Choosing Wisely discourages testosterone for erectile dysfunction when testosterone is normal (a statement largely based on total testosterone), and high-quality RCT data specifically for isolated low free testosterone are limited with long-term cardiovascular outcomes from TRAVERSE still contextually relevant at the time of those reviews, so I need to present these trade-offs transparently [^116QUpQv] [^115x7nqZ] [^117Ubn9i] [^112CeEKd] [^113Vw3oH] [^113esc8W].

> But wait, what if symptoms are domain-specific; I should prioritize direct treatments first or alongside endocrine management — PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction, evidence-based therapy for depression, standard osteoporosis treatments when indicated, and structured exercise programs for fatigue and function — because multiple guidelines advise against using testosterone monotherapy to treat these endpoints in the absence of clear hypogonadism, and this approach can reduce unnecessary exposure while we continue evaluation [^114W9Cp4] [^112SfWr7].

> If after shared decision-making a carefully monitored therapeutic trial is undertaken, I need to ensure precise follow-up; reassess sexual symptoms by 3–6 months and broader outcomes by 12 months, check total testosterone (aiming for a mid-normal range per practice standards), hematocrit, and PSA at baseline and during therapy, and discontinue if there is no clinically meaningful improvement by 12 months in men treated for age-related low testosterone and sexual dysfunction, recognizing that treatment burden and monitoring are integral to safety [^114TwRZc] [^111HqSMM].

> I should double-check special considerations before final recommendations; testosterone is contraindicated when fertility is desired in the near term because it suppresses spermatogenesis, and prostate risk discussions should remain balanced, noting observational data that very low free testosterone may be associated with lower overall prostate cancer risk but potentially different associations by grade, which underscores why individualized counseling and urologic collaboration are prudent when risk is uncertain [^1174Hvb4] [^111rtRHy].

For men with low free testosterone but normal total testosterone, **treat only if symptomatic** [^116QUpQv] and **confirm low free T using reliable methods** [^116yTpN9]. Start with **lifestyle changes** [^114W9Cp4] (weight loss, exercise [^113BAEvt], treat sleep apnea, stop smoking, limit alcohol) and address **reversible causes** (medications, comorbidities) [^1132LYjC]. If symptoms persist after 6–12 months, **consider testosterone therapy** [^114W9Cp4] with shared decision-making; monitor benefits and adverse effects, and discontinue if there is no improvement [^114TwRZc]. Avoid **TRT** in men planning fertility [^1174Hvb4] or with contraindications (prostate/breast cancer, severe LUTS, recent cardiovascular events, thrombophilia, untreated severe sleep apnea) [^112uJAkp].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical significance

Diagnosis of hypogonadism requires consistent symptoms/signs [^11798Y7c] and **unequivocally low total and/or free testosterone** [^116QUpQv]. Clinical significance: **low free testosterone with normal total testosterone** [^116p18DP] can cause androgen deficiency symptoms (sexual dysfunction, fatigue, reduced muscle mass, osteoporosis) [^114XFAuG].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Initial testing**: Measure total testosterone on two separate fasting morning samples [^111zq8AY] (7–10 am).

- **Free testosterone assessment**: Use equilibrium dialysis [^116yTpN9] or calculate from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal [^1145zyce].

- **Avoid direct immunoassays**: Do not use direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays [^1138udww] [^116yTpN9].

---

## Clinical guidelines for treatment

- **Lifestyle modifications**: First-line therapy [^114W9Cp4] includes weight loss, exercise, treating sleep apnea, smoking cessation, and alcohol reduction [^113BAEvt].

- **Address reversible causes**: Optimize comorbidities and review medications that suppress the HPT axis [^114W9Cp4] [^1132LYjC].

- **Testosterone therapy**: Consider only for persistent symptoms after 6–12 months of lifestyle measures and confirmed low free testosterone [^114W9Cp4] [^112XtTwV].

---

## Indications for testosterone therapy

Testosterone therapy is appropriate when **androgen-deficiency symptoms** [^115x7nqZ] — such as sexual dysfunction, fatigue, reduced muscle mass, or osteoporosis — persist despite lifestyle measures [^114W9Cp4]. Initiate therapy only after low free testosterone is confirmed with reliable methods [^116yTpN9]. Use shared decision-making to discuss benefits, risks, and patient preferences before starting therapy [^117Ubn9i].

---

## Contraindications to testosterone therapy

Absolute contraindications include prostate or breast cancer, severe LUTS, recent MI or stroke, thrombophilia, and untreated severe sleep apnea [^112uJAkp]. Relative contraindications include elevated hematocrit, high PSA, uncontrolled heart failure, and fertility plans.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical monitoring**: Reassess symptoms within 12 months [^117Ubn9i] and periodically thereafter [^114TwRZc].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Check testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA at baseline [^11618rAB] and at least annually [^117KbkG9].

- **Discontinue therapy**: Stop if no symptom improvement or adverse effects occur [^114TwRZc].

---

## Alternative treatments

Clomiphene citrate can be considered for men who desire fertility or have contraindications to testosterone therapy [^112VkCBb], and **selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs)** are investigational options under study.

---

## Risks and benefits of testosterone therapy

Benefits include improved sexual function [^113esc8W], mood, muscle mass, and bone density [^114XcycD] [^112XtTwV], and **risks** include erythrocytosis, prostate effects, cardiovascular events, and infertility [^112uJAkp].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|
| Lifestyle modifications | High |
| Address reversible causes | High |
| Testosterone therapy for persistent symptoms | Moderate |
| Shared decision-making | High |
| Regular monitoring and follow-up | High |
| Discontinue if no improvement | High |

---

Treatment for low free testosterone with normal total testosterone should be guided by symptoms [^116QUpQv] and confirmation of **low free testosterone** [^116yTpN9]. Start with lifestyle changes and address reversible causes [^114W9Cp4]; consider testosterone therapy only if symptoms persist, with careful monitoring and shared decision-making [^117Ubn9i].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically in relation to testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend determining free testosterone concentrations either directly from equilibrium dialysis assays or through calculations using total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and albumin concentrations. This approach is suggested for patients with conditions altering SHBG, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid use, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, SHBG gene polymorphisms, older age, HIV, cirrhosis, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, certain anticonvulsants, and estrogens. It is also recommended for those with initial total testosterone concentrations at or near the lower limit of the normal range (200–400 ng/dL). Direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays should not be used.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114W9Cp4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The decision to treat medical conditions always involves an analysis of the benefits and risks; that analysis is particularly important in the decision to initiate testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years. Although testosterone replacement for men with organic hypogonadism is uncontroversial irrespective of age, men ≥ 50 years old with nonspecific symptoms, reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations, normal serum gonadotropins, and no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease often have improved health and well-being and normalization of serum testosterone concentrations with optimization of weight and comorbidities and stopping or reducing the dosage of medications that affect the HPT axis.

In addition, therapies other than testosterone should be considered for symptoms and signs that might be attributed to hypogonadism: PDE5-inhibitors (for erectile dysfunction); treatment of sleep apnea, depression, obesity, and diabetes mellitus with proven effective therapies; and medications that reduce fracture risk (for osteoporosis). It is reasonable to add testosterone treatment to men ≥ 50 years with persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone (measured fasted in the morning when the man is at baseline health) and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations, despite lifestyle measures for 6–12 months to lose weight (if BMI > 25 kg/m²) and optimization of management of comorbidities. This decision must be individualized and is not algorithmic, and there should be no contraindication.

Regarding the medical management of male hypogonadism, particularly concerning testosterone therapy, the Endocrine Society 2018 guidelines recommend initiating testosterone replacement therapy in patients aged 55–69 with hypogonadism who have a life expectancy greater than 10 years. This should only occur after discussing potential benefits and risks, evaluating prostate cancer risk, and engaging the patient in shared decision-making regarding prostate cancer monitoring. Prostate cancer risk should be assessed before and 3–12 months after initiating testosterone therapy in patients opting for monitoring.

### When and when not to use testosterone for palliation in cancer care [^112dmymn]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is common throughout the illness trajectory of patients with cancer. About two-thirds of male patients with advanced cancer have hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal dysfunction and low testosterone levels. Chronic inflammation, comorbidities, cachexia, chemotherapy, and medications such as opioids, megestrol acetate, and corticosteroids contribute to primary and secondary hypogonadism. Studies have reported increased symptom burden, diminished quality of life, and poor prognosis associated with low testosterone levels in males with cancer. The Endocrine Society has published clinical practice guidelines for replacing testosterone in symptomatic patients with chronic illness and in patients receiving opioids; however, the role of testosterone therapy specifically in patients with cancer is not addressed. This review explores the potential benefits and limitations of testosterone replacement based on evidence.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1138udww]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected. A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L), measured by a reliable assay, is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations. The most common causes of the constellation of low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (i.e. pseudohypogonadism) are obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^115TWE1i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The international panel concluded that the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition, or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

- **Diagnosis and treatment recommendations**:
	- The diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment, and other factors contributing to female sexual dysfunction (FSD) must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentrations. Since no approved female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses, and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

### Approach to the patient: Low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^114kbPD3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Free testosterone, whether measured or calculated using equilibrium binding or empirical equations, is advocated by some experts to appraise androgen status in certain circumstances. However, such recommendations are based on observational data and received wisdom rather than objective evidence from controlled clinical testing and, therefore, in our opinion, add nothing useful to the clinical evaluation. The free testosterone hypothesis asserts that free testosterone is the most biologically active moiety of testosterone. This is conceptually flawed because unbound testosterone is equally accessible to sites of degradation as it is to target tissues, so there is no logical basis to claim it is more (rather than less) biologically active.

Reference laboratory dialysis-based measurements of free testosterone are non-robust, costly, and rarely available. Most laboratories report calculations based on formulae incorporating serum testosterone and SHBG measurements. However, such calculations are consistently inaccurate relative to dialysis-based measurements due to assumptions such as using SHBG mass as a substitute for SHBG binding capacity, the use of four different non-harmonized SHBG immunoassays, and the use of five different empirical estimates of testosterone-SHBG binding affinity.

Furthermore, free testosterone is not a valid analytical variable, as it lacks a certified reference standard. This violates a fundamental principle of analytical chemistry requiring the comparison of like with like. As a result, free testosterone lacks sufficient quality control.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115LrmTB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations, measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 AM) in the fasting state, are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Use of such an assay facilitates application of findings from the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone vs. placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (e.g. specific clinical features, such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration due to significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing vena.

### Low free testosterone is associated with hypogonadal signs and symptoms in men with normal total testosterone [^114XFAuG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

During aging, total testosterone (TT) declines and SHBG increases, resulting in a greater decrease in calculated free testosterone (cFT). Currently, guidelines suggest using TT to diagnose androgen deficiency and to reserve cFT only for men with borderline TT.

Our objective was to investigate if either low cFT or low TT is more strongly associated with androgen-related clinical endpoints. A total of 3,334 community-dwelling men, aged 40–79 years, were included in this study. Differences in clinical variables between the referent group of men with both normal TT (≥ 10.5 nmol/liter) and normal cFT (≥ 220 pmol/liter) with those who had normal TT/low cFT, low TT/normal cFT, and low TT/low cFT were assessed by regression models adjusted for age, center, body mass index, and comorbidities.

A total of 2,641 men had normal TT (18.4 ± 5.5 [mean ± SD] nmol/liter)/normal cFT (326 ± 74 pmol/liter), 277 men had normal TT (14.2 ± 3.7)/low cFT (194 ± 23), 96 men had low TT (9.6 ± 0.7)/normal cFT (247 ± 20), and 320 men had low TT (7.8 ± 2.5)/low cFT (160 ± 55). Men with normal TT/low cFT were older and in poorer health. They had higher SHBG and LH and reported more sexual and physical symptoms, whereas hemoglobin and bone ultrasound parameters were lower compared to the referent group. Men with low TT/normal cFT were younger and more obese. They had lower SHBG, but LH was normal, whereas features of androgen deficiency were lacking.

Low cFT, even in the presence of normal TT, is associated with androgen deficiency-related symptoms.

Testosterone treatment rates in adult men have increased in the United States over the past two decades. This study was conducted to assess the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment for men without underlying organic causes of hypogonadism.

- **Data sources**: English-language searches of multiple electronic databases (January 1980 to May 2019) and reference lists from systematic reviews.

- **Study selection**: The study included 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least six months' duration, evaluating transdermal or intramuscular testosterone therapies versus placebo or no treatment. It also reported on prespecified patient-centered outcomes, as well as 20 long-term observational studies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review data, and product labels that reported harms information.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was performed by a single investigator and confirmed by a second. Two investigators assessed risk of bias, and evidence certainty was determined by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: Studies primarily involved older men with varying ages, symptoms, and testosterone eligibility criteria. The study found that testosterone therapy improved sexual functioning and quality of life in men with low testosterone levels, although effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). However, testosterone therapy had little to no effect on physical functioning, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition. The evidence for harms reported in trials was judged to be insufficient or of low certainty for most harm outcomes. No trials were powered to assess cardiovascular events or prostate cancer, and trials often excluded men at increased risk.

### Low free testosterone and prostate cancer risk: A collaborative analysis of 20 prospective studies [^111rtRHy]. European Urology (2018). High credibility.

Experimental and clinical evidence implicates testosterone in the etiology of prostate cancer. Variation across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations may not lead to changes in prostate biology unless circulating concentrations are low. This may also apply to prostate cancer risk, but this has not been investigated in an epidemiological setting.

- **Objective**: To examine whether men with low concentrations of circulating free testosterone have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Analysis of individual participant data from 20 prospective studies including 6,933 prostate cancer cases, diagnosed on average 6.8 years after blood collection, and 12,088 controls in the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Odds ratios (ORs) of incident overall prostate cancer and subtypes by stage and grade, using conditional logistic regression, based on study-specific tenths of calculated free testosterone concentration.

- **Results and limitations**: Men in the lowest tenth of free testosterone concentration had a lower risk of overall prostate cancer (OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.86; p < 0.001) compared with men with higher concentrations (2nd–10th tenths of the distribution). Heterogeneity was present by tumor grade (p het = 0.01), with a lower risk of low-grade disease (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.88) and a non-significantly higher risk of high-grade disease (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.95–2.57).

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1132LYjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Men with low serum testosterone concentrations can be characterized as having classic hypogonadism (sometimes called organic hypogonadism) due to an identifiable pathology or disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT, gonadal) axis, or they can be characterized as eugonadal with suppression of the gonadal axis due to a systemic disorder or condition. A low serum testosterone due to suppression of the gonadal axis by a systemic disorder is analogous to the changes in thyroid function seen in euthyroid sick syndrome and is sometimes described as functional hypogonadism. Similar to euthyroid sick syndrome (or nonthyroidal illness), men with low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis by systemic disease might have underlying normal HPT function. Because the serum testosterone might normalize if the underlying disorder is treated and health restored, eugonadal sick syndrome or nongonadal illness might be more accurate terms than functional hypogonadism.

These terms have the advantage of identifying the underlying gonadal axis as normal and not conflating functional with reversible pathologies and disorders associated with classic hypogonadism, which are also potentially reversible (e.g. hyperprolactinemia, iron overload syndromes). Classic pathologic hypogonadism is relatively uncommon with an estimated lifetime prevalence of less than 1%. Low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis is common and increases with age and body mass index (BMI). Some experts use the term late-onset hypogonadism for functional hypogonadism in older men.

### Society for endocrinology guidelines for testosterone replacement therapy in male hypogonadism [^116pqrx4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Male hypogonadism (MH) is a common endocrine disorder; however, uncertainties and variations in its diagnosis and management exist. Several guidelines on testosterone replacement therapy have predominantly been driven by single disciplines. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with MH. This guideline has been compiled using expertise from endocrine (medical and nursing), primary care, clinical biochemistry, urology, and reproductive medicine practices. Additionally, these guidelines provide a patient perspective to help clinicians best manage MH.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115dU9ax]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The patient has continued to experience symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, alongside reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations. He inquired about testosterone therapy to restore his serum testosterone concentration to the normal range. Before considering testosterone therapy, the potential benefits and risks were discussed, and prostate cancer screening was addressed because untreated prostate cancer is a contraindication to testosterone therapy (see Table 4). After discussing the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, he chose to proceed with the screening. A digital rectal exam revealed no prostate abnormalities, and his PSA level was 1.5 ng/dL.

The potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy were further elaborated on because he had persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and unequivocally low serum testosterone concentrations following a year of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed HPT axis, including lifestyle changes to lose weight and optimizing treatment for sleep apnea.

- **Contraindications**: Due to the existing contraindications to testosterone therapy, counseling included discussions on the potential benefits and risks (like the lack of definitive data on effects related to cardiovascular outcomes and prostate cancer) and the absence of high-quality, long-term studies. The patient's main concerns were identified as low libido, reduced energy, and low mood. He was advised that, based on the T-Trials, effects of testosterone treatment on these symptoms should be apparent within 3 to 6 months, whereas other benefits such as increased muscle mass could take longer to develop.

### Optimizing diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions in men with testosterone deficiency [^112VkCBb]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

This narrative review offers a guideline-based approach for optimizing diagnostic evaluation and treatment decision-making in men being evaluated for testosterone deficiency.

- **Methods**: A narrative review was conducted.

- **Results**: Testosterone deficiency is a clinical syndrome that results from the inability of the testes to produce normal amounts of testosterone and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs associated with consistently low testosterone concentrations. The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is made by the ascertainment of symptoms and signs; the measurement of total and, if indicated, free testosterone levels in early-morning fasting samples on ≥ 2 days; the measurement of luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism; and an additional evaluation to ascertain the cause of testosterone deficiency. Nonspecificity of symptoms and signs, variations in testosterone levels over time, inaccuracy in the measurement of total and free testosterone levels, variations in binding protein concentrations, and suboptimal reference ranges contribute to diagnostic inaccuracy.

Testosterone treatment is indicated for men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency. However, testosterone treatment should be avoided in men with prostate or breast cancer, erythrocytosis, thrombophilia, increased risk of prostate cancer or severe lower urinary tract symptoms without prior urologic evaluation, a recent major adverse cardiovascular event, uncontrolled heart failure, or severe untreated sleep apnea.

### Clinical review: Why is androgen replacement in males controversial [^11757dfP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and low testosterone levels are recognized frequently in clinical practice. Recent population-based epidemiological studies indicate that low testosterone levels in men are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The clinician must be able to counsel patients to help them determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is appropriate for them.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The authors have conducted a literature search in PubMed, and they have reviewed references in the multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses published on this topic.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The goal is to provide the reader with an appreciation of the evidence that can be used to support the diagnosis of androgen deficiency, the efficacy of treatment, potential risks of treatment, therapeutic options, and recommendations for monitoring treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Published clinical experience justifies testosterone replacement therapy in males who have not initiated puberty by age 14 and in males with low testosterone levels due to classical diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The benefit-risk ratio is less certain in older men and in those with chronic diseases associated with low testosterone levels. The decision to treat in this setting is much more controversial because there are few large clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy and no large clinical trials that have determined potential risks of increasing the incidence of clinical prostate cancers or cardiovascular issues.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BvEFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

This patient might have experienced a placebo effect from testosterone therapy, which typically abates after approximately six months. The sense of well-being and sexual function are complex and depend on multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. Approximately 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to achieve a clinically significant and lasting benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men. The high discontinuation rate is reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism, after attempts to treat reversible causes, are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of treatment is 12 months or less.

An alternative explanation is that this patient experienced an improvement in the sense of well-being and sexual function that has now been sustained by the restoration of normal HPT axis function through weight loss. With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the benefit of an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration within the normal range.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112YHvvM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

His serum FSH was 4.1 IU/L (reference range, 1.0–7.0 IU/L), and LH was 3.2 IU/L (reference range, 1.0–8.0 IU/L).

- **What additional diagnostic evaluation is necessary to exclude classic organic hypothalamic-pituitary pathology in a man with low serum total testosterone and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations**: Most middle-aged and older, obese men with low testosterone will have secondary hypogonadism with normal serum gonadotropin concentrations. Men with secondary hypogonadism should be clinically assessed for Cushing syndrome and sleep apnea. Evaluation for identifiable hypothalamic and pituitary pathology should be individualized because the yield is typically low.

In men ≥ 50 years old with low serum testosterone and normal gonadotropin concentrations, clinical experience suggests that the probability of classic organic hypothalamic-pituitary pathology is inversely related to BMI, age, number of comorbidities, and testosterone concentration. In older, obese men, pseudohypogonadism due to obesity is the most common cause for the biochemical constellation of low serum total testosterone (due to low SHBG), normal serum free testosterone, and normal gonadotropins, reflecting a eugonadal state. In secondary hypogonadism due to structural or genetic hypothalamic-pituitary disorders, gonadotropins are often low or undetectable.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^112SLFvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label, such that women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification, or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus position statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This position statement was developed by consensus between the participating organizations to inform health care professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance as to which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

This guideline updates the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" published in 2010. The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

- **Evidence**: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and utilized the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

- **Consensus process**: One group meeting, several conference calls, and email communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members, along with the cosponsoring organization, were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. The diagnosis should be confirmed by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal, or who have a condition affecting sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it.

### Andropause or male menopause? Rationale for testosterone replacement therapy in older men with low testosterone levels [^112PNaFU]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

To provide a rationale for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in older men with low testosterone levels and symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency, relevant literature was reviewed using PubMed.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies indicate that total and free testosterone levels fall with aging, and they may be accompanied by symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency. Testosterone treatment of younger men with very low testosterone levels and hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular disease is associated with improvements in symptoms, body composition, bone density, and hematocrit/hemoglobin. Studies evaluating testosterone treatment of older men with low testosterone levels are limited, but they suggest some increase in fat-free mass, some decrease in fat mass, and some increase in bone density of the lumbar spine and femoral neck.

The Testosterone Trial should provide definitive information regarding the potential benefits of TRT in men aged 65 years and older. If efficacy is confirmed, we will still need more information regarding the risks of TRT in older men.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111zq8AY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, specifically related to testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend measuring total testosterone concentrations on two separate mornings in the fasting state. This is necessary as testosterone concentrations exhibit significant diurnal and day-to-day variations and may be suppressed by food intake or glucose.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). High credibility.

The objective of this guideline is to update the recommendations for evaluating and treating androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men, building on guidelines published in 2006.

- **Participants**: The Task Force consisted of a chair appointed by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend diagnosing androgen deficiency only in men who exhibit consistent symptoms, signs, and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. Initial diagnostic testing should involve the measurement of morning total testosterone levels using a reliable assay. Confirmation of the diagnosis should be achieved by repeating the morning testosterone measurement. In cases where total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or when a SHBG abnormality is suspected, free or bioavailable testosterone levels should be measured using validated assays. Testosterone therapy is recommended for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to develop and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. However, testosterone therapy is not recommended for patients with existing breast or prostate cancer, palpable prostate nodules or induration, prostate-specific antigen levels greater than 4 ng/ml, or above 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer, such as African-Americans or those with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer, without further urological examination.

### Practice patterns in the diagnosis and management of hypogonadism: A survey of Sexual Medicine Society of North America members [^116vyEgc]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe practice patterns in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism, as the optimal approaches are controversial. Multiple therapeutic options are currently available for hypogonadal men, leading to considerable variation in treatment patterns. Notably, the safety of testosterone therapy (TTh) remains understudied.

A 23-question survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism was sent to all members of the Sexual Medicine Society of North America. Subgroup analyses compared responses between sexual medicine fellows and non-fellows, as well as between academic and nonacademic physicians, using a chi-squared analysis.

A total of 101 responses were included for analysis. The most common cutoff value used to diagnose hypogonadism was 300 ng/dL (55%, range = 200–400 ng/dL), with 31% of respondents feeling comfortable prescribing TTh to a symptomatic patient with normal serum testosterone levels. No respondents felt that TTh increased the risk of cardiovascular events. Of those surveyed, 68% would prescribe TTh to a hypogonadal man with severe lower urinary tract symptoms, and 64% would offer TTh to a man with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. Fellowship-trained physicians were more likely to prescribe TTh to a man with hypogonadism but normal serum testosterone (P = 0.038). These physicians differed in the types of therapy they would use for men with hypogonadism who wish to preserve or regain fertility.

In conclusion, significant variety exists in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism. The majority of physicians will only prescribe TTh in the setting of subnormal serum testosterone.

Regarding the medical management of male hypogonadism, the EAA 2020 guidelines specifically address testosterone therapy indications and contraindications. They recommend not initiating testosterone replacement therapy for the following purposes:

- **Weight management**: Weight reduction in patients with obesity.

- **Metabolic health**: Improvement of glycometabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or metabolic syndrome.

- **Chronic disease outcomes**: Improvement of morbidity and/or mortality of several chronic diseases, including HIV infection/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, heart failure, obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, bowel inflammatory diseases, or prevention of long-term outcomes in patients chronically treated with corticosteroid or opioid therapy, in the absence of symptomatic hypogonadism.

- **Bone health**: Reduction of fracture risk in patients with high fracture risk.

- **Physical function**: Improvement of exercise capacity/physical function in frail patients.

- **Aging**: Anti-aging therapy in patients older than 65 years.

- **Mental health**: Improvement of depressive symptoms.

- **Cognitive function**: Improvement of cognitive function.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men aged 50 years or older:

1. Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia, and osteoporosis should be considered.

2. Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) measured without high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. Repeating the measurement is generally useful in this clinical setting.

3. Measure TT when the patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample, drawn between 7 and 10 AM.

4.

- **Serum free testosterone**: Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on a confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is between 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected. Some experts discourage measuring free testosterone due to limitations, focusing instead on interpreting SHBG with total testosterone.

5.

- **Investigation for hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder**: This includes a clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, a review of medications affecting the HPT axis, and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. The evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes a review of medications and measurement of TSH.

### Testosterone replacement therapy in naturally and surgically menopausal women [^1122Y454]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy in naturally and surgically menopausal women is a complex and currently highly debated topic. Opposing guidelines for the use of testosterone exist, creating a therapeutic dilemma for clinicians confronted by severely distressed women experiencing a decrease in sexual desire after surgical or natural menopause.

- **Aim**: In this review, we will address the knowledge on androgen physiology, conditions associated with a low androgen state, and the risks and benefits of androgen therapy.

- **Methods**: An English-language Medline review was performed.

- **Main outcome measure**: Review of available literature.

- **Results**: A review of normal androgen physiology in women is summarized, and a brief review of the prior use of androgens over the last six decades is included. The data on the use of androgen replacement in pre- and postmenopausal women is evaluated, especially regarding its relationship to sexual functioning. Special concerns about the effect of androgens on cardiovascular disease, breast, and endometrial tissue are discussed. The balance of evidence suggests that androgens have more of a positive effect than a negative effect in women if used properly.

- **Conclusions**: Testosterone replacement therapy for surgically and naturally menopausal women with low sexual desire can be accomplished physiologically and effectively after ruling out other medical conditions leading to low sexual desire. Proper information about the fact that testosterone therapy is not an FDA-approved medication in the United States is also necessary. The majority of the available data supports this therapy approach.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1176zTxe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In this article, we use a case-based approach to outline the assessment and management of men older than 50 years presenting with features of androgen deficiency and a low testosterone level, based on a review of the literature (PubMed), using the search terms "male hypogonadism", "testosterone deficiency", "androgen deficiency", "functional hypogonadism", "late onset hypogonadism", as well as the clinical experience of the authors. We focus on the diagnosis and management of possible androgen deficiency. Fertility will not be discussed.

Many of the principles and recommendations that we discuss are pertinent to men under age 50. However, we focus on men ≥ 50 years old in this manuscript because of the following:

- **Prevalence and studies**: The prevalence of low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology increases significantly in men starting at age 40–50. Most of the high-quality epidemiological and randomized controlled studies of men with low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology were performed in men ≥ 50 years old.

- **Diagnostic evaluation and management differences**: The diagnostic evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years old differ from younger men because:
	- Evaluation for hypothalamic and pituitary disease with sellar imaging and evaluation for iron overload syndromes is often unnecessary in older men.
	- Infertility due to HPT dysfunction is less commonly important for men ≥ 50 years old.
	- Long-term suppression of the HPT axis (iatrogenic androgen deficiency) is much more likely to occur with exogenous testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years old.

### Testosterone deficiency: A review and comparison of current guidelines [^112oQ6mF]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There is much controversy regarding the appropriate evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency (TD).

- **Aim**: To compare guidelines on the evaluation and management of TD to provide clarity for patients and clinicians, as well as to highlight areas of controversy.

- **Methods**: A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and various association websites was performed to identify guidelines for TD.

- **Outcomes**: Key aspects in the approach were compared, with a focus on the biochemical definition (cutoff) for low testosterone (T), principles of management, and recommendations for testosterone therapy (TTh) in special patient populations.

- **Results**: Guidelines from the Canadian Medical Association Journal, American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, Endocrine Society, International Society for Sexual Medicine, and British Society for Sexual Medicine were included for review. Recommendations were generally consistent across guidelines. Key differences include the biochemical cutoff for low T and recommendations for patients with low to normal T, prostate cancer, or cardiovascular disease. We highlight several case scenarios in which management differs depending on the guideline adopted.

- **Clinical implications**: Although general diagnostic and management principles are in agreement across the guidelines, notable differences may impact patient diagnosis and eligibility for TTh.

- **Strengths & limitations**: Only guidelines written in English were included. The quality of the included guidelines was not evaluated.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Ubn9i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations based on evidence of the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.

- **Recommendation 1a**: ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone who have sexual dysfunction and wish to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include the potential benefits, harms, costs, and the patient's preferences.

- **Recommendation 1b**: ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction if treatment goals are not met.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints.

However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113Vw3oH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

**Cardiovascular health**: Effects of testosterone treatment on cardiovascular outcomes remain unknown because there are no published long-term, placebo-controlled RCTs of testosterone therapy and cardiovascular outcomes as a primary outcome. The first such study, TRAVERSE (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03518034), has completed enrollment (n > 5200 men), and the findings of this study with ∼5-year follow-up are expected to be released in 2023; the study was fully recruited and was not ended early for prespecified cardiovascular outcomes. In some observational studies, higher endogenous serum testosterone concentrations have been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events, but higher endogenous serum testosterone might be a marker of better overall health and fewer major comorbidities. Retrospective studies of testosterone treatment have suggested either reduced risks of cardiovascular events, neutral effects, or increased risks; such retrospective studies have significant methodological shortcomings, including confounding by indication (i.e. preferential treatment of healthier men) and time-related biases. Clinical trials of testosterone treatment have been mixed, with one study in older men with mobility limitations reporting an increased risk of cardiovascular events, while there was no increase in a similar trial in frail older men. A total of 17 RCTs shared their individual patient data (n = 3431) to the Testosterone Efficacy and Safety Consortium (TestES) to report mortality and cardiovascular endpoints. Eighteen deaths (6 in testos…).

### British Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^116AjNSy]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD) is an increasingly common problem with significant health implications, but its diagnosis and management can be challenging.

- **Aim**: To review the available literature on TD and provide evidence-based statements for UK clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Evidence was derived from Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane searches on hypogonadism, testosterone (T) therapy, and cardiovascular safety from May 2005 to May 2015. Further searches continued until May 2017.

- **Outcomes**: To provide a guideline on diagnosing and managing TD, with levels of evidence and grades of recommendation, based on a critical review of the literature and consensus of the British Society of Sexual Medicine panel.

- **Results**: 25 statements are provided, relating to 5 key areas: screening, diagnosis, initiating T therapy, benefits and risks of T therapy, and follow-up. 7 statements are supported by level 1, 8 by level 2, 5 by level 3, and 5 by level 4 evidence.

- **Clinical implications**: To help guide UK practitioners on effectively diagnosing and managing primary and age-related TD.

- **Strengths and limitations**: A large amount of literature was carefully sourced and reviewed, presenting the best evidence available at the time. However, some statements provided are based on poor-quality evidence. This is a rapidly evolving area of research, and recommendations are subject to change. Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients but rather help to focus decisions and take personal values, preferences, and individual circumstances into account.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (i.e. 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above, and these experts recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. However, this approach is congruent with assessment of serum free testosterone with an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies to help establish more accurate and uniform methods of assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility for the diagnosis of hypogonadism are needed. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the setting of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol (even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases). Marked SHBG elevations leading to misleading results need careful consideration in diagnosis and treatment.

### Low free testosterone and prostate cancer risk: A collaborative analysis of 20 prospective studies [^112La594]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical evidence implicates testosterone in the etiology of prostate cancer. Variation across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations may not lead to changes in prostate biology unless circulating concentrations are low. This may also apply to prostate cancer risk, but this has not been investigated in an epidemiological setting.

- **Objective**: To examine whether men with low concentrations of circulating free testosterone have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Analysis of individual participant data from 20 prospective studies, including 6933 prostate cancer cases diagnosed on average 6.8 years after blood collection, and 12,088 controls in the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers, and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Odds ratios (ORs) of incident overall prostate cancer and subtypes by stage and grade, using conditional logistic regression, based on study-specific tenths of calculated free testosterone concentration.

- **Results and limitations**: Men in the lowest tenth of free testosterone concentration had a lower risk of overall prostate cancer (OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.86; p < 0.001) compared with men with higher concentrations (2nd-10th tenths of the distribution). Heterogeneity was present by tumor grade (p het = 0.01), with a lower risk of low-grade disease (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.88) and a nonsignificantly higher risk of high-grade disease (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.95–2.57). There was no evidence of heterogeneity.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BAEvt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In addition to providing general health benefits, there is evidence that lifestyle changes might increase mean serum testosterone by 10% to 30%, which could normalize testosterone concentrations in patients and improve many symptoms overlapping with hypogonadism. However, the data primarily come from cohort studies of supervised lifestyle interventions, involving small numbers of participants who were typically younger (30–50 years of age), with relatively short follow-up periods (< 1–2 years) and variable methodologies in the assessment of serum testosterone concentrations. Some evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions might be less successful in normalizing serum testosterone concentrations and improving function in older, frailer men. The extent to which the increase in serum testosterone is responsible for improvements in androgen deficiency-like features (e.g. erectile function, physical performance) remains uncertain. Whether concomitant testosterone treatment enhances the efficacy of lifestyle interventions requires further study, though preliminary evidence suggests that testosterone therapy preserves lean mass compared to placebo during caloric restriction.

In summary, the single most important intervention for patients and many older men with high BMI and low serum testosterone concentration might be lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise, caloric restriction, and improved diet, to reduce weight.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^114e6NH5]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Are there normal values and treatment targets? As testosterone is measured by a variety of methods with different reference standards, it is not possible to establish a universal reference range for premenopausal women. Historically, the adequacy of serum testosterone therapy targeting premenopausal values was estimated using the free androgen index (FAI) with assessment of morning total testosterone (T) and SHBG. These values were used in the equation to calculate the FAI as follows: FAI = 100 × [Total T (ng/dL)]/SHBG (nmol/l). The concentration of free or bioavailable testosterone was approximated, but this approach has limitations as it assumes predictable binding of testosterone to SHBG at all concentrations.

An attempt to extend this method for determination of a discriminatory level correlated to sexual function and dysfunction was published by Guay et al. in 2004. They studied 60 healthy, menstruating women not on hormonal contraception, ages 20–49 years, without sexual dysfunction as assessed by a validated questionnaire and detailed interview. RIA measurements of morning testosterone, SHBG, and multiple other androgens were assayed; the FAI was calculated. Based on this small cohort, these investigators proposed a clinically useful range of the normal androgen profile in women without sexual dysfunction.

The applicability of this method in clinical practice is limited given today's alternatives for several reasons: (1) the small sample sizes of the original publications, (2) insufficient accuracy and precision of RIA testosterone measurements, (3) the availability of more accurate methods now.

### Society for endocrinology guideline for understanding, diagnosing and treating female hypogonadism [^115wHh7i]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Female hypogonadism (FH) is a relatively common endocrine disorder in women of premenopausal age, but there are significant uncertainties and wide variation in its management. Most guidelines are monospecialty and only address premature ovarian insufficiency (POI); some allude to management in very brief and general terms. Most rely upon the extrapolation of evidence from studies relating to physiological estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned new guidance to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary perspective on managing patients with all forms of FH. It has been compiled using expertise from endocrinology, primary care, gynecology, and reproductive health practices. Contributions from expert patients and a patient support group are also included to help clinicians best manage FH resulting from both POI and hypothalamo-pituitary disorders, whether organic or functional.

### Controversies and advances with testosterone therapy: A 40-year perspective [^111bfNdh]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone therapy (TTh) has become highly controversial. There are important health consequences of testosterone deficiency and meaningful benefits with treatment. There is level 1 evidence that TTh improves sexual function and desire, body composition, and bone density. Concerns regarding cardiovascular risk were based on two deeply flawed retrospective studies and are contradicted by dozens of studies showing cardiovascular benefits of TTh or higher endogenous testosterone, including placebo-controlled studies in men with known heart disease (angina, heart failure). Prostate cancer should no longer be considered a risk of TTh. Testosterone is neither scourge nor panacea — it is just good medicine.

Regarding medical management for male hypogonadism, specifically concerning testosterone therapy, the EAA 2020 guidelines advise against initiating testosterone replacement therapy for the following purposes:

- **Prevention of bone fracture**: Do not use as monotherapy in patients with high fracture risk.

- **Improvement of muscle strength**: Do not use with a clinically meaningful aim in frail patients.

- **Improvement of major depressive symptoms**: Avoid use as monotherapy.

- **Improvement of cognitive function**: Avoid use.

### Clinical practice patterns in the assessment and management of low testosterone in men: An international survey of endocrinologists [^113J5ADX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to document practices in the approach to low testosterone in older men. Given that recommendations are based on low-level evidence, it was hypothesized that there would be wide variability in clinical practice patterns.

- **Design**: Members of all major endocrine as well as andrological societies were invited to participate in a web-based survey. This survey focused on the diagnostic work-up and management of a hypothetical index case of a 61-year-old overweight man presenting with symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, but without evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPT) axis disease.

- **Results**: Nine hundred and forty-three respondents (91.2% adult endocrinologists) from North America (63.7%), Europe (12.7%), Oceania (8.2%), Latin America and the Caribbean (7.6%), and the Middle East, Asia, or Africa (7.8%) completed the survey. Response rates among participating societies ranged from 4.1–20.0%. There was a wide variability in clinical practice patterns, especially regarding the biochemical diagnosis of androgen deficiency, exclusion of HPT axis pathology, and monitoring for prostate cancer. In a man with suggestive symptoms, 42.4% of participants would offer testosterone treatment for serum total testosterone levels below 10.4 nmol/l (300 ng/dl). A total of 46.0% of participants were, over the last five years, 'less inclined' to prescribe testosterone to men with nonspecific symptoms and borderline testosterone levels compared to 'no change' (29.3%) or 'more inclined' (24.7%), P < 0.001.

- **Conclusions**: This large-scale international survey shows a wide variability in the management of low testosterone in men.

### Testosterone replacement in men with sexual dysfunction [^111cn3Tq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for men with sexual dysfunction and testosterone deficiency. However, TRT is commonly promoted in men without testosterone deficiency, and existing trials often do not clearly report participants' testosterone levels or testosterone-related symptoms. This review assesses the potential benefits and harms of TRT in men presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of testosterone replacement therapy compared to placebo or other medical treatments in men with sexual dysfunction.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status, up to 29 August 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in men (40 years or over) with sexual dysfunction. We excluded men with primary or secondary hypogonadism. We compared testosterone or testosterone with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5I) to placebo or PDE5I alone.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened the literature, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADE using a minimally contextualized approach. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to standard Cochrane methodology.

### British society for sexual medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^113QiZ12]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The 2017 guidelines from the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM) recommend initiating testosterone therapy in symptomatic patients with testosterone deficiency syndrome. This includes patients with treated localized low-risk prostate cancer characterized by a Gleason score of less than 8, stages 1–2, a preoperative PSA level of less than 10 ng/mL, and the treatment should not start before 1 year of follow-up. Importantly, there must be no evidence of active disease as determined by measurable PSA levels, digital rectal exam (DRE) results, and the absence of metastatic disease.

### Performance of total testosterone measurement to predict free testosterone for the biochemical evaluation of male hypogonadism [^116p18DP]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend serum total testosterone measurement as the initial test to evaluate male hypogonadism, reserving free testosterone assessment for men with suspected sex hormone-binding globulin abnormalities or total testosterone near the lower limit of normal. We determined the performance of total testosterone measurement as a test to identify men with normal versus low free testosterone.

- **Materials and methods**: We examined the electronic medical records of all 3,672 men evaluated for hypogonadism by a serum testosterone panel, including total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin, and calculated free testosterone, from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2007, in a network that serves veterans in Washington.

- **Results**: The sensitivity and specificity of low total testosterone (less than 280 ng/dl) to rule out and predict low calculated free testosterone were 91.0% and 73.7%, respectively. At thresholds of less than 350 and less than 400 ng/dl, the sensitivity of total testosterone for low calculated free testosterone increased to 96.8% and 98.2%, and at thresholds of less than 150 and less than 200 ng/dl specificity increased to 98.9% and 92.6%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Total testosterone between 280 and 350 ng/dl is not sensitive enough to reliably exclude hypogonadism. Total testosterone must exceed 350 to 400 ng/dl to reliably predict normal free testosterone. Except when levels are less than 150 ng/dl, total testosterone measurement has low specificity for the biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism), and can be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and cause considerable general health concerns.

Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests, and evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids in the determination of primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency. Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months; long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance. Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by evidence; therefore, monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^117KbkG9]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome defined by persistently low serum testosterone levels accompanied by symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. However, evidence is conflicting regarding its effects on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk.

After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. The treatment method should consider patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

### The effects of testosterone on bone health in males with testosterone deficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117EFQqv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD) may induce a series of clinical symptoms. Studies have shown that testosterone supplementation may prevent these unfavorable symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. Given the conflicting findings across studies, this systematic review aims to evaluate the effects and risks associated with testosterone supplementation in middle-aged or aging males with TD.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library) were searched up to December 2019. The risk of bias of individual included studies and the quality of the aggregate evidence were assessed using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcome was bone mineral density (BMD). Meta-analyses were performed, and this systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA statement.

- **Results**: A total of 52 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. When compared with placebo, testosterone supplementation did not increase total BMD (short-term: 1081 participants, MD -0.01g/cm², 95% CI -0.02g/cm² to 0.01g/cm²; long-term: 156 participants, MD 0.04g/cm², 95% CI -0.07g/cm² to 0.14g/cm²), lumbar spine, hip, or femur neck BMD. Furthermore, testosterone supplementation did not decrease the risk of falling or fracture. It was found that testosterone supplementation did not increase the risk of cardiovascular events (1374 participants, RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.64), all-cause mortality (729 participants, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.04), or prostatic events. However, testosterone supplementation may improve sexual function and quality of life.
