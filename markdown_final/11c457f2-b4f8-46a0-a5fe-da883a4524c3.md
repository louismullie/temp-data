## Question

Give me a treatment plan for venous stasis dermatitis with concomitant cellulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a treatment plan for venous stasis dermatitis with concomitant cellulitis, including when to start compression, how to choose antibiotics, how to treat the dermatitis, and how to prevent recurrence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing cellulitis from stasis dermatitis and other mimics. Then, I should assess severity and decide on outpatient versus inpatient care. Next, I'll outline acute antimicrobial and supportive measures. After that, I need to determine the safe timing and method for compression. Then I will address underlying venous disease and optimize topical therapy. Finally, I should set a prevention and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because misclassification is common; approximately one-third of ED admissions for suspected lower-limb cellulitis are ultimately alternative diagnoses, frequently venous stasis dermatitis, so I should anchor on laterality, tempo, tenderness, warmth, and systemic signs to separate acute unilateral tender cellulitis from chronic often bilateral pruritic, hyperpigmented, eczematous stasis dermatitis, and I should remember that routine labs and cultures are typically nonspecific while a careful skin exam, including interdigital toe spaces, and duplex ultrasound for venous insufficiency mapping materially improve accuracy and guide management [^116qPMsz] [^1118duHJ] [^113EYPpq] [^111Mrdn1] [^116ezjgs].

> Hold on, I should verify the need for hospitalization versus outpatient care by applying IDSA criteria: admit if there is concern for necrotizing infection, severe immunocompromise, failure of outpatient therapy, poor adherence, or systemic inflammatory response with hemodynamic instability, whereas stable patients without SIRS can be treated as outpatients; in immunocompromised hosts, I need to consider early biopsy or aspiration with broad diagnostic testing if the presentation is atypical [^112iZpuV] [^111ek3cL] [^115UecZb] [^1133ckZb].

> Next, I will initiate acute antimicrobial therapy targeted to the cellulitis phenotype; for typical nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic signs, I should cover streptococci with an oral beta-lactam such as cephalexin or dicloxacillin, whereas purulent disease or MRSA risk warrants empiric MRSA-active agents like doxycycline or TMP-SMX in combination if streptococcal coverage is needed, and for severe infection I need IV therapy with agents such as cefazolin or nafcillin, adding vancomycin when MRSA is suspected, with broad-spectrum regimens reserved for severe nonpurulent SSTI in severely compromised patients; I should treat for about 5–10 days and avoid routine blood or skin cultures in uncomplicated cases to minimize low-yield testing [^116aZEV3] [^1125vnm1] [^114zdKRg] [^113PjKu3] [^112Y49h4].

> While antibiotics work, I need to support the limb: elevation above heart level to reduce edema, analgesia as needed, gentle cleansing with non-soap cleansers, and liberal bland emollients on intact skin to protect the barrier; wait, let me verify steroid timing — if the skin is eroded or the infection is severe, I should hold topical corticosteroids initially and resume them only after the cellulitis starts improving, and I must examine and treat interdigital tinea pedis or maceration to reduce pathogen colonization and recurrence risk [^117WMmEy] [^115CSBhR] [^111Mrdn1].

> Now, about compression — the cornerstone for stasis dermatitis — I almost started it on day 1, but wait, I should verify tolerance and timing; to avoid worsening pain and to ensure safety, I will begin compression once cellulitis shows clear clinical improvement, often at 48–72 hours, using properly fitted stockings around 30–40 mmHg or professionally applied bandaging, understanding adherence challenges and potential contact dermatitis, and I must first screen for significant arterial disease and ensure ABI is adequate before higher-pressure compression, with an Unna boot as an option in exudative dermatitis or ulcers [^114CrC9N] [^114CrC9N] [^113xpYFu] [^115CSBhR].

> I will now examine the underlying venous disease because treating the cause reduces recurrence; duplex ultrasound should map reflux or obstruction, and where significant superficial venous reflux exists, I should consider endovenous thermal ablation or foam sclerotherapy, recognizing that evidence for ulcer healing and recurrence reduction varies and patient selection matters, while adjunctive medical options like pentoxifylline can be considered to support ulcer healing and symptoms when present [^116ezjgs] [^116XdS4d] [^1168pUb9] [^116XCVA9].

> Let me optimize topical therapy for the stasis dermatitis once infection is improving; liberal emollients twice daily address xerosis and barrier dysfunction, and short courses of mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroids can calm inflamed eczematous plaques with careful taper to avoid atrophy, whereas calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus can be considered off label when steroid-sparing is needed after counseling about application-site burning and boxed warnings; if dermatitis is refractory or there is suspicion for allergen exposure from dressings or stockings, I should consider patch testing for contact allergens [^115CSBhR] [^114zPvJ9] [^113xpYFu].

> For secondary prevention, I should ensure daily compression during waking hours, meticulous skin care to prevent barrier breakdown, calf-muscle activation through walking or exercises, and weight management when obesity contributes to edema; but wait, what if recurrences continue despite optimal edema control — then IDSA supports prophylactic antibiotics such as oral penicillin or erythromycin twice daily for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, and I should continue prophylaxis as long as predisposing factors persist, noting that compression itself markedly reduces recurrence risk [^115ssoEa] [^116NB7ww] [^117MYykE] [^112bYhNj].

> I should double-check follow-up logistics: reassess within 48–72 hours to confirm defervescence of tenderness, warmth, and erythema and to pivot therapy if there is inadequate response, consider dermatology input for diagnostic uncertainty or difficult dermatitis and vascular surgery consultation for venous interventions, document baseline photos to track change, and monitor for compression-related contact dermatitis while ensuring ABI is acceptable and adherence remains strong over time [^115ofQds] [^113xpYFu] [^114CrC9N] [^115CSBhR].

For venous stasis dermatitis with concomitant cellulitis, **management** should **treat both conditions concurrently** [^115fTU2J] and **address predisposing factors** [^117MYykE] to prevent recurrence. This integrated approach targets infection, inflammation, and venous hypertension [^113efoYR] to **promote healing and reduce recurrence**.

- **Antibiotics**: Start empiric oral cephalexin or dicloxacillin [^113EYPpq] for 5–7 days; add MRSA coverage (clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX) if risk factors are present [^114zdKRg]. Use IV cefazolin or vancomycin for severe cases [^115UecZb] or if oral therapy fails [^112iZpuV].

- **Compression therapy**: Apply graduated compression stockings (20–30 mmHg) [^112bYhNj] after acute infection improves to reduce edema and prevent recurrence [^112bYhNj].

- **Topical care**: Use mid-potency corticosteroids [^114zPvJ9] for dermatitis flares and emollients for barrier repair [^115CSBhR]; avoid irritants.

- **Supportive measures**: Elevate the limb [^117WMmEy], control pain, and monitor for complications.

- **Prevention**: Treat chronic edema, venous insufficiency, and skin barrier defects [^115ofQds]; consider prophylactic penicillin [^115ssoEa] for recurrent cellulitis [^116NB7ww].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess in 48–72 hours; escalate care if no improvement or if systemic signs develop [^112iZpuV].

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after local skin trauma. It is commonly diagnosed in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in primary care settings. Classically, cellulitis presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. Given the resemblance to other dermatologic diseases, a broad differential diagnosis should be considered. Common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis.

History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can help confirm the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Compression therapy to prevent recurrent cellulitis of the leg [^112bYhNj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chronic edema of the leg is a risk factor for cellulitis. Daily use of compression garments on the leg has been recommended to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis, but there is limited evidence from trials regarding its effectiveness.

- **Methods**: In this single-center, randomized, nonblinded trial, we assigned participants with chronic edema of the leg and recurrent cellulitis, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive leg compression therapy plus education on cellulitis prevention (compression group) or education alone (control group). Follow-up occurred every 6 months for up to 3 years or until 45 episodes of cellulitis had occurred in the trial. The primary outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis. Participants in the control group who had an episode of cellulitis crossed over to the compression group. Secondary outcomes included cellulitis-related hospital admission and quality-of-life assessments.

- **Results**: A total of 183 patients were screened, and 84 were enrolled; 41 participants were assigned to the compression group, and 43 to the control group. At the time of a planned interim analysis, when 23 episodes of cellulitis had occurred, 6 participants (15%) in the compression group and 17 (40%) in the control group had had an episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.59; P = 0.002; relative risk [post hoc analysis], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.84; P = 0.02), and the trial was stopped for efficacy. A total of 3 participants (7%) in the compression group and 6 (14%) in the control group were hospitalized for cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14 to 1.00; P-value not reported).

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^115TZvuz]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

**Conclusion**: Stasis dermatitis (SD) represents the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux and most commonly occurs in the lower extremities of elderly individuals. Cutaneous changes associated with SD are driven by inflammation. The typical clinical presentation involves erythematous and eczematous patches and plaques. Itch is one of the most troublesome symptoms and often leads to scratching, which can aggravate wounds and increase the risk of skin infection. SD may also progress to chronic venous ulcerations with oozing and erythema. Accordingly, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to preventing serious complications. However, diagnosis is challenging due to the resemblance of SD to other skin conditions. The cornerstone of treatment includes compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, together with topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes and associated signs and symptoms. No treatments are currently approved for alleviating the symptoms associated with SD; new therapeutic approaches that target inflammation in SD are thereby needed.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^114CrC9N]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

The goals of treatment options for patients with stasis dermatitis (SD) include addressing the clinical impact of the underlying venous insufficiency, edema, and inflammation (itch and pain), improving skin lesions, and healing ulcers. Initial treatment options for SD include exercise, walking, and leg elevation, although such approaches are generally effective only for mild cases of SD. The cornerstone of treatment for SD remains compression therapy, using bandages or stockings with a high pressure of about 60 mmHg or a median pressure of about 30 mmHg, respectively, to reduce ambulatory venous pressure and resultant hypertension.

Although compression has been demonstrated to alleviate swelling, pain, and stasis skin changes in patients with SD, this approach often fails due to nonadherence or loss of stocking elasticity after repeated use. Indeed, only about 50–60% of patients comply with compression therapy, with bandages being more challenging to apply correctly (versus stockings) without professional guidance. Additionally, the synthetic rubber in compression stockings can result in allergic contact dermatitis of the lower extremities, further impacting treatment adherence.

Topical dressings, such as the Unna boot — a bandage containing moist zinc oxide — can also be utilized. These dressings serve as non-elastic compressions that contain a topical treatment for SD. The Unna boot can be combined with other treatments, including topical corticosteroids, to alleviate various SD symptoms, including cutaneous inflammation.

With regard to diagnostic investigations for cellulitis, and specifically concerning clinical assessment, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend examining the interdigital toe spaces in patients with lower extremity cellulitis. By treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration, it may be possible to eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of reinfection.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^1118duHJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Several cutaneous disorders can present similarly to stasis dermatitis (SD), leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis, subsequently resulting in disease mismanagement and increased patient anxiety and healthcare costs. Over 10% of cellulitis diagnoses are incorrect, with SD being the most commonly misdiagnosed condition.

Cellulitis is associated with previous trauma or a disrupted epithelial barrier in the affected region. It is marked by unilateral erythematous plaque along with tenderness, swelling, and warmth. Cellulitis is often accompanied by systemic symptoms, including mild leukocytosis, fever, and, less commonly, regional lymphadenopathy and/or ascending lymphangitis. Indicators of cellulitis include a history of acute progression and improvement with antibiotics.

Conversely, SD is often bilateral, not associated with significant tenderness, and is chronic, frequently occurring with pitting edema. Unilateral presentations of SD may be observed when venous insufficiency is limited to one extremity. Due to the many similarities between cellulitis and SD, patients with SD are often mistakenly treated for cellulitis. Given that cellulitis is potentially a medical emergency, misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary hospitalization and exposure to antibiotics. Not surprisingly, early consultation with a dermatologist has been shown to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of inflammatory skin diseases in hospitalized patients.

Allergic contact dermatitis is also a risk factor in patients with a longer history of SD and ulcerations, and it is often mistaken for SD.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^113im5Mo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, with additional reference to the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (record CRD42017080466, November 2017).

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of this review was to identify and describe diagnostic criteria and tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis. The secondary objective was to assess the quality of the studies where such diagnostic criteria or tools were developed.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies were included if they involved patients with lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas in primary and secondary care and utilized diagnostic criteria or tools for diagnosis.

- **Inclusion criteria**: The following inclusion criteria were applied: studies of any type that used diagnostic criteria or tools, regardless of language, involving patients of any age, sex, or ethnicity, with lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The excluded articles were: animal studies, laboratory in vitro studies, literature and systematic review articles, expert opinions, conference abstracts, articles including only patients with nonlower-limb cellulitis, articles where the site of cellulitis or erysipelas was not clear, articles where data from lower-limb cellulitis or erysipelas could not be separated, articles using tools to determine etiology, and case series with fewer than 20 patients.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^1127pEwQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

In terms of both the pathogenesis of stasis dermatitis (SD) and the development of effective therapies, it is important to understand that inflammation causes the skin changes characteristic of SD. The accumulation of leukocytes in the microcirculation of extremities with venous hypertension was reported in the 1980s, and such leukocyte trapping is now considered typical of the early stages of chronic venous insufficiency, particularly in SD.

Studies demonstrated that the passively dependent blood in the feet of individuals with chronic venous diseases has low levels of leukocytes, suggesting leukocyte accumulation in regions of high venous pressure, which leads to the observed inflammatory response. Here, leukocytes attach to the endothelium of vein walls and valve leaflets, causing the necrosis and/or apoptosis of the endothelium, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and parenchymal cells of the venous wall. This results in the weakening and destruction of the venous walls and valve leaflets, leading to the observed venous changes in SD.

Increased numbers of T lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells were also observed in skin biopsies of the lower legs of individuals with chronic venous insufficiency, further supporting the association of inflammatory mediators with cutaneous damage. In SD, venous hypertension promotes the cellular accumulation of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, as well as the extravasation of erythrocytes at the affected areas. Erythrocyte extravasation is followed by hemoglobin decomposition, which results in the excessive buildup of iron that is stored at the affected tissues as hemosiderin.

### A systematic review of the efficacy and limitations of venous intervention in stasis ulceration [^116XdS4d]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical techniques to address various components of chronic venous disease are rapidly evolving. Their efficacy and generally good results in treating superficial venous reflux (SVR) have been documented and compared in patients presenting with pain and swelling. A growing amount of literature is now available suggesting their efficacy in patients with venous leg ulcer (VLU). This review attempts to summarize the efficacy and limitations of commonly used venous interventions in the treatment of SVR and incompetent perforator veins (IPVs) in patients with VLU.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the published literature was performed. Two different searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and EBSCOhost to identify studies that examined the efficacy of SVR ablation and IPV ablation on healing rate and recurrence rate of VLU.

- **Results**: In the whole review, 1,940 articles were screened. Of those, 45 were included in the SVR ablation review and 4 in the IPV ablation review. Data were too heterogeneous to perform an adequate meta-analysis. The quality of evidence, assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation for the two outcomes, varied from very low to moderate. Ulcer healing rate and recurrence rate were between 70% and 100% and 0% and 49% in the SVR ablation review, and between 59% and 93% and 4% and 33% in the IPV ablation review, respectively. To explain those variable results, limitations such as inadequate diagnostic techniques, saphenous size, concomitant calf pump dysfunction, and associated deep venous reflux are discussed.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^116qPMsz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

- **Objectives**: We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review using Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis. We assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We included all types of studies that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

- **Results**: Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging, and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data were low, and results could not be pooled due to the heterogeneity of the findings.

- **Conclusions**: There is a lack of high-quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

What's already known about this topic? Diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging. Approximately one in three patients admit.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112cLfcS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs, ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis. Additionally, given the increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema [^11516tJg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis (also known as erysipelas) is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and therefore falls within the domain of dermatologists. Cellulitis, which can often be recurrent, is among the top 10 reasons for admission to the hospital, with patients receiving treatment from many specialties including emergency care, general practitioners, general medicine, surgery, tissue viability, and dermatology.

In this issue of the BJD, Burian et al. examine the prevalence of cellulitis in patients with chronic oedema. Chronic oedema is an easily identified clinical sign and leads to the same pathophysiological effects and appearances as lymphoedema, which is not so easily distinguished. Tissue fluid is predominantly drained by the lymphatic system and not by venous reabsorption as was previously thought. This means that all chronic oedema, i.e. subcutaneous oedema persisting for at least 3 months, is caused either by an absolute reduction in lymph transport, as in lymphoedema, or by lymph drainage being overwhelmed by a fluid (lymph) load, such as that which occurs with higher venous pressures from heart failure or venous disease. Therefore, chronic oedema always represents lymph drainage failure, and as it is easy to identify and has the same physiological effects, it can be considered a surrogate for lymphoedema. As lymph carries antigen related to infection as well as lymphocytes for an appropriate immune response, disturbed lymph drainage, whether owing to fluid load or lymph vessel dysfunction, results in immunodeficiency as a consequence of the disturbed immune cell.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^117SphFE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs) and exercise-induced vasculitis may resemble stasis dermatitis (SD) due to their main clinical feature of punctate petechiae, secondary to the extravasated erythrocytes. Like SD, PPDs are limited to the lower limbs bilaterally and are often chronic with re-exacerbations. Hemosiderin deposition is found in the superficial dermis in PPDs, with the deposition being deeper in SD. Other SD mimickers include atopic dermatitis (AD), diabetic dermopathy, and xerotic eczema. Familiarity with the appearance of such conditions and pursuing the correct diagnostic workup, including both the history and the clinical presentation, is important to correctly diagnose cutaneous disorders associated with inflammation of the lower extremities. Moreover, general physicians may not recognize venous disorders or appreciate their seriousness and, consequently, may not refer the patient to a specialist.

### Diagnosis and treatment of venous ulcers [^116XCVA9]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Venous ulcer, also known as stasis ulcer, is the most common etiology of lower extremity ulceration, affecting approximately 1 percent of the U.S. population. Possible causes of venous ulcers include inflammatory processes resulting in leukocyte activation, endothelial damage, platelet aggregation, and intracellular edema. The primary risk factors for venous ulcer development are older age, obesity, previous leg injuries, deep venous thrombosis, and phlebitis. On physical examination, venous ulcers are generally irregular, shallow, and located over bony prominences. Granulation tissue and fibrin are typically present in the ulcer base. Associated findings include lower extremity varicosities, edema, venous dermatitis, and lipodermatosclerosis. Venous ulcers are usually recurrent, and an open ulcer can persist for weeks to many years. Severe complications include cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and malignant change. Poor prognostic factors include large ulcer size and prolonged duration. Evidence-based treatment options for venous ulcers include leg elevation, compression therapy, dressings, pentoxifylline, and aspirin therapy. Surgical management may be considered for ulcers that are large in size, of prolonged duration, or refractory to conservative measures.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AUZTk]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methodological quality**: The risk of bias for patient selection was high for all eight studies. Six studies used a case–control method, and the exclusion criteria were not deemed appropriate in two studies as they excluded patients who were more difficult to diagnose. The study by Shin et al. had a low risk of bias for the index test since it included a prespecified threshold, whereas the other seven studies did not. The reference standard used in the study by Rabuka et al. was considered high risk as some patients received the reference test after the index test, thereby increasing the risk of observer bias. The risk was unclear in the remaining seven studies as it was not possible to determine whether the diagnosis of cellulitis was accurate. The flow of timing was unclear in seven studies, as it was not stated whether all the patients received the same reference standard test. The flow of timing described in the study by Fleischer et al. was considered high risk as not all the patients were analyzed.

- **Concerns regarding applicability**: With regard to patient selection and reference standard a…

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^112UBeah]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Stasis dermatitis (SD), as a cutaneous manifestation of chronic venous insufficiency caused by retrograde venous blood flow, is classified as C4, which signifies changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue secondary to chronic venous disease, according to the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification of venous disorders. This system is an internationally accepted standard for describing patients with chronic venous disorders based on clinical manifestations, the understanding of disease etiology, the involved anatomy, and the underlying venous pathology.

The typical clinical presentation involves poorly demarcated erythematous and eczematous patches and plaques of the lower extremities, with the medial malleolus region being the most frequently and severely affected. The eczematous nature of SD is characterized by scaling, erythema, and xerosis of the skin. These skin changes may extend from the foot up to the knee.

Characteristic symptoms include pruritus (itch) on the medial ankle, which can extend to the shin, pain, lesional inflammation, scaling, and changes in skin color and thickening. Itch is the most troublesome symptom, impacting patient quality of life (QOL), and it leads to scratching that can aggravate wounds and increase the risk of skin infection. Chronic scratching due to itching can also result in skin thickening and lichenification. Brown speckles (hyperpigmentation), resulting from hemosiderin deposition — a byproduct of hemoglobin from extravasated erythrocytes — also represent a classic chronic sign of SD.

### Predictors for readmission due to cellulitis among Japanese patients [^115STLyQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissues of the skin. Some patients experience multiple hospitalizations; lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral circulatory disturbance, and deep vein thrombosis are cited as risk factors for repeated admissions. In Japan, however, elderly women and undernourished elderly have been identified as being at risk for multiple hospitalizations, indicating a different patient demographic compared to those reported overseas. This study investigates the characteristics of readmission cases for patients hospitalized for cellulitis in Japan.

Cases of cellulitis and erysipelas admitted between April 1, 2005, and March 31, 2018, were examined retrospectively. Patients with cellulitis or erysipelas at multiple sites, as well as those with osteomyelitis, pressure ulcer infection, and necrotizing fasciitis, were excluded. In terms of recurrence, only hospitalizations for recurrence at the same site were considered. Patients with multiple hospitalizations showed significantly lower blood albumin levels compared to those hospitalized only once. Additionally, rates of lymphedema, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were significantly higher in patients with multiple hospitalizations. Other laboratory and clinical factors did not show statistical significance.

- **Risk factors**: Hypoalbuminemia, with or without liver dysfunction, lymphedema, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were suggested as risk factors for cellulitis recurrence. Conversely, chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral circulatory disturbance, and deep vein thrombosis did not appear to be risk factors in the Japanese cases. Japanese cases had a different profile from those found internationally.

### Microbiological and clinical features of patients with cellulitis in tropical Australia: Disease severity assessment and implications for clinical management [^114GHBWg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Australian guidelines for the treatment of cellulitis are informed by data from temperate, metropolitan centers. It is uncertain if these guidelines are equally applicable in tropical Australia, where the population, access to healthcare, and array of potential pathogens are quite different. This retrospective study examined adults admitted to Cairns Hospital in tropical Queensland, Australia, who were treated with intravenous antibiotics for a principal diagnosis of cellulitis in 2019.

The study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings in these cases and the resulting implications for patient management. There were 305 episodes of cellulitis; a potential pathogen was identified in 93 out of 305 cases (30%), most commonly Staphylococcus aureus (45 out of 93, 48%) or Group A Streptococcus (16 out of 93, 17%). There was one case of Burkholderia pseudomallei.

Initial treatment was most commonly with narrow spectrum β-lactam antibiotics: flucloxacillin was prescribed in 170 out of 305 cases (56%) and cefazolin in 74 out of 305 cases (26%). Overall, 4 out of 305 patients (1%) died or were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 30 days, 123 out of 305 (40%) had an inpatient stay longer than 48 hours, and 63 out of 305 (21%) were readmitted to hospital within 30 days. Every patient who subsequently died or required ICU admission had an elevated early warning score (EWS ≥ 3) on admission.

An EWS ≥ 3 on admission also predicted an inpatient stay of longer than 48 hours (odds ratio [OR]: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.7–6.0; P < 0.001) and 30-day readmission (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2–4.6; P = 0.01). The etiology of cellulitis in tropical Queensland, Australia is thus influenced by distinct regional factors.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116BbNeu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. Additionally, due to an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Initial presentation of stasis dermatitis mimicking solitary lesions: a previously unrecognized clinical scenario [^114qFJMU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Stasis dermatitis is a common skin condition secondary to chronic venous insufficiency. Characteristic dermatologic changes in well-developed disease include bilateral erythematous, scaly, and slightly discolored papules and plaques on the lower legs. Earlier signs, such as prominent superficial veins and pitting ankle edema, are well known. Early recognition of signs and appropriate diagnosis can lead to timely treatment that can prevent painful complications, such as leg ulcers, which are at risk for the development of squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Objective**: Herein we describe a yet unrecognized early sign of venous dermatitis — a solitary lesion, some mimicking neoplastic processes.

- **Methods**: Thirty-seven cases of stasis dermatitis submitted with the clinical diagnosis of a solitary lesion were identified. Thirty-three had no clinical history of venous insufficiency. All cases of stasis dermatitis presenting for the first time as a solitary lesion were reviewed retrospectively, both clinically and pathologically.

- **Results**: Squamous cell carcinoma was most commonly suspected (33%), followed by basal cell carcinoma (24%), and a variety of other solitary lesions. The histopathology was characteristic of stasis dermatitis in all cases, with absent or mild spongiosis (82%); variable acanthosis and dermal fibrosis; and proliferation of papillary dermal thick-walled vessels, which were prominent (2–3+) in nearly all cases (≥ 90%) along with hemosiderin-laden macrophages and extravasated red blood cells (≥ 95%).

- **Limitations**: The study is limited by its retrospective nature.

### Distinguishing cellulitis from its noninfectious mimics: Approach to the red leg [^116pcKEq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical diagnosis in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Studies have demonstrated a surprisingly high misdiagnosis rate, with nearly one-third of cases being other conditions such as pseudocellulitis. This high rate of misdiagnosis is thought to contribute to nearly $515 million in avoidable health care spending in the United States each year, leading to delayed or missed diagnoses of pseudocellulitis and delays in appropriate treatment. There is a broad differential diagnosis for pseudocellulitis, which includes inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions of the skin. Accurate diagnosis of the specific condition causing pseudocellulitis is crucial, as management varies greatly.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^117QzhPn]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

- **Article highlights**:

- **Type of research**: Retrospective review of large claims database.
- **Key findings**: The incidence of cellulitis in patients with phlebolymphedema (PLED) is significantly higher than the incidence of cellulitis in other etiologies of lymphedema (LED). Additionally, patients with PLED have significantly higher treatment costs per year for cellulitis compared with other etiologies of LED, such as breast cancer-related LED and gynecologic cancer-related LED.
- **Take home message**: Clinicians should be aware of the significantly higher incidence of cellulitis in patients with LED, specifically PLED. These episodes of cellulitis come at a significant economic cost.

Lymphedema (LED), an under-recognized and incurable disease, is defined as an excess of fluid in the interstitial space that accumulates due to a mismatch between the rate of fluid deposition via capillary filtration and the rate of fluid drainage via the lymphatic system. Secondary LED, the most common form of LED, is frequently associated with oncologic treatment and damage to the lymphatic system, by either surgery, radiation, or a combination of both. LED associated with chronic venous insufficiency, however, is increasingly recognized as an important cause of secondary LED. Recently, the term phlebolymphedema (PLED) has been applied to describe LED from chronic venous insufficiency. Elevated venous pressure due to valvular reflux, outflow obstruction, or a combination of both increases intracapillary pressure with further efflux of ultrafiltrate into the interstitial space.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and hematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring an appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis. We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only. Lower-limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically relevant.

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema [^1128Axfm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The novel findings from this publication indicate that one-third of patients with chronic oedema are likely to develop cellulitis at some point. The severity of oedema is positively correlated with the likelihood of developing cellulitis; conversely, better management of oedema reduces this likelihood. The study's strengths include a large patient cohort and an international collaboration involving nine countries, highlighting that chronic oedema predisposing to cellulitis is a global healthcare burden in these areas.

- **Study limitations**: By targeting healthcare professionals with an interest in lymphoedema to identify patients, the numbers may have been falsely elevated, potentially including more severe cases compared to the general population. Despite this, it does not undermine the value of the results.

- **Lack of data on recurrent cellulitis**: Unfortunately, data on recurrent cellulitis were not included, which is likely a common occurrence. As previously shown, cellulitis can be self-perpetuating, with past episodes increasing the likelihood of future episodes.

- **Preventive measures**: While prophylactic penicillin has shown value in preventing cellulitis, this study underscores the importance of controlling chronic oedema in its prevention. This conclusion has been recently supported by findings on the use of compression garments to prevent cellulitis. Often in healthcare, patients are treated for acute episodes of cellulitis and discharged without sufficient consideration for the treatment of underlying risk factors, such as chronic oedema, skin disease, and wounds.

Dermatologists are well-positioned to manage these conditions and should be more involved in comprehensive care to prevent cellulitis.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^113v9wam]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

When patients with a history of prior cellulitis by LED etiology were compared, patients with PLED ($5691; 95% CI, $4564-$7131) have a higher cost of cellulitis-related health care expenditure per patient per year than those with BCRL ($1958; 95% CI, $1102-$3489) or GCRL ($3055; 95% CI, $1196-$6192).

- **Influence of venous ulcers**: To determine the influence of VLUs on the incidence of cellulitis and the costs of treating cellulitis in patients with and without VLUs, we divided the PLED group into those with lymphedema and VLUs [VLU+] 4855 (58%) versus those with lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency and no VLUs [VLU−] 3551 (42%). The overall rate of cellulitis per 100 PYs among the VLU+ patients was higher than those without VLUs at 48.0/100 PYs (95% CI, 46.7–49.3) versus 43.5/100 PYs (95% CI, 41.8–45.2). No difference in the rate of cellulitis was observed between the two groups for the patients with a prior history of cellulitis or for those without a history of prior cellulitis. When the cellulitis-related health care expenditures between the two groups were examined, there was no significant difference in the cost of cellulitis per patient per year between the two groups.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^1173956v]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Study characteristics**: The characteristics of all eight included studies are summarized. Raff et al. explored lower-limb cellulitis as the main pathology. Seven studies included patients with lower-limb cellulitis as a comparison group, where cellulitis and other diagnoses were compared.

- **Study types and settings**: Six studies were case–control studies, one study was a cohort study, and there was one cross-sectional study. The most common setting was the emergency department (ED) in three studies. The studies were conducted in six different countries. Kato et al. did not include exclusion criteria.

- **Reference tests**: The reference test for cellulitis was a clinical diagnosis in seven studies, with a bone scan used by Fleischer et al. However, only Rabuka et al. clearly stated the specialty of the physician who made the cellulitis diagnosis. Two studies followed up patients for up to 30 days to determine the final diagnosis.

- **Predictive score**: In a study to compare cellulitis with pseudocellulitis, Raff et al. developed an ALT-70 score (7 points) that assessed the following: asymmetry (unilateral involvement, 3 points); leucocytosis (white blood cell count ≥ 10,000 μL⁻¹, 1 point); tachycardia (heart rate ≥ 90 beats per minute, 1 point); and age.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^114zPvJ9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Although no drugs are currently approved for the treatment of stasis dermatitis (SD) symptoms, several topical options are used to relieve the associated symptoms. Skin care treatments for SD include non-soap cleansers, barrier preparations, and bland emollients. Moisturization through the liberal application of emollients is recommended to address the skin dryness associated with concomitant xerosis.

High- or mid-potency topical corticosteroids can also be used intermittently to relieve pruritus; however, prolonged use may lead to cutaneous atrophy and systemic side effects. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are another option due to their effectiveness in other steroid-responsive dermatoses. Although topical tacrolimus (used off-label) has proven effective for the treatment of SD, topical calcineurin inhibitors are associated with a burning sensation upon application and require patient education due to a boxed warning for an increased risk of lymphoma.

Cutaneous hyperpigmentation often persists even if chronic venous insufficiency is treated. Although responses are often poor, non-coherent intense pulsed light or laser treatments do represent an approach to removing hyperpigmentation.

Multiple oral treatments have shown promise in improving some of the symptoms experienced by patients with SD. Oral pentoxifylline is often used, with or without compression therapy, to reduce leg pain and to increase the healing rate of venous ulcers. Pentoxifylline is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation.

### Venous leg ulcers: A review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^1168pUb9]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Low credibility.

Conservative treatment primarily consists of compression therapy and supportive measures, including physical therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, and the use of phlebotonics for symptom relief. Other approaches include sclerotherapy, surgical procedures, and endovenous thermal and chemical procedures. These more invasive approaches are often reserved for patients who do not respond satisfactorily to conservative measures, although it has been suggested that earlier use of venous ablation should be considered in symptomatic patients. Early treatment aimed at preventing venous hypertension, reflux, and inflammation could attenuate symptoms and reduce the risk of ulceration if performed early in the course of chronic venous disease (CVD). The concept of surgical intervention remains valid once an ulcer is present: it is not sufficient to treat the ulcer alone because the cause of the problem also needs to be addressed. Supporting this idea, a randomized controlled trial, including 500 patients, demonstrated that surgery to correct superficial venous reflux combined with compression reduces ulcer recurrence compared with compression alone.

Once a venous leg ulcer (VLU) is present, multiple assessment and treatment algorithms have been proposed to optimally manage the condition. An important factor to consider when managing these wounds is the possibility of concomitant arterial disease, as a mixed etiology is estimated to affect up to 26% of patients with lower extremity ulcerations. This article reviews the literature on VLUs, specifically treatment algorithms, guidelines, and guidance documents, and provides an updated perspective on managing these complex conditions.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^115MjoAB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

It is clinically important to differentiate between acute and chronic stasis dermatitis (SD). Acute SD is often observed with acute or worsening edema and is characterized by substantial erythema, bullae, weeping, and vesicles, referred to as a flare. Both chronic and acute SD are often misdiagnosed as bilateral cellulitis. Chronic SD often presents with poorly demarcated hyperpigmentation and erythema that is linked with chronic edema and underlying inflammation of the lower extremities. Patients with chronic SD can develop acute flares that are clinically shown as worsening of the eczema, with signs of inflammation such as pain and swelling.

The lipodermatosclerosis observed in chronic SD is a severe fibrosing panniculitis of the subcutaneous tissue and may lead to an "inverted champagne bottle" appearance of the leg. In acute SD settings, lipodermatosclerosis may present with painful subcutaneous plaques or nodules.

### A case of progressive lower leg edema [^116x7tw2]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Based on the clinical presentation and histology, what is the most likely diagnosis?

- **A. Lipodermatosclerosis**: Incorrect. Although lipodermatosclerosis is a diagnostic consideration in our patient's clinical presentation, CD31 and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) positivity indicate KS (Kaposi sarcoma). Interestingly, there are increasing reports of KS mimicking other clinical and histologic entities, including lymphangioma-like KS, pyogenic granuloma–like KS, lipodermatosclerosis-like KS, and ecchymotic KS.

- **B. Lymphedema**: Incorrect. Our patient has woody, nonpitting edema, which is characteristic of lymphedema, but the findings of CD31 and HHV-8 positivity in the neoplastic capillaries are diagnostic of KS. Therefore, our patient's lymphedema is a complication of his KS.

- **C. Stasis dermatitis**: Incorrect. Stasis dermatitis is an intensely pruritic, eczematous disorder related to chronic venous insufficiency. Our patient does not complain of significant pruritus, and CD31 and HHV-8 should not be positive in stasis dermatitis. Interestingly, there are several reports of KS arising in the setting of arterial, venous, or lymphatic insufficiency with associated stasis dermatitis–like changes.

- **D. Kaposi sarcoma**: Correct. The development of a new patch on the thigh at 6-month follow-up and the histologic findings of a patchy capillary proliferation in a tiered distribution are suggestive of KS. CD31 and HHV-8 immunohistochemical stains are positive in the neoplastic capillaries.

- **E. Bilateral lower leg cellulitis**: This option is not discussed or mentioned in the provided context.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^113efoYR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the lower extremities. It typically occurs in older individuals and is the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux. Such retrograde venous blood flow results from incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or venous obstruction. Stasis dermatitis is eczematous. The associated impairment of venous valves may cause swelling of the legs, leading to serious conditions, including venous ulcerations. Diagnosis can be challenging because of its clinical resemblance to other skin conditions and poor clinical recognition by physicians.

The cornerstones of stasis dermatitis treatment are compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes, and interventional treatment options to correct the underlying causes of venous reflux. Given the central role of inflammation of the lower extremities in driving the cutaneous changes characteristic of stasis dermatitis, new therapeutic approaches that target the inflammation are under clinical evaluation in patients.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^116ezjgs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Several risk factors have been established with the development of venous insufficiency leading to stasis dermatitis (SD), including older age, female sex, pregnancy, obesity, prolonged sitting or standing, heart failure, and family history of venous disease. The association with pregnancy and obesity is due to the extra stress placed on the patient's lower extremities. Patients unable to move may experience leg edema caused by venous stasis due to immobility itself, rather than anatomical venous complications. Addressing risk factors such as a sedentary lifestyle and obesity can potentially result in disease improvement.

Stasis dermatitis is typically diagnosed by clinical evaluation of the affected skin and medical history. If the initial diagnosis is inconclusive, duplex ultrasounds can be utilized to detect the direction of blood flow, assess venous reflux, and identify potential venous obstructions. The widespread use of duplex ultrasound is supported by its accuracy, non-invasiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can be employed to detect obstructions in proximal veins and surrounding structures. A diagnosis of stasis dermatitis can be confirmed through biopsy and demonstration of classic histological features, including hemosiderin-laden macrophages, dermal fibrosis, extravasated erythrocytes, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, and the proliferation of dilated blood vessels in the papillary dermis. Biopsies are generally avoided because the impaired…

### Vancomycin infiltrate-induced dermatitis mimicking bullous cellulitis [^113MUS9b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Extravasation of medications can manifest as tenderness, pain, tissue necrosis, and thrombophlebitis, leading to infection and severe long-term complications. Risk factors for leakage of medications include mechanical and pharmacologic mechanisms such as cannulation technique, vasoconstriction, and cytotoxicity. Well-known vesicants like anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, and vasopressors are usually administered with proper caution. Often overlooked are many antimicrobial agents, which typically act via differences in osmolality and pH. Vancomycin harms the vascular wall by the latter influence (pH 2.5–4.5).

Although similar in appearance to vancomycin hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis), we present a patient whose dermatitis and subsequent cellulitis likely originated due to extravasation of the drug from the peripheral intravenous catheter. The visible dermatitis mimicked bullous cellulitis from toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Group A Streptococcus, and gram-negative rods or anaerobes in the setting of neutropenia. Our case illustrates the importance of obtaining an appropriate history and recognizing non-infectious causes of rashes that mimic chronic infections.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Cellulitis and abscesses are common reasons for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatients.

- **Conclusions**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: Part II. Conditions that simulate lower limb cellulitis [^111ZKv3w]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Several common conditions can mimic cellulitis, creating potential for misdiagnosis and incorrect management. The most common disorders mistaken for lower limb cellulitis include venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, irritant dermatitis, and lymphedema. Dermatologists are often consulted when a patient has failed to respond to therapy, and a thorough knowledge of the differential diagnosis is essential. This article focuses on entities that can mimic cellulitis, with an emphasis on elements of the history and physical examination that can help to distinguish between lower limb cellulitis and its simulators.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^112sXPJs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Venous ulcerations of the lower extremities are a significant complication in patients with advanced venous insufficiency. Although compression therapy remains the most frequently used treatment for venous ulcerations, with the healing of ulcers reported in approximately 70% of treatment-adherent patients, a significant portion of patients do not fully respond to this treatment. Compression stockings may be too painful for patients with stasis ulcers to don, so surgical treatments may be necessary (see Sect. 7 on treatments). After healing, the 5-year frequency for the recurrence of venous ulcerations ranges between 26 and 51%, with the exact value depending on the initial degree of ulceration. Moreover, healing does not guarantee the full restoration of proper function in patients nor the resolution of discomfort or pain.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^1175fVvn]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema is significant due to its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population. Recent research has highlighted the prevalence of phlebolymphedema in individuals suffering from cellulitis, which often accompanies lymphedema. This condition contributes substantially to healthcare costs and impacts patient quality of life.

- **Objective**: The study aimed to evaluate the incidence of phlebolymphedema and analyze its economic burden on patients with lymphedema-associated cellulitis.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive analysis was conducted on patient data to estimate the frequency of phlebolymphedema occurrences and associated costs in a large population. Real-world data was utilized to ensure the findings reflect practical implications.

- **Results**: Findings indicate a high incidence of phlebolymphedema among patients, with significant economic implications due to increased healthcare requirements and potential complications in treatment protocols.

- **Conclusion**: The high prevalence and economic impact of phlebolymphedema in lymphedema-associated cellulitis cases necessitate focused healthcare strategies to manage and mitigate these effects, underscoring the need for continued research in this area.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^117NuaGa]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Stasis dermatitis (SD), also known as venous eczema, stasis eczema, venous SD, or gravitational dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven by underlying chronic venous insufficiency that typically affects the lower extremities of older individuals. In SD, alterations in the function of the deep venous plexus at the lower extremities cause blood to backflow to the superficial venous system, leading to venous hypertension, cutaneous inflammation, and a range of potential complications, including venous ulcers. This review describes the incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of SD. Literature was selected via a high-level PubMed search using keywords related to SD, such as "stasis dermatitis", "stasis ulcers", "venous ulcers", "venous hypertension", "venous stasis dermatitis", "venous eczema", "chronic venous insufficiency", "chronic venous disease", and "chronic venous insufficiency".

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^111g3jp5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The relationship between the cause of secondary lymphedema (LED) and the incidence of cellulitis underscores edema as a major risk factor for developing this condition. In a study conducted at seven centers in France during 1995/1996, Dupuy and colleagues identified several independent risk factors for cellulitis, with LED having the highest odds ratio (71.2), followed by disruption of the cutaneous barrier (23.8), venous insufficiency (2.9), and obesity (2.0).

Vignes and colleagues performed a retrospective study involving nearly 2,000 patients with LED referred to a specialized lymphedema clinic. They found that breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), the most common cause of LED (58%), was associated with a nearly 40% occurrence of cellulitis. Primary lower limb LED had a comparable rate of cellulitis, while secondary lower limb LED showed a lower 31% occurrence (P < 0.02). It is important to note that Vignes excluded patients with venous disease, which significantly differentiates their findings from our patient population.

Despite LED being a defined risk factor for cellulitis, few studies demonstrate how the etiology of secondary LED may influence cellulitis incidence. A large healthcare claims database, with 86,000 patients with LED, provides valuable insights due to its size and diverse patient spectrum. Our study clearly indicates that patients with phlebolymphedema (PLED) face a higher risk for cellulitis compared to those with BCRL or genital cancer-related lymphedema (GCRL). Further comparisons of morbid risk factors suggest that PLED involves a greater proportion of two important factors that can exacerbate edema.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111kKWVP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis. We conducted a systematic review using the Ovid and Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging, and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low, and results could not be pooled due to the heterogeneity of the findings.

There is a lack of high-quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

- **What is already known about this topic**: Diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^114xiUbZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the lower extremities. It typically occurs in older individuals and is the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux. Such retrograde venous blood flow is the result of incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or venous obstruction. Stasis dermatitis is eczematous. The associated impairment of venous valves may cause swelling of the legs, leading to serious conditions including venous ulcerations. Diagnosis can be challenging because of its clinical resemblance to other skin conditions and poor clinical recognition by physicians.

The cornerstones of stasis dermatitis treatment are compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes, and interventional treatment options to correct the underlying causes of venous reflux. Given the central role of inflammation of the lower extremities in driving the cutaneous changes characteristic of stasis dermatitis, new therapeutic approaches that target the inflammation are under clinical evaluation in patients with stasis dermatitis.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^115eYSAo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The limitations of this paper are largely related to the source of the data. This study is based on health care claims data, which relies on clinicians and coders to accurately input diagnosis and treatment codes. Additionally, the clinical severity of these disease states cannot be determined. Since the demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and other comorbidities, were not propensity-matched, this may influence the results.

Additionally, when calculating the cost of hospitalized episodes, this cost was derived from hospitalizations during which the principal discharge diagnosis was coded to be cellulitis. As this is the primary discharge diagnosis, the majority of the cost of the hospitalization is likely the result of the cost of the cellulitis; however, it is not possible to determine if all reimbursed amounts were for cellulitis-related services. As such, some of this cost may reflect the cost for other conditions.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^1115h7Km]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The following databases were searched on 25 October 2017: Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to present), Ovid Embase (1980–2017), the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science Core Collection. An updated search on 22 May 2018 was also undertaken in all the databases to ensure the results were up to date.

Search strategies for these databases were developed with an information specialist (D.G.) and in consultation with a cellulitis expert (N.J.L.). Concepts were developed: 'cellulitis', 'diagnosis', and 'criteria', with controlled vocabulary (Medical Subject Headings terms and Emtree subject headings) and free-text headings. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Evidence was also searched using the term 'cellulitis'.
For grey literature, the first 100 articles (sorted by relevance) on Google Scholar retrieved using the search term 'diagnostic criteria for cellulitis' were included.

The reference lists of all articles selected for critical appraisal were screened for additional studies.

Following the searches, all citations were uploaded to Covidence (2018) online systematic review management software, with duplicates removed by one reviewer (M.P.). Title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction were conducted by independent reviewers (M.P. and S.L./R.K. A.) using predefined templates. Any disagreements between reviewers that arose were resolved through discussion or with another reviewer.

### An up-to-date approach to the management of dissecting cellulitis [^114qEd4X]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS), also known as perifolliculitis capitis abscedens et suffodiens (PCAS), is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory dermatosis. It consists of edematous sterile pustules and nodules, resulting in sinus tracts and scarring alopecia. Although first described as infectious in 1903, DCS is primarily an inflammatory process that can precede a secondary infection. This is similarly true of the other conditions within the follicular occlusion tetrad: hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), acne conglobata, and pilonidal sinus.

### Stasis dermatitis: Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^112UEuAH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Stasis dermatitis commonly occurs in older age and is caused by venous hypertension resulting from retrograde flow due to incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or obstruction of the venous system. Further tissue changes arise from an inflammatory process mediated by metalloproteinases, which are up-regulated by ferric ion from extravasated red blood cells. Stasis dermatitis presents initially as poorly demarcated erythematous plaques of the lower legs bilaterally, classically involving the medial malleolus. It is one of the spectrum of cutaneous findings that may result from chronic venous insufficiency. Its mimics include cellulitis, contact dermatitis, and pigmented purpuric dermatoses.

Duplex ultrasound is useful in demonstrating venous reflux when the clinical diagnosis of stasis dermatitis is inadequate. Conservative treatment involves the use of compression therapy directed at improving ambulatory venous pressure. Interventional therapy currently includes minimally invasive techniques such as endovenous thermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, which have supplanted the use of open surgical techniques.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^114g9p11]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Venous reflux that drives venous hypertension can result from incompetent venous valves, obstruction to venous flow, or failure of the lower extremity muscle pump, and may occur in the superficial or deep venous systems. In a study of patients with chronic venous disease, primary valvular incompetence was present in 70–80% of cases; valvular incompetence was due to trauma or deep vein thrombosis in 18–25% of cases.

In chronic venous insufficiency, increased venous hypertension initiates changes in the local subcutaneous tissue and skin. This includes activation of the endothelial cells, extravasation of red blood cells and macromolecules, diapedesis of leukocytes, and inflammatory changes that are often noted at and above the ankles. There is an accumulation of clinical evidence to support the concept that venous hypertension causes stasis dermatitis (SD).

One study that examined 360 lower limbs indicated a positive correlation between increased ambulatory venous pressure and severe skin damage. In another study, venous hypertension was found to be the only plausible cause of SD in patients with superficial venous insufficiency, with negative patch testing and without insufficiency of the deep veins. Interestingly, in this second study, surgical intervention targeting the venous pressure resulted in the complete and rapid resolution of SD for all patients who underwent surgery.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, specifically in the context of care settings, the 2015 AAFP guidelines recommend hospitalization for patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Uncontrolled SSTI**: Despite adequate oral antibiotic therapy.

- **Inability to tolerate oral antibiotics**: When a patient cannot continue with oral treatment.

- **Indications for surgery**: Where surgical intervention is necessary.

- **Initial severe or complicated SSTI**: Cases that present with severe or complex skin and soft tissue infections.

- **Underlying unstable comorbidity or signs of sepsis**: Presence of other health complications or symptoms suggestive of sepsis.

### Localized aseptic neutrophilic dermatoses of the extremities triggered by stasis and tissue damage: Two case reports of an unrecognized condition misdiagnosed as bacterial cellulitis [^111Ka3Vg]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Neutrophilic dermatoses (NDs) are a group of autoinflammatory dermatoses characterized by an aberrant accumulation of neutrophil granulocytes in the skin with potential extracutaneous involvement and systemic inflammatory response. NDs often present with overlapping clinical and histopathological features, which led to the proposal of a simplified classification of NDs, encompassing superficial NDs, NDs en plaques, and deep NDs. NDs are typically associated with hematological disorders, chronic inflammatory, rheumatological, and gastrointestinal diseases. In addition to a variety of drugs, NDs may also be triggered or aggravated by traumas, including surgery.

Here, we describe two unusual cases of localized NDs affecting the extremities, in which either acute or chronic peripheral edema resulted in a misleading inflammatory reaction that was invariably mistaken as cutaneous infection.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: Mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^11622wHx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The quantitative survey questionnaire was developed by the research team based on existing research evidence and input from dermatology research experts, patient collaborators, clinicians, and research psychologists. Eligible participants were provided with a paper version of the survey or a URL (included in the study information sheet) to an identical online survey on iSurvey, a survey generation and research tool provided by the University of Southampton. The vast majority of participants (94.6%, n = 227) chose to complete the paper survey rather than the online version and returned it in the freepost envelope provided. Questionnaire data were entered into an Access database.

- **Analysis**: Qualitative and quantitative data were initially analyzed separately. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted to explore the qualitative interview data. One author read the transcripts several times to achieve familiarization with the data, and codes were applied line by line. Main codes were described and termed according to the language present within the data. Multiple codes were applied to comments that expressed multiple meanings. Codes were derived inductively from the data and grouped together to produce an initial coding frame. Codes were reviewed and compared to identify similarities and differences. A detailed coding manual was created to ensure transparent and systematic coding of the data. Codes and theme/subtheme definitions were discussed with, and iteratively developed by, members of the research team.

### Stasis dermatitis: An overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^114rgYcg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic venous disease, which includes chronic venous insufficiency, is a prevalent condition that increases with age and is more common in women. Estimates of the prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency vary considerably, underscoring a knowledge gap in existing epidemiological data. These numbers often depend on the clinical characteristics and lifestyles of examined populations. Geographically, the highest reported prevalence is across Western countries, ranging from less than 1% to 40% in women and from less than 1% to 17% in men.

A study from Saudi Arabia estimated the overall prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency at about 45.6%. Similarly, a study in Scotland found the age-adjusted prevalence to be 9% in men and 7% in women, with prevalence increasing with age. In a cross-sectional study of patients in 24 cities in Italy, only 22.7% of approximately 5,200 adult participants showed no visible signs of the disease. It is estimated that between 2 and 6 million individuals in the United States have advanced forms of chronic venous insufficiency, including swelling and skin changes, with about 500,000 individuals suffering from painful venous ulcers. Approximately 37–44% of individuals with leg ulcers have been diagnosed with stasis dermatitis (SD). SD is an advanced cutaneous presentation of chronic venous insufficiency, more common in older patients; there is a positive correlation between age and the number of insufficient venous segments. In one study, SD was identified in 1.4% of 773 individuals aged…
