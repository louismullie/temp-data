## Question

TSH .38

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a TSH of 0.38 mIU/L and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the laboratory reference range and whether 0.38 mIU/L is below the lower limit of normal. Then, I should verify whether free T4 and free T3 are normal to classify this as subclinical versus overt hyperthyroidism. Next, I will consider pretest probability, symptoms, and risk factors that would change management. After that, I need to check for transient or non-thyroidal causes of a low TSH and confirm persistence on repeat testing. Finally, I will outline when to treat, when to observe, and what additional workup is warranted if the abnormality persists, aligning with guideline thresholds and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the reference interval. Most laboratories define the normal TSH range as roughly 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L, so a value of 0.38 mIU/L is just below the typical lower limit of normal, which places it in the "low but detectable" category rather than fully suppressed, and I should explicitly note that assay-specific reference ranges can vary and should be used for interpretation [^8cdd9023] [^bb03addf].

> Wait, let me verify the classification before labeling this as disease. If free T4 and free T3 are normal, this pattern fits subclinical hyperthyroidism; if either free T4 or free T3 is elevated, that would indicate overt hyperthyroidism, so I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions based on TSH alone without checking thyroid hormone levels [^bb03addf] [^8f7b1e36].

> I should confirm persistence because a single low TSH has limited diagnostic value. TSH exhibits substantial biological and analytical variability, with day-to-day changes up to about 50% and frequent reversion to normal, so repeating TSH in 3 to 6 months is essential to establish persistence before making management decisions, especially when the value is only modestly low like 0.38 mIU/L [^8cdd9023] [^d80df50d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology yet. I need to check for transient or non-thyroidal causes of a low TSH, including recent illness, glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, acute stress, and assay interference, and I should also remember that in early pregnancy TSH is physiologically suppressed by hCG, so I should ask about symptoms, medications, and pregnancy status before attributing this to endogenous thyroid disease [^e6e8c8db] [^81e4d454].

> Next, I should review risk stratification because it guides treatment thresholds. In patients under 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, observation is reasonable for TSH 0.1–0.4 mIU/L, whereas treatment is generally recommended when TSH is persistently less than 0.1 mIU/L, and in patients 65 or older or those with cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis, treatment should be considered even when TSH is 0.1–0.4 mIU/L due to risks of atrial fibrillation and bone loss [^8b75398b] [^450abe1e] [^f8a3436f].

> Let me consider the natural history to set expectations. Progression from subclinical to overt hyperthyroidism is uncommon in the 0.1–0.4 mIU/L range, with higher progression when TSH is fully suppressed, and spontaneous reversion to normal is not rare, which reinforces the need to confirm persistence before intervening [^bf690847] [^1d2a5271].

> I should double-check what additional testing is warranted if the low TSH persists. If subclinical hyperthyroidism is confirmed, evaluating etiology with free T4, total T3, and thyroid uptake scan or thyroid scintigraphy helps distinguish Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease, or autonomous nodules, and measuring TSH receptor antibodies can support a Graves' diagnosis when the etiology is uncertain, particularly in pregnancy or when planning therapy [^8f7b1e36] [^15c651bf].

> But wait, what if the patient is on thyroid hormone already. In treated patients, a low TSH may reflect over-replacement or intentional suppression for cancer, so I need to ask about medication, adherence, and the clinical indication for therapy before changing the dose, and I should remember that in central hypothyroidism TSH is unreliable for dosing, so free T4 should guide adjustments in that scenario [^a6804cf3] [^d45b9b90].

> Putting this together, my plan is as follows: repeat TSH in 3 to 6 months to confirm persistence, obtain free T4 and consider total T3 now to classify the biochemical pattern, assess for symptoms, cardiac risk, osteoporosis, and pregnancy, and if TSH remains low with normal free hormones and the patient is under 65 without high-risk features, observe with periodic reassessment; if TSH is persistently less than 0.1 mIU/L or the patient is 65 or older or has cardiac disease or osteoporosis, discuss treatment options including antithyroid therapy, radioactive iodine, or surgery depending on etiology, and consider a beta-blocker trial for symptomatic palpitations or anxiety while monitoring [^8b75398b] [^450abe1e] [^f8a3436f].

---

A TSH of 0.38 mIU/L is **borderline low** (just below the typical 0.4–4.0 mIU/L reference range) and most often reflects **subclinical hyperthyroidism** if free T4 and T3 are normal. Confirm with **repeat TSH** in 3–6 months [^d80df50d] and check free T4 and total T3 to exclude overt hyperthyroidism [^8f7b1e36]. In asymptomatic patients under 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, observation is reasonable [^8b75398b]; treat if TSH is persistently < 0.1 mIU/L or if symptoms, atrial fibrillation, or osteoporosis are present [^450abe1e]. Evaluate for causes such as Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease, or medications if suppression persists [^a5dd77cd].

---

## Clinical significance of TSH 0.38 mIU/L

A TSH of 0.38 mIU/L is **just below the lower limit of normal** (typically 0.4–4.0 mIU/L) and is best interpreted as **subclinical hyperthyroidism** when free T4 and T3 are normal. This pattern reflects early or mild thyroid overactivity without overt hormone excess [^bb03addf].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation

### Confirmatory testing

Repeat TSH in **3–6 months** to confirm persistence, as TSH fluctuates and many mild abnormalities normalize on retesting [^8cdd9023] [^d80df50d]. Concurrently measure **free T4 and total T3** to exclude overt hyperthyroidism (elevated free T4/T3 with suppressed TSH) [^8f7b1e36].

---

### Clinical assessment

Assess for **symptoms** of hyperthyroidism (anxiety, palpitations, weight loss, insomnia, tremor) and screen for **risk factors** — age ≥ 65, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or arrhythmias — that increase the risk of adverse effects from subclinical hyperthyroidism [^450abe1e].

---

## Potential causes of mildly suppressed TSH

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Endogenous thyroid disease | - Graves' disease <br/> - Toxic nodular disease (multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma) <br/> - Thyroiditis (silent, postpartum) [^a5dd77cd] |
| Medications | - Excess levothyroxine <br/> - Amiodarone <br/> - Glucocorticoids <br/> - Dopamine agonists [^e6e8c8db] |
| Non-thyroidal illness | - Acute illness <br/> - Stress <br/> - Malnutrition [^e6e8c8db] |
| Assay interference | - Heterophile antibodies <br/> - Biotin supplementation [^53aca48d] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

### Observation

Observation is appropriate for **asymptomatic patients < 65 years without cardiac disease or osteoporosis**; monitor TSH every 6–12 months [^8b75398b].

---

### Treatment considerations

Treatment is indicated for **persistent TSH < 0.1 mIU/L** or when symptoms, atrial fibrillation, or osteoporosis are present [^450abe1e]. Options include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery, tailored to etiology and patient factors [^a16d21a8].

---

### Special populations

In **pregnancy**, interpret TSH cautiously; first-trimester suppression is common due to hCG, and trimester-specific ranges should guide decisions [^81e4d454]. In **older adults**, the upper TSH reference limit rises with age, so mild TSH elevations may be physiologic; conversely, even mild suppression carries higher risks and may warrant treatment [^37bd7e8b].

---

## Risks and benefits of intervention

### Risks of untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Increased risk, especially in older adults [^ea0f81d6].
- **Bone loss**: Higher fracture risk, particularly in postmenopausal women [^ea0f81d6].
- **Progression**: Small risk of evolving to overt hyperthyroidism [^bf690847].

---

### Benefits and risks of treatment

Treatment normalizes TSH and may reduce atrial fibrillation and bone loss, but **overtreatment can cause hypothyroidism** and adverse effects; individualize decisions using shared decision-making [^4b5003c6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm**: Repeat TSH in 3–6 months and check free T4 and total T3 [^d80df50d] [^8f7b1e36].
- **Assess**: Evaluate symptoms and risk factors (age, cardiac disease, osteoporosis) [^450abe1e].
- **Observe**: For asymptomatic patients < 65 without risk factors, monitor periodically [^8b75398b].
- **Treat**: If TSH is persistently < 0.1 mIU/L or symptoms/complications are present, initiate therapy based on etiology [^450abe1e].
- **Evaluate**: If suppression persists, identify the cause (Graves', nodular disease, medications) [^a5dd77cd].

---

A TSH of 0.38 mIU/L is **borderline low** and most consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism when free T4 and T3 are normal. Confirm with repeat testing, assess symptoms and risk, and manage with observation or treatment based on persistence and clinical context.

### Optimal thyrotropin level: normal ranges and reference intervals are not equivalent [^1a28f4f5]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

This paper marshals arguments in support of a narrower, optimal or true normal range for thyrotropin (TSH) of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L, based on clinical results and recent information on the relatively stable and narrow range of values in patients without thyroid disease. The terminology used for TSH results is clarified in an attempt to help physicians interpret, explain, and respond to TSH test results for their patients.

Thyroid dysfunction screening — test interpretation and confirmation in asymptomatic adults indicates that accurate interpretation of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is further complicated by measurement variability and conditions other than thyroid disease, and many professional groups recommend repeating thyroid function tests for confirmation of persistent dysfunction over 3- to 6-month intervals in asymptomatic persons before diagnosis or treatment unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^05ae4a8f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1dff0889]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Detection of thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic adults — early detection and treatment of asymptomatic persons with abnormal serum TSH levels with or without abnormal T4 levels may be beneficial, but widespread screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction can also result in harms due to labeling, false-positive results, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening can detect "abnormal" serum TSH levels in asymptomatic persons; however, what constitutes an abnormal TSH level is uncertain, laboratory reference intervals are based on statistical distribution (for example, using the 97.5th percentile as an upper boundary for normal), and there is professional disagreement about appropriate cut points, including in subgroups such as older adults.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de885b19]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence); persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.4 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3- to 6-month period.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^8cdd9023]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### Accurate interpretation of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy: should we continue to use published guidelines instead of population-based gestation-specific reference intervals for the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)? [^b14f5be3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding ATA 2017 based comparison in the T1a subgroup, a minimal level of agreement (κ = 0.34) was also observed for diagnosing hypothyroidism, similar to the level of agreement found with the previous ATA threshold (κ = 0.40). The discordance between the established and fixed cut-off values in the early first trimester indicates that implementing ATA 2017 criteria may increase the risk of undetected hypothyroid pregnant women while using ATA 2011 recommendation may lead to the misdiagnosis of healthy women as having hypothyroidism. However, high agreement found between ATA 2011 criteria and our estimated RI in the T1b subgroup suggests that previous recommended RIs may be more appropriate for the late first trimester. Gao et al. also reported that adopting ATA 2017 threshold in the first trimester might be a sub-optimal practice for pregnant Chinese women.

To guide all patients and clinicians, the 2017 ATA guideline updated the recommendation by reducing the LRL and the URL of TSH by approximately 0.4 mIU/L and 0.5 mIU/L, respectively, in the first trimester when local assessments are not available. Since the URL for TSH has approached 4.0–4.5 mIU/L concentrations from ~ 10 mIU/L over the past years, it was widely reduced by 0.5 mIU/L in the first trimester, corresponding to an URL of 4.0 mIU/L. This cut-off should be primarily implemented beginning from the second half of the first trimester, with a progressive increase in the succeeding trimesters. Therefore, we have used an URL of 5.1 mIU/L (URL of non-pregnant level reduced by 0.5 mIU/L) for the T1 a subgroup, corresponding to the early first trimester and 4.0 mIU/L for the T1 b subgroup, which represents the late first trimester, considering 2017 ATA criteria. However, when analyzing the 19 studies cited in the 2017 ATA guidelines, only five articles reported an URL of normal ≥ 4.0 mIU/L. The only one paper reported an upper limit of normal exceeding 3.5 mIU/L, out of the five most extensive reference studies, each comprising more than 5000 pregnant women.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^4995b152]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^b7cab04a]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Clinical thyrotropin (TSH) measurement — Serum TSH measurement is the best test to screen for primary hypothyroidism in all age groups, but TSH measurement alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis or treatment of patients with central hypothyroidism. In acute and/or intercurrent illness, interpretation is not straightforward and should take into account other patient factors, and age, sex, reproductive status, medications, ethnicity, iodine intake, and biological variation, but not circadian or circannual rhythms, are important variables to consider when interpreting TSH values.

---

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^bb03addf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^075db126]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — TSH target ranges for treatment: In nonpregnant patients, the target range should be within the normal range, and data are lacking to support targeting low normal or subnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. If third-generation assay normal limits are unavailable, use the NHANES III reference population range of 0.45–4.12. In pregnancy, there are no prospective trials establishing optimal target TSH ranges, and the lower range of normal for serum TSH in pregnancy is generally 0.1–0.2 mIU/L lower than the normal range for nonpregnant individuals.

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^6bd74f0d]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^006569d0]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — when to treat (Recommendation 74): When TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L, treatment of SH should be considered in asymptomatic individuals < 65 years of age without the risk factors listed in Recommendation 73, with strength noted as weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^3a37b02b]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Subclinical Hypothyroidism Measurement of serum TSH is generally considered the best screening test for thyroid disease; increased values usually indicate hypothyroidism, and decreased values usually indicate hyperthyroidism. This test has proved to be both sensitive and specific. Its very sensitivity, however, may create a dilemma, since some patients are found to have elevated serum TSH levels, suggesting hypothyroidism, but have normal levels of thyroid hormone, whether measured as free thyroxine or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. The presence of symptoms that might be related to mild hypothyroidism also increases the potential benefit of treatment. Risk of harm to the patient, against which this potential benefit must be balanced, is quite small, since the use of the sensitive TSH assay provides assurance that we are not raising the blood thyroid hormone levels too much as long as TSH levels do not fall below the normal range.

In patients with coronary artery disease and minimal elevations of TSH, however, it may be advisable to follow the TSH level rather than subject the patient to the small risk of levothyroxine therapy. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL, especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased. Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL range. An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in Figure 1. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, because of the minimal extent of the thyroid hormone deficiency, may be controlled with total daily dosages of levothyroxine as low as 25 to 50 μg.

This initial dosage should be maintained for six to eight weeks before a TSH measurement is repeated to guide adjustment of the levothyroxine dosage. The goal is to maintain the TSH level within normal limits; the dosage of levothyroxine should be increased if the TSH level remains above normal and should be decreased if the TSH level falls below normal. Once the correct dosage of thyroxine is established, the frequency of TSH measurement may be decreased to every six to 12 months.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^37bd7e8b]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

The clinical utility of TSH measurement — serum TSH is widely used for diagnosis and screening, with age-specific interpretation needs; in newborns < 3 days of age results are confounded by the postnatal surge, while in newborns 3 days to 1 month a serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally treated as a clinical cutoff requiring immediate action; primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency; in the elderly the upper bound of the TSH reference interval increases with age; interpretation leverages the log-linear relationship between TSH and free thyroxine (fT4) and must consider factors such as iodine intake, age, sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^d4cafc0d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^87f9238e]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^8b75398b]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^472a8176]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^a8dc296c]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Upper limit of normal TSH determination — The reference range of a given laboratory should determine the upper limit of normal for a third generation TSH assay; the normal TSH reference range changes with age; and if an age-based upper limit is not available in an iodine sufficient area, an upper limit of normal of 4.12 should be considered (Grade A, BEL 1).

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^97eb0961]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions — practice implications and laboratory–clinician interface: over the past five decades, testing for TSH and thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) has greatly improved in selectivity and sensitivity. Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement, and there is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. Laboratories often receive requests missing clinical and pharmacological information; the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interpretations and should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges. Standardization, quality, performance, and harmonization of assays (TSH, T4, T3) need to be maintained and improved to enable exchange, application, and interpretation of test results within clinical standards.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^faa6dc70]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

How long should TSH suppression to below the reference range be maintained — Recommendation 46 states that long-term thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression is not suggested for patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease who have no evidence of biochemical or structural recurrence (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). It further states that risks versus benefits of TSH suppression and TSH goals should be re-evaluated over time (Good Practice Statement).

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1d2a5271]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — natural history and treatment evidence indicates that subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 2% of the U.S. population, one quarter of persons revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time, and an estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop "overt" hyperthyroidism, whereas persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress; the USPSTF did not identify any studies evaluating benefits of treating subclinical hyperthyroidism on clinical health outcomes, and except for 1 small (n = 67) nonrandomized study of bone mineral density, no evidence was found on effects of treating "overt" hyperthyroidism.

Our local reference population used to determine reference ranges for TSH was also identified, taking into consideration ATA-approved guidelines: all pregnant women with known thyroid disease and positive TPOAb status were excluded from the reference population. However, limitation in our study includes the lack of the iodine status of our study population, though guidelines recommend establishing the RIs in populations with optimal iodine uptake. Whereas, limited reports documenting the apparent influence of iodine status on gestational RIs of thyroid function tests exist. In particular, a Chinese study could not find any impact of low urinary iodine concentrations on TSH levels. Moreover, though there were also further points to be addressed in the clinical context, estimation of method-specific reference intervals for our local pregnant population and the matter on adopting split gestational subgroups rather than trimesters was a focus of this paper, and other clinically relevant issues were left to our forthcoming study.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^bf5485fb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^5396d0ea]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^22fb1b8f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

TSH reference variability and pregnancy — Median TSH values tend to be higher in iodine-deficient populations than those found in iodine sufficient groups, so population iodine intake should be considered when interpreting TSH values. During pregnancy, the reference interval for TSH varies by trimester, fetal number, geography, and assay; TSH is lowest in the first trimester, lower in women with twins than in women with singleton pregnancies, is ∼0.4 mIU/L lower in African and Asian women, and is higher in women with insufficient iodine intake. Target TSH values for patients taking T4 are dependent on the clinical indication for hormone replacement; for instance, TSH suppression is often recommended for thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TSH MEASUREMENT

Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and can in most cases be easily diagnosed based on using TSH measurement. In addition, the availability of high quality, sensitive and specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentration from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement and the interpretation of TSH results is essential for the practice of high-quality cost-effective medicine.TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Note that primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, turn-around time from specimen collection to patient follow-up represents a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different (Box 2). Patient age presents an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns < 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due the postnatal TSH surge. In newborns between the ages of 3 days and 1 month, serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally considered as a clinical action limit requiring immediate action. At the other age extreme, in the elderly, the upper bound of the TSH reference interval progressively increases with age and should be reflected in laboratory reports and taken into consideration for clinical interpretation of TSH test results.

Box 2.
Points to Consider for Clinical Thyrotropin Measurements

As well as the initial clinical indication for which TSH is measured, other independent variables must be kept in mind when using and interpreting TSH measurements. Human thyroid function is affected by nutritional, environmental, geographical, genetic, and various (patho-)physiological endogenous or exogenous factors. These include population-specific iodine intake, patient age and sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used (see Comparability and Quality Assessment of fT4 and TSH Assays section).

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^13164e9a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Main text

In this article, we take a closer look how these technical changes may have impacted on patient care. A transition occurred from the era of low metabolic rate regarded as synonymous with hypothyroidism to a purely biochemically based definition. Hence, TSH measurement became the new determinant of hypothyroidism. Consequently, treatment habits changed over the last decade and were more related to laboratory records than subjective patient experience. In particular, LT4 replacement doses tended to decrease, as a suppressed TSH was viewed as evidence of overtreatment. However, for two reasons this is an area of considerable uncertainty. Firstly, thyroid-related patient complaints overlap with a plethora of non-specific symptoms caused by other conditions and diseases. Thyroid tests are also more likely to be obtained in patients with unspecific symptoms. In these conditions, LT4 treatment may not be superior to placebo in symptom alleviation. Secondly, TSH is increasingly recognised to be less reliable as a definitive diagnostic tool than previously assumed. Not only is its reference interval not universally agreed on or adjusted for various influences, such as ethnicity, iodine supply, age, but the univariate statistical derivation of a TSH reference range is inherently ill-defined owing to its nature as a controlling element. Physiologically, stimulation by TSH raises thyroid hormones to a level appropriate to the optimal well-being of a person. Because TSH, FT4 and FT3 are interrelated through the operation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback regulation, integrated pairs of TSH and FT4 values define the so-called individual set points. Unlike a population-based univariate reference interval, set points are subject to multivariate normality and narrow homeostatic ranges. When plotting TSH against FT4 concentrations the resulting distribution in a healthy population does not describe the familiar rectangle, but a kite-shaped area. Accordingly, a TSH value can be indicative of true euthyroidism in an individual despite it slightly exceeding the upper reference limit, while a TSH measurement within that reference interval may represent a truly hypothyroid subject. Isolated TSH interpretation thereby becomes ambiguous, resulting in unacceptable diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty surrounding a given TSH measurement when it approaches the TSH euthyroid range. As a consequence, this strategy divorces diagnostic disease definitions from treatment targets. Rationally therefore, the triple roles of TSH as a screening test, diagnostic tool and therapeutic target require separate assessment. Diagnostic reliability for patients may be improved by reconstructing personal TSH-FT4 set points, depending on whether this novel approach can be confirmed in clinical trials.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^2d92ae99]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

Conclusion

Our data analysis strategy supports a normal reference range for TSH of 0.3 to 3.5 mIU/l. Either a clinical and laboratory control or a TRH test can be recommended for patients with basal TSH values lying between 3.0 and 3.5 mIU/l in order to rule out latent hypothyroidism.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^32fb5434]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^ea0f81d6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^7665392a]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) interpretation pitfalls include acute illness; pregnancy; central hypothyroidism from nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas; effects of subcutaneous octreotide and oral bexarotene; anorexia nervosa; heterophile or interfering antibodies; and adrenal insufficiency. In acute illness, TSH may be suppressed with levels below 0.1 mIU/L and testing in hospitalized patients "should be only performed if there is a strong clinical suspicion for thyroid dysfunction". During pregnancy, TSH typically falls in the first trimester, but infrequently to below 0.1 mIU/L, and returns to normal in the second trimester. In central hypothyroidism due to nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, mildly elevated TSH is described, generally not above 6 or 7 mIU/L, due to bioinactive isoforms. Drug and condition effects are specified: subcutaneous octreotide does not cause persistent central hypothyroidism, oral bexarotene almost always does, anorexia nervosa may show low TSH with low free T4, heterophile or interfering antibodies may cause falsely elevated TSH values, and adrenal insufficiency may be associated with TSH elevations reversed with glucocorticoid replacement.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^5ab7491c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^824d4918]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^4b5003c6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma — Principles of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression state that the use of levothyroxine to maintain low TSH levels is considered optimal for papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, although data are lacking to permit precise specification of serum TSH levels. In general, patients with known structural residual carcinoma or at high risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained below 0.1 mU/L. Patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained at the normal range, and for patients at low risk for recurrence with biochemical evidence but no structural evidence of disease (eg, Tg positive, but imaging negative), maintain TSH levels at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Patients who remain disease free for several years should have their TSH levels maintained within the reference range. Given the potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine — including cardiac tachyarrhythmias (especially in the elderly) and bone demineralization (particularly in post-menopausal women) as well as frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis — the risks and benefits of TSH-suppressive therapy must be balanced for each individual patient. Patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed should be counseled to ensure adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^8826411a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Guidelines recommend use of population- and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) reference intervals (RIs) in pregnancy. Since these are often unavailable, clinicians frequently rely on alternative diagnostic strategies. We sought to quantify the diagnostic consequences of current recommendations.

Methods

We included cohorts participating in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Different approaches were used to define RIs: a TSH fixed upper limit of 4.0 mU/L (fixed limit approach), a fixed subtraction from the upper limit for TSH of 0.5 mU/L (subtraction approach) and using nonpregnancy RIs. Outcome measures were sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) of women for whom levothyroxine treatment was indicated and those for whom treatment would be considered according to international guidelines.

Results

The study population comprised 52 496 participants from 18 cohorts. Compared with the use of trimester-specific RIs, alternative approaches had a low sensitivity (0.63–0.82) and high FDR (0.11–0.35) to detect women with a treatment indication or consideration. Sensitivity and FDR to detect a treatment indication in the first trimester were similar between the fixed limit, subtraction, and nonpregnancy approach (0.77–0.11 vs 0.74–0.16 vs 0.60–0.11). The diagnostic performance to detect overt hypothyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinemia, and (sub)clinical hyperthyroidism mainly varied between FT4 RI approaches, while the diagnostic performance to detect subclinical hypothyroidism varied between the applied TSH RI approaches.

Conclusion

Alternative approaches to define RIs for TSH and FT4 in pregnancy result in considerable overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis compared with population- and trimester-specific RIs. Additional strategies need to be explored to optimize identification of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy.

Median TSH values tend to be higher in iodine-deficient populations than those found in iodine sufficient groups. This is reflected in geographically specific TSH reference intervals. Accordingly, population iodine intake should be considered when interpreting TSH values. During pregnancy, TSH concentrations are also affected. This results from the combined effects of high human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations, especially during early pregnancy, and the fact that hCG is a weak thyroid stimulator because of shared homology with TSH. Hence, hCG will mimic TSH stimulation, T4 will be released, and TSH becomes suppressed to a variable extent. In addition to the aforementioned parameters, the reference interval for TSH during pregnancy varies also by trimester, fetal number, and geography (i.e. iodine intake and ethnicity) as well as the TSH assay used.

TSH is lowest in the first trimester, lower in women with twins than in women with singleton pregnancies, is ∼0.4 mIU/L lower in African and Asian women, and is higher in women with insufficient iodine intake. Target TSH values for patients taking T4 are dependent on the clinical indication for hormone replacement; for instance, TSH suppression is often recommended for thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^e4b106db]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — postoperative levothyroxine is considered optimal to decrease TSH in patients with higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, but the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring the degree of TSH suppression to individual risk because optimal serum levels have not been defined. For patients with known residual carcinoma or those at high risk for recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mU/L; for patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence, TSH levels should be maintained at the normal range; and for patients at low risk with imaging negative but Tg levels concerning for disease, TSH levels should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, so an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended for patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed; reports do not suggest that bone mineral density is altered in patients receiving levothyroxine.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and miscarriage — In meta-analysis of first-trimester pregnancy loss, studies included nine studies and over 20,000 patients, and pregnant patients with untreated SCH had a similar risk compared with euthyroid women (relative risk [RR] 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–2.96, P = 0.40). In assisted reproductive technology (ART) data, almost 4,000 women showed no increased risk of miscarriage in women with TSH levels > 2.5 and > 3.5 mIU/L, and overall the three available meta-analyses do not evaluate true SCH or, when they do, show no association with miscarriage. A prospective cohort of unassisted pregnancies found that in > 1,200 women, those with TSH levels > 2.5 mIU/L did not have an increased risk of first-trimester pregnancy loss (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.81–1.41).

Third generation thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) assays have emerged as the single most useful test of thyroid function, and are used widely and appropriately as a screening test. TSH measurement alone may be misleading in complicated patients and those undergoing treatment for thyroid dysfunction. Before obtaining thyroid function tests, clinicians need to consider whether the patient might have pituitary or hypothalamic disease or severe nonthyroidal illness, and whether assessment of the pituitary-thyroid axis reflects steady-state conditions. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with adverse effects on the skeleton and the heart, and is best assessed by measurement of serum TsH with a third-generation assay.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^53aca48d]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Key clinical points for interpreting thyroid tests — most thyroid tests are performed on multimodality automated immunoassay instrument systems, and the same test from different manufacturer instruments can differ in absolute value; use appropriate reference intervals for interpretation, recognizing that laboratories may change instruments and reference intervals without consulting or alerting physicians. Interference is rare but can affect any thyroid test result and includes heterophile antibodies (HABs), analyte autoantibodies, high-dose biotin, pharmaceuticals, and nutritional factors; HAb interference can affect multiple tests and, when detected, it should be noted in the patients' chart, and interference should be suspected when the test result is discordant with the clinical presentation of the patient, while the laboratory may not have access to the clinical condition of the patient. The reference interval typically represents the 95% confidence limits for a control population without thyroid disease and the between-person reference interval is typically wider than the within-person reference interval. Thyrotropin (TSH) represents a more sensitive reflection of thyroid status than free thyroxine (fT4) because of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship; however, TSH is only a valid measure of thyroid status if the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is intact and it may take weeks to months for the TSH measurement to accurately reflect thyroid status after an acute change.

### Evaluation of thyroid hormone status: are simultaneous TSH and FT4 tests necessary? Analysis of thyroid function test results taken from the greater manchester care record 2010–2023 [^1aab20a8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge previous work suggesting that combined fT4 and TSH testing is not necessary, with the alternative being a two‐step approach based on first testing TSH. However, in this representative large community sample, we have identified a large number of people treated with levothyroxine who have a fT4 outside the laboratory RR.

There is variability in relation to the way that thyroid hormone status assessment is decided. However, the laboratory can lead on best practice. We here have provided evidence that thyroid function testing for individuals on levothyroxine replacement should include a check of fT4 as well as TSH. Such an approach, if adopted, can be enabled by the simple strategy of requiring the clinician requesting the test to state whether or not the patient is taking thyroid hormone replacement with a mandatory tick box.

Regarding cost estimates, while assay costs will be subject to some variation between laboratories, our estimate is for an additional £0.80 (Euro 0.93) of fT4 estimation to be added to TSH (£1.00) (Euro 1.16) for the cost of TSH alone, giving a total cost of £1.80 (Euro 2.09) for fT4 and TSH to be assayed together.

We accept that we do not have sufficient data to support a universal recommendation. Given the possible risks associated with prolonged exposure to high and low fT4 levels, we suggest that where indicated, fT4 and TSH should both be measured, in particular for those treated with levothyroxine, to enable thyroid hormone replacement dose adjustment as appropriate. In any case, if pituitary/hypothalamic disease is suspected fT4 and TSH should be checked in order not to miss pituitary insufficiency.

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

Thyroid hormone suppression of TSH — Postoperative levothyroxine to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is considered optimal for higher-risk papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, and the NCCN Panel recommends tailoring suppression to individual risk. For known residual carcinoma or high risk of recurrence, the recommended TSH level is < 0.1 mIU/L; for disease-free, low-risk patients, TSH should be maintained at the normal range; and for low-risk patients with imaging negative but concerning Tg, TSH should be maintained at 0.1–0.5 mIU/L. Potential toxicities include cardiac tachyarrhythmias, bone demineralization, and frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis; therefore, an adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 units/day) is recommended when TSH is chronically suppressed, and reports do not suggest altered bone mineral density in patients receiving levothyroxine.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^8f7b1e36]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

### Higher serum thyroid stimulating hormone level in thyroid nodule patients is associated with greater risks of differentiated thyroid cancer and advanced tumor stage [^ea78bab4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

TSH is a known thyroid growth factor, but the pathogenic role of TSH in thyroid oncogenesis is unclear.

Objective

The aim was to examine the relationship between preoperative TSH and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

Design

The design was a retrospective cohort.

Setting, Participants

Between May 1994 and January 2007, 1198 patients underwent thyroid surgery at a single hospital. Data from the 843 patients with preoperative serum TSH concentration were recorded.

Main Outcome Measures

Serum TSH concentration was measured with a sensitive assay. Diagnoses of DTC vs. benign thyroid disease were based on surgical pathology reports.

Results

Twenty-nine percent of patients (241 of 843) had DTC on final pathology. On both univariate and multivariable analyses, risk of malignancy correlated with higher TSH level (P = 0.007). The likelihood of malignancy was 16% (nine of 55) when TSH was less than 0.06 mIU/liter vs. 52% (15 of 29) when 5.00 mIU/liter or greater (P = 0.001). When TSH was between 0.40 and 1.39 mIU/liter, the likelihood of malignancy was 25% (85 of 347) vs. 35% (109 of 308) when TSH was between 1.40 and 4.99 mIU/liter (P = 0.002). The mean TSH was 4.9 ± 1.5 mIU/liter in patients with stage III/IV disease vs. 2.1 ± 0.2 mIU/liter in patients with stage I/II disease (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

The likelihood of thyroid cancer increases with higher serum TSH concentration. Even within normal TSH ranges, a TSH level above the population mean is associated with significantly greater likelihood of thyroid cancer than a TSH below the mean. Shown for the first time, higher TSH level is associated with advanced stage DTC.

### Adding interpretative comments to results of thyroid function tests from patients on thyroxine replacement does not improve management [^d94bab19]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the impact of adding clinical comments to reports of thyroid function testing in patients treated for hypothyroidism.

Methods

We compared thyroid function test results in primary care patients being treated for hypothyroidism from January 2016 to August 2023 at two NHS Trusts with similar demographics and using the same instruments, but with different interpretative comment policies. One laboratory, Buckinghamshire Health Trust (Bucks), adds interpretative comments, whereas the other, Oxford University Hospitals (Oxford), does not. We used two outcome measures: the percentage of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within the reference interval on repeat testing and the timing of repeat TSH testing samples, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance (NG145).

Results

We identified 18242 and 31655 hypothyroid patients (9.0% and 7.7% of the population tested) in Bucks and Oxford, with a total of 121961 and 247639 tests over the evaluation period, respectively. The proportion of TSH results within the reference interval (83.4% in Bucks, 83.9% in Oxford) was similar in both Trusts, as was TSH concentration (median TSH concentration 1.60 (IQR 0.78–2.82) mU/L in Bucks, 1.68 (IQR 0.97–2.76) in Oxford). The interval between tests was shorter in Oxford, but differed significantly from NG145 in both Trusts. Differences were statistically significant for both outcome measures, but of questionable clinical significance.

Conclusions

Adding interpretative comments to results of thyroid function tests does not appear to affect the distribution of TSH concentrations in primary care patients on thyroxine replacement or the intervals between tests in a clinically meaningful way.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^aa4edc81]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests (thyrotropin [TSH] and thyroid hormone [TH] measurement) is open to question and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) with its expertise support the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing the recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care. Summary: This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of current routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated through ongoing international efforts before results from different assays can be considered equivalent. Emerging technology (e.g., mass spectrometry) shows promise for improved analytical performance, but more evidence of its clinical utility and improved throughput is required before it can be considered for routine use. Close clinical-laboratory collaboration is encouraged to overcome and avoid the pitfalls in thyroid testing as well as resolve clinically discrepant results. The evidence base supporting the conclusions of this review is summarized in four detailed online technical supplements. Conclusions: Over the past five decades, testing for TSH, T4, and T3 has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays to nonisotopic multiplexed immunometric assays using highly automated equipment. Despite these technical advances, physicians and laboratorians performing these analyses must understand limitations of these methods to properly order tests and interpret results.

THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF TH MEASUREMENTS COMPLEMENTING INTERPRETATION OF THE PRIMARY PARAMETER TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease as a consequence of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval as this allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical, and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in a number of clinical situations (Table 2) such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome,), and the initial treatment of hypo-or hyperthyroidismas the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Table 2.
Common Physiological and Pharmacological Effects on the Biology of the Thyroid Hormone Axis

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, this term is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis. In addition, "thyroid function tests" are frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring, for example, primary congenital hypothyroidism. Table 3 describes rare causes of perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^077124d9]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

### Normal limits for serum thyrotropin vary greatly depending on method [^314f9ef3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within populations do not follow Gaussian distribution, and normal limits are derived after mathematical normalization. The clinical relevance of these limits is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare upper and lower TSH limits by four data normalization methods with non-normalized data and assess their clinical relevance.

Design, Patients and Measurements

Results of blood samples taken by community physicians and stored in a computerized database were analysed after removing samples from patients with evidence of thyroid illness. TSH values were normalized by the Hoffmann and Tukey methods and each method with natural log transformation. Non-normalized data for TSH in the uppermost and lowermost percentile were also calculated. Clinical relevance was determined by alterations in thyroid hormone levels at, below and above the limits for each method.

Results

The maximal reduction from non-normalized data for the upper normal limit (UNL) was by the Hoffman method 43% = 3.1 mIU/l). The maximal increase for the lower normal limit (LNL) was also by the Hoffman method (708% = 0.81 mIU/l). There was very limited difference in average FT3 and FT4 between patients with TSH within, below or above the normal range for all methods.

Conclusions

Different normalization methods alter the normal limits greatly. However, in individuals without thyroid illness, thyroid hormone values are stable over a wide range of TSH levels including beyond the UNL for all methods. Indeed, there may be no true universal upper TSH cut-off level and clinical decision-making cannot rely on these calculated limits.

Graves' disease after 131I therapy — follow-up and monitoring should include an assessment of free T4 and total T3 within the first 1–2 months, with biochemical monitoring continued at 4–6 week intervals if the patient remains thyrotoxic; most patients normalize thyroid function and symptoms within 4–8 weeks, hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks on but more commonly between 2 and 6 months, once euthyroidism is achieved lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended, and since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves they should be interpreted cautiously and only in concert with free T4 and T3 estimates.

### Serum thyrotrophin at baseline predicts the natural course of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^32adc6e0]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Optimal therapeutic strategies for subclinical hyperthyroidism are undecided. Overt disease develops in a minority of cases, but the risk factors for progression remain unclear. We examined whether a baseline thyrotrophin (TSH) predicted progression to overt hyperthyroidism in asymptomatic individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Design, Patients and Measurements

This was a retrospective study of 323 patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism seen in our institution from 2003 to 2010 (mean age 71 years, males 26.9%, females 73.1%, mean follow-up duration 32 months, range 6–93 months). Serum TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) were documented at baseline and during follow-up. After excluding individuals with nonthyroid causes of low TSH, patients were grouped according to initial TSH as: TSH 0.10–0.39 mU/l (grade I) and TSH < 0.10 mU/l (grade II).

Results

Only 38 patients (11.8%) developed overt hyperthyroidism with annual progression rates of 0.6–3.7%. Most patients reverted to normal thyroid status (31.6%) or remained subclinically hyperthyroid (56.7%). Progression to frank hyperthyroidism was higher in grade II than in grade I patients (20.3% vs 6.8%, P < 0.001, Chi square test). Kaplan-Meier curves showed faster progression rates in grade II than grade I (P < 0.001, log rank test). In stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis, TSH < 0.1 mU/l was associated with overt hyperthyroidism (hazard ratio 3.4, confidence interval 1.6–7.0), whereas age, gender, FT4 and aetiological diagnosis were not associated with hyperthyroidism.

Conclusions

Thyrotrophin predicts overt hyperthyroidism in asymptomatic individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Patients with TSH < 0.10 mU/l have a higher risk of progressing to hyperthyroidism than those with TSH 0.10–0.39 mU/l.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — treatment thresholds and candidate groups: When TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L, treatment of SH should be strongly considered in all individuals ≥ 65 years of age, in postmenopausal women who are not on estrogens or bisphosphonates, in patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis, and in individuals with hyperthyroid symptoms; when TSH is persistently below the lower limit of normal but > 0.1 mU/L, treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism; if SH is to be treated, treatment should be based on etiology and follow the same principles as for overt hyperthyroidism.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^e06cfc94]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently < 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be strongly considered in all individuals ≥ 65 years of age, in postmenopausal women not on estrogens or bisphosphonates, in patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis, and in individuals with hyperthyroid symptoms (2/++0). Persistent SH is defined as a TSH level of < 0.1 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period, and the underlying thyroid disorder should be diagnosed and is most commonly TMNG, GD, or TA. The task force elected to recommend treatment of all SH patients younger than 65 years of age with persistent TSH < 0.1 mU/L and hyperthyroid symptoms, while noting insufficient data for or against treatment of younger persons or premenopausal women with serum TSH < 0.1 mU/L.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^73204c7e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Using the observed historical narrower therapeutic range for an individual patient we note that the treatment targets may overlap for patients in a group. If that is true the general assumption that maintaining TSH anywhere within its broad reference limits to routinely achieve a satisfactory outcome for each and every patient may be ill advised. We have refuted the applicability of treatment targets based on the consideration of the reference ranges in the healthy population, by demonstrating dissociations between FT3 and FT4, and FT3 and TSH in LT4-treated athyreotic patients, and documenting altered equilibria between the hormones on LT4, compared to the healthy state. Others have arrived at similar conclusions. In laboratory diagnostics, the high individuality of TSH and thyroid hormones has long been recognised since the pioneering work of Andersen and colleagues. However, this applies equally to the statistical analysis of associations involving thyroid parameters. Data clustering, be it in groups with similar properties or in subjects where multiple measurements are obtained over time, potentially masks the true relationship, abolishing the strong associations at the group level when the data are combined for analysis. This phenomenon, known as Simpson's paradox, is readily demonstrated with a fictitious random sample of two groups with a slightly shifted centre showing the same strong inverse correlation. Unlike the correct analysis by individual groups, a combined analysis of the total cohort artificially weakens the correlation (Fig. 2). The analytical distinction between the averaged versus the typical outcome is clinically relevant for all thyroid drug trials, independently of evidence class and study design, because doctors are naturally more interested in the latter.

Fig. 2
Demonstration of correlation bias by combining dissimilar groups. In randomly sampled groups showing the same strong inverse correlation (blue and red regression line) but slightly shifted centres, a combined analysis (black regression line) - unlike the correct analysis by individual groups - weakens the correlation. Distinguishing between averaged and typical outcomes is particularly important for parameters with known high individuality such as thyroid hormones

In a large retrospective longitudinal study, relying on a multilevel model and accounting for both within-subject and between-subject variation, symptomatic outcomes were associated with serum FT3 concentrations, and differed according to the placement of biochemical parameters within the reference range or noticeably beyond its limits in the case of TSH and FT4. Treatment-related displacement of the equilibria between thyroid parameters, wide variations in the biochemical treatment response, and individually adjusted dose requirement pose particular challenges for thyroid trials. Demonstration of averaged equivalency cannot therefore be a satisfactory analytical goal.
