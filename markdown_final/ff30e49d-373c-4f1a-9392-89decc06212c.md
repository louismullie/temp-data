## Question

The role of Mebendazole on anemia patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how mebendazole affects patients with anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causal link between helminth infections and anemia. Then, I should verify mebendazole's efficacy against the specific helminths that cause anemia, especially hookworm. Next, I will review direct and indirect evidence on how deworming affects hemoglobin and anemia outcomes. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnant women and people living with HIV. I should also examine safety, including hematologic adverse effects and pregnancy considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-aligned recommendations and note limitations and alternatives where mebendazole underperforms.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. Hookworm infection causes intestinal blood loss and iron deficiency anemia. Ascaris and Trichuris can contribute to anemia via inflammation and malabsorption, but hookworm is the principal driver of helminth-related anemia in endemic settings, particularly in children and women of reproductive age [^111cDz8s] [^1134TQh7] [^114jtmhc].

> Wait, let me verify mebendazole's efficacy profile before assuming benefit. Mebendazole is indicated for Ascaris, Trichuris, Enterobius, and hookworm, but its cure rates vary by species; single-dose mebendazole performs poorly against hookworm compared with albendazole, with meta-analytic cure rates around 33% for mebendazole versus about 80% for albendazole, whereas multiple-dose mebendazole regimens can achieve much higher cure rates in some settings [^1152XMTk] [^114jtmhc]. Hold on, I should verify formulation effects; chewable mebendazole did not outperform standard tablets against hookworm in head-to-head trials, suggesting limited impact of formulation on efficacy in that context [^115bkKyW].

> I will now examine direct evidence on hemoglobin outcomes. In a randomized trial of severely anemic pregnant women, adding a multiple-dose mebendazole regimen to standard iron-folic care produced a modest but statistically significant additional hemoglobin rise compared with standard care alone, indicating that eradicating worms augments iron repletion when baseline iron deficiency is prominent [^115w8xmC]. Let me consider broader syntheses; systematic reviews suggest deworming yields small average hemoglobin improvements, roughly translating to a 5–10% reduction in anemia prevalence in high-burden settings, though effects are heterogeneous and often modest without concurrent iron support [^116NW159] [^114b5Hh9].

> Next, I should review pregnancy-specific data. WHO recommends presumptive deworming with mebendazole or albendazole after the first trimester in settings with high STH prevalence and substantial anemia, because untreated hookworm in pregnancy is associated with maternal iron deficiency anemia and adverse perinatal outcomes. Randomized and observational studies generally show no increase in adverse birth outcomes with mebendazole exposure, and some analyses suggest potential benefits on low birth weight and infant outcomes when deworming is combined with iron, although results are mixed and context-dependent [^117VNqyn] [^111qmdyR] [^112MtjBf] [^114yTKw5]. Hold on, I should verify timing; most guidance favors treatment after the first trimester, and some programs have operationalized single or dual-dose strategies in the second and third trimesters, with pragmatic adaptations in trials to balance uptake and safety [^1173MdCi] [^116CRaQt].

> Let me consider people living with HIV. I should confirm whether deworming is safe and whether it affects anemia markers. Cochrane analyses indicate no signal of harm from antihelminthics in HIV-positive populations, and there may be small, short-term improvements in viral load and CD4 in those with confirmed helminth infection, though evidence quality is low; one trial captured a small hemoglobin difference favoring deworming, but overall anemia data are limited and inconsistent, so expectations should be cautious [^115rjgcR].

> I need to check safety, especially hematologic risks. Routine short-course mebendazole is generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal adverse effects most common; rare hematologic adverse effects such as neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported with prolonged high-dose use, not with standard single or short-course regimens, and benzimidazole class marrow suppression is more clearly described with albendazole in certain contexts, reinforcing that standard mebendazole dosing is low risk for hematologic toxicity in typical anemia patients [^1161Xbwu] [^113bDJ9y] [^114m5yy8]. But wait, what if the patient is pregnant? Human data have not shown a clear increase in major birth defects or miscarriage with mebendazole, yet animal data suggest potential fetal risks; thus, balancing maternal-fetal benefits of treating hookworm-related anemia against theoretical risks supports use after the first trimester in endemic settings [^117NFtD6] [^114bmLHc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about population-level impact. Meta-analyses of school-based deworming show small, sometimes statistically non-significant effects on hemoglobin and growth, likely reflecting low average infection intensity in some settings, rapid reinfection, and the need for concurrent iron and nutrition support; this aligns with the concept that anthelmintics stop blood loss but do not by themselves restore iron stores or correct malnutrition without dietary micronutrients [^114b5Hh9] [^116WT8kV] [^111XaVYF]. I should double-check that WHO's anemia reduction goals are framed within integrated packages including iron, folate, and WASH, not deworming alone, which is consistent with these findings [^112MtjBf].

> Let me synthesize the clinical role. Mebendazole is appropriate for confirmed or strongly suspected hookworm infection in anemic patients, particularly when iron deficiency is present, because eradicating the cause of ongoing blood loss facilitates iron repletion; however, given its inferior single-dose efficacy against hookworm, a multiple-dose regimen may be preferred in individual patient care or in settings with suspected reduced susceptibility, with albendazole considered as an alternative based on superior single-dose cure rates in meta-analyses [^1152XMTk] [^114jtmhc] [^111PNiiv]. I should confirm that in pregnancy, presumptive treatment is recommended after the first trimester in endemic settings, ideally paired with iron-folate supplementation, and that safety data to date are reassuring for such practice [^117VNqyn] [^111qmdyR].

> Next, I should review practical implementation. Standard adult dosing is 500 mg once or 100 mg twice daily for three days, with chewable and solid formulations showing broadly similar safety profiles. In children, chewable 500 mg tablets are available and generally well accepted, though efficacy against hookworm remains limited with single-dose mebendazole, reinforcing the value of multi-dose regimens or alternative agents when response is suboptimal [^115bkKyW] [^114kHioB] [^114jtmhc]. I need to ensure we address reinfection by integrating WASH and, where appropriate, periodic retreatment within public health programs, given rapid post-treatment reinfection dynamics in endemic communities [^1134TQh7] [^114oydrf].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and resistance concerns. Declining efficacy of mebendazole against hookworm has been documented in several settings, raising concern for benzimidazole resistance. In such contexts, albendazole may be preferred, and combination regimens such as albendazole plus ivermectin for Trichuris, or alternative agents, may be needed to sustain control efforts and protect anemia-related gains [^1152XMTk] [^116gA8YB]. Hold on, I should verify that ongoing monitoring of cure rates and egg reduction is essential to detect suboptimal responses and guide regimen choices in anemia-focused care pathways [^1152XMTk].

Mebendazole is indicated for anemia when it is caused by **hookworm infection** [^112xcdcs] [^112C38we], as it eradicates the worms and thereby reduces ongoing blood loss and iron deficiency. It is **not effective for non-helminth anemia** and should be combined with iron therapy for optimal recovery [^111XaVYF]. In pregnancy, use after the first trimester if benefits outweigh risks; avoid in the first trimester unless clearly indicated [^113GYA6C] [^117VNqyn]. Mebendazole is safe and well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects [^1161Xbwu] [^1116Cksx].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to anemia

Mebendazole binds to β-tubulin and disrupts microtubule polymerization, leading to parasite death and cessation of **blood loss** — the primary driver of iron-deficiency anemia in hookworm infection [^114kHioB] [^115WhjSD].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting mebendazole use in anemia

- **Hookworm anemia**: Mebendazole is effective against Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, the main causes of helminth-related anemia [^112xcdcs] [^114jtmhc].

- **Pregnancy**: WHO recommends single-dose mebendazole (500 mg) after the first trimester in endemic areas to reduce hookworm burden and maternal anemia [^117VNqyn] [^112MtjBf].

- **Pediatric use**: Mebendazole is safe and effective for children ≥ 2 years, reducing anemia by clearing hookworm [^112xcdcs] [^1116Cksx].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

| **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Administration** |
|-|-|-|
| Hookworm infection | 100 mg twice daily for 3 days | Oral tablets, with or without food |
| Pregnancy (after first trimester) | 500 mg single dose | Oral tablet, after the first trimester [^117VNqyn] |
| Pediatric patients (≥ 2 years) | 100 mg twice daily for 3 days | Oral tablets or chewable formulation [^112xcdcs] [^114QzCg4] |

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, rash [^1161Xbwu] [^1116Cksx].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare neutropenia, agranulocytosis, hepatitis with prolonged high-dose use [^113bDJ9y] [^112coRtx].

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid in the first trimester unless benefits outweigh risks; use after the first trimester if indicated [^113GYA6C] [^117VNqyn].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Non-helminth anemia**: Mebendazole is not effective for anemia from other causes (e.g. nutritional, genetic, chronic disease) [^notfound].

- **Resistance**: Emerging benzimidazole resistance may reduce efficacy; monitor and rotate therapies as needed [^1152XMTk] [^111cDz8s].

- **Reinfection**: High reinfection rates necessitate integrated WASH and repeated dosing [^114oydrf] [^1134TQh7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

WHO recommends preventive chemotherapy with **mebendazole** or **albendazole** in endemic settings to reduce STH burden and anemia [^1134TQh7]. For pregnant women, administer mebendazole **after the first trimester** in endemic areas with high hookworm prevalence and anemia [^117VNqyn]. For pediatric patients, treat school-aged children in endemic areas to reduce anemia and improve growth [^1134TQh7] [^112PY4me].

---

## Conclusion

Mebendazole is effective for anemia caused by hookworm, reducing blood loss and improving iron status [^111XaVYF]. It is **not effective for non-helminth anemia** and should be combined with iron therapy for optimal recovery [^111XaVYF]. Use after the first trimester in pregnancy, and monitor for resistance and reinfection [^117VNqyn] [^111cDz8s].

### Low efficacy of mebendazole against hookworm in Vietnam: two randomized controlled trials [^115qp8t4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Vietnam is participating in a global de-worming effort that aims to treat 650 million school children regularly by 2010. The treatment used in Vietnam is single dose oral mebendazole (Phardazone) 500 mg. We tested the efficacy of single dose mebendazole 500 mg in the therapy of hookworm infection in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial among 271 Vietnamese schoolchildren. The treatment efficacy of single dose mebendazole in children did not differ significantly from placebo, with a reduction in mean eggs per gram of feces relative to placebo of 31% (95% CI -9 to 56%, P = 0.1). In light of these findings we then carried out a similar randomized trial comparing triple dose mebendazole, single dose albendazole, and triple dose albendazole against placebo in 209 adults in the same area. The estimated reduction in mean post-treatment eggs per gram of feces relative to placebo was 63% (95% CI 30–81%) for triple mebendazole, 75% (47–88%) for single albendazole, and 88% (58–97%) for triple albendazole. Our results suggest that single dose oral mebendazole has low efficacy against hookworm infection in Vietnam, and that it should be replaced by albendazole. These findings are of major public health relevance given the opportunity costs of treating entire populations with ineffective therapies. We recommend that efficacy of anti-helminth therapies is pilot tested before implementation of national gut worm control programs.

### Treatment response to standard of care for severe anemia in pregnant women and effect of multivitamins and enhanced anthelminthics [^115w8xmC]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Severe anemia (hemoglobin < 70 g/L) in pregnancy may increase the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality.

Objectives

We assessed response to standard treatment with high-dose iron-folic acid for 90 d and single-dose (500 mg) mebendazole among severely anemic pregnant women in periurban Karachi, Pakistan. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of 2 enhanced treatment regimens.

Design

We screened pregnant women (n = 6288) for severe anemia and provided them all with the standard treatment. To test the efficacy of 2 additional treatments, women were randomly assigned to standard treatment alone (control) or with 100 mg mebendazole twice daily for 3 d or 90 d of daily multivitamins or both using a 2 x 2 factorial design.

Results

Prevalence of severe anemia was high (10.5%) during pregnancy. Prevalence of geohelminths and malaria was low. Treatment response was defined as hemoglobin > 100 g/L at the 90-d or ≥ 25 g/L at the 60-d follow-up visit. The standard-of-care treatment resulted in a response rate of 49% at follow-up, although an adherence of ≥ 85% elicited a higher response (67%). The effect of the additional treatments was weak. Although response was higher in the enhanced groups than for the standard treatment at the final assessment, the differences were not statistically significant. However, hemoglobin concentration increased significantly in all groups and was higher in the enhanced mebendazole group compared with the standard group (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Iron deficiency was high in this population, and the standard-of-care treatment resulted in a treatment response of 50%, although better treatment adherence showed a higher response. Multivitamins and the enhanced mebendazole regimen had a modest benefit over and above the standard treatment.

### Effect of lymphatic filariasis and hookworm infection on pregnancy course and outcome in women living in the democratic republic of the Congo [^115jGKyL]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The aim of the present study was to document, for the first time, pregnancy outcomes in a rural population of DRC, and assess whether pregnancy outcomes were related to HW or LF parasitological status. No significant associations were found between infections with W. bancrofti or with HW, and the four pregnancy outcomes we focused on (miscarriage, preterm birth, neonatal mortality, and postpartum hemorrhage). The only significant result was that women with HAHT before the first albendazole treatment given as part of the trial had a significantly lower frequency of history of neonatal mortality.

The significant relationship observed here between HAHT and neonatal mortality is intriguing but will require further exploration to confirm and establish whether it is due to biological causes such as anemia (see in the following text) or is instead a product of other factors such as sociological determinants. Despite the potential benefits of anthelmintic treatment among pregnant women and an informal consultation made by the WHOwhich recommended treatment of all pregnant women with praziquantel and albendazole in areas endemic for STH or schistosomiasis, widespread adoption has not been observed. To date, only a minority of countries have included anthelmintic intake (albendazole or mebendazole) during routine pregnancy care, in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy: specifically, Madagascar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Published studies suggest that it may be because of a fear of adverse birth outcomes due to a lack of safety data. More studies are needed to assess the benefits of implementing systematic deworming for pregnant women in resource-poor settings.

### Ascaris lumbricoides infection following school-based deworming in Western Kenya: assessing the role of pupils' school and home water, sanitation, and hygiene exposures [^114oydrf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

It has been estimated that more than 1.45 billion people throughout the world are infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), primarily roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), and hookworms (Necator americanus or Ancylostoma duodenale).STH infections can lead to anemia, and slowed physical and cognitive development. School-aged children bear much of the burden of STH morbidity, which accounts for over 5 million disability-adjusted life years annually.

Mass drug administration (MDA) programs that administer anthelminthic drugs, principally albendazole or mebendazole, at either the school or community levelare being implemented throughout the world to reduce the prevalence of STHs and their associated morbidity. Although MDA greatly reduces parasite loads, deworming does not prevent transmission or reinfection.MDA efficacy varies depending on worm species and the type of deworming drug being used, but even when cure rates are high, the prevalence of STHs often return to near pretreatment levels within 6 months due to new infections.

### Antihelminthics in helminth-endemic areas: effects on HIV disease progression [^115rjgcR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Helminth infections, such as soil‐transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and lymphatic filariasis, are prevalent in many countries where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common. There is some evidence from observational studies that HIV and helminth co‐infection may be associated with higher viral load and lower CD4+ cell counts. Treatment of helminth infections with antihelminthics (deworming drugs) may have benefits for people living with HIV beyond simply clearance of worm infections.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2009 and we have expanded it to include outcomes of anaemia and adverse events.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of deworming drugs (antihelminthic therapy) on markers of HIV disease progression, anaemia, and adverse events in children and adults.

Search methods

In this review update, we searched online for published and unpublished studies in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICRTP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Global Health Library up to 29 September 2015. We also searched databases listing conference abstracts, scanned reference lists of articles, and contacted the authors of included studies.

Selection criteria

We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared antihelminthic drugs with placebo or no intervention in HIV‐positive people.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias. The primary outcomes were changes in HIV viral load and CD4+ cell count, and secondary outcomes were anaemia, iron deficiency, adverse events, and mortality events. We compared the effects of deworming using mean differences, risk ratios (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main results

Eight trials met the inclusion criteria of this review, enrolling a total of 1612 participants. Three trials evaluated the effect of providing antihelminthics to all adults with HIV without knowledge of their helminth infection status, and five trials evaluated the effects of providing deworming drugs to HIV‐positive individuals with confirmed helminth infections. Seven trials were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa and one in Thailand.

Antihelminthics for people with unknown helminth infection status

Providing antihelminthics (albendazole and praziquantel together or separately) to HIV‐positive adults with unknown helminth infection status may have a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six weeks but the 95% CI includes the possibility of no effect (difference in mean change −0.14 log 10 viral RNA/mL, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.07, P = 0.19; one trial, 166 participants, low quality evidence).

Repeated dosing with deworming drugs over two years (albendazole every three months plus annual praziquantel), probably has little or no effect on mean viral load (difference in mean change 0.01 log 10 viral RNA, 95% CI: −0.03 to −0.05; one trial, 917 participants, moderate quality evidence), and little or no effect on mean CD4+ count (difference in mean change 2.60 CD4+ cells/µL, 95% CI −10.15 to 15.35; P = 0.7; one trial, 917 participants, low quality evidence).

Antihelminthics for people with confirmed helminth infections

Treating confirmed helminth infections in HIV‐positive adults may have a small suppressive effect on mean viral load at six to 12 weeks following deworming (difference in mean change −0.13 log 10 viral RNA, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.00; P = 0.04; four trials, 445 participants, low quality evidence). However, this finding is strongly influenced by a single study of praziquantel treatment for schistosomiasis. There may also be a small favourable effect on mean CD4+ cell count at 12 weeks after deworming in HIV‐positive populations with confirmed helminth infections (difference in mean change 37.86 CD4+ cells/µL, 95% CI 7.36 to 68.35; P = 0.01; three trials, 358 participants, low quality evidence).

Adverse events and mortality

There is no indication that antihelminthic drugs impart additional risks in HIV‐positive populations. However, adverse events were not well reported (very low quality evidence) and trials were underpowered to evaluate effects on mortality (low quality evidence).

Authors' conclusions

There is low quality evidence that treating confirmed helminth infections in HIV‐positive adults may have small, short‐term favourable effects on markers of HIV disease progression. Further studies are required to confirm this finding. Current evidence suggests that deworming with antihelminthics is not harmful, and this is reassuring for the routine treatment of confirmed or suspected helminth infections in people living with HIV in co‐endemic areas.

Further long‐term studies are required to make confident conclusions regarding the impact of presumptively deworming all HIV‐positive individuals irrespective of helminth infection status, as the only long‐term trial to date did not demonstrate an effect.

### Prospects for elimination of soil-transmitted helminths [^112PY4me]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Soil-Transmitted Helminths Morbidity Control

The current WHO endorsed strategy for the control of STH aims to eliminate STH as a public health problem, defined by the WHO as a reduction in prevalence to less than 1% of moderate or high intensity infection. This target is based on evidence that severity of STH-associated morbidities is highly associated with an individual's intensity of infection. STH infections of moderate-to-high intensity are associated with diarrhea, anemia, chronic inflammation, and malnutrition and with disrupted growth and cognitive impairment in children.

Key Points

Mathematical modeling indicates that interrupting the transmission of STH may be possible through MDA of albendazole expanded from child-targeted to community wide, even without universal access to water and sanitation.
New opportunities to pursue transmission interruption are emerging because of pursuit of elimination strategies for other neglected tropical diseases, demonstrated feasibility of community-wide MDA, reductions in prevalence of STH through current morbidity control efforts, and advances in molecular diagnostics.
Challenges to an MDA-based STH transmission interruption strategy include the need for high coverage and compliance, the definition and accurate determination of interruption status, and the potentialfor anthelminthic resistance.
A switch from morbidity control to a transmission interruption strategy for STH has risks, including the emergence of resistance to antihelminthics and the loss of resources for morbidity control in the event that elimination is unsuccessful.

Given that the diagnosis of STH infection requires laboratory capacity and skilled microscopists and that treatment with a single dose of albendazole or mebendazole is inexpensive, well tolerated, and can be delivered to high-risk groups by nonmedical personnel in schools or communities, the WHO recommends presumptive deworming through MDA in endemic areas. Although there is ongoing debate about the economic, cognitive, and morbidity impact at the population level of this strategy, it can effectively eliminate infections of intensities understood to cause morbidity. Specifically, current WHO guidelines focus on routine empiric deworming of all SAC, PSAC, and women of childbearing age without reliance on diagnostic testing of individuals before treatment. The WHO recommends deworming of SAC annually in areas where pre-MDA prevalence is between 20 and 50%, and twice annually where pre-MDA prevalence is greater than 50%.

Description of interventions

Five RCTs treated HIV‐positive adults with confirmed helminth infections; two trials treated soil‐transmitted helminth (STH) infections with albendazole (400 mg) once daily for three days (Abate 2014 ETH; Walson 2008 KEN), one study treated schistosomiasis with praziquantel (40 mg/kg) once only (Kallestrup 2005 ZWE), one study treated STH or schistosomiasis with albendazole, praziquantel, or both (Webb 2012 UGA), and one trial treated lymphatic filariasis (LF) with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) (Nielsen 2007 TZA). These trials followed participants for six to 12 weeks (see Table 16 and Table 15).

13
Characteristics of trials in which participants had confirmed helminth infections

Five trials measured and reported HIV‐1 RNA viral load (Kallestrup 2005 ZWE; Nielsen 2007 TZA; Walson 2008 KEN; Walson 2012 KEN; Webb 2012 UGA), and four trials reported CD4+ cell count (Kallestrup 2005 ZWE; Nielsen 2007 TZA; Walson 2008 KEN; Walson 2012 KEN). One study reported CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio, seven trials reported adverse events, one trial reported measures of iron deficiency and anaemia respectively, and six trials reported mortality.

We requested unpublished data from all but one trial author (Kelly 1996 ZMB), and we included these data in the analyses.

Excluded studies

We excluded 33 studies due to their observational designs or irrelevance to the intervention or outcomes of interest. See the ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' table. We identified two ongoing or planned RCTs, and have provided descriptions of these trials in Table 17.

### Common intestinal parasites [^114ywQvd]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Intestinal parasites cause significant morbidity and mortality. Diseases caused by Enterobius vermicularis, Giardia lamblia, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, and Entamoeba histolytica occur in the United States. E. vermicularis, or pinworm, causes irritation and sleep disturbances. Diagnosis can be made using the "cellophane tape test". Treatment includes mebendazole and household sanitation. Giardia causes nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, diarrhea, and weight loss. Stool ova and parasite studies are diagnostic. Treatment includes metronidazole. Sewage treatment, proper handwashing, and consumption of bottled water can be preventive. A. duodenale and N. americanus are hookworms that cause blood loss, anemia, pica, and wasting. Finding eggs in the feces is diagnostic. Treatments include albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, iron supplementation, and blood transfusion. Preventive measures include wearing shoes and treating sewage. E. histolytica can cause intestinal ulcerations, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, fever, gastrointestinal obstruction, and peritonitis. Amebas can cause abscesses in the liver that may rupture into the pleural space, peritoneum, or pericardium. Stool and serologic assays, biopsy, barium studies, and liver imaging have diagnostic merit. Therapy includes luminal and tissue amebicides to attack both life-cycle stages. Metronidazole, chloroquine, and aspiration are treatments for liver abscess. Careful sanitation and use of peeled foods and bottled water are preventive.

### Guideline: preventive chemotherapy to control soil-transmitted helminth infections in at-risk population groups [^117VNqyn]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2017). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of mebendazole PO (also known as Vermox, Emverm) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. The WHO guidelines recommend preventive deworming with single-dose albendazole (400 mg) or mebendazole (500 mg) as a public health intervention to reduce the worm burden of hookworm and Trichuris trichiura infection in pregnant women, after the first trimester, living in areas where both the baseline prevalence of hookworm and/or Trichuris trichiura infection is ≥ 20% among pregnant women and anemia is a severe public health problem, with a prevalence of ≥ 40% among pregnant women. The drug mebendazole PO (also known as Vermox, Emverm) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

Why it is important to do this review

Ascariasis remains a neglected disease despite its global distribution and the high number of infected individuals. It is still one of the most prevalent STH in the world. A lumbricoides, like other helminth infections, can affect the immune system and alter susceptibility to other parasitic diseases, such as malaria. The potential interaction between STH and malaria is complex. Previous studies suggest that large‐scale deworming programmes can have a protective effect on malaria morbidity in children (Stelekati 2012). One systematic review and meta‐analysis suggested that STH infection is associated with an increased prevalence and density of asymptomatic/uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection but with a decreased occurrence of anaemia (Degarege 2016).

The main goals of deworming programmes are to reduce the number of people who have heavy infections; reduce environmental contamination and risk of infection for other people; reduce micronutrient loss (e.g. iron loss through intestinal bleeding in hookworm infection); and improve nutritional status, cognitive functions, and learning abilities (WHO 2011).

Some specialists believe that wide‐scale administration of anthelmintic drugs will exert increasing drug pressure on parasite populations and favour parasite genotypes resistant to anthelmintic drugs (Vercruysse 2011a). Occurrence of resistance to anthelmintic drugs in nematode populations has been described in veterinary medicine. It highlights the potential for selecting drug‐resistant worms when chemotherapy programmes are widely adopted (Wolstenholme 2004). For example, reduction in the efficacy of mebendazole compared with historical controls has been documented in studies in Vietnam (Flohr 2007).

The WHO has highlighted the need to closely monitor anthelmintic drug efficacy (Vercruysse 2011a). Currently, there have been few research‐based studies about anthelmintic drugs, a very limited number of drugs that do not meet all needs in terms of efficacy, and there are no new anthelmintic drugs in late‐stage development (Geary 2010).

### Effects of deworming during pregnancy on maternal and perinatal outcomes in entebbe, Uganda: a randomized controlled trial [^114yTKw5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Helminth infections during pregnancy may be associated with adverse outcomes, including maternal anemia, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality. Deworming during pregnancy has therefore been strongly advocated, but its benefits have not been rigorously evaluated.

Methods

In Entebbe, Uganda, 2507 pregnant women were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating albendazole and praziquantel in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Hematinics and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for presumptive treatment of malaria were provided routinely. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were recorded. Analyses were by intention to treat.

Results

At enrollment, 68% of women had helminths, 45% had hookworm, 18% had Schistosoma mansoni infection; 40% were anemic (hemoglobin level, < 11.2 g/dL). At delivery, 35% were anaemic; there was no overall effect of albendazole (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–1.15) or praziquantel (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83–1.21) on maternal anemia, but there was a suggestion of benefit of albendazole among women with moderate to heavy hookworm (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21–0.98; p = 0.15 for interaction). There was no effect of either anthelminthic treatment on mean birth weight (difference in mean associated with albendazole: -0.00 kg; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.04 kg; difference in mean associated with praziquantel: -0.01 kg; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.04 kg) or on proportion of low birth weight. Anthelminthic use during pregnancy showed no effect on perinatal mortality or congenital anomalies.

Conclusions

In our study area, where helminth prevalence was high but infection intensity was low, there was no overall effect of anthelminthic use during pregnancy on maternal anemia, birth weight, perinatal mortality, or congenital anomalies. The possible benefit of albendazole against anemia in pregnant women with heavy hookworm infection warrants further investigation.

### Schistosoma japonicum reinfection after praziquantel treatment causes anemia associated with inflammation [^113zvzzv]. Infection and Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

There is a relationship between schistosomiasis and anemia, although the magnitude and exact mechanisms involved are unclear. In a cohort of 580 Schistosoma japonicum-infected 7- to 30-year-old patients from Leyte, The Philippines, we evaluated the impact of reinfection with S. japonicum after treatment with praziquantel on the mean hemoglobin level, iron-deficiency (IDA) and non-iron-deficiency anemia (NIDA), and inflammatory markers. All participants were treated at baseline and followed up every 3 months for a total of 18 months. At each follow-up, participants provided stools to quantify reinfection and venous blood samples for hemograms and measures of iron status and inflammation. After 18 months, reinfection with S. japonicum was associated with a lower mean hemoglobin level (-0.39 g/dl; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -0.63 to -0.16) and 1.70 (95% CI, 1.10 to 2.61) times higher odds of all-cause anemia than those without reinfection. Reinfection was associated with IDA for high reinfection intensities only. Conversely, reinfection was associated with NIDA for all infection intensities. Reinfection was associated with serum interleukin-6 responses (P < 0.01), and these responses were associated with NIDA (P = 0.019) but not with IDA (P = 0.29). Our results provide strong evidence for the causal relationship between S. japonicum infection and anemia. Rapidly reinfected individuals did not have the positive treatment effect on hemoglobin seen in nonreinfected individuals. The principle mechanism involved in S. japonicum-associated anemia is that of proinflammatory cytokine-mediated anemia, with iron deficiency playing a role in high-intensity infections. Based on the proposed mechanism, anemia is unlikely to be ameliorated by iron therapy alone.

### Factors associated with the use of deworming drugs during pregnancy in tanzania; an analysis from the 2015–16 Tanzanian HIV and malaria indicators survey [^116hKHgB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

In Tanzania, deworming by mebendazole 500 mg for all pregnant women attending ANC across the country remains routine in ANC. However, while preconception anaemia remains a challenge in Tanzania, and the overall prevalence of anaemia among women of reproductive age increased from 40% in 2010 to 45% in 2015–16, it remains higher among pregnant women (57%) compared to both breastfeeding mothers (46%) and women who are neither pregnant nor breastfeeding (43%). Among several other questions regarding this increased proportion of anaemia, is whether they truly use the deworming drugs given during their antenatal visits and the associated factors for the use. Therefore, this retrospective study was conducted to discover factors associated with the use of deworming drugs during pregnancy among women of reproductive age in Tanzania.

### The role of nutrition in integrated programs to control neglected tropical diseases [^111XaVYF]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recovery of nutritional status after treatment

The main method used to assess whether NTDs have an effect on human health or growth is to undertake randomized trials of treatment, although having untreated controls is now hard to justify. The effects of treatment on most nutritional outcomes is difficult to assess, mainly because drugs kill only worms, they do not provide the nutrients needed for catch-up growth, or for any other consequent deficit for that matter. For example, if hemoglobin is being lost because of hookworms or urinary schistosomiasis then stopping that loss with an anthelmintic drug does not have an effect on the manufacture of hemoglobin in the bone marrow, that rate is mainly dependent on the quality and quantity of the diet to provide nutrients for hemopoiesis. A relative deficiency of even one micronutrient may be rate-limiting, which might explain why some studies of giving iron supplements alone to anemic people after deworming have found no effect on their hemoglobin concentration. It also means that studies which compare different anthelmintic treatments in terms of nutritional outcomes such as hemoglobin concentration must be done in the same communities, otherwise differences could be explained by the diet, not by the drug given.

As recovery occurs only slowly for chronically undernourished individuals if their diet is not improved, supplementary food or micronutrients are usually required. For example, a study of schoolchildren in Tanzania reported an increase in hemoglobin concentration of 3.6 g/L three months after children were treated with albendazole and praziquantel alone, but the children given supplements of iron and vitamin A in addition showed an increase of 22.1 g/L over the same period. It may also be possible to achieve catch-up growth: therapeutic feeding of Jamaican children treated for Trichuris dysentery syndrome found that they grew on average 10.9 cm/year after treatment, more than two standard deviations above the rate expected of children of the same height-for-age. If no nutritional supplements are given then the rate at which body weight or the hemoglobin concentration improves depends on the degree of deficit before treatment and the diet of the people treated, not just on the drug given and its efficacy.

### Efficacy and safety of a single dosea multiple dose regimen of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: a randomised, double-blind trial [^112TwKR1]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

A multiple dose (100 mg twice per day over three consecutive days) treatment of mebendazole is recommended globally and in Tanzania for individual treatment. However, surprisingly, only a few small studies have evaluated the multiple dose regimen of mebendazole. Moreover, results obtained varied considerably with cure rates (CRs) ranging from 31 to 100% and, therefore, did not allow drawing final treatment recommendations. Finally, only a single study evaluated both treatment arms in an open label trial design, more than 15 years ago. No high quality clinical trial conducted to date did a side-by-side comparison of multiple dose versus single dose treatment of mebendazole. Thus, the present trial is, to our knowledge, the first randomised, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a single dose (500 mg) to a multiple dose (six doses of 100 mg over three consecutive days twice per day) regimen of mebendazole against hookworm.

diepoxybutane and mitomycin. 3 Based on the presence of mutations in one of the FA genes, FA can be divided into 8 complementation groups, with each group having in common the cellular hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents. 4, 5 Complementation groups A, C, and G account for most patients with this disorder reported to the International Fanconi Anemia Registry. The IFAR was established at The Rockefeller University in 1982 to collect clinical and genetic information from patients with FA. Registration into the IFAR typically occurs at diagnosis, and includes information on congenital and hematologic abnormalities and any history of neoplasm development. Comprehensive attempts to obtain follow-up data are made periodically. 14 All reporting is voluntary and obtained with the consent of the patient or legal guardian.

The diagnosis of FA is confirmed for each patient registered in the IFAR by the assessment of chromosomal breakage induced by diepoxybutane in the peripheral blood lymphocytes, as described in detail elsewhere.
3. In the remaining 413 patients, complementation groups were not determined. These patients were grouped together and referred to as nontyped. Of the 754 patients, 601 developed the onset of bone marrow failure; 219 patients underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation during the study. The overall survival of the patient population ranged from 1 month to 49 years. Chemotherapy was rarely undertaken in patients with FA because of the known deleterious effects of myelosuppression in patients with a baseline bone marrow disorder.

Three patients underwent CTx during their treatment course; 1 patient underwent adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation, 1 underwent CTx as the primary treatment, and 1 was treated with a combination of methotrexate and XRT for recurrent disease. All 6 patients who underwent adjuvant XRT had associated complications, which were dose limiting in 3 patients. Early XRT-associated complications included thrombocytopenia, anemia, myelosuppression, and skin breakdown with ulcer formation, while late complications included tracheal and esophageal stenosis. Two patients died of severe myelosuppressive complications shortly after termination of XRT.

### Efficacy, safety and acceptability of a new chewable formulationthe solid tablet of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: an open-label, randomized controlled trial [^113zj42J]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Soil-transmitted helminthiases are caused by one of the four soil-transmitted helminths (STHs): Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus). Currently, these parasites infect almost 1.5 billion people worldwide, mostly in the tropics and subtropics. Annually, STH infections lead to an estimated 1.9 million disability-adjusted life years. The health burden of STH includes nutritional deficiencies, anaemia, physical and cognitive impairment in children and reduction in work performance in adulthood. Currently, STH infections are mainly controlled through preventive chemotherapy, the regular administration of mebendazole or albendazole to at-risk populations. However, the mebendazole tablets currently used are solid (non-chewable and hard to crush), which might be problematic for young children. The WHO's call for a more child-friendly formulation of mebendazole resulted in the development of a chewable strawberry-flavoured tablet by Johnson&Johnson (Vermox™) to effectively treat children > 1 years of age. A randomised, placebo-controlled trial testing the efficacy and safety of the chewable mebendazole reported good tolerability and cure rates (CRs) of 84% and 34% against A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, respectively, but could not draw any conclusion on the efficacy against hookworm. Moreover, the children's acceptability of this formulation has not yet been explored. Finally, to date, no head-to-head comparison with the current standard solid formulation of mebendazole has been conducted. Before the new formulation is provided to millions of children every year, solid evidence on its performance is required.

Formulation factors affecting dissolution rates and hence absorption and bioavailability are known to influence clinical outcomes. Indeed, a CR of 100% was reported for the chewable mebendazole in four hookworm infected children in the above mentioned Phase 2 study. We hypothesized that the chewable formulation of mebendazole has a higher efficacy against hookworm infections than the solid one, which shows a poor performance. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, acceptability and age-appropriateness of the two mebendazole formulations.

### Neglected parasitic infections: what every family physician needs to know [^111kTbw1]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Neglected parasitic infections, including Chagas disease, toxocariasis, cysticercosis, and toxoplasmosis, affect millions of persons in the United States. Relatively few resources have been devoted to surveillance, prevention, and treatment of these diseases. Chagas disease primarily affects Latin American immigrants and can cause heart failure and death if not treated. Immediate antiparasitic treatment is indicated for most patients with acute Chagas disease. Treatment is recommended for patients younger than 18 years who have chronic Chagas disease and is generally recommended for adults younger than 50 years who do not have advanced cardiomyopathy; treatment decisions for other patients should be made on an individual basis. Toxocariasis primarily affects children and can cause gastrointestinal, respiratory, and ophthalmologic disease. Treatment options include albendazole and mebendazole. Patients with ocular infection require referral to an ophthalmologist. Neurocysticercosis, a form of cysticercosis, is the most common infectious cause of seizures in some parts of the United States. Initial treatment should focus on symptom control. Humans generally acquire toxoplasmosis by eating undercooked contaminated meat or ingesting things that have been contaminated with cat feces. Congenital infection can result in miscarriage or adverse fetal effects. Treatment is recommended for immunosuppressed persons, pregnant women, and immunocompetent persons with severe symptoms.

### Profiling nonrecipients of mass drug administration for schistosomiasis and hookworm infections: a comprehensive analysis of praziquantel and albendazole coverage in community-directed treatment in Uganda [^112C38we]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

An estimated 207 and 576 million individuals, respectively, are infected with Schistosoma and hookworm species. The majority of schistosomiasis infections occur in childhood and, if left untreated, can cause irreversible disease in adulthood. These diseases include portal hypertension (caused by Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma japonicum) and bladder squamous cell carcinoma (caused by Schistosoma haematobium). Heavy hookworm infection intensity, which can be found in children but is most common in adults, can lead to iron deficiency anemia, protein malnutrition, and diarrhea.

Mass drug administration (MDA) is the mainstay of morbidity control for human helminthiases. MDA is the delivery, en masse, of free single-treatment preventive chemotherapies (PCs) in regular intervals to endemic populations. PCs are "preventive'" in that they successfully curtail morbidity and are safe to administer to uninfected individuals. Endemic areas are classified by rapid sampling, usually of children in primary schools, to assess infection prevalence. Schistosomiasis is treated with praziquantel (PZQ), and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are treated with albendazole (ALB) or mebendazole. Repeated annual or biannual treatments are necessary mainly because of susceptibility to reinfection after treatment. Coverage (the proportion of persons requiring and receiving PCs through MDA) was an estimated 16.88% among all individuals requiring treatment for schistosomiasis in 2012 and 30.63% among children needing PCs for STHs in 2011.

Risk Summary

The available published literature on mebendazole use in pregnant women has not reported a clear association between mebendazole and a potential risk of major birth defects or miscarriages [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated helminthic infection during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

In animal reproduction studies, adverse developmental effects (i.e., skeletal malformations, soft tissue malformations, decreased pup weight, embryolethality) were observed when mebendazole was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at single oral doses as low as 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.2-fold the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD)). Maternal toxicity was present at the highest of these doses [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risks

Untreated soil-transmitted helminth infections in pregnancy are associated with adverse outcomes including maternal iron deficiency anemia, low birth weight, neonatal and maternal death.

Human Data

Several published studies, including prospective pregnancy registries, case-control, retrospective cohort, and randomized controlled studies, have reported no association between mebendazole use and a potential risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Overall, these studies did not identify a specific pattern or frequency of major birth defects with mebendazole use. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any mebendazole-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including recall bias, confounding factors and, in some cases, small sample size or exclusion of first trimester mebendazole exposures.

### Effect of lymphatic filariasis and hookworm infection on pregnancy course and outcome in women living in the democratic republic of the Congo [^113Aze8u]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study was a retrospective observational study, but to assess more specifically the relationships between parasitic infections and pregnancy outcomes, prospective cohort studies are required. Examples of such studies are present in the literature: Christian et al.conducted a clinical trial of albendazole (zero, one, or two doses) among 4,998 pregnant women in Nepal coinfected by the three geohelminths (prevalence of HW: 47.5%). They assessed the proportion of severe anemia in the treated (one or two doses) and untreated groups and found that 20% of the women belonging to the latter suffered of severe anemia (hemoglobin < 70 g/L) versus 5% in the treated group. There was also evidence of an impact on infant mortality (i.e. mortality in the 6 months after birth), which was 14% lower in the one-dose group and 41% lower in the two-dose group than those in the untreated group. In a similar clinical trial conducted in 2006 in Peru among 1,042 women in the second trimester of pregnancy and coinfected by the three geohelminths, Larocque et al.compared the proportion of anemia in a group treated with placebo and iron supplementation and a group treated with mebendazole (500 mg) and iron supplementation. These authors did not observe a significant difference in anemia proportion at the third trimester, but this could be due to the iron supplementation provided to both groups. However, the study did show that the proportion of very low weight birth infants was higher in the placebo group than that in the mebendazole group. Although the results appear to be suggestive of impacts of geohelminths on adverse pregnancy outcomes, a limitation of both the studies described earlier is that the effect of STH infection on pregnancy outcome was assessed indirectly, through administration of anthelminthic treatment, rather than directly. A number of other parasites sensitive to the same treatments (Taenia spp. E. vermicularis, Strongyloides stercoralis…) and which frequently co-occur with STHs could therefore be implicated. To our knowledge, the only prospective cohort study exploring the direct implication of HW on the pregnancy outcomes is a Bolivian longitudinal 9-year study conducted in an area with high prevalence of HW. It showed that HW infection was associated with lower body mass index of the women, lower number of deliveries, and an older age at first pregnancy. Some cross-sectional studies have examined the occurrence of adverse pregnancy events according to the HW infection status. Two of the four published studies on the relationship between HW and infant mortality found an association, whereas the other two found no association. Results in the literature are similarly mixed for the relationship between HW infection and premature birth; Wanyonyi et al.and Asundep et al.found an association, whereas Mahande and Mahandedid not.

### Investigating environmental determinants of hookworm transmission using GPS tracking and metagenomics technologies [^115WhjSD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 500 million individuals residing in tropical regions of Africa, South America, and Asia are infected with hookworms, predominantly Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. The infections result in four million disability-adjusted life yearsand an estimated 139 billion USD in annual economic productivity losses. The primary clinical symptoms of hookworm disease include iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and protein malnutrition. Chronic infections and associated blood loss lead to low iron stores, which impairs physical and cognitive development in children and increases perinatal maternal/infant mortality in pregnant women.

To combat hookworm infection, mass drug administration (MDA) to at-risk populations with single-dose albendazole (400 mg) or mebendazole (500 mg), implementation of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices, and health education programs are recommended. As of 2016, 638.5 million people had been covered by MDA, which includes 69.5% of at-risk school-aged children and 50.8% of at-risk preschool-aged children globally. However, high rates of reinfection after drug treatment and the risk of emerging drug resistance pose major challenges to the long-term sustainability of deworming programs. Although these strategies have been associated with a reduced prevalence of hookworm infections, additional strategies are needed to interrupt transmission and achieve disease elimination by 2030.

### Efficacy and safety of a single dosea multiple dose regimen of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: a randomised, double-blind trial [^115y6Lfr]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Concerns have been raised that mebendazole resistance had developed in the setting of Pemba since reduced efficacy of this drug was observed. In more detail, treatment of hookworm infections resulted in significantly lower cure (7.6%) and ERR (52.1%) in 2003 than the ones reported before the beginning of periodic chemotherapy (CR = 22.4%, ERR = 82.4%). However, our findings clearly demonstrate that with using the recommended treatment regimen (which does not include dose intensification or dose density of chemotherapy, strategies commonly employed for example in the treatment of cancer) for mebendazole, high efficacy against hookworm can still be obtained and that speculations on drug resistance of mebendazole against hookworm should therefore be considered with caution. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the above mentioned strategies of dose intensification did not result in higher efficacy of mebendazole against soil-transmitted helminth infections. For example, RCTs evaluating the effect of 500 mg of mebendazole daily for 3 days (1500 mg in total) found CRs ranging of 26 to 59%. Thus, the higher dose does not seem to be the most important determinant driving the drug's effect.

Overall, the hookworm CR for single dose mebendazole we observed on Pemba Island (13%) is in line with results from RCTs conducted in the same setting, however is considerably lower than a CR of 33% calculated from 13 trials in a recent meta-analysis. This discrepancy between our results and the summary estimate by means of meta-analysis could be due to several factors such as the diagnostic method used, the parasite strain, or the study location: three of the four RCTs which reported CRs below 20% following a single dose of mebendazole against hookworm took place on Pemba Island. Another influencing factor could be study quality and the sample size: the two RCTs reporting highest CRs using the single dose had small sample sizes of 35 and 45 participants in the single dose mebendazole arms.

### Antihelminthics in helminth-endemic areas: effects on HIV disease progression [^1173LJfg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Given that a substantial number of individuals targeted by helminth control programmes may be exposed to or infected with HIV, it is important to establish the safety of deworming drugs in HIV‐positive populations and the potential for drug interactions, particularly as an increased incidence of drug reactions has been observed in patients with advanced HIV infection (Gordin 1984; Nunn 1991). Available data from a recent systematic review also suggested the potential for an interaction between both mebendazole and albendazole and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors appears low, although no formal pharmacokinetic studies exist. The review also reported that interactions may exist between praziquantel and protease inhibitors via enzyme inhibition (Seden 2013).

Since the publication of our initial Cochrane Review of this topic in 2009 (Walson 2009), deworming campaigns have been dramatically scaled up and it has become increasingly important to understand not only the effects of deworming on HIV disease progression but also the safety of treating these unique patient populations. In this update, we have expanded the scope of this Cochrane Review to include trials that evaluate the impact of deworming on anaemia and iron deficiency, as well as markers of HIV disease progression and safety.

### Efficacy and safety of a single dosea multiple dose regimen of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: a randomised, double-blind trial [^111PNiiv]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Single-dose mebendazole is widely used in preventive chemotherapy against the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura, yet it shows limited efficacy against hookworm and T. trichiura infections. The use of adapted treatment regimens might provide a strategy to control and eliminate STH infections in STH-persistent settings. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the multiple dose mebendazole regimen (3 days 100 mg bid) versus a single dose of 500 mg mebendazole in a setting with high STH prevalence and high drug pressure.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind clinical trial took place in a primary school on Pemba Island, Tanzania, in school-aged children (6–12 years). Using a computer random number generator (block size 10), hookworm-positive children were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a single or multiple dose regimen of mebendazole by an independent statistician. Two stool samples were collected at baseline and follow-up (18 to 22 days after treatment) for Kato-Katz analysis. The primary outcome was cure rate (CR) against hookworm. Secondary outcomes were egg reduction rate (ERR) against hookworm, CRs and ERRs against A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, and tolerability assessed 3, 24 and 48 h post-treatment. Participants, investigators, caregivers, outcome assessors and the trial statistician were blinded. This trial is registered with, number.

Findings

93 children were assigned to each treatment arm. 185 children completed treatment and provided follow-up stool samples. CR against hookworm was significantly higher in the multiple dose (98%) than in the single dose arm (13%, OR 389.1, 95% CI 95.2 to 2885.7%, p < 0.001). 34 and 42 children reported mild adverse events in the single and multiple dose arms, respectively. The most common events were abdominal pain, headache and diarrhoea.

Interpretation

The poor performance of single dose mebendazole against hookworm infections was confirmed, but the multiple dose treatment regimen of mebendazole showed high efficacy. Hence, multiple dose mebendazole might provide a treatment strategy in given epidemiological situations to boost control and elimination of STH infections.

### Could a simple antenatal package combining micronutritional supplementation with presumptive treatment of infection prevent maternal deaths in sub-saharan Africa? [^116Y8M6L]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Puerperal sepsis

The inclusion of presumptive treatment of genitourinary infection, and its estimated impact on puerperal sepsis, is likely to raise concerns about resistance to antibiotics. The data from Kenya strongly suggested a beneficial effect of mass anti-microbial treatment in pregnancy where sexually transmitted infections are highly prevalent. In the fourteen years since this trial was conducted, new antibiotics have become available. Azithromycin, for example, has demonstrated efficacy against chlamydia, gonorrhoea, chancroid, incubating syphilis, mycoplasma, and possibly bacterial vaginosis, and appears to be without teratogenic risk. Azithromycin has been used for mass treatment of other infections, and has demonstrated efficacy against P falciparum and P vivax. Three trials conducted since the Cochrane review have provided further evidence, at least for perinatal outcomes, of the benefits of prophylactic antibiotics in pregnancy.

WHO currently recommends a range of anti-microbials for treatment of genitourinary infections during pregnancy, some prescribed over several days. It is widely acknowledged that current strategies for treating genitourinary infection among pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa are failing, and that new approaches are needed. A successful strategy could also contribute to the prevention of HIV transmission. However, because of the likely controversy, we would advocate for a large-scale trial to establish the efficacy and safety of this strategy in settings where the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections is high.

Anemia

We have based our estimate on the effects of anti-malarial treatment and iron supplementation. Although the benefits of intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) are greatest among women of low parity, it has been suggested that IPT should be provided to all pregnant women in areas of high HIV prevalence because HIV-positive multigravidae are at similar risk of severe malaria as HIV-positive primigravidae.

Nutritional deficiencies are compounded by other infections, principally hookworm. Pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori may also play a major role. Some of the maternal deaths caused by anemia, which were attributable neither to malaria nor to iron deficiency, might be prevented through a combination of multiple micronutrient supplementation and presumptive treatment of parasitic and bacterial infection. Albendazole has been shown to reduce the decline in haemoglobin during pregnancy, but there is no conclusive evidence for an effect of vitamin A or other micronutrients on anemia during pregnancy, particularly when compared with iron and folate supplementation.

### Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis [^112vYuch]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Ascaris lumbricoides is a common infection, and mainly affects children living in low‐income areas. Water and sanitation improvement, health education, and drug treatment may help break the cycle of transmission, and effective drugs will reduce morbidity.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of anthelmintic drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, ivermectin) for treating people with Ascaris infection.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, three other databases, and reference lists of included studies, without language restrictions, up to 4 July 2019.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin in children and adults with confirmed Ascaris infection.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from the included trials. A third review author checked the quality of data extraction. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to determine the risk of bias in included trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare dichotomous outcomes in treatment and control groups. We used the fixed‐effect model for studies with low heterogeneity and the random‐effects model for studies with moderate to high heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the control rate average to provide illustrative cure rates in the comparison groups.

Main results

We included 30 parallel‐group RCTs, which enrolled 6442 participants from 17 countries across Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, and South America. Participants were from 28 days to 82 years of age, recruited from school, communities, and health facilities. Twenty studies were funded or co‐funded by manufacturers, while 10 studies were independent of manufacturer funding. Twenty‐two trials had a high risk of bias for one or two domains (blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting).

Single dose of albendazole (four trials), mebendazole (three trials) or ivermectin (one trial) was compared to placebo. Parasitological cure at 14 to 60 days was high in all the studies (illustrative cure of 93.0% in the anthelmintic group and 16.1% in the placebo group; RR 6.29, 95% CI 3.91 to 10.12; 8 trials, 1578 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Single dose of albendazole is as effective as multiple doses of albendazole (illustrative cure of 93.2% with single dose, 94.3% with multiple doses; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05; 3 trials, 307 participants; high‐certainty evidence); or as single dose of mebendazole (illustrative cure of 98.0% with albendazole, 96.9% with mebendazole; RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02; 6 trials, 2131 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Studies did not detect a difference between a single dose of albendazole and a single dose of ivermectin (cure rates of 87.8% with albendazole, 90.2% with ivermectin; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.08; 3 trials, 519 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Across all the studies, failure after single dose of albendazole ranged from 0.0% to 30.3%, mebendazole from 0.0% to 22.2%, and ivermectin from 0.0% to 21.6%.

The egg reduction rate (ERR) measured up to 60 days after the treatment was high in all treated groups, regardless of the anthelmintic used (range 96% to 100%). It was not possible to evaluate parasitological cure by classes of infection intensity.

No included trials reported complication or serious adverse events. Other adverse events were apparently similar among the compared anthelmintic groups (moderate‐ to low‐certainty evidence). The most commonly reported other adverse events were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache, and fever.

Authors' conclusions

Single‐dose of albendazole, mebendazole, and ivermectin all appeared effective against Ascaris lumbricoides infection, yielding high parasitological cure and large reductions in eggs excreted, with no differences detected between them. The drugs appear to be safe to treat children and adults with confirmed Ascaris infection. There is little to choose between drugs and regimens in terms of cure or adverse events.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^112anPn6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hydatid cysts medical, percutaneous, and surgical therapy indicates that medical therapy consists of chemotherapy with anthelmintic drugs, albendazole or mebendazole, with studies indicating the former as the superior agent, and is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture to prevent risk of recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, with the risk of anaphylaxis with percutaneous drainage mitigated by initiating medical therapy first; an important change in medical therapy is that cyclical regimens are no longer recommended, and because albendazole can cause hepatic dysfunction and granulocytopenia patients should be monitored regularly with white cell counts and liver function tests; percutaneous or surgical approaches are recommended for large cysts (> 5 cm), for cysts likely to rupture, for cysts not responding to medical therapy, or for patients with contraindications to medical therapy, with puncture, aspiration, injection of scolicidal agent, and reaspiration with adjunct anthelmintic therapy an effective alternative to surgery, although this is contraindicated in biliary fistulas or cysts communicating with the biliary tree, complex multiseptated cysts, or percutaneously inaccessible cysts; surgical approaches aim for cyst removal and cavity obliteration and may range from simple cyst resection to radical cystectomy, and hepatic resection may be warranted in some instances to remove all the hydatid disease.

### Efficacy, safety and acceptability of a new chewable formulationthe solid tablet of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: an open-label, randomized controlled trial [^115bkKyW]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We evaluated, for the first time, the safety and efficacy of the new mebendazole formulation, which will be used in millions of children, against hookworm and concomitant STH infections using the current standard mebendazole as a side-by side comparator. Additionally, for the first time, we observed and interviewed participants to assess whether one of the formulations was more accepted than the other.

The chewable and solid tablets performed similarly with respect to efficacy and safety. Regarding safety, our results were similar to those of a safety trial which also took place on Pemba Island, Tanzania. Surprisingly, the new product specifications such as dissolution or disintegration seem to have, therefore, no influence on efficacy. The only other published study testing the efficacy of the chewable formulation versus placebo found a slightly lower CR against A. lumbricoides (84%, vs 95% in our study) than we did and a considerably higher CR against T. trichiura (34%, vs 10% in our study). These discrepancies could be due to the higher proportion of participants with moderate/heavy infections in our study, which are more refractory to treatment. In the previous study, only four participants were infected with hookworm in the active treatment arm, and all four were cured (in contrast to a CR of 13% in our study), which could be due to their low sample size. Nonetheless, the efficacy observed in our study is in line with a recent meta-analysis, and reconfirms that mebendazole shows only a poor performance against T. trichiura and hookworm infections.

### Efficacy and safety of a single dosea multiple dose regimen of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: a randomised, double-blind trial [^114jtmhc]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

An estimated 472 million people are infected with hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus). Hookworm disease burden is mainly associated with anaemia, which can cause both physical and intellectual growth retardation among preschool- and school-aged children. In 2016, 1.6 million DALYs were estimated to be caused by hookworm infections, leading to annual productivity losses of up to US$139 billion.

Currently, the control of hookworm and other soil-transmitted helminths is based on periodic deworming (so called preventive chemotherapy) of school-aged children and other high-risk groups by regularly administering a single dose of either albendazole (400 mg) or mebendazole (500 mg). Both drugs are highly effective against Ascaris lumbricoides but show poor performance against Trichuris trichiura when administered as a single dose. Moreover, based on a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis, a single dose of albendazole shows acceptable efficacy against hookworm (CR = 80%), while a single dose of mebendazole fails to clear most of these infections (CR = 33%). The main anthelmintic drugs available to the control programmes are, therefore, variably efficacious depending on the drug and parasite. Additionally, there are worries that drug resistance will emerge, a problem commonly described in veterinary medicine. With preventive chemotherapy being the predominant tool for helminthiasis control, it might not be surprising that soil-transmitted helminthiasis persists in many settings. As an example, recent studies on Pemba Island reported that prevalence of hookworm continues to range at high levels from 36 to 97%, despite regular treatment of school-aged children. Therefore, additional strategies are required to control and eliminate soil-transmitted helminth infections, including access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as adapted treatment regimens, such as optimised dosing or combination chemotherapy which would improve drug therapy.

### Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment for children with anaemia [^115zLeAw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Malaria causes anaemia mainly by destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis) (Looareesuwan 1987) but also by causing an increase in the splenic pool of red blood cells and decreased production of red blood cells (Crawley 2004; Phillips 1992). Acute loss of red blood cells may lead to severe anaemia. Chronic anaemia can slow growth and result in learning difficulties and behavioural changes in affected children (Grantham‐McGregor 2001; Lozoff 1991).

The symptoms of anaemia vary according to the severity, the age of the affected person, and whether the anaemia is acute or chronic. People with anaemia report fatigue, shortness of breath and palpitations. Clinical signs include paleness of the mucosal linings, such as the tongue, conjunctiva, palm and nail bed (Kalter 1997). Although palm pallor is commonly used for classification of disease in children (Meremikwu 2009), diagnosis of anaemia is based on laboratory tests. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined anaemia in pre‐school aged children as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 11 g/dL (WHO 2008) and severe anaemia, often a complication of severe malaria, as a Hb concentration of less than 5 g/dL (WHO 2000). In a study assessing the short and long term outcome of severe anaemia in Malawian children, children hospitalized and treated for severe anaemia had a significantly higher mortality rate (in‐hospital and post‐discharge) than children who were seen in hospital for other conditions and those from the community (Phiri 2008). Furthermore, researchers estimate that severe anaemia probably accounts for more than half of all childhood deaths from malaria in Africa (Crawley 2004). Children who are affected may need to be admitted to hospital and may need blood transfusions (Obonyo 2007).

A Cochrane Review has shown that long lasting insecticide‐treated net (LLIN) use was highly effective in reducing childhood mortality and morbidity from malaria and had a positive effect on anaemia in children (Lengeler 2009). These vector control strategies are a core component of the malaria control programmes globally and especially in Africa (WHO 2012a). Other measures to prevent anaemia include prompt and effective treatment of malaria infections, intestinal helminths and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), increased use of measures to prevent mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV and provision of micronutrient supplementation (Balarajan 2011; Crawley 2004).

### Deworming drugs for soil-transmitted intestinal worms in children: effects on nutritional indicators, haemoglobin, and school performance [^116WT8kV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Given the amount of investment of public money in these programmes, it is important to be clear whether mass or targeted drug administration is able to contribute to health and development in such a substantive way. Indeed, international donors and developed country governments and tax payers are contributing to the efforts to tackle STH infections in the belief that they will improve the health of children in the way that the WHO claims. For example, Deworm the World has worked with the Indian Government to treat 140 million children across India in 2015 on the basis of the Copenhagen Consensus Statement.

Thus, this systematic review of reliable evidence from RCTs will help clarify whether existing evidence supports the conclusion that there is an impact of these drugs in populations with STH infections (ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm) and will evaluate the strength of the evidence.

History of this Cochrane Review

Previous editions of this Cochrane Review have generated considerable debate.

Early on the debate was around medical outcomes, such as anaemia. More recently there has been a shift in focus from short‐term impacts of deworming to potential longer‐term developmental impacts (Figure 1). Indeed, Givewell suggests that the most compelling case for deworming as a cost‐effective intervention comes from "the possibility that deworming children has a subtle, lasting impact on their [children's] development, and thus on their ability to be productive and successful throughout life", but further comments that "empirical evidence on this matter is very limited". There have been some recent observational analyses with long‐term follow‐up of dewormed children which were considered during this update. None of these trials met the inclusion criteria of this review (described in the Characteristics of excluded studies section).

### Efficacy and safety of a single dosea multiple dose regimen of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: a randomised, double-blind trial [^114jF94z]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

3 Results

364 consenting participants were screened for hookworm. 354 children provided two baseline stool samples. Of these, 206 were found hookworm positive and were invited for the clinical and physical examination. Two children were excluded because they had haemoglobin levels below 8.0 g/dl and 18 were absent from school on the clinical and physical examination day. The remaining 186 children were present for treatment and 93 participants were randomly allocated to each treatment arm. One child from the single dose of mebendazole arm was lost to follow-up because he/she was not on Pemba Island during the follow-up period. With the exception of 11 children, who provided the second baseline stool sample between six and 19 days after the first sample, both stool samples from all other children were collected within a five-day window. All remaining 185 participants who provided follow-up stool samples were included in the available case analysis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Trial profile.

At the second treatment time point, two children's envelopes were swapped. Therefore, by the end of the six-treatment time points, one child had erroneously received 100 mg of mebendazole in addition to the single dose of 500 mg of mebendazole plus placebo and the other child received only five doses instead of six doses of 100 mg of mebendazole plus 100 mg of placebo. These two subjects were included in the available case analysis but excluded from the per protocol analysis (n = 183) (Appendices 1 and 2). Appendix 3 presents the results of the analysis using the intention-to-treat population (n = 186).

The treatment arms were balanced according to age, sex, weight, height, and hookworm baseline infection intensity (Table 1). During the physical examination, three children were found to have Tinea capitis, one child reported having asthma and one sickle cell anaemia. These children were not excluded.

### Enhancing nutrition and antenatal infection treatment (ENAT) study: protocol of a pragmatic clinical effectiveness study to improve birth outcomes in Ethiopia [^1173MdCi]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Parasitic intestinal infections

In settings of high geohelminth burden, WHO recommends prophylactic deworming in second and third trimester of pregnancy. At study initiation, mebendazole (500 mg) was provided two times in pregnancy consistent with WHO guidelines. Due to health provider concerns regarding medication package insert information contraindicating use in early pregnancy, in September 2020, the protocol was modified to a single presumptive deworming in the third trimester. In May 2021, with the adoption of new Ethiopian FMOH ANC guidelines allowing earlier provision of antihelminthics in pregnancy, the ENAT protocol was modified to provide presumptive deworming in the second trimester followed by a stool screening and treatment at least 4 weeks later. In the first post-deworming visit, stool is screened for intestinal parasites in the health centre laboratory using wet mount microscopy available at the health centre. Women identified with parasitic infections are treated as per FMOH recommendations (online supplemental web table 4).

Randomisation/allocation

At the first level of randomisation, clusters (ie, health centres) are randomised into one of two nutrition interventions: (a) ENP or (b) standard nutrition care. We performed a constrained randomisation to ensure balance across the two arms of the study for key indicators including: population size, pre-study ANC coverage rates, number of births and travel time to the regional centre of Bahir Dar. We: (1) set reasonable tolerance levels for the restriction variables, (2) created all possible random sequences, where each sequence allocated six health centres to the ENAT Nutrition Package and six health centres to routine care, (3) assessed each sequence as to whether or not it met these restriction criteria and (4) chose randomly from the subset of all such allocation sequences that met the criteria. At the second level of randomisation, we randomised individual pregnant women presenting for ANC at each health centre to receive (a) ENAT EIMP, or (b) standard infection care (figure 2). Each health centre received a pre-generated randomisation list of sequential individual assignments to EIMP or standard care, where assignments were equally allocated to each arm within randomly permuted blocks of size 4, 8 or 12. The randomisation lists were generated separately, by health centre, using a script written by one of the authors (LCM) in R.

### Iron supplementation and deworming during pregnancy reduces the risk of anemia and stunting in infants less than 2 years of age: a study from sub-saharan Africa [^112yhahu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Exposure variables and potential confounding factors

The 'Iron supplementation (with or without deworming)' variable was classified as yes or no depending on whether women took iron tablets or syrup during their most recent pregnancy. To investigate the impact of the number of days of iron intake on the outcomes, a variable was constructed. 'Number of days of iron intake' was defined as all women who had given birth in the previous two years and had taken iron tablets or syrup for at least two days during their past pregnancy, regardless of whether they received deworming medication. There were four categories for the variable: none, less than 60, 60 to 90, and more than 90 days of intake. The variable 'Deworming (with or without iron supplementation)' was classified as yes or no depending on whether women received deworming medication during their most recent pregnancy. Deworming treatment (Albendazole or Mebendazole) targets soil-transmitted helminthiases, of which the most common species infecting humans are Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm) and Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus (hookworms). In addition, the variable "Iron supplementation and/or deworming" was added to explore the combined effect of iron and deworming on the study outcomes. It was defined as any women who took iron supplements alone (without deworming), deworming alone (without iron supplementation), or both (indicating those who received both iron supplements plus deworming medication), and was divided into four categories: none, iron supplementation alone, deworming alone, and iron supplementation plus deworming.

The covariates and potential confounders considered were the mother's age (15–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49), Currently in union (Not in union, In union), Type of place of residence (Urban, Rural), Highest educational level (No education, Primary, Secondary, Higher), Wealth index (Poorest, Poorer, Middle, Richer, Richest), Number of ANC visits (None, < 4, ≥ 4, don't know/missing), Improved Water Source (unimproved surface water, improved water), Sex of infants (Male, Female) and infant's age in months.

### Efficacy and safety of a single dosea multiple dose regimen of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: a randomised, double-blind trial [^115JR2Vx]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Our study showed that the multiple dose of mebendazole was also considerably more effective against T. trichiura infections than the single 500 mg dose. Not only CRs were higher (CR = 42.9% versus CR = 6.8% respectively) but moderate infection intensities were less commonly observed in the multiple dose arm. Our results for the multiple dose regimen against T. trichiura are in line with previous studies conducted in Papua New Guinea and Brazil (CR = 65% and CR = 39%). However, similarly to what we found for the efficacy on hookworm, our results for the single dose were markedly lower than summary estimates reported by Moser and colleagues (CR = 42%).

Unlike the other two parasites, a multiple dose of mebendazole does not present an advantage against A. lumbricoides infections over a single mebendazole dose.

Overall, both mebendazole treatments were well tolerated. Interestingly, available data on adverse events following multiple mebendazole doses is sparse. None of the three RCTs which tested the efficacy of the multiple dose mebendazole regimen documented information on adverse events. Headache, abdominal pain or diarrhoea were most commonly reported in both treatment arms, which is in line with previous studies exploring the efficacy and safety of 500 mg mebendazole. In the current study, we found a sudden increase in the number of adverse events 48 h after the last treatment which is rather unexpected due to the short half-life of mebendazole (in the range of 2–9 h). For comparison, Speich et al. assessed adverse events at 3, 24, 27 and 48 h post-treatment following a single dose of mebendazole and found the peak number of symptoms at 24 h. It is important to highlight that the same trend was observed in both treatment arms (hence 48 h and 96 h after the last active treatment), which suggests that this finding might not be triggered by the treatment but rather by differences in the reporting.

### Predicting the risk and speed of drug resistance emerging in soil-transmitted helminths during preventive chemotherapy [^111cDz8s]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) constitute a diverse group of nematode species that are transmitted via faecal contamination of the environment and infect approximately one billion people globally. STH infections cause intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anaemia, and protein malnutrition, especially in heavily infected individuals and high-risk populations with low iron reserves such as children and women of reproductive age. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore targeted STH to be controlled in high-risk populations by 2030. Long-term control or even elimination of STH is expected to require improved access to water, hygiene and sanitation. In the short term, control of STH relies heavily on regular large-scale deworming of high-risk groups with mebendazole or albendazole, which are both benzimidazole derivatives. Deworming is implemented as preventive chemotherapy (PC), meaning that all treatment-eligible individuals in endemic populations are offered treatment, without individual diagnosis. As such, the development of benzimidazole resistance would present a severe threat to the effectiveness of control programmes and the health gains achieved thus far. The risk of benzimidazole resistance among STH is considered to be real –, primarily because benzimidazole resistance is widespread in intestinal helminths of small ruminants, and cattle, which are also controlled by means of regular deworming. For STH in humans, suboptimal responses and genetic selection effects have been reported. but without conclusive evidence of resistance.

### Iron supplementation and deworming during pregnancy reduces the risk of anemia and stunting in infants less than 2 years of age: a study from sub-saharan Africa [^112MtjBf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The nutritional health of the woman, especially before and during pregnancy, is essential for the proper development of the infant. The mother's diet must provide the appropriate nutrients for the harmonious development of the fetus and the infant throughout the first year of life. Iron deficiency accounts for nearly half of all maternal anemia cases worldwide, with the highest proportion occurring in Africa. The main causes of iron deficiency are inadequate intake (e.g. low iron diet), increased iron requirements (e.g. during pregnancy), and chronic blood loss (e.g. severe hookworm infection). In 2019, approximately 45.8% of pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa were anemic. And more than 2 million people in the world are currently suffering from human helminth infections. As part of prenatal care, the World Health Organization (WHO) had set standards of daily intake for iron at 30–60 mg and folic acid at 400 g to decrease the risk of maternal and neonatal anemia and adverse birth outcomes. In addition, a single dose of Albendazole (400 mg) or Mebendazole (500 mg) after the first trimester of pregnancy was strongly recommended for women living in areas with a high risk of worm infection. Since then, daily iron supplementation and deworming treatment (DWM) have become an integral part of antenatal care (ANC) practices in sub-Saharan African countries. Anemia in women during pregnancy has been reported to increase the risk of infant stunting, childhood anemia and low birth weight. In Africa, stunting, childhood anemia, and low birth weight remain a public health problem to this day. The prevalence of stunting in infants under five years of age was 41% in 2020, anemia in infants was 60.2% in 2019, and low birth weight was 13.7% in 2019. Iron supplementation has been shown to reduce the incidence of stunting, low birth weight and childhood anemia. But some studies have not found such a relationship between prenatal iron supplementation and low birth weight or stunting in infants. However, it is unclear whether prenatal iron supplementation and/or deworming medications can reduce the risk of stunting, low birth weight, and anemia in infants younger than 2 years of age. Therefore, we used nationally representative surveys to investigate the association between prenatal iron supplementation and/or deworming medications and stunting, anemia, and low birth weight in infants under two years of age in sub-Saharan Africa.

### The impact of enhancing nutrition and antenatal infection treatment on birth outcomes in amhara, Ethiopia: a pragmatic factorial, cluster-randomised clinical effectiveness study [^116CRaQt]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Enhanced infection management package

Women provided a mid-void clean catch urine sample for urine culture and a self-collected mid-vaginal swab for chlamydia/gonorrhoea testing (Xpert CT/NG assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, USA)) performed at APHI. Women who reported vaginal symptoms were tested at the health centre with point-of-care tests for Trichomonas (OSOM, Sekisui Diagnostics, Lexington, Massachusetts, USA) and bacterial vaginosis (BVBLUE, Gryphus Diagnostics, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA). Genitourinary tract infections were classified, managed and treated according to protocols consistent with MoH guidelines (online supplemental table S2, figures S2–S4). Women with identified infections were contacted and advised to return for treatment with the first antibiotic dose directly observed, and a test of cure at the following routine ANC visit. Deworming with mebendazole (500 mg) was provided twice in pregnancy (second and third trimester) consistent with WHO guidelines. At the mid-enrolment study monitoring committee (SMC) review (May 2021), UTI/sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening-treatment was discontinued given the low infection prevalence and supply chain shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, given the low coverage of the two deworming doses, the SMC recommended modifying the study protocol to a first dose of mebendazole followed by third trimester stool microscopy screening and treatment (online supplemental table S3).

Outcome measures

Outcomes were measured by trained research staff and case definitions are detailed in online supplemental table S4.

The primary study outcomes were newborn weight and length measured within 72 hours of birth.

Secondary outcomes included duration of gestation, proportion of pregnancies resulting in spontaneous preterm delivery, proportion of newborns born preterm, proportion of newborns born LBW, proportion of newborns born SGA, stillbirth rate, newborn weight-for-age z-scores, newborn length-for-age z-scores, newborn head circumference and maternal anaemia.

### Efficacy, safety and acceptability of a new chewable formulationthe solid tablet of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: an open-label, randomized controlled trial [^1123u1fe]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3 Results

This trial took place between July 12, 2019, and October 9, 2019. We screened a total of 1524 children for hookworm infections. 1465 provided two stool samples and, of these, 500 were positive for hookworm. 81% (407/500) fulfilled the minimum parasitological eligibility criteria (EPG > 50 and more than one egg positive slide). Nine children did not show up for treatment and one was excluded due to the presence of sickle cell anaemia. A total of 397 children were randomised, including one hookworm negative child erroneously randomised. 199 and 198 children were assigned to the chewable and solid tablet arm, respectively. Three children were lost to follow-up, as they were absent from school. Of note, two children provided one stool sample delayed (up to 28 days after treatment), and two other children only provided one follow-up sample. There were no protocol deviations from the treatment protocol; therefore, the per-protocol and available case population are identical. 393 children were included in the analysis (the per protocol and available case population were identical) (Fig. 1).

### Efficacy and safety of a single dosea multiple dose regimen of mebendazole against hookworm infections in children: a randomised, double-blind trial [^115X3VTY]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

Preventive chemotherapy is the mainstay of helminthiases control, since it remains among the most cost-effective global public health control measures. Albendazole and mebendazole, which are variably efficacious against the different soil-transmitted helminths, are the most widely used drugs. We were interested in learning whether treatment efficacy could be improved by an adapted treatment regimen in a setting such as Pemba Island which, even though community members have been receiving treatment once or twice a year for 25 years, is still characterised by intense helminth transmission and persisting high prevalence rates. Using a double-blind trial design we evaluated the multiple dose (3 day, 6 dose course) treatment of mebendazole, which is recommended globally and in Tanzania for individual treatment, versus the single dose regimen widely used for population-based treatment.

We found clear evidence that the multiple, six-dose treatment schedule of mebendazole is significantly more effective at curing hookworm infections than a single dose of mebendazole. In our trial, only 13% of children were cured after a 500 mg single dose of mebendazole. On the other hand, the multiple dose regimen of mebendazole cured almost all hookworm-infected children (CR = 98%) which is in agreement with exploratory studies in the early 1970s. To our knowledge, only four RCTs, conducted in Iran, Thailand, Brazil and Papua New Guinea, assessed the effect of the multiple dose mebendazole on hookworm infections. In these studies, CRs ranged from 35 to 94%. Although these studies reported different baseline infection intensities, there seems to be no correlation between the intensity of infection and CRs.

2 Methods

2.1 Study design

This randomised superiority parallel trial took place on Pemba Island, Tanzania. The study was conducted in four kindergarten and primary schools. Ethical approval was obtained from the Zanzibar Heath Research Ethics Committee (ZAHREC, no. ZAHREC/02/APR/2019/19) and from the Ethics Committee of Northern and Central Switzerland (EKNZ, no. 2019–00,351).

The trial protocol and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information.

2.2 Participants

We recorded the name, age, sex and school grade of potentially eligible children. Caregivers of children attending the schools and aged 3–12 years were invited for information sessions where a study staff member orally communicated the purpose, procedures, benefits and potential risks of participating in our study. Caregivers were encouraged to ask any questions and those who decided to have their child participate were asked to sign a written informed consent form. Caregivers who could not read provided a thumbprint and an impartial witness signed to confirm that all the information had been appropriately communicated.

Children with caregiver consent were invited for a clinical and physical examination if they provided two baseline stool samples and these were found to be positive for hookworm (initially set to a minimum of ≥ 100 eggs per gram [EPG] of stool, and then lowered to ≥ 50 EPG due to difficulties in finding enough children with EPG ≥ 100; an amendment to the protocol was submitted and approved) and at least two of the four Kato-Katz thick smears with more than one hookworm egg. We excluded children who had severe anaemia (Hb < 80 g/l), had currently or in the past a major systemic or chronic illness self-reported or assessed by the physician, had received any anthelmintic drug in the past four weeks, were participating in another clinical trial, or were pregnant.

### Efficacy and safety of albendazole in hookworm-infected preschool-aged children, school-aged children, and adults in Côte D'ivoire: a phase 2 randomized, controlled dose-finding trial [^113CodS1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Necator americanus or Ancylostoma duodenale, two types of hookworm, affect approximately 500 million individuals worldwide. As a soil-transmitted helminth (STH), hookworm is most common in tropical and subtropical settings where larvae are able to survive in moist, warm soil.

Hookworm accounted for approximately 845 000 disability-adjusted life-years lost in 2017, with an estimated economic loss of more than $100 billion. The hookworm can cause skin irritation when it enters through the skin, acute lung inflammation and difficulty breathing when larvae migrate through the pulmonary system, and gastrointestinal issues such as blood loss, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Morbidity is highly correlated with infection intensity, and more serious infections can cause anemia from blood loss.

Albendazole is one of two benzimidazoles currently on the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines as a anthelmintic against intestinal STHs. Developed in 1975 and licensed less than a decade later for human use, albendazole is part of current global control strategies. The mainstay of control is based on targeted preventative chemotherapy (PC) in preschool-aged children (PSAC), school-aged children (SAC), and women of reproductive age (WRA) given annually/biannually using either 400 mg of albendazole or 500 mg of mebendazole. In 2012, the WHO published targets for 75% of coverage with PC in PSAC and SAC in all endemic countries and regular treatment of about 600 million PSAC and SAC who are in need of treatment by 2020. In 2018, additional targets were developed with the aim of STH control by 2030, including achieving and maintaining elimination in PSAC and SAC and expanding control programs to WRA.

### Published reports of delayed hemolytic anemia after treatment with artesunate for severe malaria – worldwide, 2010–2012 [^111kRXus]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Recent reports of delayed hemolytic anemia after artesunate treatment for severe malaria in nonendemic countries other than the United States have generated concern that this phenomenon might be related to the treatment.

What is added by this report?

Published reports describing prolonged hemolytic anemia in severe malaria not associated with artesunate treatment suggest multiple possible causes related to the pathogenesis of severe malaria infection itself.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Additional data are needed. Clinicians treating patients for severe malaria with artesunate should monitor the patient for 4 weeks after treatment, assess for hemolysis if anemia is present, and report any episodes of delayed hemolysis to CDC.

In 1997, a study using antibodies against ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens (RESA) to label P. falciparum –infected cells found that RBCs with the RESA antigen, but without parasites, could be detected if labeled in vivo. This led to the hypothesis that the spleen or another organ removed or killed the parasites without destroying the RBCs. A follow-up study found that, in patients with severe malaria, artesunate treatment generated a much higher number of unparasitized RESA-positive RBCs than quinine. It also noted that artesunate-treated RBCs were more deformable then quinine-treated or parasitized RBCs, likely further extending their lifespan. This increase in RBCs surviving after parasitemia, albeit with a shorter lifespan than healthy RBCs, might explain the delayed postartesunate treatment decrease in hemoglobin observed in the cases reported.

Further comparative data would be required to determine how artesunate influences the risks for this complication, both in travelers and in the increasing proportion of patients receiving artesunate for severe malaria in highly endemic countries. There is insufficient evidence at present to attribute these few reported hemolytic events directly to artesunate treatment itself, and these events should not reduce confidence in artesunate, which has many other benefits for patients with severe malaria. In addition, all patients with reported delayed hemolysis have recovered without long-term complications. However, to further understand the relationship between delayed hemolysis and artesunate use, CDC is requesting that patients treated with artesunate in the United States be evaluated and have their hemoglobin assessed 4 weeks after treatment. Significant declines in hemoglobin should be reported to CDC's Malaria Branch and should prompt an evaluation for hemolysis and closer monitoring.

### Efficacy of recommended drugs against soil transmitted helminths: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1152XMTk]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Our data confirm that the most widely used drugs — albendazole and mebendazole — have shortcomings in their efficacy profile, especially against infections with hookworm and T trichiura. Alarmingly, the efficacy of albendazole and mebendazole has decreased over time. As the two most widely distributed drugs in preventive chemotherapy — albendazole and mebendazole — have been in use for almost 50 years, the threat of resistance is real and immediate. For careful monitoring of potential resistance, our summary estimates might help to revise current reference figures of efficacy.

There is an imminent need to strengthen efforts to develop new drugs for soil transmitted helminths. Alternatively, old and new drugs — such as tribendimidine, oxantel pamoate, moxidectin, or ivermectin — with different efficacy profiles could be used in combination with the recommended drugs to successfully tackle infections with all three soil transmitted helminths. Only with an integrated approach combining improved sanitation, health education, and scaling up of research for new anthelmintic drugs and use of drug combinations for preventive chemotherapy will we achieve the ultimate goal to control soil transmitted helminth infections. Furthermore, future randomised controlled trials should follow a harmonised design to reduce confounders and yield improved summary estimates of efficacy of anthelmintic drugs.

### Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis [^111AT9nB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The relationship between A lumbricoides infection and socioeconomic variables is intense, as STH infections are linked to a lack of sanitation and poverty (Stepek 2006; WHO 2011). Other factors such as unhygienic housing conditions, precarious health care, and poor educational or financial resources result in difficulties in ascariasis management, especially among economically disadvantaged groups (Bethony 2006; WHO 2001; WHO 2002; WHO 2005; WHO 2011).

Description of the condition

In general, people infected with A lumbricoides are asymptomatic. However, the infection can manifest as abdominal discomfort, anorexia, diarrhoea, and vomiting (Bethony 2006; Jardim‐Botelho 2008), and is associated with both chronic and acute morbidity, particularly in growing children. Specialists consider nutritional impairment as a common condition, mainly manifested by anaemia. A lumbricoides infection can also result in an allergic inflammatory response to parasites and parasite antigens in people who are infected. A classic example is the asthma‐like illness, Loeffler's syndrome, caused by the passage of A lumbricoides larvae through the lungs. Also, exposure to A lumbricoides can cause or increase asthma symptoms and bronchial hyperreactivity (Cooper 2009; Leonardi‐Bee 2006). A lumbricoides is a persistent parasite and may have impact on a person's immune responses to other pathogens. The bystander chronic infection is associated with increased susceptibility to other pathogens as well as reduced vaccine efficacy (Stelekati 2012). Despite the large number of studies, the potential interaction of intestinal helminths and other pathogens remains controversial. Studies focusing on the coinfection of A lumbricoides and Plasmodium yield conflicting conclusions. In some studies, the interaction results in worsening of a specific clinical condition whereas other studies demonstrate it may protect severe manifestation (Degarege 2016; Fenton 2013).

### Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment for children with anaemia [^115Drfa5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Anaemia is a public health problem that affects people worldwide. Between 1993 and 2005, an estimated 1.62 billion people worldwide had anaemia, which corresponded to 24.8% of the world's population (WHO 2008). The reported global prevalence was 47.4% in children aged under five. Children in Africa and South‐East Asia carried the highest reported burden of anaemia: 67.6% and 65.5% respectively (WHO 2008). Causes of anaemia are multifactorial and include poor nutritional status, micronutrient deficiencies (especially iron deficiency, but also vitamin A, vitamin B and folic acid), intestinal helminth infection, HIV infection and haemoglobinopathies (Calis 2008). However, malaria is probably the most important cause of anaemia in malaria‐endemic countries (Antony 2008; Balarajan 2011; Crawley 2004). Anaemia is also more common in children from low‐income and illiterate families, compared to children coming from wealthier households (Balarajan 2011).

Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis

The current WHO Model List of Essential Medicine for treating intestinal helminths includes seven drugs: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, ivermectin, niclosamide, praziquantel, and pyrantel (WHO 2017b). The benzimidazoles drugs (i.e. albendazole and mebendazole), are used to treat a variety of parasitic infestations by interfering with the parasitic worm microtubular system (Utzinger 2004). They are considered the mainstay drugs for roundworm and hookworm treatment. They are low cost, safe, easily administered, and children do not need to be weighed. Dosage is the same for children and adults. Albendazole 400 mg once a day and mebendazole 100 mg orally twice daily for three days or 500 mg orally once are given.

### Interactions between worm infections and malaria [^112rbaiE]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Helminths are the most prevalent parasitic infections and malaria is the deadliest parasitic disease. Helminths have been reported to be protective against the severe forms of malaria but they were also possibly linked to increased malaria-incidence and gametocyte carriage. Connecting the dots between observations suggests that statistical regularities throughout the evolution of worms and malaria parasites in the same hosts, may have led to the emergence of non-zero interactions as observed in iterated prisoners dilemma games. Thus by protecting the host, helminths protect themselves and their reproductive potential, but also favor the dissemination and reproduction of Plasmodium falciparum. The proximate causes of this evolutionarily stable strategy might be mediated by IgE and the CD23/NO pathway, the protective role of IL10 in helminth-infected patients, and possibly the hematological consequences of worms. The chronic activation of the CD23/NO pathway might be instrumental in downregulating the expression of cytoadherence receptors thus reducing sequestration of parasitized red blood cells in the deep organs. Mild anemia in helminth-infected patients might favor gametocytogenesis and send attractive cues to the vector. This framework leads to numerous testable hypotheses and could explain certain singularities regarding the double edged role of IgE and NO. Among these hypotheses, there are 2 practical ones: the impact of helminths on malaria vaccine candidates, and the theoretical risk of increasing the severity of malaria after anthelmintics. The capacity for increased IgE responses could thus have been vital in our ancestor's wormy and malarious past. Allergies may be what remains of it in the modern world.

### Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis [^115a5Ho5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

One network meta‐analysis evaluated the efficacy of mebendazole, albendazole, levamisole, and pyrantel pamoate against A lumbricoides, hookworms and T trichiura. It included 55 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the cure rate and 46 RCTs to assess the egg reduction rates (ERR), with a single‐dose of anthelmintic drugs (Moser 2017b). In this network meta‐analysis, all drugs presented high efficacy against Ascaris.

Although using different methodological approaches, these two systematic reviews published with an interval of about 10 years (Keiser 2008; Moser 2017b) focus on the same anthelmintic drugs. Another meta‐analysis using individual patient data analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of co‐administered ivermectin plus albendazole for treating STH. According to this systematic review, the coadministration resulted in no benefit on cure and ERRs over albendazole alone for A lumbricoides (Palmeirim 2018b).

Some anthelmintic drugs, for example nitazoxanide and ivermectin, potentially effective against A lumbricoides, have not been evaluated in previous systematic reviews. Although many anthelmintic drugs exist, the most effective regimen and the optimal doses to treat ascariasis are not well known. In this sense, further systematic reviews are necessary to evaluate efficacy and safety of these drugs.

### Albendazole and mebendazole administered alone or in combination with ivermectin against trichuris trichiura: a randomized controlled trial [^116gA8YB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Single-dose albendazole and mebendazole show limited efficacy in the treatment of trichuriasis. The combination of albendazole with ivermectin improves efficacy, but a mebendazole-ivermectin combination has not been previously investigated.

Methods

We performed a randomized controlled trial in 2 schools in Zanzibar, Tanzania, to assess the efficacy and safety of albendazole (400 mg) plus placebo, albendazole plus ivermectin (200 μg/kg), mebendazole (500 mg) plus placebo, and mebendazole plus ivermectin in children with a parasitologically confirmed Trichuris trichiura infection. Cure rate (CR) and egg reduction rate were assessed by intent-to-treat analysis. Adverse events were monitored within 48 h after treatment.

Results

Complete data records were available for 548 children. The highest CR against T. trichiura was achieved with a mebendazole-ivermectin combination (55%). Low CRs were observed with albendazole-ivermectin (38%), mebendazole (19%), and albendazole (10%). Compared with placebo, the use of ivermectin statistically significantly increased the CRs from 14% to 47% (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12–0.28). The highest egg reduction rate (97%; 95% CI, 95%-98%) was observed using the mebendazole-ivermectin combination, followed by albendazole-ivermectin (91%; 95% CI, 87%-94%), mebendazole (67%; 95% CI, 52%-77%), and albendazole (40%; 95% CI, 22%-56%). The adverse events, reported by 136 children, were generally mild, with no significant difference between the treatment arms.

Conclusions

Addition of ivermectin improves the therapeutic outcomes of both albendazole and mebendazole against T. trichiura and may be considered for use in soil-transmitted helminth control programs and individual patient management.

6.1	Clinical Studies

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of mebendazole was evaluated in 6276 subjects who participated in 39 clinical trials for treatment of single or mixed parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract. In these trials, the formulations, dosages and duration of mebendazole treatment varied. Adverse reactions reported in mebendazole-treated subjects from the 39 clinical trials are shown in Table 2 below.

Risk Summary

The available published literature on mebendazole use in pregnant women has not reported a clear association between mebendazole and a potential risk of major birth defects or miscarriages [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated helminthic infection during pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

In animal reproduction studies, adverse developmental effects (i.e., skeletal malformations, soft tissue malformations, decreased pup weight, embryolethality) were observed when mebendazole was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at single oral doses as low as 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.5-fold the total daily maximum recommended human dose [MRHD]). Maternal toxicity was present at the highest of these doses [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risks

Untreated soil transmitted helminth infections in pregnancy are associated with adverse outcomes including maternal iron deficiency anemia, low birth weight, neonatal and maternal death.

Malaria — clinical manifestations by prior exposure: The clinical syndromes caused by Plasmodium species depend on prior exposure, and among those who have resided in malarious areas, manifestations depend on whether exposure occurred in stable endemic transmission (year round) or unstable transmission (seasonal, infrequent or very low). In stable endemic areas, children younger than age 5 years may experience chronic infections with recurrent parasitemia leading to severe anemia and death, and children who survive usually acquire partial immunity by age 5 years and maintain this into adulthood if they remain in endemic areas. In stable endemic areas, adults usually experience asymptomatic or milder infections.

Anaemia and iron deficiency

Only one trial captured data regarding changes in serum haemoglobin levels (Kallestrup 2005 ZWE). The trial authors reported a mean difference in haemoglobin of −0.25 g/dL (95% CI −0.58 to −0.08) in the HIV‐positive participants that received praziquantel relative to the untreated participants over three months follow‐up (unpublished data).

A secondary analysis of the primary Nielsen 2007 TZA trial examined the effect of antihelminthic treatment on micronutrient indicators in LF and HIV co‐infected individuals (Nielsen 2009). The study found that serum ferritin levels increased in co‐infected individuals 12 weeks after treatment. The study authors observed a log mean increase of 0.07 µg/L in the treatment group, while they noted a log mean increase of 0.04 µg/L in the non‐treated group. The mean difference in log ferritin levels between baseline and 12 weeks follow‐up in the treated group relative to the control group was thus 0.03 µg/L (95% CI −0.30 to 0.35) (unpublished data provided by the study authors). As the study authors did not observe the same increase in ferritin in the HIV‐positive LF‐uninfected groups, the study authors hypothesize that the serum ferritin changes may be related to the immune mechanisms involved in killing of filaria.

### Soil-transmitted helminthiasis in children from a rural community taking part in a periodic deworming program in the Peruvian amazon [^114oJRWw]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

A high overall prevalence of STH infection (26%) was found among children from an Amazonian rural community who were part of a school-based deworming program. Most of the burden was related to A. lumbricoides infection (16.5%) despite its known susceptibility to mebendazole. Also, a relatively high prevalence of S. Stercoralis (10.5%) was noticed, which is concordant to that reported in a local study. By contrast, infections by T. trichiura and hookworm were rare in this study when compared with other studies conducted in the Peruvian rainforest.,

The prevalence of the common STH (A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworm) was significantly higher among PSAC than among SAC (31.6% versus 12.8%, P = 0.01). This finding is important as recent evidence has shown robust positive health effects of deworming in PSAC, reflected in decreased stunting and anemia rates. In Padre Cocha, PSAC and SAC attended separate schools and were approached by the deworming program staff under different procedures. This may have resulted in different practices, medication supply, or program surveillance between PSAC and SAC.

Strongyloides stercoralis infection was common in children of this community. Strongyloidiasis can cause diarrhea and abdominal pain in the pediatric population and has also been associated with stunting in children with severe infection. Mebendazole, the drug administered as part of the deworming program in this community, is not effective against S. stercoralis. On the other side, thiabendazole and ivermectin have shown to be effective within strongyloidiasis control programs elsewhere. – Appropriate strategies including therapy with thiabendazole or ivermectin could potentially contribute to reduce the extent of infection among children. Unfortunately, and to the best of our knowledge, there are presently no national policies that promote the eradication of S. stercoralis in children or adults in Peru.

### Reducing stillbirths: prevention and management of medical disorders and infections during pregnancy [^113GYA6C]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Mebendazole therapy should be avoided during the first trimester pending further evidence on safety. The overall quality of evidence from the literature reviewed is Grade C, however there is some evidence of impact of deworming on stillbirths and other perinatal outcomes. Maternal deworming holds promise for improving the health of pregnant women in low-/middle-income countries where intestinal helminthiases are endemic. Consonant with the findings of the studies we reviewed, the Lancet Maternal and Child Undernutrition Series recommends deworming during pregnancy in specific, situational contexts (i.e. where prevalence of helminthiases and iron-deficiency anaemia are high). Given the promising but inconclusive findings of a recent Cochrane review, further RCTs, especially effectiveness trials, of maternal anti-helminthic therapy reporting a range of pregnancy and infant outcomes are needed.

Syphilis screening and treatment

Background

Reported rates of syphilis vary greatly worldwide. Prevalence is generally lower in high-income countries than in low-/middle-income countries. In 1990, the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was 20 per 100,000 population, far less than the disease burden of 360 per 100,000 estimated for parts of Africa. Syphilis remains a major cause of avoidable perinatal death in many low-/middle-income countries despite being treatable, and despite the WHO recommendation that all pregnant women be tested as part of routine ANC. Among pregnant women with untreated early syphilis, 25% of pregnancies result in stillbirth and 14% in neonatal death, an overall perinatal mortality of about 40%. In early untreated syphilis, a pregnant woman has a 70% chance of transmitting the infection to her fetus. Even after effective screening, many pregnant women with syphilis remain inadequately treated because of delays in initiating treatment or patient non-adherence. Testing for syphilis within antenatal clinics is a strategy that makes test results available immediately so that early treatment can be administered, which could improve treatment of syphilis and reduce perinatal mortality.

### Lack of risk of adverse birth outcomes after deworming in pregnant women [^111qmdyR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnant women who live in hookworm-endemic areas may benefit from deworming during their pregnancy. The benefit derives from reducing anemia, primarily iron-deficiency anemia caused by hookworm infection-attributable blood loss. Where the prevalence of hookworm is more than 20% to 30%, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women receive anthelminthic treatment (mebendazole, albendazole, levamisole or pyrantel) after their first trimester. The objective of this study is to report, describe and compare the occurrence of adverse birth outcomes in a large randomized, controlled trial of antenatal mebendazole (500 mg single dose) plus iron supplements versus placebo plus iron supplements conducted between April 2003 and June 2004 in the Amazon region of Peru.

Methods

Physician-recorded data on adverse birth outcomes occurring during the trial (N = 1042) were obtained. Proportions were compared using chi analysis.

Results

No statistically significant difference (P = 0.664) was found between the mebendazole group and the placebo group in terms of numbers of miscarriages, malformations, stillbirths, early neonatal deaths and premature babies (28 versus 31, respectively).

Conclusions

The evidence provided by this large randomized, controlled trial of mebendazole administered during pregnancy indicates that deworming with mebendazole can be safely included in antenatal care programs in hookworm-endemic areas.

### Investigating the effectiveness of current and modified World Health Organization guidelines for the control of soil-transmitted helminth infections [^1134TQh7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), launched in 2012, has helped to highlight the importance of a wide range of infections, including the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), which are endemic in many developing countries. These intestinal nematode parasites, namely the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, and the whipworm Trichuris trichiura are the cause of considerable morbidity. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 places the prevalence of infection with STHs overall at 1.5 billion cases globally, with around 800 million cases of ascariasis and well in excess of 400 million each of trichuriasis and hookworm disease. Individuals become infected with Ascaris and Trichuris when they ingest parasitic eggs released into the environment through the feces of infected individuals. Hookworm eggs mature and hatch in the soil, and become larvae, which penetrate through human skin when individuals walk barefoot in contaminated habitats. The severity of morbidity is correlated to the intensity of infection. Moderate- to high-intensity infections are linked to diarrhea, anemia, malnutrition, and physical and cognitive impairments; Ascaris and Trichuris are most commonly found in school-aged children (SAC), whereas for hookworm the highest worm burdens are typically found in adults.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on large-scale preventive chemotherapy through programs employing mass drug administration (MDA) of the drugs albendazole or mebendazole. The guidelines aim to reduce morbidity from STH infections in pre–school-aged children (pre-SAC) and SAC by reducing the prevalence of moderate- or heavy-intensity infections to < 1% in SAC, the thresholds for which are parasite-specific and based on fecal egg counts. The WHO recommends scaling up MDA programs to target at least 75% of SAC, and to include individuals who are at risk for morbidity caused by STH infections (ie, pregnant women in the last 2 semesters of pregnancy, lactating women, or adults in high-risk occupations). Regular treatment is required as eggs or larvae remaining present in the environment for many months can be the cause of reinfection.

### Antihelminthics in helminth-endemic areas: effects on HIV disease progression [^1133vemC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend that high‐risk populations living in endemic areas participate in regular mass drug administration with antihelminthic medicines (deworming drugs) without the need for prior confirmatory diagnostic testing. This is also known as preventive chemotherapy. In settings where community prevalence of STH infections exceed 20%, the WHO recommends annual treatment with albendazole or mebendazole for all preschool‐age children, school‐age children, and pregnant women in their second and third trimester (WHO 2006).

The rationale for mass treatment rather than a test and treat approach is the safety of the drugs, low cost of the drugs (often donated by pharmaceutical companies), the relatively high cost of diagnostic testing, and the high prevalence of infection in some areas. The cost of these programmes is estimated to be as low as USD 0.25 per treatment, including delivery costs (Bundy 2009; Partnership for Child Development 1998). Mass deworming programs are scaling up rapidly in part due to the WHO NTD Roadmap for Implementation and the 2012 WHO‐endorsed London Declaration, which calls for the control or elimination of 10 neglected tropical diseases including STHs, schistosomiasis, LF, and onchocerciasis by 2020 (Uniting to Combat NTDs 2012).

In research settings deworming treatment may require prior confirmatory testing or treatment may be delivered empirically as customary in preventative chemotherapy campaigns. For example, specific age groups may be targeted and recruited to receive deworming medications during community‐based household recruitment, at HIV clinics, at tuberculosis (TB) clinics, or during antenatal care.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, vomiting and rash. (6.1).

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1–800-JANSSEN (1–800–526–7736) or FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

6.1	Clinical Studies

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of mebendazole was evaluated in 6276 adult and pediatric subjects one year of age and older who participated in 39 clinical trials for treatment of single or mixed parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract. In these trials, the formulations, dosages and duration of mebendazole treatment varied. Adverse reactions reported in mebendazole-treated subjects from the 39 clinical trials are shown in Table 1 below.

Clinical Studies with Mebendazole Chewable 500 mg Tablet

The safety profile of mebendazole chewable 500 mg tablets administered as a single dose was evaluated in 677 pediatric subjects aged 1 to 16 years and in 34 adults. The safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of mebendazole.

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified in adult and pediatric patients postmarketing with mebendazole formulations and dosages other than the VERMOX™ CHEWABLE 500 mg tablet. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Other data

Some trials did not provide data in a form that we could use in meta‐analysis. We have collated these data in Table 14 and Table 17, and have summarized this information below:

reported no significant differences in mean z‐scores or prevalence of stunting, underweight or wasting between the intervention groups, and the changes between intervals (ie between weeks 0 to 12, 0 to 24, 0 to 36, 12 to 24, etc.) did not differ significantly between groups;
reported no significant differences detected between treatment groups on basis of multivariate analyses;
reported no difference in final and change in height;
found that "the rates of absenteeism were similar for all groups", but no measures of variance were provided;
found no difference in height or weight between treatment and control group at the end of two‐year follow‐up;
reported no obvious trend in nutritional variable;
demonstrated no significant effect on weight‐for‐age z‐score, height‐for‐age z‐score, and haemoglobin;
reported that ANOVAS of the change in z‐scores revealed no significant improvement with treatment;
found no significant differences in mean z‐scores for weight‐for‐height, weight‐for‐age, and height‐for‐age z‐scores at five years of age;
reported that mebendazole significantly reduced the prevalence of mild wasting malnutrition in a subgroup of children aged < 30 months;
reported that in a subgroup of under 10 year olds, the twice‐yearly treated group experienced significantly greater weight gain (kg) compared to control (2.38 (SE 0.08) vs 2.11 (SE 0.08), P < 0.05);
reported no statistical difference in growth rates in terms of height and weight between the two groups.

Comparisons 5 and 6. Sensitivity analysis

Including only trials with low risk of bias for allocation of concealment, no significant difference between treatment and control groups was detected in weight, height, or haemoglobin (Analysis 5.1; Analysis 5.2, Analysis 5.3, Analysis 5.4; Analysis 6.1, Analysis 6.2; Analysis 6.3).

Comparison 7. Exploring whether the intervention effect changed over time

The MD in weight (between deworming drugs vs control in children in an endemic area after multiple doses) did not differ by length of follow‐up (results not presented) or by publication year (Analysis 7.1).

### Control of neglected tropical diseases needs a long-term commitment [^112Pxqza]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Soil-transmitted helminthiasis

Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) is caused by a group of parasitic nematode worms (most importantly, hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) through ingestion of parasite eggs or contact with skin-penetrating larvae that are present in the contaminated environment. These diseases are by far the most common NTDs in the developing world, affecting school-age children in particular and causing anaemia and other forms of malnutrition. The control strategy is morbidity control through MDA using albendazole or mebendazole. Generally, control of STH is integrated into other programmes such as nutrition or school health as a deworming component, and is often part of schistosomiasis control programmes or as a collateral benefit from LF control programmes, as the same drug is used. Addition of mebendazole to vitamin A supplementation expanded the treatment to children of 12–59 months with a high coverage. Children Without Worms (CWW) was established as a partnership between Johnson & Johnson and the Task Force for Global Health to leverage the donation of mebendazole from Johnson & Johnson to advocate for comprehensive and sustainable control of STH with a focus exclusively on school-age children. Despite these efforts, less than 20% of the at-risk school-age population receive deworming treatment worldwide; this is far short of the World Health Assembly's target to regularly treat 75% of school-age children at risk of morbidity due to schistosomiasis and STH infections by 2010. As for schistosomiasis control, only a few countries are currently implementing or about to implement national integrated NTD control programmes that include STH control.

### Efficacy and safety of albendazole in hookworm-infected preschool-aged children, school-aged children, and adults in Côte D'ivoire: a phase 2 randomized, controlled dose-finding trial [^111MRGWh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-based MDA aligns with the 2030 targets of the NTD Roadmap, which plans to expand control programs to WRA, who are at risk of iron-deficiency anemia. Evidence from this trial can have a direct impact on the program strategies for the control and elimination of hookworm infection. Given the remarkable higher efficacy observed, increasing the dose of albendazole for adults targeted by community-based MDA may aid in the interruption of transmission.

The estimated cost of one albendazole tablet is $0.018 with an additional 10% for overhead costs. Recent estimates have shown that the average per-person cost of annual treatment at the community level is $0.68, which could be reduced during scale-up to $0.33 if coverage remains high. These estimates are within the reported range of costs ($0.33–$0.70) for treating an infected individual reported by the WHO in 2017. Integrating an additional albendazole tablet into program strategies for treatment of adults would not drive costs outside of current ranges, though more evidence on the cost-effectiveness of two tablets of 400 mg albendazole for adults is needed.

In conclusion, this trial provides direct evidence on the optimal dose of albendazole for treatment of hookworm infection in low-transmission settings. Though sample sizes in SAC and PSAC were lower than anticipated, our findings support use of the currently recommended albendazole doses since increasing doses revealed no benefit in these age groups. However, we observed a considerably higher efficacy with administration of 800 mg of albendazole in the adult cohort. Strategies to integrate an 800-mg dose of albendazole to adults during community-based MDA should therefore be explored.

### Efficacy and safety of moxidectin and albendazole compared with ivermectin and albendazole coadministration in adolescents infected with trichuris trichiura in tanzania: an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled, phase 2 / 3 trial [^114Q3KKW]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

On the treatment day, study physicians performed a physical examination (including a rapid assessment of haemoglobin concentrations to rule out anaemia, measurement of body temperature, and the medical history to assess baseline conditions) of all eligible participants to ensure inclusion criteria were met. Females were tested for pregnancy and asked to confirm that no pregnancy was planned throughout the duration of the study. Study physicians assessed adverse events at 3 h and 24 h after treatment. At the three follow-up timepoints of 14–21 days, 5–6 weeks, and 3 months after treatment, adverse events were assessed retrospectively by trained study team members and considered as possibly related when causality could not be ruled out by other conditions. Severity grading was categorised according to the US National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 5.0). When symptoms prevailed at follow-up assessments, participants were taken to a study physician or Chake Chake hospital, provided with the prescribed treatment, and followed up by the study team until symptoms resolved.

A subsample of 60 participants were asked to provide blood samples collected by a finger prick for the assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters between day 0 and 7 after treatment. Pharmacokinetic results will be published elsewhere. Efficacy was assessed 14–21 days after treatment by quadruplicate Kato-Katz from two stool samples collected using the same procedures as for baseline sampling. The same procedures were applied at the other timepoints to determine long-term treatment efficacy. At the end of the study, participants who were still positive for soil-transmitted helminth infections were offered the best available treatment option — ie, ivermectin and albendazole.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was egg reduction rate (ERR) of T trichiura 14–21 days after treatment in the available case population. Secondary outcomes were cure rates (defined as the proportion of participants converted from egg-positive at baseline to egg-negative after treatment) of combination therapy groups compared with monotherapy groups for T trichiura 14–21 days after treatment; egg reduction rates and cure rates for A lumbricoides and hookworm assessed at 14–21 days, 5–6 weeks, and 3 months after treatment; and tolerability of treatment assessed by type, number, and severity of adverse events. Secondary outcomes were assessed in the available case population.

### Deworming drugs for soil-transmitted intestinal worms in children: effects on nutritional indicators, haemoglobin, and school performance [^116NW159]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

undertook a systematic review of the effects of deworming on haemoglobin, and reported a marginal increase in mean values that could translate into small reduction (5% to 10%) in anaemia in a population with a high prevalence of intestinal helminths. This systematic review differs from our analysis of haemoglobin in a number of respects: it included trials in adults and pregnant women and it included trials excluded from our review on the basis of methodological quality.

Other advocates of deworming, such as, have argued that many of the underlying trials of deworming suffer from three critical methodological problems: treatment externalities in dynamic infection systems, inadequate measurement of cognitive outcomes and school attendance, and sample attrition. We agree with these points. However, externalities will be detected by large cluster‐RCTs and there are now nine trials such as this included in this review, and the externalities previously reported inwere not found in the replication analysis after various coding and classification errors had been corrected.
