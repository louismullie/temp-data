## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best defines the salience of a political issue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core meaning of salience in political science. Then, I should verify which answer choices map most directly to that definition. Next, I will consider common proxies of salience like media coverage and whether they are causes or constituents of salience. Finally, I will eliminate distractors and select the best fit, making sure I'm not conflating salience with related but distinct concepts like scope, duration, or elite attention.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: salience refers to the prominence or importance of an issue in the minds of individuals or groups, essentially how much it matters to them and how readily it comes to mind when thinking about politics or policy, which is inherently subjective and perception-based rather than purely objective or structural.

> Now, I should review the options and see which aligns with that subjective importance framing. Option I, "the importance of the issue to a particular individual or group", matches the definition most closely because salience is fundamentally about perceived importance and cognitive accessibility for actors, not about the objective characteristics of the issue itself.

> Wait, let me verify the tempting distractors. Media coverage (A) and social media volume (B) are common proxies researchers use to infer salience, but they are indicators or drivers of salience rather than the definition itself; an issue can be salient with little media attention if it is personally important to a group, and conversely, heavy coverage does not guarantee salience for everyone, so A and B are not the best definitional choices.

> Hold on, I should also check the other options. Geographical scope (C), duration (D), elite discourse (E), protest activity (F), funding (G), opinion volatility (H), and raw number affected (J) all describe objective features or correlates of issues that may influence whether they become salient, but none capture the subjective, perception-based essence of salience as directly as option I does, so they are better viewed as antecedents or consequences rather than the definition itself.

> I need to ensure I'm not overstating. While salience is often measured with media metrics in practice, the construct remains the psychological prominence or importance of an issue to a person or group, which is precisely what option I expresses, making it the most accurate definitional choice among the alternatives provided.

> Final answer: I. The importance of the issue to a particular individual or group [^notfound].

---

The salience of a political issue is best defined as **how important the issue is to individuals or groups** [^notfound], shaping their attention, priorities, and behavior. Salience is **subjective and context-dependent**, varying by person, group, and situation, and is distinct from objective measures such as media coverage, geographic scope, or duration. While media attention and public discourse can influence salience, they do not define it; salience is ultimately determined by **perceived importance** to the audience [^notfound].

---

## Definition and core concept

Salience refers to the **perceived importance or prominence** of an issue in the minds of individuals or groups [^notfound]. It reflects how much an issue matters to people and how likely they are to think about it, discuss it, or act on it. Salience is inherently **subjective and context-dependent**, varying across individuals, groups, and situations [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing salience

Several factors influence the salience of a political issue:

- **Personal relevance**: Issues that directly affect individuals or their communities tend to be more salient [^notfound].
- **Emotional impact**: Issues that evoke strong emotions, such as fear, anger, or hope, are more likely to be salient [^notfound].
- **Media coverage**: Extensive media coverage can increase the salience of an issue by bringing it to public attention [^notfound].
- **Elite discourse**: Statements and actions by political leaders, experts, and influential figures can shape public perception and increase salience [^notfound].
- **Social norms and values**: Issues that align with or challenge prevailing social norms and values are more likely to be salient [^notfound].

---

## Measurement of salience

Salience is typically measured through **public opinion surveys**, which ask respondents to identify the most important issues facing the country or their community. Other methods include analyzing media coverage, social media activity, and public discourse. However, these indirect measures reflect salience rather than define it [^notfound].

---

## Distinction from related concepts

Salience is often confused with related concepts such as:

- **Media coverage**: While media coverage can influence salience, it is not synonymous with it. An issue can receive extensive media coverage without being salient to the public, and vice versa [^notfound].
- **Geographical scope**: The geographical area impacted by an issue does not necessarily determine its salience. Local issues can be highly salient to affected communities, while global issues may be less salient to individuals [^notfound].
- **Duration**: The length of time an issue has been present does not inherently determine its salience. Some longstanding issues remain salient, while others fade from public attention [^notfound].

---

## Examples of salient political issues

Examples of political issues that have been particularly salient in recent years include:

- **Climate change**: Increasingly salient due to its perceived impact on future generations and the frequency of extreme weather events [^notfound].
- **Healthcare**: Salient due to its direct impact on individuals' lives and well-being [^notfound].
- **Economic inequality**: Salient due to its perceived impact on social justice and opportunity [^notfound].
- **Immigration**: Salient due to its emotional and cultural implications, as well as its economic and security dimensions [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

In summary, the salience of a political issue is best defined as **the importance of the issue to a particular individual or group** [^notfound]. It is a subjective and context-dependent concept that influences public attention, political discourse, and policy priorities. While factors such as media coverage, elite discourse, and personal relevance can influence salience, they do not define it. Salience is ultimately determined by the perceived importance of the issue to the audience [^notfound].

### Chronic hepatitis E: advancing research and patient care [^113TnPym]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The hepatitis E virus (HEV) was initially thought to exclusively cause acute hepatitis. However, the first diagnosis of chronic hepatitis E in transplant recipients in 2008 profoundly changed our understanding of this pathogen. We have now begun to understand that specific HEV genotypes can cause chronic infection in certain immunocompromised populations. Over the past decade, dedicated clinical and experimental research has substantiated knowledge on the epidemiology, transmission routes, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnosis, clinical features and treatment of chronic HEV infection. Nevertheless, many gaps and major challenges remain, particularly regarding the translation of knowledge into disease prevention and improvement of clinical outcomes. This article aims to highlight the latest developments in the understanding and management of chronic hepatitis E. More importantly, we attempt to identify major knowledge gaps and discuss strategies for further advancing both research and patient care.

### Dietary vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing digestive diseases and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114SZqmu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin E supplementation is recommended for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) for nondiabetic patients, but its preventative effects are unclear.

Methods

We assessed dietary vitamin E intake with disease phenotypes and evaluated vitamin E levels with the development of NAFLD.

Results

Data from > 210,000 participants demonstrate that increased dietary vitamin E associates with reduced rates of several gastrointestinal diseases and reduced overall mortality. Diabetic and overweight subjects with increased vitamin E intake have fewer NAFLD diagnoses.

Discussion

Our findings reveal the relevance of vitamin E consumption for several gastrointestinal diseases and warrant further mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.

### Vitamin E supplementation in inflammatory skin diseases [^114czNRr]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitamin E is a powerful lipophilic antioxidant that protects membranes from lipid peroxidation, and consequently, oxidative damage. Oxidative stress plays a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Vitamin E supplementation is recommended in patients with vitamin E deficiency due to fat malabsorption. The addition of vitamin E to the diet slows Alzheimer's disease progression and protects older patients against respiratory infections. Recent studies also point to the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathology of immune-mediated skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. We reviewed the available clinical trials that investigated the role of vitamin E supplementation in preventing and treating atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Data from these studies point to a positive role of vitamin E supplementation in these diseases. Still, due to limitations in study design, further evidence is needed to reach a definite conclusion.

### A randomized trial of E-cigarettes versus nicotine-replacement therapy [^114vw2rv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

E-cigarettes are commonly used in attempts to stop smoking, but evidence is limited regarding their effectiveness as compared with that of nicotine products approved as smoking-cessation treatments.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults attending U.K. National Health Service stop-smoking services to either nicotine-replacement products of their choice, including product combinations, provided for up to 3 months, or an e-cigarette starter pack (a second-generation refillable e-cigarette with one bottle of nicotine e-liquid [18 mg per milliliter]), with a recommendation to purchase further e-liquids of the flavor and strength of their choice. Treatment included weekly behavioral support for at least 4 weeks. The primary outcome was sustained abstinence for 1 year, which was validated biochemically at the final visit. Participants who were lost to follow-up or did not provide biochemical validation were considered to not be abstinent. Secondary outcomes included participant-reported treatment usage and respiratory symptoms.

Results

A total of 886 participants underwent randomization. The 1-year abstinence rate was 18.0% in the e-cigarette group, as compared with 9.9% in the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk, 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30 to 2.58; P < 0.001). Among participants with 1-year abstinence, those in the e-cigarette group were more likely than those in the nicotine-replacement group to use their assigned product at 52 weeks (80% [63 of 79 participants] vs. 9% [4 of 44 participants]). Overall, throat or mouth irritation was reported more frequently in the e-cigarette group (65.3%, vs. 51.2% in the nicotine-replacement group) and nausea more frequently in the nicotine-replacement group (37.9%, vs. 31.3% in the e-cigarette group). The e-cigarette group reported greater declines in the incidence of cough and phlegm production from baseline to 52 weeks than did the nicotine-replacement group (relative risk for cough, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9; relative risk for phlegm, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9). There were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of wheezing or shortness of breath.

Conclusions

E-cigarettes were more effective for smoking cessation than nicotine-replacement therapy, when both products were accompanied by behavioral support. (Funded by the National Institute for Health Research and Cancer Research UK; Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN60477608 .).

### Long-term efficacy of a hepatitis E vaccine [^115UD5KF]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a leading cause of acute hepatitis. The long-term efficacy of a hepatitis E vaccine needs to be determined.

Methods

In an initial efficacy study, we randomly assigned healthy adults 16 to 65 years of age to receive three doses of either a hepatitis E vaccine (vaccine group; 56,302 participants) or a hepatitis B vaccine (control group; 56,302 participants). The vaccines were administered at 0, 1, and 6 months, and the participants were followed for 19 months. In this extended follow-up study, the treatment assignments of all participants remained double-blinded, and follow-up assessments of efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety were continued for up to 4.5 years.

Results

During the 4.5-year study period, 60 cases of hepatitis E were identified; 7 cases were confirmed in the vaccine group (0.3 cases per 10,000 person-years), and 53 cases in the control group (2.1 cases per 10,000 person-years), representing a vaccine efficacy of 86.8% (95% confidence interval, 71 to 94) in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, rather than (95% confidence interval, 71 to 84). Of the participants who were assessed for immunogenicity and were seronegative at baseline, 87% of those who received three doses of the hepatitis E vaccine maintained antibodies against HEV for at least 4.5 years; HEV antibody titers developed in 9% in the control group. The rate of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Immunization with this hepatitis E vaccine induced antibodies against HEV and provided protection against hepatitis E for up to 4.5 years. (Funded by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01014845.).

### Effect of e-cigarettes plus counseling vs counseling alone on smoking cessation: a randomized clinical trial [^1166ZdyE]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for smoking cessation remain controversial.

Objective

To evaluate e-cigarettes with individual counseling for smoking cessation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial enrolled adults motivated to quit smoking from November 2016 to September 2019 at 17 Canadian sites (801 individuals screened; 274 ineligible and 151 declined). Manufacturing delays resulted in early termination (376/486 participants, 77% of target). Outcomes through 24 weeks (March 2020) are reported.

Interventions

Randomization to nicotine e-cigarettes (n = 128), nonnicotine e-cigarettes (n = 127), or no e-cigarettes (n = 121) for 12 weeks. All groups received individual counseling.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was point prevalence abstinence (7-day recall, biochemically validated using expired carbon monoxide) at 12 weeks, changed from 52 weeks following early termination. Participants missing data were assumed to be smoking. The 7 secondary end points, examined at multiple follow-ups, were point prevalence abstinence at other follow-ups, continuous abstinence, daily cigarette consumption change, serious adverse events, adverse events, dropouts due to adverse effects, and treatment adherence.

Results

Among 376 randomized participants (mean age, 52 years; 178 women [47%]), 299 (80%) and 278 (74%) self-reported smoking status at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Point prevalence abstinence was significantly greater for nicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling vs counseling alone at 12 weeks (21.9% vs 9.1%; risk difference [RD], 12.8 [95% CI, 4.0 to 21.6]) but not 24 weeks (17.2% vs 9.9%; RD, 7.3 [95% CI, -1.2 to 15.7]). Point prevalence abstinence for nonnicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling was not significantly different from counseling alone at 12 weeks (17.3% vs 9.1%; RD, 8.2 [95% CI, -0.1 to 16.6]), but was significantly greater at 24 weeks (20.5% vs 9.9%; RD, 10.6 [95% CI, 1.8 to 19.4]). Adverse events were common (nicotine e-cigarette with counseling: 120 [94%]; nonnicotine e-cigarette with counseling: 118 [93%]; counseling only: 88 [73%]), with the most common being cough (64%) and dry mouth (53%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults motivated to quit smoking, nicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling vs counseling alone significantly increased point prevalence abstinence at 12 weeks. However, the difference was no longer significant at 24 weeks, and trial interpretation is limited by early termination and inconsistent findings for nicotine and nonnicotine e-cigarettes, suggesting further research is needed.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02417467.

### Is e-cigarette use in non-smoking young adults associated with later smoking? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115d3gBe]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary measures

Effect estimates were reported as ORs (and converted where necessary). ORs of the association between e-cigarette use and later cigarette use were combined using a random-effects model. All unadjusted ORs were calculated using observed data points that were obtained from the original study or directly from the author if insufficient information was provided in the original study. Calculated effect sizes were double checked by the review team.

Adjusted ORs were reported as they were in the original study and adjusted risk ratios were converted to ORs using a modified version of a formula published in the Cochrane Handbook (Section 12.5.4.4): OR = (−RR+RR×ACR) / (RR×ACR−1), where OR = odds ratio; RR = risk ratio; ACR = assumed control risk (calculated on a per study basis as the risk of later smoking among controls).

Synthesis and results

In a random-effects model, we calculated the pooled ORs from unadjusted and adjusted ORs for ever cigarette use at follow-up among never smokers at baseline, in ever compared with never e-cigarette users at baseline. Where multiple exposure or outcome measures were included in the original study, this estimate was used in the main analysis. If ever use of e-cigarettes was not reported, then the main effect reported in the study was included in our main analyses.

Where possible (ie, where more than one study was available), we also analysed the results in a series of subgroups — we pooled odds for: (i) ever versus never e-cigarette use at baseline and ever versus never smoking at follow-up; (ii) ever versus never e-cigarette use at baseline and current (past 30 days) versus non-current use of cigarettes at follow-up, and (iii) current versus non-current e-cigarette use at baseline and ever versus never smoking at follow-up. In retrospective studies, measures of e-cigarette use prior to smoking were treated as baseline and smoking status at the time of the study was treated as the follow-up. We aimed to pool the results of regular (at least monthly for > 6 months) cigarette use at follow-up among never smokers at baseline, in regular compared with non-regular e-cigarette users at baseline; however, insufficient data were available to do so.

Heterogeneity of study effect estimates can be indicated by an I 2 statistic. Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analysis. All analyses were conducted using Stata SE V.15.1 and Review Manager V.5.

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition support of adult patients with hyperglycemia [^1176ck5X]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines — blood glucose targets during nutrition support in adult hospitalized patients: We recommend a target blood glucose goal range of 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10 mmol/L) (Grade: Strong). Hyperglycemia is associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients, both in the ICU and the non-ICU setting, and although a consensus conference recommended that blood glucose concentrations in hospitalized patients be maintained below 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), more recent large clinical trials failed to show benefit when such an aggressive target was achieved and the largest randomized controlled trial found a higher mortality with intensive treatment compared with those treated to a target blood glucose range of 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10 mmol/L).

### Patterns, trends and determinants of e-cigarette use in 28 European union member States 2014–2017 [^113DSpdR]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

There is a lack of nationally representative data on regular e-cigarette use, as well as on the transition from experimentation to regular use. This study examines changes in these in Europe between 2014 and 2017. Data come from the 2014 (n = 27,801) and 2017 (n = 27,901) adult Special Eurobarometer for Tobacco Survey, providing nationally representative surveys of 28 EU member states. We defined regular use of e-cigarettes as daily or weekly use from a question on frequency of e-cigarette use. Among ever users of e-cigarettes we assessed socio-demographic correlates of becoming a regular user. 1.5% of the EU population were regular e-cigarette users in 2014, which had risen to 1.8% in 2017. In 2017 63 million Europeans aged 15 or older had ever used e-cigarettes (95% CI, 59.9 million-66.2 million), and 7.6 million (95% CI, 6.5million-8.9 million) were regular e-cigarette users. Among those who had ever used e-cigarettes, participants aged 15–24 years were less likely to be regular user than those aged ≥ 55 years (16.9% vs. 38.1%), as were never smokers compared with current and former smokers (12.8% vs. 27.0% vs. 41.3%). The proportion of adults who were regular e-cigarette users in 2017 ranged from 4.7% in the UK to 0.2% in Bulgaria. There have been slight rises in the proportion of people regularly using e-cigarettes in the EU, and this varies considerably between member states, indicating the role of the regional environment in supporting or deterring e-cigarette use.

### E-cigarettes: a scientific review [^115tLfHj]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, only a few studies have directly investigated the health effects of exposure to e-cigarette aerosol, but some demonstrate the ability of e-cigarette aerosol exposure to result in biological effects. Long-term biological effects are unknown at this time because e-cigarettes have not been in widespread use long enough for assessment.

### CSF apo-E levels associate with cognitive decline and MRI changes [^113W6EXC]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it is thought to do so by modulating levels of its product, apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), and regulating amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance. However, information on clinical and biomarker correlates of Apo-E proteins is scarce. We examined the relationship of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma Apo-E protein levels, and APOE genotype to cognition and AD biomarker changes in 311 AD neuroimaging initiative subjects with CSF Apo-E measurements and 565 subjects with plasma Apo-E measurements. At baseline, higher CSF Apo-E levels were associated with higher total and phosphorylated CSF tau levels. CSF Apo-E levels were associated with longitudinal cognitive decline, MCI conversion to dementia, and gray matter atrophy rate in total tau/Aβ1–42 ratio and APOE genotype-adjusted analyses. In analyses stratified by APOE genotype, our results were only significant in the group without the ε4 allele. Baseline CSF Apo-E levels did not predict longitudinal CSF Aβ or tau changes. Plasma Apo-E levels show a mild correlation with CSF Apo-E levels, but were not associated with longitudinal cognitive and MRI changes. Based on our analyses, we speculate that increased CSF Apo-E2 or -E3 levels might represent a protective response to injury in AD and may have neuroprotective effects by decreasing neuronal damage independent of tau and amyloid deposition in addition to its effects on amyloid clearance.

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition support of adult patients with hyperglycemia [^116qTv3R]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines — critically ill adults with hyperglycemia: We recommend that the target blood glucose concentration in the critically ill adult should be 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10 mmol/L). Mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40–70 mg/dL; 2.2–3.9 mmol/L) is associated with adverse outcomes, and some studies have compared a broader range with a lower limit, for example, 110–180 mg/dL (6.1–10.0 mmol/L). No randomized controlled trials have been conducted in non-ICU patients.

### Diagnostic accuracy of tissue Doppler index E/e' for evaluating left ventricular filling pressure and diastolic dysfunction / heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113r3YM3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

To best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive meta‐analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of tissue Doppler echocardiographic index, E/è, to estimate LVFP in patient cohorts with pEF and for the identification of DD/HFpEF. We find that the evidence for the use of E/è for routine clinical practice in estimating LVFP in pEF is limited. Further, because of multiplicity of study designs, no conclusive inference can be drawn for the use of E/è in diagnosing DD/HFpEF in routine clinical applications.

Based on ASE and ESC guidelines, 4, 5 E/è is an important noninvasive parameter with which to evaluate diastolic function. From a clinical perspective, this application of E/è can be grouped into 2 important concepts: (1) estimation of LVFP — this includes either semiquantitative estimate of LVFP (ie, normal versus elevated) and/or direct quantitative estimate of LVFP, and (2) clinical diagnosis of DD/HFpEF. Extensive use of E/è as a noninvasive surrogate for LVFP and diastolic function has been observed in recent clinical research in cardiac and multidisciplinary fields. 6, 7, 8, 52, 53, 54 The poor‐to‐mediocre correlation of E/è to LVFP indicates that E/è alone may not be reliable to estimate LVFP. Therefore, its use for directly estimating LVFP is not recommended until well validated in robust clinical studies.

For the semiquantitative estimate of LVFP, we find that (1) the summary specificity of the ASE‐recommended E/è for identifying elevated LVFP is high but the summary sensitivity is very low. Except for E/è septal, the resulting LR + is also low. (2) For identifying normal LVFP, the LR + of E/è is low for all locations. To provide a practical framework for interpreting/use of these findings in the clinical practice, we describe 3 representative scenarios based on E/è septal that demonstrates the best LR + for identifying elevated LVFP. These scenarios are based on PPV–patient prevalence relationship obtained in our study results (Figures 3 I and 4 I).

### A pragmatic trial of E-cigarettes, incentives, and drugs for smoking cessation [^115FvMx6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether financial incentives, pharmacologic therapies, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) promote smoking cessation among unselected smokers is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned smokers employed by 54 companies to one of four smoking-cessation interventions or to usual care. Usual care consisted of access to information regarding the benefits of smoking cessation and to a motivational text-messaging service. The four interventions consisted of usual care plus one of the following: free cessation aids (nicotine-replacement therapy or pharmacotherapy, with e-cigarettes if standard therapies failed); free e-cigarettes, without a requirement that standard therapies had been tried; free cessation aids plus $600 in rewards for sustained abstinence; or free cessation aids plus $600 in redeemable funds, deposited in a separate account for each participant, with money removed from the account if cessation milestones were not met. The primary outcome was sustained smoking abstinence for 6 months after the target quit date.

Results

Among 6131 smokers who were invited to enroll, 125 opted out and 6006 underwent randomization. Sustained abstinence rates through 6 months were 0.1% in the usual-care group, 0.5% in the free cessation aids group, 1.0% in the free e-cigarettes group, 2.0% in the rewards group, and 2.9% in the redeemable deposit group. With respect to sustained abstinence rates, redeemable deposits and rewards were superior to free cessation aids (P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively, with significance levels adjusted for multiple comparisons). Redeemable deposits were superior to free e-cigarettes (P = 0.008). Free e-cigarettes were not superior to usual care (P = 0.20) or to free cessation aids (P = 0.43). Among the 1191 employees (19.8%) who actively participated in the trial (the "engaged" cohort), sustained abstinence rates were four to six times as high as those among participants who did not actively engage in the trial, with similar relative effectiveness.

Conclusions

In this pragmatic trial of smoking cessation, financial incentives added to free cessation aids resulted in a higher rate of sustained smoking abstinence than free cessation aids alone. Among smokers who received usual care (information and motivational text messages), the addition of free cessation aids or e-cigarettes did not provide a benefit.

### E-cigarette characteristics and cigarette cessation among adults who use E-cigarettes [^116h5HVw]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We conducted analyses using the 2 approaches to ascertaining the e-cigarette use sample indicated previously: respondents who used e-cigarettes at baseline when they were also smoking cigarettes (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1) and those who used e-cigarettes at follow-up when the cigarette cessation outcome was assessed (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). For each approach, we determined cigarette cessation behavior rates at follow-up stratified by e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette flavor, e-cigarette device type, and year of data collection.

Next, we used generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for each approach to evaluate associations of e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette flavor, e-cigarette device type, and year of data collection with each cigarette cessation behavior outcome. GEE analyses were conducted using 4 wave pairs: 2014–2015 to 2015–2016, 2015–2016 to 2017, 2017 to 2019, and 2019 to 2021. This allowed for the assessment of change in cigarette smoking between baseline and follow-up from all wave pairs in a single analysis while statistically controlling for interdependence among observations contributed by the same individuals. This approach allows for a robust evaluation of meaningful transitions in cigarette smoking behaviors over relatively shorter periods of time rather than evaluating numerous trajectories in product use over longer periods across all the waves of data. GEE logistic regression models specified unstructured covariance and within-person correlation matrices and a binomial distribution of the dependent variable using the logit link function. A 2-sided α of.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were adjusted for sex, race, ethnicity, age, cigarettes smoked per day, menthol or nonmenthol cigarette smoking, e-cigarette flavor, e-cigarette device type, interview mode, and year of data collection (model 1). In a second model, analyses were adjusted for the same covariates as in model 1 plus e-cigarette use frequency to determine whether any associations of e-cigarette flavor, device type, or year of data collection with cigarette cessation outcomes were mitigated by e-cigarette use frequency (model 2).

### A test in context: E/A and E/e' to assess diastolic dysfunction and LV filling pressure [^1165smPr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diastolic dysfunction represents a combination of impaired left ventricular (LV) relaxation, restoration forces, myocyte lengthening load, and atrial function, culminating in increased LV filling pressures. Current Doppler echocardiography guidelines recommend using early to late diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E/A) to assess diastolic function, and E to early diastolic mitral annular tissue velocity (E/e') to estimate LV filling pressures. Although both parameters have important diagnostic and prognostic implications, they should be interpreted in the context of a patient's age and the rest of the echocardiogram to describe diastolic function and guide patient management. This review discusses: 1) the physiological basis for the E/A and E/e' ratios; 2) their roles in diagnosing diastolic dysfunction; 3) prognostic implications of abnormalities in E/A and E/e'; 4) special scenarios of the E/A and E/e' ratios that are either useful or challenging when evaluating diastolic function clinically; and 5) their usefulness in guiding therapeutic decision making.

### Electronic nicotine-delivery systems for smoking cessation [^115Q3Np3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Electronic nicotine-delivery systems - also called e-cigarettes - are used by some tobacco smokers to assist with quitting. Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of these systems is needed.

Methods

In this open-label, controlled trial, we randomly assigned adults who were smoking at least five tobacco cigarettes per day and who wanted to set a quit date to an intervention group, which received free e-cigarettes and e-liquids, standard-of-care smoking-cessation counseling, and optional (not free) nicotine-replacement therapy, or to a control group, which received standard counseling and a voucher, which they could use for any purpose, including nicotine-replacement therapy. The primary outcome was biochemically validated, continuous abstinence from smoking at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included participant-reported abstinence from tobacco and from any nicotine (including smoking, e-cigarettes, and nicotine-replacement therapy) at 6 months, respiratory symptoms, and serious adverse events.

Results

A total of 1246 participants underwent randomization; 622 participants were assigned to the intervention group, and 624 to the control group. The percentage of participants with validated continuous abstinence from tobacco smoking was 28.9% in the intervention group and 16.3% in the control group (relative risk, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.43 to 2.20). The percentage of participants who abstained from smoking in the 7 days before the 6-month visit was 59.6% in the intervention group and 38.5% in the control group, but the percentage who abstained from any nicotine use was 20.1% in the intervention group and 33.7% in the control group. Serious adverse events occurred in 25 participants (4.0%) in the intervention group and in 31 (5.0%) in the control group; adverse events occurred in 272 participants (43.7%) and 229 participants (36.7%), respectively.

Conclusions

The addition of e-cigarettes to standard smoking-cessation counseling resulted in greater abstinence from tobacco use among smokers than smoking-cessation counseling alone. (Funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and others; ESTxENDS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03589989.).

### Structure and inference in hypergraphs with node attributes [^116iDNxy]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

The model

We propose a probabilistic model that incorporates both the structure of a hypergraph, i.e. the interactions observed in the data, and additional attributes (or covariates) on the nodes. These two types of information, which we call structural and attribute information, have been previously shown to be informative in modeling community structure in networks, when there is correlation to be exploited –.

We denote a hypergraph as H = (V, E, A), where V = {1, …, N } is a set of nodes, E is a set of observed hyperedges whose elements e ∈ E are arbitrary sets of two or more nodes in V, and A is a vector containing the weights of edges. In this work, we assume that weights are positive and integer quantities. Denoting Ω as the set of all possible hyperedges, we have that A e is the weight of edge e when e ∈ E, otherwise A e = 0 if e ∈ Ω ⧹ E. Given these definitions, the observed edge set E can equivalently be represented as E = { e ∈ Ω ∣ A e > 0}. We represent the covariates on nodes as a matrix, where Z is the number of attributes, with entries equal to 1 if the node i has attribute z and 0 otherwise. We note that a node can have several types of covariates, e.g. gender and age, which are then one-hot encoded as attributes.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^1122Lxev]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Appendix E — Monitoring patients during withdrawal management — specifies minimum monitoring frequencies and use of withdrawal symptom scales by substance. For alcohol, re-assessment using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) at least every 8 hours during alcohol withdrawal management until the CIWA-Ar score remains below 10 for 24 hours; if the CIWA-Ar is ≥ 19, repeat the CIWA-Ar at least every 6 hours during alcohol withdrawal management until the score falls below 19, then continue monitoring with the CIWA-Ar at least every 8 hours until the score remains below 10 for 24 hours. For sedatives, perform daily clinical assessment by a qualified health care professional for at least the first week or as condition indicates, then after the first week re-assess by a qualified health care professional at least two times per week until withdrawal management is complete. For opioids, monitor using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Score (COWS) at least every 4 hours for patients who report use of a short-acting opioid (e.g., heroin, oxycodone, fentanyl), and monitor using the COWS at least every 8 hours for patients who report using long-acting opioids (e.g., extended-release formulations, methadone). For stimulants, monitoring, at an interval determined by the treating clinician, is for suicide risk, cardiac complications, severe or persistent psychosis, significant agitation, and possible opioid withdrawal (due to potential contamination of stimulant drugs). The page cautions that the most frequent monitoring noted is the minimum expectation and providers may need to increase monitoring, and it notes that clinical assessments should be conducted by qualified health care professionals not less than twice per day, not more than 16 hours apart unless otherwise stated.

### E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury: developing a research agenda. An NIH workshop report [^116eY4wH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The NHLBI convened a working group on October 23, 2019, to identify the most relevant and urgent research priorities and prevailing challenges in e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Experts across multiple disciplines discussed the complexities of the EVALI outbreak, identified research priorities, and recommended strategies to address most effectively its causal factors and improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease. Many research priorities were identified, including the need to create national and international registries of patients with EVALI, to track accurately those affected and assess outcomes. The group concluded that biospecimens from subjects with EVALI are urgently needed to help define EVALI pathogenesis and that vaping has disease risks that are disparate from smoking, with the occurrence of EVALI highlighting the importance of broadening e-cigarette research beyond comparators to smoking-related diseases.

Table 5
The summary of chloroplast genes used for determination of maternal genome donor of E. coracana

Concatenated phylogenetic trees were rooted using chloroplast and ortholog genes separately (Figure 2A, 2B). In the chloroplast gene derived tree, E. coracana, E. africana, and E. indica formed a clade that is sister to E. tristachya. A close phylogenetic relationship of E. coracana, E. africana, and E. indica further supports the hypothesis of E. indica as the maternal genome donor to the crop species E. coracana. Nuclear gene tree analyses eliminate E. floccifolia, E. intermedia, and E. multiflora as potential maternal genome donors with high bootstrap support. It does not eliminate E. indica or E. tristachya as a potential maternal genome donor. Our use of single copy genes from an allotetraploid that may have differences in homeologous gene expression limits the conclusions that can be drawn. To better understand the contributions of each subgenome to the super-matrix, subgenome identity was also predicted from individual gene tree topology (Figure S2). These results support E. indica as the maternal genome donor of E. coracana and again a close relationship between E. indica and E. tristachya, and also between E. floccifolia and E. multiflora. Our maternal genome donor conclusions are consistent with approaches such as genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), cytogenetic analysis, and phylogenetic analysis that conclude E. indica is the maternal parent of E. coracana.also constructed a molecular phylogenetic analysis using two low-copy-number genes in E. coracana and concluded that E. indica was close to E. coracana, consistent with our phylogenetic analysis. Chloroplast DNA is highly conserved and its potential usefulness in phylogenetic studies has been well documented. Here, we broadened the E. coracana maternity analysis to all assembled chloroplast genes in all our Eleusine transcriptome profiles. In addition, a close relationship between E. floccifolia and E. multiflora was supported by both of the phylogenetic trees. This relationship has been reported byusing trnT-trnF region of plastid DNA, byusing nuclear EF-1a data and byusing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 4 (Pepc4) gene.

### Perceived stress and E-cigarette use during emerging adulthood: a longitudinal examination of initiation, progression, and continuation [^114cbyXL]. Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

E-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product among youth and young adults in the US. Limited research has examined how stress impacts e-cigarette use among young people. We examine the longitudinal associations between perceived stress scale (PSS) score and e-cigarette use behaviors among a diverse cohort of emerging adults. We analyzed two waves of data collected in Fall 2019 (baseline) and Spring 2020 (6-month follow-up) of the Texas Adolescent Tobacco and Marketing Surveillance (TATAMS) system. Participants were classified into three mutually exclusive subsamples at baseline: (1) n = 1177 never e-cigarette users; (2) n = 806 ever but not current (past 30-day) e-cigarette users (i.e., ever users); and (3) n = 257 current (past 30-day) e-cigarette users. Three multivariate logistic regression models examined the relationship between PSS at baseline and: (1) initiation among never users; (2) progression to current use among ever users; and (3) continuation among current users, at 6-month follow-up. PSS scores were standardized using z-scores. Models controlled for race/ethnicity, sex, age, ever marijuana use, and ever use of other tobacco products. Mean age ranged from 18.6 to 19.4 among cohorts. Risk for e-cigarette progression among ever users (aOR: 1.30; 95%CI: 1.01–1.69) and e-cigarette continuation among current users (aOR: 1.33 (95%CI: 1.01–1.75) increased with each unit increase in PSS score at baseline. PSS at baseline was not associated with e-cigarette initiation among never users. PSS predicted greater risk of e-cigarette progression and continuation but not initiation among a diverse cohort of emerging adults. E-cigarette prevention and cessation strategies should consider perceived stress an important risk factor for e-cigarette use during emerging adulthood.

### E-cadherin is required for metastasis in multiple models of breast cancer [^1149Ag34]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Metastasis is the major driver of death in patients with cancer. Invasion of surrounding tissues and metastasis have been proposed to initiate following loss of the intercellular adhesion protein, E-cadherin 1,2, on the basis of inverse correlations between in vitro migration and E-cadherin levels 3. However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the observation that most breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas and express E-cadherin in primary tumours and metastases 4. To resolve this discrepancy, we tested the genetic requirement for E-cadherin in metastasis using mouse and human models of both luminal and basal invasive ductal carcinomas. Here we show that E-cadherin promotes metastasis in diverse models of invasive ductal carcinomas. While loss of E-cadherin increased invasion, it also reduced cancer cell proliferation and survival, circulating tumour cell number, seeding of cancer cells in distant organs and metastasis outgrowth. Transcriptionally, loss of E-cadherin was associated with upregulation of genes involved in transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), reactive oxygen species and apoptosis signalling pathways. At the cellular level, disseminating E-cadherin-negative cells exhibited nuclear enrichment of SMAD2/3, oxidative stress and increased apoptosis. Colony formation of E-cadherin-negative cells was rescued by inhibition of TGFβ-receptor signalling, reactive oxygen accumulation or apoptosis. Our results reveal that E-cadherin acts as a survival factor in invasive ductal carcinomas during the detachment, systemic dissemination and seeding phases of metastasis by limiting reactive oxygen-mediated apoptosis. Identifying molecular strategies to inhibit E-cadherin-mediated survival in metastatic breast cancer cells may have potential as a therapeutic approach for breast cancer.

### Effects of ephedrine, caffeine, and their combination on muscular endurance [^112AfT9r]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of ingesting caffeine (C), ephedrine (E), and their combination on muscular endurance, using a double-blind, repeated measures design.

Methods

Ninety minutes after ingesting either C (4 mg x kg-1), E (0.8 mg x kg-1), a combination of C+E, or a placebo (P), 13 male subjects performed a weight-training circuit consisting of three supersets (SS), each SS consisting of leg press (at 80% of 1 RM to exhaustion) followed by bench press (at 70% 1-RM to exhaustion); 2 min of rest intervened between SS.

Results

The trials involving ephedrine ingestion (C+E and E), when compared with the nonephedrine trials (C and P), caused significant increases (P < 0.05) in the mean number of repetitions completed for both the leg-press and bench-press exercises but only during the first SS. During that first set, the mean number (± SD) of repetitions for leg press was 19 ± 8, 16 ± 7, 14 ± 6, and 13 ± 5 for the C+E, E, C, and P trials, respectively. The mean numbers of repetitions for the first set of bench-press exercise were 14 ± 3, 13 ± 3, 12 ± 3, and 12 ± 3 for the C+E, E, C, and P trials, respectively. As a result, the total weight lifted during all three sets was greater for the trials involving ephedrine ingestion. Systolic blood pressure before exercise was significantly increased with both ephedrine treatment trials when compared with the other trials (C+E = 156 ± 29 mm Hg; E = 150 ± 14; C = 141 ± 16; P = 138 ± 14).

Conclusion

It was concluded that acute ingestion of C+E and E increases muscular endurance during the first set of traditional resistance-training exercise. The performance enhancement was attributed primarily to the effects of E; there was no additive effect of C.

### Association of socioeconomic position with e-cigarette use among individuals who quit smoking in england, 2014 to 2019 [^1172QHQm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is socioeconomic position associated with use of e-cigarettes among those who formerly smoked, and has use e-cigarette use changed over time?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 34 442 individuals who formerly smoked, e-cigarette use increased among all who had not smoked for at least 1 year but was highest among those with lower socioeconomic position. Among those who quit smoking before 2011, there was no evidence for an association between socioeconomic position and e-cigarette use.

Meaning

In this study, lower socioeconomic position was associated with higher rates of e-cigarette use among those who quit smoking after e-cigarettes became widely available, likely reflecting continued use of e-cigarettes as a long-term cessation aid among individuals with lower socioeconomic positions.

### Assessment of patterns in e-cigarette use among adults in the US, 2017–2020 [^112yNxse]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The weighted prevalence of current e-cigarette use was 4.4% (95% CI, 4.3%-4.5%) in 2017, which increased to 5.5% (95% CI, 5.4%-5.7%) in 2018, then decreased slightly to 5.1% (95% CI, 4.9%-5.3%) in 2020. The prevalence of daily e-cigarette use increased steadily from 1.5% (95% CI, 1.4%-1.6%) in 2017 to 2.1% (95% CI, 2.0%-2.2%) in 2018 and 2.3% (95% CI, 2.2%-2.4%) in 2020. The proportion of current e-cigarette users who reported daily use therefore increased from 34.5% (95% CI, 33.1%-36.0%) in 2017 to 37.3% (95% CI, 35.5%-39.1%) in 2018 and 44.4% (95% CI, 42.5%-46.3%) in 2020 (Figure 1).

### E-cigarette use and lung cancer screening uptake [^117Vk3Zn]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, e-cigarette use was independently associated with lower use of LCS, particularly among individuals who had quit smoking combustible cigarettes. Emerging research suggests that e-cigarettes contain definite and probable carcinogens and cause similar cancer-associated gene deregulations as combustible tobacco. However, it has been shown that two-thirds of individuals currently using e-cigarettes consider e-cigarettes to be less harmful than combustible cigarettes. Thus, individuals who use e-cigarettes may have lower awareness of lung cancer risks. Limitations of this study include cross-sectional study design, self-reported smoking and LCS information, and inability to assess the impact of switching between cigarettes and e-cigarettes on LCS uptake. Our results highlighted the importance of raising awareness and rectifying misconceptions of e-cigarette use. Former smokers who use e-cigarettes remain at increased risk of lung cancer and should be targeted by interventions to improve adherence to LCS.

### Patterns and predictors of e-cigarette, cigarette and dual use uptake in UK adolescents: evidence from a 24-month prospective study [^115zowVm]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

To assess prevalence and predictors of e-cigarettes/cigarettes patterns of use in adolescents in England.

Design

Prospective study with 24-month follow-up of e-cigarette/cigarette ever/regular use with data from an intervention evaluation.

Setting

Forty-five schools in England (Staffordshire and Yorkshire).

Participants

A total of 3210 adolescents who, at baseline, were aged 13–14 years and had never used e-cigarettes/cigarettes.

Measurements

Based on e-cigarette/cigarette ever use at follow-up, six groups were created: (a) never user, (b) e-cigarette only, (c) cigarette only, (d) dual use-order of use unclear, (e) dual use-e-cigarettes used first and (f) dual use-cigarettes used first. Baseline measures were: gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, impulsivity, family plus friend smoking and smoking-related beliefs (attitude and perceived behavioural control).

Findings

In groups (a) to (f), there were 71.5, 13.3, 3.3, 5.7, 2.9 and 3.4% adolescents, respectively. Among groups using cigarettes, regular smoking was more prevalent in group (f) (dual use-cigarettes used first) [17.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 10.4, 24.8] than in groups (c), (d) and (e) combined (7.3%, 95% CI = 4.7, 9.9). Among groups using e-cigarettes, regular use was less prevalent in group (b) (e-cigarette only) (1.9%, 95% CI = 0.6, 3.2) than in groups (d), (e) and (f) combined (12.2%, 95% CI = 8.9, 15.5). Higher impulsivity plus friends and family smoking were predictive of being in groups (b) to (f) compared with group (a) (never users). Males were more likely to be in group (b) compared to group (a); females were more likely to be in groups (c) to (f) compared to group (a).

Conclusions

Regular use of e-cigarettes/cigarettes varies across groups defined by ever use of e-cigarettes/cigarettes. Interventions targeted at tackling impulsivity or adolescents whose friends and family members smoke may represent fruitful avenues for future research.

### The two faces of hepatitis E virus [^116tQ43A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has at least 2 distinct epidemiological profiles: (1) large outbreaks and epidemics in developing countries, usually caused by HEV genotype 1, resulting in high morbidity and mortality among pregnant women and young children, and (2) very few symptomatic cases of HEV genotype 3, most cases without symptoms or clear source(s) of infection, but frequent seroreactivity in 5%-21% of asymptomatic persons in developed countries. We urge more epidemiological studies and public health interventions, including the promotion and development of existing and future vaccine candidates and the availability of US Food and Drug Administration-approved serological assays for this underappreciated and poorly understood virus, a major cause of disease throughout the world.

Participants were 15.4% Black (95% CI, 15.0%-15.7%), 24.1% Hispanic (95% CI, 23.9%-24.4%), 75.9% non-Hispanic (95% CI, 75.6%-76.1%), 69.1% White (95% CI, 68.5%-69.8%), and 15.5% another race (95% CI, 14.9%-16.1%).

Transitions in e-Cigarette Use Between 2019 and 2021

e-Cigarette Initiation

Table 1 shows longitudinal transitions in e-cigarette use among youth aged 12 to 17 years in 2019. Overall, among those who did not use e-cigarettes in 2019, 531 (6.5%) initiated e-cigarette use in 2021 (Table 1). Among those who initiated e-cigarette use in 2021, 415 (76.8%) initiated with a flavor/device combination other than a sweet flavor in a cartridge device, and 54 (11.4%) initiated with a sweet flavor in a cartridge device (Table 1). Among those who initiated e-cigarette use in 2021, 40 (8.0%) initiated with Hyde brand e-cigarettes, 40 (6.6%) initiated with Puff Bar, 27 (5.6%) initiated with Juul, 28 (5.2%) initiated with Vuse, and the remaining 396 (74.6%) initiated with some other brand or did not know the brand (Table 1). Most (466 [86.8%]) of those who initiated e-cigarette use in 2021 used e-cigarettes that contained nicotine, and close to one-third (169 [30.6%]) of those who initiated used e-cigarettes on 20 or more days during the previous 30 days (Table 1).

### Electronic cigarettes and nicotine clinical pharmacology [^111pQTwo]. Tobacco Control (2014). Low credibility.

In another study, Vansickel et al measured plasma nicotine concentrations after multiple puffs on an 18 mg nicotine/mL e-cigarette (Vapor King) in 20 cigarette smokers. Although no participants were also current e-cigarette users, some had sampled them in the past. Plasma nicotine concentrations increased significantly after the fourth 10-puff bout. After the sixth (and final) bout, mean plasma nicotine concentrations increased from 2.2 to 7.4 ng/mL, yet remained below reported values for traditional cigarettes.

A recent study by Flouris et al measured serum cotinine (the primary nicotine metabolite) levels after 15 cigarette smokers smoked their own brand cigarette or an e-cigarette (Giant, 11 mg nicotine/mL). Cigarette smokers who reported using e-cigarettes in the past were specifically excluded from this study. To ensure similar nicotine delivery between the cigarette and e-cigarette conditions, a pilot study surveyed 141 current e-cigarette users about their e-cigarette and former cigarette use behaviours, and determined that the traditional cigarette/e-cigarette nicotine absorption ratio was 1.5, confirming earlier findings that e-cigarettes deliver lower amounts of nicotine than traditional cigarettes. Participants were instructed to smoke two own brand cigarettes or, in the e-cigarette group, puff behaviours were individually tailored to approximate nicotine delivery from their own brand cigarette. Immediately and 1 h following both product use sessions, serum cotinine levels were significantly higher than baseline. Because this study attempted to normalise nicotine delivery between the two products, these results suggest that e-cigarettes are capable of delivering similar amounts of nicotine as traditional cigarettes.

These studies suggest that e-cigarettes deliver modest amounts of nicotine to the inexperienced user. However, Bullen and colleagues reported that e-cigarettes were rated less desirable compared to own brand cigarettes, and it is likely that different (and unaccustomed) use behaviours account for some differences between e-cigarette and own brand cigarette nicotine exposure.

### Trajectories of e-cigarette advertising exposure, e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking in a sample of young adults from Hawaii [^1127gBcX]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To test whether intrapersonal growth in e-cigarette advertising exposure over time is associated with growth in e-cigarette use and/or cigarette smoking.

Design

Longitudinal study using four waves of data were collected in 6-month intervals between 2018 and 2020.

Setting and Participants

Participants were 2327 young adults recruited from colleges in Hawaii, USA.

Measurements

Data were collected on demographics, e-cigarette advertising exposure measured using the cued- recall method and recent (past 30-day) cigarette and e-cigarette use.

Findings

The average trajectory for e-cigarette advertising exposure over time was significant and upward [M slope = 0.18 (0.14–0.22), P < 0.0001]. However, average trajectories for e-cigarette [M slope = -0.08 (-0.18 to 0.02), P = 0.09] and cigarette [M slope = -0.14 (-0.30 to 0.02), P = 0.07] use were not. There were significant differences in individual level trajectories across participants for advertising exposure [σ 2 = 0.12 (0.10–0.14), P < 0.0001], e-cigarette use [σ 2 = 0.22 (0.14–0.30), and cigarette smoking (σ 2 = 0.17 [0.09–0.25], P < 0.0001). Individuals with an increasing rate of advertising exposure showed an increasing rate of e-cigarette use [B = 0.63 (0.36–0.90), P < 0.0001). Neither initial level of, nor rate of change in, advertising exposure was significantly associated with cigarette smoking growth factors (P > 0.05). Higher initial level of e-cigarette use was associated with higher initial level of cigarette smoking [B = 0.89 (0.69–1.09), P < 0.0001] but decreased rate of cigarette smoking over time [B = -0.12 (-0.20 to -0.04) P = 0.003]. Rate of change in e-cigarette use was not associated with the rate of change in cigarette smoking (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Increased exposure to e-cigarette advertising appears to be associated with increased e-cigarette use but not with increased cigarette smoking. Higher initial level of e-cigarette use appears to be associated with higher initial level of cigarette smoking but may be associated with a decreasing rate of cigarette smoking over time.

### Identification of a pocket factor that is critical to zika virus assembly [^116n673B]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The presence of the lipid is critical to function

To test the significance and understand the mechanism of ZIKV lipid incorporation, we used the cryo-EM structure to guide a mutagenesis study (Fig. 3). For the crooked lipid, the amino acid side chains subjected to mutagenesis were selected from M (Thr 57 and Ser 58) and E proteins (Trp 474). For the Y-shaped lipid, mutagenesis-targeted residues E H446, E F449, E F453. Initially, the following alanine substitutions were made in M protein (M T57A, and M S58A) and E protein (E H446A, E F449A, E F453A, E W474A, and E F497A) using a full-length ZIKV cDNA clone. Plaque assays were performed to assess the effect of the mutations on the virus life cycle. Alanine substitutions of M residues T57A and S58A did not affect virus production, while alanine substitution of E-protein residues (F449A, F453A, H446A, W474A, and F497A) were lethal for ZIKV. The amino acid Trp 474, which is located near the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer and presumably contacting the headgroup of the lipid density, was selected for further mutagenesis. To test which side-chain identities would be tolerated near the lipid headgroup, the following mutations were generated: E W474H, E W474Y, E W474R, E W474F (Fig. 3). Single-amino-acid substitutions of E W474H and E W474R produced a lethal phenotype, whereas E W474F and E W474Y did not significantly affect virus production and gave rise to medium plaques. Thus, the mechanism of lipid incorporation depends on maintaining the hydrophobicity of the newly identified inner leaflet pocket. Additionally, the presence of both the crooked lipid in the pocket and the Y-shaped lipid in the hydrophobic cleft were critical for the ZIKV life cycle.

Structure-based mutagenesis demonstrates lipid interactions are essential for virus release.

a – c The MR-766 M and E proteins (yellow and blue ribbon, respectively) illustrate the location of residues interacting with the lipid densities that were chosen for mutational analysis (red). d Plaque assays of the mutant viruses compared to wild-type MR-766 virus showed that all but four mutations were lethal. Data shown are from three technical replicates of one biological experiment, and the data are expressed as the mean with standard error (SEM).

### The drosophila enhancer of split gene complex: architecture and coordinate regulation by notch, cohesin, and polycomb group proteins [^111HQtfd]. G3 (2013). Low credibility.

The cohesin protein complex functionally interacts with Polycomb group (PcG) silencing proteins to control expression of several key developmental genes, such as the Drosophila Enhancer of split gene complex [E(spl)-C]. The E(spl)-C contains 12 genes that inhibit neural development. In a cell line derived from the central nervous system, cohesin and the PRC1 PcG protein complex bind and repress E (spl)-C transcription, but the repression mechanisms are unknown. The genes in the E(spl)-C are directly activated by the Notch receptor. Here we show that depletion of cohesin or PRC1 increases binding of the Notch intracellular fragment to genes in the E(spl)-C, correlating with increased transcription. The increased transcription likely reflects both direct effects of cohesin and PRC1 on RNA polymerase activity at the E(spl)-C, and increased expression of Notch ligands. By chromosome conformation capture we find that the E(spl)-C is organized into a self-interactive architectural domain that is co-extensive with the region that binds cohesin and PcG complexes. The self-interactive architecture is formed independently of cohesin or PcG proteins. We posit that the E(spl)-C architecture dictates where cohesin and PcG complexes bind and act when they are recruited by as yet unidentified factors, thereby controlling the E(spl)-C as a coordinated domain.

### Polymorphisms within the human leucocyte antigen-E gene and their associations with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis as well as clinical outcome of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy [^116eeuUF]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Involvement of the non-classical human leucocyte antigen-E (HLA-E) in both innate and acquired immune response suggests its possible role in development of autoimmune pathologies. This study was undertaken to investigate relationships between the HLA-E gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as to evaluate a potential of these polymorphisms to modulate clinical outcome of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment in female patients. A total of 223 female patients with RA receiving anti-TNF biological therapy and 134 female healthy subjects were enrolled into the study. Genotypings for two SNPs within the HLA-E gene (rs1264457 HLA-E✱01:01/01:03; rs1059510 HLA-E✱01:03:01/01:03:02) were performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification employing LightSNiP assays. Clinical response was evaluated according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria at 12 and 24 weeks after initiation of the therapy. The frequency of the HLA-E✱01:01/01:01 genotype was decreased significantly in RA patients in comparison to controls (P = 0.031). The presence of the HLA-E✱01:01/01:01 genotype in patients correlated with better EULAR response after 12 weeks of anti-TNF treatment, while 01:03 allele carriers were generally unresponsive to the treatment (P = 0.014). The HLA-E✱01:03/01:03 genotype was also over-represented among non-responding patients in comparison to HLA-E✱01:01/01:01 homozygotes (P = 0.021). With respect to the HLA-E rs1059510 variation, a better response after 12 weeks was observed more frequently in patients carrying the HLA-E✱01:03:01/01:03:01 genotype than other genotypes (P = 0.009). The results derived from this study imply that HLA-E polymorphisms may influence RA susceptibility and affect clinical outcome of anti-TNF therapy in female RA patients.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Single-atom catalyst for high-performance methanol oxidation [^1135yqWa]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The binding energy of one Pt atom with the substrate was evaluated as E bind = E (Pt-sub) ‒ E (Pt) ‒ E (sub), where E (Pt-sub) and E (sub) are the energies of the system with one Pt atom and the pure substrate, respectively, and E (Pt) is the total energy per atom for Pt bulk metal. The transition states (TSs) were located by the combination of both the nudged elastic band (NEB) method and the dimer method –. All the TSs were confirmed by noticing only one imaginary vibrational frequency. The adsorption energy of the intermediate was calculated by Δ E ads = E (adsorbate-sub) ‒ E (sub) ‒ E (adsorbate), where E (adsorbate-sub) is the energy of the system with the adsorbate on the substrate, E (sub) is the energy of the clean substrate, and E (adsorbate) is the energy of the isolated adsorbate molecule in the vacuum. The adsorption free energy was further calculated as Δ G ads = Δ E ads + ΔZPE ‒ T Δ S, where ΔZPE is the change of zero-point energies, and Δ S is the entropy difference, and T is the temperature (298.15 K). The activation energy was calculated as E a = E (TS) ‒ E (IS), where E (TS) and E (IS) are the energies for the TS and the initial state (IS).

E 1, serum estrone; E 1 S, serum estrone sulfate; E 1 S/E 1, ratio of estrone sulfate to estrone in serum; E 2, serum 17β-estradiol, E 2 S, serum estradiol sulfate, E 2 S/E 2 = ratio of estradiol sulfate to 17β-estradiol in serum.

The serum concentration of E 2 S also was associated with SLCO1B1 rs4149056 SNP genotype after adjustment for treatment (P = 0.008). The TT genotype was associated with a lower serum E 2 S concentration than the CT or CC genotypes (Fig. 1, Table 1). Further analysis for interactions between genotype, treatment, and E 2 S concentration revealed that the strength of the association between rs4149056 SNP genotype and E 2 S concentration was stronger in the group of women assigned to tE 2 than the women taking oCEE (P value for the interaction between genotype and treatment arm in the model was 0.056 for the SNP × oCEE treatment group and 0.013 for the SNP × tE 2 treatment group). The ratio of E 2 S/E 2 trended toward a lower ratio with increasing T alleles, but was not significant (P = 0.070). The interaction term for SNP × oCEE treatment in the model was significant (P = 0.043), indicating that the ratio of E 2 S/E 2 is significantly associated with rs4149056 genotype in this treatment group. There was no association between E 2 concentration and rs4149056 before or after adjusting for treatment group (P = 0.493 and 0.169, respectively).

### Triazolam [^113JPZFd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Characterizing long COVID in an international cohort: 7 months of symptoms and their impact [^112Ue6Vy]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A significant number of patients with COVID-19 experience prolonged symptoms, known as Long COVID. Few systematic studies have investigated this population, particularly in outpatient settings. Hence, relatively little is known about symptom makeup and severity, expected clinical course, impact on daily functioning, and return to baseline health.

Methods

We conducted an online survey of people with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, distributed via COVID-19 support groups (e.g. Body Politic, Long COVID Support Group, Long Haul COVID Fighters) and social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Data were collected from September 6, 2020 to November 25, 2020. We analyzed responses from 3762 participants with confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive; 1020) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested; 2742) COVID-19, from 56 countries, with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020. We estimated the prevalence of 203 symptoms in 10 organ systems and traced 66 symptoms over seven months. We measured the impact on life, work, and return to baseline health.

Findings

For the majority of respondents (> 91%), the time to recovery exceeded 35 weeks. During their illness, participants experienced an average of 55.9 ± 25.5 (mean ± STD) symptoms, across an average of 9.1 organ systems. The most frequent symptoms after month 6 were fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. Symptoms varied in their prevalence over time, and we identified three symptom clusters, each with a characteristic temporal profile. 85.9% of participants (95% CI, 84.8% to 87.0%) experienced relapses, primarily triggered by exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 1700 respondents (45.2%) required a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness, and an additional 839 (22.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to illness. Cognitive dysfunction or memory issues were common across all age groups (~88%). Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all symptoms were similar between groups with confirmed and suspected COVID-19.

Interpretation

Patients with Long COVID report prolonged, multisystem involvement and significant disability. By seven months, many patients have not yet recovered (mainly from systemic and neurological/cognitive symptoms), have not returned to previous levels of work, and continue to experience significant symptom burden.

Estrogen metabolizing enzyme expression defines CRC estrogenic proliferative response

Because human CRC exhibited dysregulated estrogen metabolism, we hypothesized that CRC cell lines expressing E 2 synthesis pathways might be more responsive to estrogen signaling. Thus, we determined the expression patterns of key estrogen-metabolizing enzymes in selected CRC cells. Compared with human CRC tissue, HCT116 and HT-29 cells exhibited similar HSD17Β mRNA (data not shown) and protein (Fig. 2A) expression (i.e. lack of HSD17Β1, presence of HSD17Β7 and HSD17Β12, and limited HSD17Β2 expression). In contrast, Caco2 cells have low HSD17Β7 and HSD17Β12 expression and higher HSD17Β2 expression. Colo205 cells had low or no HSD17B mRNA (data not shown) and protein expression; thus, these cells were not used in further testing. When incubated for 72 hours with E 1 (Fig. 2B; raw absorbance data shown in) or E 2 (Fig. 2C; raw absorbance data shown in) in sFBS media, HCT116 and HT-29 cells had increasing dose-dependent proliferative rates compared with the sFBS media controls. The Caco2 cells failed to respond to E 1 or E 2 stimulation.

1 EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the emergency use of GOHIBIC for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, GOHIBIC is not FDA-approved for this use.

Justification for Emergency Use of Drugs During the COVID-19 Pandemic

There is currently an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus. The Secretary of HHS has:

Determined that there is a public health emergency, or significant potential for a public health emergency, related to COVID-19.
Declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biological products for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

An EUA is a FDA authorization for the emergency use of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product (i.e., drug, biological product, or device) in the United States under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, when the Secretary of HHS declares that there is a public health emergency, or significant potential for a public health emergency that affects the national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves biological agent(s) or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent(s). Criteria for issuing an EUA include:

The biological agent(s) can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition;
Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence (including data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available), it is reasonable to believe that:
The product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
The known and potential benefits of the product – when used to diagnose, prevent or treat such disease or condition – outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, taking into consideration the material threat posed by the biological agent(s)
There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the serious or life-threatening disease or condition.

A monochromatized 200 keV electron is also focused on the sample and scanned to acquire EELS, EEGS, and CL signals. EEGS measurements are taken by synchronizing light (using a laser trigger) and electrons (through an e-beam blanker) at the detector. b A series of EELS spectra is acquired for a given electron probe position as the laser wavelength is scanned over the spectral region of interest (simulated data). The strength of the energy-gain signal is boosted when the light wavelength is close to an optical resonance of the specimen. c Schematic of a resonance probed by EEGS in a constant laser power regime. The energy-gain signal yields the EEGS intensity as a function of light wavelength, only limited by the nominal laser linewidth (7 μeV for the laser used in this study).

The EEGS electron-light coupling is described by a single parameter:where R e is the transverse electron probe position, v is the electron velocity, ω is the angular frequency of the external light, and E z is the optical electric field component along the e-beam direction z, corresponding to a time-varying field, which is dependent on the focal beam profile and position relative to the specimen (see SI). In our experiment, we use a low peak-intensity illumination, such that ∣ β ∣ 2 ≪ 1 is the probability for the electron to gain one photon quantum (i.e. the EEGS signal is essentially a perturbation).

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

-Fenoprofen Calcium, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS - Cardiovascular Effects).
-Fenoprofen Calcium, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS - Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).
-Fenoprofen Calcium, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
-Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.
-Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
-Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
-Starting at 30-weeks gestation, Fenoprofen Calcium and other NSAIDs should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur.

### HLA-E-restricted immune responses are crucial for the control of EBV infections and the prevention of PTLD [^114nZSvN]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

We then compared the viral spread and the CD8 + T-cell activation levels between cells, expressing either the HLA-E∗0103/0103 or the HLA-E∗0101/0101 variant. SQAPLPCVL -specific, HLA-E–restricted CD8 + T cells prevented the viral spread to a significantly higher extent in K562-CR2- HLA-E∗0103/0103, compared with K562-CR2- HLA-E∗0101/0101, cells (Figure 2 C). Vice versa, K562-CR2- HLA-E∗0103/0103 cells elicited a significantly higher level of CD8 + T-cell activation, as reflected by more IFN-γ–expressing cells, compared with K562-CR2- HLA-E∗0101/0101 cells (Figure 2 D).

To analyze whether the HLA-E variants also have an impact on the expansion of SQAPLPCVL -specific, HLA-E–restricted CD8 + T cells, we cultured K562- HLA -E∗0103/0103 or K562- HLA -E∗0101/0101 cells together with sorted carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester-stained SQAPLPCVL -specific, HLA-E–restricted CD8 + T cells and subsequently analyzed the proliferating CD8 + T-cell subsets. Stimulation with K562- HLA -E∗0103/0103 cells led to a significantly higher proliferation of SQAPLPCVL -specific, HLA-E–restricted CD8 + T cells, compared with stimulation with K562-HLA-E∗0101/0101 cells (Figure 2 E).

Overall, the data demonstrate that the HLA-E∗0103/0103 variant is better stabilized by the BZLF1- derived SQAPLPCVL peptide, which further leads to a robust proliferation and activation of EBV-specific, HLA-E–restricted CD8 + T cells.

### Discontinuous epidemic transition due to limited testing [^117W633Q]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Spatial epidemic model

Our base model is a spatial SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model, in which a population P = 3162 × 3162 is represented by a two-dimensional grid where each grid point represents an individual. In addition to the above four compartments we distinguish between symptomatic (I S) and weak-symptom (I W) individuals, where the latter ranges from people who may have nonspecific symptoms (e.g. coughing) to entirely asymptomatic. With the introduction of intervention measures aimed at containing the disease spread, the individuals in the states S, E, I S, and I W can be put under quarantine (Q S for S, Q E for E, and Q I for I S and I W). All the eight states and the possible transition paths are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and described in the caption. Simulations start from a small group of 100 I W that are randomly scattered across the grid. Each infectious individual (I S or I W) is assigned an infectious period, which is drawn from a Gamma distribution with mean 4 days and one day as scale parameter. During the infectious period these individuals can interact with each of the four neighbors and a randomly chosen additional individual. The disease is transmitted with a given probability, if the target individuals are susceptible (cf. Fig. 1). After the infectious period I S and I W transform into recovered (R) and can not interact any more with the population. Once a susceptible individual is infected, it transforms into exposed (E) and is assigned an incubation period, which is drawn from a Gamma distribution with mean 3 days and one day as scale parameter. After the incubation period is elapsed, the state of the individual is transformed from E into I W with probability p W = 0.5. For a large population size, p W thus represents the ratio of weak-symptom cases to the infected population. The transmission probability is chosen to reproduce the average growth rate observed during the early exponential phase of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we run several simulations without any containment and we pick the transmission probability that minimizes the difference from the growth ∝exp(κ t) with rate κ = 0.3 day −1.

### Evidence for elizabethkingia anophelis transmission from mother to infant, Hong Kong [^114oAWJg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Comparison of Genomes from Human and Mosquito E. anophelis Strains

E. anophelis strains R26 T and Ag1 were isolated from mosquitoes. Compared with those strains, the genomes of the 3 strains we identified possessed 33 unique hypothetical proteins. Moreover, the genetic island consisting of conjugative transposable elements found in strains HKU37 and HKU38 was also absent in the mosquito strains. In contrast to the mosquito strains, which possessed genes encoding for xylose isomerase (XylA) and xylulose kinase (XylB), these 2 genes were absent in the 3 strains we identified. This finding may reflect different requirements for sugar metabolism in E. anophelis under different environments. Notably, despite the presence of XylA and XylB, E. anophelis mosquito strain R26 T did not produce acid from xylose. However, this finding does not exclude the strain's ability to metabolize xylose, as D-xylulose 5-phosphate, the product of XylA and XylB, can be used as a substrate for the pentose-phosphate pathway. XylA and XylB were also absent in the genome of E. meningoseptica type strain ATCC 13253 T, which suggests that mosquito strains of E. anophelis may be evolutionarily distinct from clinical strains of E. anophelis and E. meningoseptica. More genome sequence data from other clinical and environmental strains of E. anophelis may shed light on the ecology, biology, and pathogenesis of E. anophelis.

### Cardiovascular risk indicators and perceived race / ethnic discrimination in the Dallas heart study [^112t3Q6n]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between race/ethnic (r/e) discrimination and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although r/e discrimination is a chronic stressor that might have negative health effects, cardiovascular data related to experiences with discrimination among different r/e groups in the United States remain sparse.

Methods

Using data from the Dallas Heart Study, we assessed the association between perceived r/e discrimination and traditional CVD risk factors, C-reactive protein (CRP), aortic plaque area and wall thickness, and coronary calcium (CAC) score among black, white, and Hispanic participants. Prevalent CAC was defined as a CAC score ≥ 10 Agatston units; CRP elevation was defined as ≥ 3 mg/L. Participants were asked, "Have you ever been discriminated against due to your race/ethnicity? (responses: yes, no, or don't know)".

Results

Blacks reported r/e discrimination more frequently than whites or Hispanics (P < .0001). Blacks who reported r/e discrimination were more likely to be college graduates, to have a family history of myocardial infarction, and to be more physically active than blacks who did not report r/e discrimination (each P < .05). Hispanics who reported r/e discrimination had a higher prevalence of smoking (P < .01) and were more likely to be born in the United States. In models that adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors and medication use, we generally found no association between reports of r/e discrimination and aortic wall thickness, aortic plaque area, prevalent CAC, or elevated CRP in any of the r/e groups. Among blacks, stratification by gender and education did not change the observed relationship between perceived r/e discrimination and CAC or CRP.

Conclusions

Although perceived r/e discrimination is associated with certain health characteristics that may result in negative health outcomes, in general, we found no association of r/e discrimination with either subclinical atherosclerosis as determined by CAC score, aortic wall thickness and aortic plaque area, or inflammation as assessed by elevated CRP levels.

We characterized 12 Exophiala strains isolated from patients over a 15-year period to the species level using phenotypic tests and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and Rpb1 sequencing and described the clinical spectrum of the 12 patients. Eight patients had nail or skin infections, two had invasive infections, and two had colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. ITS and Rpb1 sequencing showed that 11 of the 12 strains were known Exophiala species (E. oligosperma [n = 3], E. jeanselmei [n = 2], E. lecanii-corni [n = 2], E. bergeri [n = 1], E. cancerae [n = 1], E. dermatitidis [n = 1], and E. xenobiotica [n = 1]), which included the first reported cases of onychomycosis caused by E. bergeri and E. oligosperma. The 12th strain (HKU32(T)), isolated from the nail clipping of the right big toe of a 68-year-old female patient with onychomycosis, possessed unique morphological characteristics distinct from other Exophiala species. It grew very slowly and had a velvety colony texture after 28 days, short conidiophores of the same olivaceous color as the supporting hyphae, numerous spores, and no chlamydospore-like cells. ITS, Rpb1, β-tubulin, and β-actin gene sequencing unambiguously showed that HKU32(T) was clustered with but formed branches distinct from other Exophiala species in phylogenetic trees. We propose the new species Exophiala hongkongensis to describe this novel fungus.

### Distinct contributions of tensile and shear stress on E-cadherin levels during morphogenesis [^112pMb36]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The Vinc/E-cad ratio reflects load on adhesion complexes

Mechanical inference and laser ablations provide an estimate for the junctional tension, a macroscopic quantity that is assumed to be uniform along the junction. E-cadherin adhesion complexes, on the other hand, are distributed in clusters along the junction (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1H, J). Adhesion complexes, composed of E-cadherin, β-Catenin, and α-Catenin, mechanically resist the contractile forces from actomyosin. Thus, adhesion complexes could be under differently oriented contractile forces and resist different magnitude of mechanical loads as they couple independently to the actomyosin network. Vinculin can be an estimate of the mechanical load experienced by each adhesion complex, as individual molecules of Vinculin are recruited to α-Catenin, in a load-dependent manner. Given that the Vinc/E-cad ratio correlates with "junctional tension" (a macroscopic quantity), we asked if it can be a readout of the mechanical load at adhesion complexes (a microscopic quantity), potentially providing access to forces at a sub-junctional level.

We address this question by over-expressing E-cadherin to increase its junctional level. The E-cadherin over-expression is expected to reduce the number of Myosin-II molecules per E-cadherin molecule, thereby reducing the load per adhesion complex. The Vinculin level is hence expected to decrease relative to E-cadherin due to a reduction of tension supported by each E-cadherin molecule in the adhesion clusters (Fig. 3a). Indeed, E-cadherin over-expression produced a mild, but significant, increase in its junctional density (Fig. 3b, c), while the distribution of Myosin-II was unchanged (Fig. 3h–j). The junctional tension was also unchanged as shown by recoil velocities after laser ablations (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Concomitantly, there was a reduction in Vinculin density on all junctions (Fig. 3d, e), leading to an even stronger decrease in the Vinc/E-cad ratio (Fig. 3f, g). We suggest that the decrease in Vinculin levels is not due to junctional tension or Myosin-II, as both quantities are unaffected by E-cadherin over-expression, but a response to the decrease of the load per adhesion complex (see Fig. 3a).

(2) How decision makers are reaching their conclusions (ie, who else are they reaching out to for advice)? (3) Which exact positions advisers had? was not always easy to come by. There are signs that some countries' governments and/or Covid-19 task forces are indeed consulting with outside partiesrelevant to the secondary consequences of long-term isolationbut this information is generally not clear and transparent.

In addition, transparency on selection criteria for the task forces themselves is needed to better understand the weight given to the different aspects of the outbreak.

Conclusion

We acknowledge that the information may not be complete, nor completely up to date, given the extremely fast-paced dynamic of the Covid-19 outbreak as well as response measures. We also recognise that Covid-19 task force compositions are not the sole indication of whose voices are included in decision-making. Through the fairly broad range of (mostly) publicly available information analysed, we attempted to understand which groups the task forces were reaching out to within the scope of a rapid analysis. In general, protocols, reports, minutes of task force meetings and lists of externally consulted parties were simply not easily available. Nevertheless, we feel that the broad conclusions we take based on our rapid (but imperfect) analysis still hold based on the information we were able to access. The table above displays the list of countries and their available task force information.

Governments must recognise the multidimensional effects and needs of societyduring this Covid-19 crisis and consult more broadly and across disciplines, within health and beyond health, based on a true multisectoral paradigm. More importantly, more transparency is needed regarding who decision-making bodies are listening to as a basis for their decisions. Now more than ever, the voices of those who are at risk of getting left behind need to be heard. In the end, we must ensure that we do not do more harm than good with the measures in place to protect our at-risk populations.
