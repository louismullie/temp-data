## Question

Is there a suppressive medication for HSV?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a medication that can suppress herpes simplex virus (HSV). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "suppressive therapy" means clinically versus "curative" therapy. Then, I should verify which agents are approved and guideline-recommended for HSV suppression. Next, I will review efficacy data on recurrence reduction, viral shedding, and transmission. After that, I need to check dosing options, including once-daily versus twice-daily regimens, and note any caveats. I should also examine special populations such as people with HIV, pregnant patients, and neonates. Finally, I will clarify what suppression does not do (eradicate latency), confirm safety and resistance considerations, and synthesize a clear, reference-aware conclusion.

> Let me first confirm definitions so I don't conflate terms. "Suppressive therapy" refers to continuous, daily antiviral medication aimed at reducing HSV reactivation, symptomatic outbreaks, and transmission; it is not curative and does not eradicate latent HSV in sensory ganglia, so expectations must be framed correctly [^114Yb6rv] [^115vyebv].

> Next, I should review which medications are used for suppression. The nucleoside analogues acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are the established agents for HSV suppression, with decades of safety and efficacy data and multiple guideline endorsements for this purpose, while topical antivirals are not effective for suppression and are discouraged for routine genital HSV management [^114Yb6rv] [^116hQWg4] [^112qu7uB].

> Wait, let me verify efficacy on recurrences before jumping ahead. Suppressive therapy reduces clinical recurrences by roughly 70–80% in people with frequent outbreaks, and randomized data consistently show lower recurrence risk with acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir compared with placebo; in HIV-negative individuals, valacyclovir 500 mg once daily cut recurrences by about 71% in one large study, with higher daily doses favored in those with very frequent episodes [^114Yb6rv] [^116w8Hf6] [^116vSCmi].

> I will now examine effects on transmission, since that is a key rationale for suppression. In HSV-2–serodiscordant heterosexual couples where the infected partner is HIV-negative, valacyclovir 500 mg daily reduced HSV-2 transmission by about 48%; however, among persons with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection not on ART, suppressive acyclovir did not reduce HSV-2 transmission to partners, underscoring that HIV status and ART use modify benefit and that suppressive HSV therapy is not a substitute for ART in HIV prevention strategies [^114Yb6rv] [^1158pVck] [^114guRbo].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing nuances because not all once-daily regimens are equal across populations. For immunocompetent adults, valacyclovir 500 mg once daily is generally effective, but those with very frequent recurrences (for example, ≥ 10/year) may need valacyclovir 1 g once daily or twice-daily regimens; in people with HIV, twice-daily dosing (for example, acyclovir 400 mg BID, valacyclovir 500 mg BID, or famciclovir 500 mg BID) is preferred and better supported by evidence, and some guidelines list valacyclovir 500 mg BID as the studied dose in this population [^114Yb6rv] [^111w19Ep] [^114DvQcW].

> Let me consider special populations systematically. In pregnancy, suppressive therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir starting at 36 weeks reduces symptomatic recurrences, shedding, and the need for cesarean. Some guidelines extend initiation earlier in high-risk scenarios, and dosing may be adjusted for renal clearance in pregnancy, so shared decision-making and obstetric coordination are essential [^1128e2Jq] [^115nuatv] [^116aemba]. In neonates after acute HSV disease, oral acyclovir suppressive therapy for 6 months reduces cutaneous recurrences and improves neurodevelopmental outcomes in those with CNS disease, supporting a defined secondary prophylaxis course in this group [^111u7dEa] [^116Qek28]. For people with HIV, suppressive therapy is indicated for severe or frequent recurrences and may be considered around ART initiation when CD4 counts are low, but it does not replace ART for HIV outcomes and should be reassessed annually [^111vyT7f] [^113myCVu] [^111w19Ep].

> But wait, what exactly does suppression not accomplish? I need to ensure we are clear on limitations. Suppressive antivirals reduce reactivation and shedding but do not eradicate latent HSV in sensory ganglia, so recurrences can still occur and may rebound after stopping therapy; long-term safety is favorable with low resistance in immunocompetent hosts, and routine laboratory monitoring is not required, though annual reassessment of the need for continued suppression is advised [^116hQWg4] [^114Yb6rv] [^115rk6jJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought topical acyclovir might help with suppression, but I should double-check that. The evidence shows topical antivirals offer minimal clinical benefit for genital HSV and are not recommended for suppression; systemic therapy is required for meaningful reductions in recurrences and transmission, so I should correct that earlier assumption and emphasize oral regimens for suppression [^116hQWg4] [^114Yb6rv].

> Next, I should review emerging options briefly so I don't miss clinically relevant developments. Pritelivir, a helicase-primase inhibitor, reduced shedding and lesions more than valacyclovir in a phase 2 crossover trial, suggesting a potentially more potent suppressive agent, but it is investigational and not yet standard of care; likewise, gene-editing approaches targeting latent HSV are promising in preclinical models but are not clinically available for suppression at this time [^111253H8] [^115vyebv].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, there are effective suppressive medications for HSV: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, given orally on a daily basis, reduce recurrences by about 70–80% in those with frequent outbreaks, lower viral shedding, and in selected populations reduce transmission. Dosing should be individualized, with attention to outbreak frequency, HIV status, and pregnancy, and therapy can be continued long term with periodic reassessment of need [^114Yb6rv] [^111vyT7f] [^112qu7uB].

---

Yes, there are **suppressant medications** for herpes simplex virus (HSV) — acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir — given as daily suppressive therapy to reduce outbreak frequency, severity, and asymptomatic shedding [^114Yb6rv] [^116w8Hf6]. Suppressive therapy is indicated for patients with frequent or severe recurrences, those who want to minimize outbreaks, and for **prevention of transmission to partners** [^111vyT7f] [^112qu7uB]. Valacyclovir 500 mg once daily is commonly used and reduces transmission risk by about 48% in discordant couples [^114Yb6rv] [^1157vWSf]. Suppressive therapy is safe for long-term use, with minimal resistance and adverse effects, and is also recommended in pregnancy from 36 weeks to reduce outbreaks and transmission risk [^114Yb6rv] [^115anYew].

---

## Indications for suppressive therapy

Suppressive therapy is recommended for the following clinical scenarios:

- **Frequent or severe recurrences**: Patients experiencing six or more outbreaks per year or severe, distressing episodes [^112qu7uB] [^1177DZz6].

- **Patient preference**: Individuals who desire to minimize the frequency and severity of recurrences [^111vyT7f].

- **Prevention of transmission**: Patients with HSV-2 infection who wish to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to sexual partners [^114Yb6rv] [^112GqjaT].

- **Pregnancy**: Pregnant women with a history of genital herpes to reduce the risk of recurrent outbreaks and neonatal transmission [^115anYew] [^114JtZy5].

---

## Recommended suppressive medications and dosing regimens

The following antiviral medications are recommended for suppressive therapy:

| **Medication** | **Standard suppressive dosing regimen** |
|-|-|
| Acyclovir | 400 mg orally twice daily [^114Yb6rv] [^1163qaP8] |
| Valacyclovir | 500 mg orally once daily (up to 1 g daily for frequent recurrences) [^114Yb6rv] [^1163qaP8] |
| Famciclovir | 250 mg orally twice daily [^114Yb6rv] [^1163qaP8] |

---

These regimens have been shown to significantly reduce the frequency of recurrences, asymptomatic shedding, and transmission risk [^116w8Hf6] [^117DSMge].

---

## Efficacy of suppressive therapy

Suppressive therapy with these antiviral agents has been extensively studied and demonstrated to be highly effective:

- **Reduction in recurrences**: Suppressive therapy reduces the frequency of HSV recurrences by approximately 70–80% [^114Yb6rv] [^116w8Hf6].

- **Reduction in asymptomatic shedding**: Suppressive therapy significantly reduces asymptomatic viral shedding, thereby decreasing transmission risk [^117DSMge].

- **Prevention of transmission**: Valacyclovir 500 mg once daily reduces the risk of HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners by approximately 48% [^114Yb6rv] [^112GqjaT].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Suppressive therapy with **acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir** is generally well-tolerated. Long-term safety has been documented, with minimal risk of adverse effects or development of **antiviral resistance** [^114Yb6rv] [^115rk6jJ]. Regular monitoring is not routinely required, but **annual reassessment** of the need for continued suppressive therapy is recommended [^114Yb6rv].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Suppressive therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir is recommended starting at 36 weeks gestation to reduce the risk of recurrent outbreaks and neonatal transmission [^115anYew] [^117CTo2H].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Suppressive therapy is particularly beneficial in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV infection, to reduce the frequency and severity of recurrences [^111vyT7f] [^117G5zPg].

- **Resistance**: Although rare, antiviral resistance can occur, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Alternative therapies such as foscarnet may be considered in cases of resistance [^116rFMpx].

---

## Limitations of suppressive therapy

While suppressive therapy effectively controls HSV symptoms and reduces transmission risk, it **does not cure** the infection or eliminate the latent virus from the body [^116hQWg4]. Recurrences may still occur, albeit less frequently, and discontinuation of therapy may result in increased recurrence frequency [^116hQWg4].

---

Suppressive medications for HSV, including acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, are effective in reducing the frequency and severity of recurrences, asymptomatic shedding, and transmission risk. They are recommended for patients with frequent or severe recurrences, those who wish to minimize outbreaks, and for **prevention of transmission to partners**.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) exposure prevention in people with HIV — Consistent condom use reduces HSV-2 acquisition in heterosexual couples and should be encouraged to prevent transmission of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII), and although evidence in men who have sex with men is lacking, consistent condom use should be encouraged (AIII). In heterosexual HIV-negative but HSV-2-serodifferent couples, disclosure of HSV-2 status is associated with reduced risk of HSV-2 transmission. Sexual transmission of HSV most often occurs during episodes of asymptomatic viral shedding, and people with HIV should avoid sexual contact with partners who have overt genital or orolabial herpetic lesions (AII). In people without HIV, valacyclovir 500 mg once daily reduced HSV-2 transmission by 48%, but among people seropositive for HSV-2 and HIV-1 not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), suppressive acyclovir at 400 mg twice daily did not prevent transmission. Suppressive anti-HSV therapy used only for the purpose of preventing HSV-2 transmission to seronegative partners can be considered as part of a shared-decision-making conversation with applicable patients and partners particularly if there is a history of genital ulcer disease (BIII), and patients should be made aware that this strategy may be of modest benefit in preventing transmission (BIII). There are no data available regarding the use of suppressive therapy to prevent genital HSV-1 transmission.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) stromal keratitis — treatment duration and antiviral use: the recommended treatment for HSV stromal keratitis without ulceration should include a topical corticosteroid for at least ten weeks in conjunction with a prophylactic oral antiviral, and a treatment period greater than ten weeks has been recommended because randomized trials found excessively high treatment failure rates six weeks after a ten-week prednisolone taper; the treatment course should be titrated empirically depending on the clinical response; oral antiviral agents are recommended over topical antiviral agents for their safety profile and superior corneal penetration; for HSV keratitis with epithelial ulceration, available evidence suggests a role for therapeutic doses of oral antiviral combined with judicious use of topical corticosteroids.

### Can valaciclovir suppress recurrent genital HSV?… [^1167QZBb]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus infections continue to be a significant problem, particularly in sexually active young adults. After the initial episode of the infection, over 90 percent of patients have clinical recurrence of the infection. Suppressive therapy with acyclovir has been established as both safe and effective in managing recurrent episodes of HSV infection. The recommended dosage for acyclovir is 400 mg twice daily. Valaciclovir is a newer antiviral agent that, because of its greater bioavailability, may be effective in suppressive therapy using once-a-day dosages. Reitano and associates examined the efficacy and safety of various dosage schedules of valaciclovir compared with acyclovir and placebo in the treatment of recurrent genital herpes. The patients were divided into two groups, those with a history of fewer than 10 recurrent HSV episodes and those with 10 or more recurrences.

The six treatment arms of the study included valaciclovir in dosages of 250 mg once daily, 500 mg once daily, 1 g once daily or 250 mg twice daily, acyclovir in a dosage of 400 mg twice daily, and placebo. A total of 1, 479 patients enrolled in the study; 1, 050 patients completed the protocol. The demographics were similar in all the treatment groups. With regard to efficacy, all treatment groups were better than the placebo group. Patients who received valaciclovir and acyclovir twice daily showed no difference in the number of recurrences. The results of these regimens were similar to those of a regimen of acyclovir twice daily. The incidence of adverse outcomes in all of the regimens, including placebo, were similar. Most of the adverse effects were mild and well-tolerated; the most frequent side effects were headache, rhinitis, infection and flu-like syndrome.

The authors conclude that the study supports the use of valaciclovir as suppressive therapy for recurrent genital HSV infections. In patients with a history of less than 10 recurrent episodes per year, 500 mg of valaciclovir once daily is the appropriate starting dosage. In patients with more frequent recurrences, valaciclovir, in a dosage of 1 g daily or 250 mg twice daily, or acyclovir, in a dosage of 400 mg, would be the most effective therapy.

### Treatment of mucocutaneous presentations of herpes simplex virus infections [^116n95aP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types I and II are diverse and quite frequent. After primary infection, the virus establishes a life-long latency in the sensory ganglia and recrudescences may occur at an unpredictable rate. Recurrent labial and genital herpes infections represent the majority of clinical manifestations of HSV infections. Their management is currently well established using evidence-based medicine data. Primary labial herpes is generally not treated with antivirals in otherwise healthy children, although intravenous aciclovir may be offered in severe primary infections, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. The decision whether or not to treat recurrent labial herpes should be evaluated individually and depends on the frequency and severity of relapses, the impairment of the quality of life, and the cost of therapy. Patients with mild disease may benefit from topical therapy, and those with severe and frequent recurrences may be considered for intermittent or long-term oral antiviral therapy. Primary genital herpes is treated with oral or intravenous antivirals, depending on the severity of the infection and associated symptoms. Recurrent genital herpes can be managed with episodic short courses of oral antivirals in patients whose recurrences are moderate to severe and rare, and have a clear prodrome. Patients with > 5 episodes/year, severe recurrences or unrecognisable prodromes may be best managed with long-term suppressive antiviral prophylaxis. HSV is also responsible for a variety of other clinical manifestations, including herpetic whitlow, neonatal infection, disseminated and atypical cutaneous infections, traumatic herpes, eczema herpeticum, and HSV-associated erythema multiforme. HSV infection may also represent a complication following cosmetic procedures of the oro-facial region, surgical and dental interventions, sun exposure and burns. Precise treatment guidelines for these HSV infections are not firmly established.

### Management of oral and genital herpes in the emergency department [^112PaVAG]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of oral and genital herpes has dramatically changed over the past decade. Herpes simplex virus-1, traditionally associated with oral herpes, is now implicated in an increasing percentage of genital herpes cases. The possibility of "autoinoculation" (or self-infection) of anatomic sites other than that of the primary infection has been recognized. New methods of suppression therapy are being examined. These changes have led to a revision in the recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This review discusses herpes infections of the oral and genital mucosa and the suggested approach to the infected patient who presents in the emergency department. Specific attention is given to the CDC's 2006 guidelines for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.

### Acyclovir and transmission of HIV-1 from persons infected with HIV-1 and HSV-2 [^1157vWSf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Most persons who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are also infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), which is frequently reactivated and is associated with increased plasma and genital levels of HIV-1. Therapy to suppress HSV-2 reduces the frequency of reactivation of HSV-2 as well as HIV-1 levels, suggesting that suppression of HSV-2 may reduce the risk of transmission of HIV-1.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of suppressive therapy for HSV-2 (acyclovir at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily) in couples in which only one of the partners was seropositive for HIV-1 (CD4 count, ≥ 250 cells per cubic millimeter) and that partner was also infected with HSV-2 and was not taking antiretroviral therapy at the time of enrollment. The primary end point was transmission of HIV-1 to the partner who was not initially infected with HIV-1; linkage of transmissions was assessed by means of genetic sequencing of viruses.

Results

A total of 3408 couples were enrolled at 14 sites in Africa. Of the partners who were infected with HIV-1, 68% were women, and the baseline median CD4 count was 462 cells per cubic millimeter. Of 132 HIV-1 seroconversions that occurred after randomization (an incidence of 2.7 per 100 person-years), 84 were linked within couples by viral sequencing: 41 in the acyclovir group and 43 in the placebo group (hazard ratio with acyclovir, 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 1.41; P = 0.69). Suppression with acyclovir reduced the mean plasma concentration of HIV-1 by 0.25 log(10) copies per milliliter (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.29; P < 0.001) and the occurrence of HSV-2-positive genital ulcers by 73% (risk ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.36; P < 0.001). A total of 92% of the partners infected with HIV-1 and 84% of the partners not infected with HIV-1 remained in the study for 24 months. The level of adherence to the dispensed study drug was 96%. No serious adverse events related to acyclovir were observed.

Conclusions

Daily acyclovir therapy did not reduce the risk of transmission of HIV-1, despite a reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of 0.25 log(10) copies per milliliter and a 73% reduction in the occurrence of genital ulcers due to HSV-2. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00194519.)

### Herpes simplex virus infections of the newborn [^1149jPRD]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are fortunately quite rare in the neonatal population. Nevertheless, due to their life-threatening nature and the tremendous damage that surviving infants can incur, neonatal HSV is actually considered in a differential diagnosis relatively commonly. The availability of safe and effective antiviral therapy for the management of neonatal HSV also can accelerate a clinician's decision to consider HSV as the cause of a neonate's disease presentation, and then to obtain appropriate diagnostic studies and empirically institute antiviral treatment. Decisions on whether to continue antiviral therapy for a full course are predicated on the appropriate interpretation of these diagnostic studies as they subsequently are reported to the treating physician. For HSV-infected neonates, the duration of parenteral acyclovir therapy ranges from 14 to 21 days, depending on the extent of disease. Use of subsequent oral suppressive antiviral therapy is under investigation in randomized controlled trials, and at this time cannot be routinely recommended. This article will summarize the current state of neonatal HSV disease presentation, diagnosis, and management.

### Interventions for men and women with their first episode of genital herpes [^112AYUJo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is incurable, and is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First-episode genital herpes is the first clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Current treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the episode.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different existing treatments for first-episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to April 2016), MEDLINE (from inception to April 2016), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group (from inception to April 2016), EMBASE (from inception to April 2016), PsycINFO (from inception to April 2016), CINAHL (from inception to April 2016), LILACS (from inception to April 2016), AMED (from inception to April 2016), and the Alternative Medicines Specialised Register (from inception to April 2016). We handsearched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first-episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials, and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion, risk of bias for each trial, and to extract data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, trial quality, and data extraction by external translators.

Main Results

We included 26 trials with 2084 participants analysed. Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), and involved men and women experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, with the exception of three studies which included only women. We rated the majority of these studies as having an unclear risk of bias; largely due to lack of information supplied in the publications, and due to the age of the trials. This review found low quality evidence from two studies of oral acyclovir, when compared to placebo, reduced the duration of symptoms in individuals undergoing their first episode of genital herpes (mean difference (MD) -3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.91 to -0.54; I² = 52%). In two studies (112 participants), intravenous acyclovir decreased the median number of days that patients with first-episode herpes suffered symptoms. Oral valaciclovir (converted to acyclovir) also showed a similar length of symptom duration when compared to acyclovir in two studies. There is currently no evidence that topical acyclovir reduces symptoms (MD -0.61 days, 95% CI -2.16 to 0.95; 3 RCTs, 195 participants, I² statistic = 56%). There is also no current evidence that the topical treatments of cicloxolone cream, carbenoxolone sodium cream, adenosine arabinoside, idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, when compared to placebo reduced the duration of symptoms in people undergoing their first episode of herpes. Two studies reported no evidence of a reduction in the number of median days to recurrence following treatment with oral acyclovir versus placebo. Adverse events were generally poorly reported by all of the included studies and we were unable to quantitatively analyse this outcome. For those taking acyclovir, there were no serious adverse events; the most common adverse events reported for oral acyclovir were coryza, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhoea and renal colic. For intravenous acyclovir these were phlebitis, nausea and abnormal liver function tests and for topical acyclovir there was pain with the topical application. Those undergoing interferon treatment had significantly more adverse events compared to those taking placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence from this review that oral acyclovir reduced the duration of symptoms for genital herpes. However, there is low quality evidence which did not show that topical antivirals reduced symptom duration for patients undergoing their first episode of genital herpes. This review was limited by the inclusion of skewed data, resulting in few trials that we were able to meta-analyse.

### Genital herpes: a review [^11152iNU]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus infection is a recurrent, lifelong disease with no cure. The strongest predictor for infection is a person's number of lifetime sex partners. The natural history includes first-episode mucocutaneous infection, establishment of latency in the dorsal root ganglion, and subsequent reactivation. Most infections are transmitted via asymptomatic viral shedding. Classic outbreaks consist of a skin prodrome and possible constitutional symptoms such as headache, fever, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. As the infection progresses, papules, vesicles on an erythematous base, and erosions appear over hours to days. These lesions usually crust, re-epithelialize, and heal without scarring. First-episode infections are more extensive: primary lesions last two to six weeks versus approximately one week for lesions in recurrent disease. Atypical manifestations are common. Infected persons experience a median of four recurrences per year after their first episode, but rates vary greatly. Genital herpes simplex virus type 2 recurs six times more frequently than type 1. Viral culture is preferred over polymerase chain reaction testing for diagnosis. Serologic testing can be useful in persons with a questionable history. Effective oral antiviral medications are available for initial, episodic, and suppressive therapy but are not a cure. There is some evidence that alternative therapies such as L-lysine, zinc, and some herbal preparations may offer some benefit. Counseling patients about the risk of transmission is crucial and helps prevent the spread of disease and neonatal complications.

### The management of herpes simplex virus infections [^114ZYPtY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus persists in a latent form for the life of its host, periodically reactivating and often resulting in significant psychosocial distress for the patient. Currently no cure is available. Antiviral therapy is the main treatment modality, used either orally, intravenously, or topically to prohibit further replication of the virus and thereby minimize cellular destruction. However, immunologic advances in the treatment and prevention of herpes simplex infections are promising and continue to be studied.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112irAfY]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated herpes simplex virus (HSV) management — treating disease — Patients with HSV infections can be treated with episodic antiviral therapy when symptomatic lesions occur or with daily suppressive therapy to prevent recurrences, and acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective for suppressive and episodic therapy; valacyclovir is the prodrug of acyclovir, and has improved oral bioavailability, with decreased dosing frequency, compared to acyclovir. Patients with orolabial HSV lesions can be treated with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 5 days to 10 days (AIII). First episodes of genital HSV should be treated with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7 days to 10 days; recurrences can be treated for 5 to 10 days (AI). Severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions respond best to initial treatment with intravenous (IV) acyclovir (AIII); once the lesions begin to regress, patients can be switched to oral antiviral therapy and therapy should be continued until the lesions have completely healed. When deciding on suppressive therapy for genital HSV-2 infection in persons with HIV and HSV-2 coinfection, factors to consider include the frequency and severity of HSV recurrences and risk for genital ulcer disease (GUD) when initiating ART, and episodic treatment for individual recurrences of GUD does not influence the natural history of genital HSV-2 infection.

### Global and regional estimates of the contribution of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection to HIV incidence: a population attributable fraction analysis using published epidemiological data [^111r8qV9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Trials of daily suppressive antiviral therapy against HSV-2 did not show a reduction in HIV acquisition; however, it has been speculated that the antivirals evaluated did not sufficiently reduce the HSV-associated influx of immune cell targets for HIV for there to be an effect on HIV acquisition. Antivirals do not fully suppress viral shedding, leading to immune cell persistence, and bioavailability of, and adherence to, aciclovir in the suppressive therapy trials were also cited as potential issues. New, more effective interventions could hold more promise for translating an effect on HSV-2 infection or shedding and disease into gains for the reduction of HIV incidence.

The landscape for HIV prevention and treatment has transformed in the past decade, with expanded availability of HIV prevention interventions such as antiretroviral treatment, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and voluntary medical male circumcision. However, no intervention used alone is likely to be sufficient to achieve global goals to end the HIV epidemic, especially given challenges in uptake and adherence. Hence, combination measures are needed. A potential indirect effect of interventions against HSV-2 on HIV incidence will need to be evaluated in the context of existing HIV prevention interventions and for new interventions against HSV-2, particularly HSV-2 vaccines. Our estimates suggest that HSV-2 prevention measures could be an important additional tool in the fight against HIV.

### Clinical and virologic efficacy of herpes simplex virus type 2 suppression by acyclovir in a multicontinent clinical trial [^115bANUV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Acyclovir suppressive therapy (400 mg twice daily) reduces herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2-associated genital ulcer disease and lesional HSV shedding. In an international trial of acyclovir for suppression of HSV type 2 to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition (HIV Prevention Trials Network 039), acyclovir had a smaller effect on the frequency of genital ulcer disease as well as a smaller effect on the frequency and quantity of lesional HSV DNA in African women and Peruvian men, compared with its effects in men in the United States. The observed regional variation in the clinical and virologic efficacy of acyclovir for HSV suppression warrants further evaluation of determinants of responses to acyclovir.

### A randomized controlled pilot trial of valacyclovir for attenuating inflammation and immune activation in HIV / herpes simplex virus 2-coinfected adults on suppressive antiretroviral therapy [^111RC6nX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with increased systemic inflammation and immune activation that persist despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a common coinfection that may contribute to this inflammation.

Methods

Sixty HIV type 1 (HIV-1)/HSV-2-coinfected adults on suppressive ART were randomized 1:1:1 to 12 weeks of placebo, low-dose valacyclovir (500 mg twice daily), or high-dose valacyclovir (1 g twice daily) in this 18-week trial. Co-primary outcome measures were the percentage of activated (CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)) CD8 T cells in blood, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in plasma. Secondary outcomes included additional immune, inflammatory cytokine, and endothelial activation markers. The impact of valacyclovir (both groups combined) on each outcome was estimated using treatment × time interaction terms in generalized estimating equation regression models.

Results

Participants were mostly white (75%) men who have sex with men (80%). Median age was 51 (interquartile range [IQR], 47–56) years, median duration of HIV infection was 15 (IQR, 8–21) years, median CD4 count at enrollment was 520 (IQR, 392–719) cells/µL, and median nadir CD4 count was 142 (IQR, 42–240) cells/µL. Valacyclovir was not associated with significant changes in any primary or secondary immunological outcomes in bivariate or multivariable models. Medication adherence was 97% by self-report, 96% by pill count, and 84% by urine monitoring. Eight patients had adverse events deemed possibly related to the study drug (5 placebo, 1 low-dose, 2 high-dose), and 6 patients reported at least 1 HSV outbreak (3 placebo, 3 low-dose, 0 high-dose).

Conclusions

Valacyclovir did not decrease systemic immune activation or inflammatory biomarkers in HIV-1/HSV-2-coinfected adults on suppressive ART.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing recurrence of HSV — use of suppressive therapy is selective. "Administration of oral acyclovir prophylaxis (suppressive therapy) for 6 months can prevent cutaneous recurrences of HSV after neonatal disease of the CNS or skin, eyes, and mouth in infants without HIV and is associated with better neurodevelopmental outcome in those with CNS disease". Outside the neonatal period, "chronic prophylaxis with acyclovir or other available antivirals against HSV is not required", and "Effective ART may decrease recurrences". For high-burden cases, "Children who have frequent, severe, or troubling recurrences (i.e., 4 to 6 severe episodes a year) can be given daily prophylaxis", consistent with the on-page wording.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Secondary prophylaxis — Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections: For mucocutaneous disease, first-choice dosing is Acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight/dose (maximum 800 mg/dose) by mouth BID; for adolescents old enough to receive adult dosing, alternatives are Valacyclovir 500 mg by mouth BID or Famciclovir 500 mg by mouth BID. For suppressive therapy after neonatal HSV disease (skin, eye, mouth, CNS, or disseminated disease), the regimen is Acyclovir 300 mg/m² body surface area/dose by mouth TID for 6 months. Secondary Prophylaxis Indicated: Suppressive secondary prophylaxis can be considered for children with severe and recurrent mucocutaneous (oral or genital) disease. Criteria for discontinuing secondary prophylaxis: After a prolonged period (e.g., 1 year) of prophylaxis, consider suspending prophylaxis and determine with the patient whether additional prophylaxis is necessary; although level of immune reconstitution is a consideration, no specific CD4 threshold has been established.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116mUQmM]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) prophylaxis — children and adolescents with HIV: Chronic prophylaxis with acyclovir or other antivirals is not required beyond the neonatal period, although effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) may decrease recurrences, and children with frequent, severe, or troubling recurrences (i.e., 4 to 6 severe episodes a year) can be given daily prophylaxis with oral acyclovir; daily valacyclovir or famciclovir also are options for adolescents. Use of suppressive antiviral drugs against HSV in adults reduces recurrences by 30% to 60%, and in adults with HIV receiving ART, symptomatic recurrences are reduced by 60% to 75%. Because corneal clouding can occur due to the stromal reaction of recurrent keratoconjunctivitis, many ophthalmologists use acyclovir prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of ocular recurrences; however, resistance to acyclovir has been reported in this circumstance in patients without HIV. Patients receiving prophylactic therapy should be evaluated annually for the need to continue prophylaxis, and cessation will be determined by immune reconstitution, frequency and severity of recurrences, individual tolerance, and location (e.g., recurrent keratitis may require longer prophylaxis because of vision-impairing risk).

### Clinics in dermatology: herpes simplex virus (update on dermatologic aspects of sexually transmitted disease and human immunodeficiency virus) [^117MDGu7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of anogenital ulceration worldwide. There are two distinct viruses: HSV-1 associated with oro-labial cold sores and genital infection, and HSV-2 associated with genital infection. Infection is lifelong, and typically presents with painful anogenital ulceration which may recur after periods of latency. Asymptomatic shedding is common and may lead to transmission to sexual partners. Antiviral suppression with aciclovir, valaciclovir or famciclovir is useful to treat initial painful episodes, or troublesome recurrent infection. Suppressive antiviral therapy, condoms, selective abstinence and disclosure to sexual partners have all been demonstrated to reduce the risk of transmission.

### Famciclovir suppression of asymptomatic and symptomatic recurrent anogenital herpes simplex virus shedding in women: a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center trial [^117DSMge]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is most often transmitted while the patient is asymptomatic, presumably during episodes of viral shedding. To determine whether famciclovir is effective in reducing asymptomatic shedding, women with frequent, recurrent genital outbreaks were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 112-day trial of suppressive treatment with famciclovir for anogenital viral shedding. Sixty women received 125 mg of famciclovir 3 times daily, 59 received 250 mg of famciclovir 3 times daily, and 58 received placebo. Patients recorded symptoms and self-obtained cultures daily. Famciclovir reduced asymptomatic shedding, compared with placebo (P < .0001). The onset of asymptomatic shedding was also delayed (P < .0001). Famciclovir reduced symptomatic shedding in a dose-dependent manner (0.72% for 125 mg 3 times daily vs. 0.19% for 250 mg 3 times daily [P < .0001] vs. 5.53% for placebo [P < .0001]). In conclusion, suppressive treatment with famciclovir reduced both asymptomatic and symptomatic viral shedding and delayed the onset of asymptomatic shedding in women with frequently recurring genital herpes. Studies to examine the effects of suppression by famciclovir on the transmission of genital herpes are warranted.

### The potential role of suppressive therapy for sex partners in the prevention of neonatal herpes: a health economic analysis [^114Raozr]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The development of suppressive therapy and type specific tests for herpes infections allow for screening to reduce the risk of neonatal herpes.

Objectives

To assess the potential effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and benefit of suppressive therapy among herpes simplex virus serodiscordant sex partners during pregnancy.

Methods

Decision and economic analyses are used to compare the incidence and costs of neonatal herpes in California (2000) for three interventions: (1) no management; (2) current guidelines (caesarean delivery for women with lesions); (3) screening for women at risk and use of suppressive treatment in sex partners.

Results

Screening and suppressive therapy are the most effective interventions, while current guidelines have limited effectiveness, but the latter provide the most cost effective results.

Conclusions

While current guidelines are cost saving, they forgo a potential 82% decrease in neonatal herpes incidence that would be possible with screening and suppressive therapy if society were willing to pay the necessary US$363 000 per case prevented. To evaluate HSV screening and drug therapy completely, clinical trials and an economic assessment of infant mortality "value" to society are required.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) suppression in people with HIV — chronic suppressive therapy reduces HSV-2 transmission to susceptible HSV-discordant partners without HIV by 25% to 75% and can reduce HSV shedding in HIV/HSV coinfection. All HSV-active antivirals are equally effective in reducing transmission, but twice-daily dosing may be superior to a larger once-daily dose. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) also reduces the frequency of asymptomatic HSV shedding, and when administered to prevent clinical recurrences, suppressive therapy may thus limit spread to sexual partners.

### Long-term valacyclovir suppressive treatment after herpes simplex virus type 2 meningitis: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^112pn9Dq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a common cause of acute and recurrent aseptic meningitis. Our aim was to determine the impact of antiviral suppression on recurrence of meningitis and to delineate the full spectrum of neurological complications.

Methods

One hundred and one patients with acute primary or recurrent HSV-2 meningitis were assigned to placebo (n = 51) or 0.5 g of valacyclovir twice daily (n = 50) for 1 year after initial treatment with 1 g of valacyclovir 3 times daily for 1 week in a prospective, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. The primary outcome was time until recurrence of meningitis. The patients were followed up for 2 years.

Results

The first year, no significant difference was found between the valacyclovir and placebo groups. The second year, without study drugs, the risk of recurrence of verified and probable HSV-2 meningitis was significantly higher among patients exposed to valacyclovir (hazard ratio, 3.29 [95% confidence interval, 10.06–10.21]). One-third of the patients experienced 1–4 meningitis episodes during the study period. A considerable morbidity rate, comprising symptoms from the central, peripheral, and autonomous nervous system, was found in both groups.

Conclusions

Suppressive treatment with 0.5 g of valacyclovir twice daily was not shown to prohibit recurrent meningitis and cannot be recommended for this purpose after HSV meningitis in general. Protection against mucocutaneous lesions was observed, but the dosage was probably inappropriate for the prevention of HSV activation in the central nervous system. The higher frequency of meningitis, after cessation of active drug, could be interpreted as a rebound phenomenon.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1144jskN]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV — HSV episodic versus suppressive therapy and agent selection — oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective, with valacyclovir and famciclovir offering dosing convenience. People with HSV infections can be treated with episodic antiviral therapy when symptomatic lesions occur or with daily suppressive therapy to prevent recurrences. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are all effective for suppressive and episodic therapy. Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, and famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir (only available topically); both have improved oral bioavailability and allow for decreased dosing frequency compared to acyclovir, making them preferred oral regimens for patient dosing convenience and adherence, if available. Episodic treatment for individual recurrences of genital ulcer disease does not influence the natural history of genital HSV-2 infection.

HIV-associated HSV — considerations for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) — Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision on when to start ART in persons with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected persons; in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes is often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

### Population-level effect of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence of HIV in sub-saharan Africa [^113CS1vh]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) have a synergistic relationship. HIV affects HSV-2 shedding, ulcer recurrence rate and ulcer duration. – HSV-2, in turn, has a strong impact on HIV transmission and acquisition and probably also affects the natural history of HIV infection. – A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies found HSV-2 seropositivity to be associated with a risk ratio of HIV acquisition of 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 3.9) in men and 3.1(95% CI 1.7 to 5.6) in women, and most cross-sectional studies have found a correlation between HSV-2 and HIV viral shedding and/or quantity.

Antiviral therapy against HSV-2 could thus have a population-level impact on the global HIV epidemic in areas with a high HSV-2 prevalence such as sub-Saharan Africa. Two types of therapy exist: episodic and suppressive.

### Effect of pritelivir compared with valacyclovir on genital HSV-2 shedding in patients with frequent recurrences: a randomized clinical trial [^111253H8]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Current therapy of herpes infections relies on nucleoside analogues. Pritelivir is a well-tolerated novel herpes simplex virus (HSV) helicase-primase inhibitor that reduced genital shedding and lesions.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of pritelivir with valacyclovir for suppression of genital HSV-2 infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial at clinical research centers in 4 US cities (October 2012-July 2013) compared daily oral doses of 100 mg of pritelivir with 500 mg of valacyclovir. The planned sample size was 98 adults, allowing for detection of a 50% reduction in viral shedding between the study treatments. Healthy adults with 4 to 9 annual genital HSV-2 recurrences were eligible. 45 participants were randomized to receive pritelivir and 46 to receive valacyclovir first when the US Food and Drug Administration placed the trial on clinical hold based on findings in a concurrent nonclinical toxicity study, and the sponsor terminated the study.

Interventions

Participants took the first drug for 28 days followed by 28 days of washout before taking the second drug for 28 days. Throughout treatment, the participants collected genital swabs 4 times daily for testing by HSV polymerase chain reaction assays.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was within-participant genital HSV shedding while receiving pritelivir compared with valacyclovir. Secondary end points included the quantity of HSV in positive swabs and the frequency of genital lesions and shedding episodes.

Results

Of the 91 randomized participants (median age, 48 years; 57 women [63%]), 56 had completed both treatment periods at the time of the study's termination. In intent-to-treat analyses, HSV shedding was detected in 2.4% (173 of 7276) of swabs during pritelivir treatment compared with 5.3% (392 of 7453) during valacyclovir treatment (relative risk [RR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.82; p = 0.01). In swabs with HSV, the mean quantity of HSV was 3.2 log10 copies/mL during pritelivir treatment vs 3.7 log10 copies/mL during valacyclovir treatment (difference, -0.1; 95% CI, -0.6 to 0.5; p = 0.83). Genital lesions were present on 1.9% of days in the pritelivir group vs 3.9% in the valacyclovir group (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17–0.96; p = 0.04). The frequency of shedding episodes did not differ by group, with 1.3 per person-month for pritelivir and 1.6 per person-month for valacyclovir (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.22; p = 0.29). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 62.3% of participants in the pritelivir group and 69.2% of participants in the valacyclovir group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with frequently recurring genital HSV-2, the use of pritelivir compared with valacyclovir resulted in a lower percentage of swabs with HSV detection over 28 days. Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety.

### Genital herpes: rapid evidence review [^115SCbDS]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2. It affects at least 500 million people worldwide and is a lifelong condition involving initial infection and periodic reactivation with variable viral shedding. There are no vaccinations for the prevention of HSV, and routine serologic screening is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals. Practices that prevent or reduce transmission include the use of suppressive antiviral therapy in serodiscordant partners, avoiding sexual contact during outbreaks, and use of condoms. A clinically apparent herpes outbreak is characterized by painful vesicles on the genitals, rectum, or perineum and may be accompanied by a flulike syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis uses type-specific polymerase chain reaction, viral culture of active lesions, or type-specific serologic testing. Nucleoside analogue medications reduce viral shedding and are used to treat active outbreaks and prevent recurrences. Complications of genital herpes include encephalitis, meningitis, and urinary retention. During pregnancy, antiviral suppression is recommended starting at 36 weeks of gestation in patients with a known history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be offered to patients with active lesions to reduce neonatal exposure to HSV.

Regarding specific circumstances for genital herpes, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, suppressive therapy, BASHH/RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate suppressive antiviral therapy with aciclovir or valaciclovir after HSV acquisition to reduce asymptomatic HSV shedding, lesions at term, and potentially premature delivery:

- **All pregnancies**: aciclovir 400 mg TID or valaciclovir 500 mg BID from 32 weeks of gestation; continue the treatment dose antivirals until delivery in third trimester acquisition, even if suppression is starting before 32 weeks

- **Pregnancies at high risk of premature delivery**: aciclovir 400 mg BID or valaciclovir 500 mg once daily from 22 weeks of gestation, followed by aciclovir 400 mg TID or valaciclovir 500 mg BID from 32 weeks of gestation.

A randomized cross-over trial of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)-suppressive therapy (valacyclovir, 500 mg twice daily, or placebo for 8 weeks, a 2-week washout period, then the alternative therapy for 8 weeks) was conducted among 20 Peruvian women coinfected with HSV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who were not on antiretroviral therapy. Plasma samples (obtained weekly) and endocervical swab specimens (obtained thrice weekly) were collected for HIV-1 RNA polymerase chain reaction. Plasma HIV-1 level was significantly lower during the valacyclovir arm, compared with the placebo arm (-0.26 log10 copies/mL, a 45% decrease [P < .001]), as was cervical HIV-1 level (-0.35 log10 copies/swab, a 55% decrease [P < .001]). Suppressive HSV-2 therapy has the potential to reduce HIV-1 infectiousness and slow HIV-1 disease progression.

Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Suppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes recurrences by 70%–80% among patients who have frequent recurrences. Persons receiving such therapy often report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. Suppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less frequent recurrences. Long-term safety and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Quality of life is improved for many patients with frequent recurrences who receive suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment. Providers should discuss with patients on an annual basis whether they want to continue suppressive therapy because frequency of genital HSV-2 recurrence diminishes over time for many persons. However, neither treatment discontinuation nor laboratory monitoring is necessary because adverse events and development of HSV antiviral resistance related to long-term antiviral use are uncommon.

Treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate of HSV-2 transmission for discordant heterosexual couples in which a partner has a history of genital HSV-2 infection. Such couples should be encouraged to consider suppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy for preventing transmission, in addition to consistent condom use and avoidance of sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive antiviral therapy for persons with a history of symptomatic genital herpes also is likely to reduce transmission when used by those who have multiple partners. HSV-2 seropositive persons without a history of symptomatic genital herpes have a 50% decreased risk for genital shedding, compared with those with symptomatic genital herpes. No data are available regarding efficacy of suppressive therapy for preventing HSV-2 transmission among discordant couples in which a partner has a history of asymptomatic HSV-2 infection identified by a positive HSV-2 serologic test. Among HSV-2 seropositive persons without HIV infection, oral TDF/FTC and intravaginal tenofovir are ineffective at reducing the risk for HSV-2 shedding or recurrences.

Recommended Regimens for Suppression of Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes
Acyclovir 400 mg orally 2 times/day
or
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally once a day *
or
Valacyclovir 1 g orally once a day
or
Famciclovir 250 mg orally 2 times/day
* Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day might be less effective than other valacyclovir or acyclovir dosing regimens for persons who have frequent recurrences (i.e. ≥ 10 episodes/year).

Famciclovir appears somewhat less effective for suppression of viral shedding. Ease of administration and cost also are key considerations for prolonged treatment.

### Genital herpes: oral antiviral treatments [^112vyc8U]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Genital herpes is an infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2), and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of different oral antiviral treatments versus each other for a first episode of genital herpes in HIV-negative people? What are the effects of different antiviral treatments for genital herpes in HIV-positive people? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found eight studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aciclovir, famciclovir, and valaciclovir.

### Efficacy and safety of valacyclovir for the suppression and episodic treatment of herpes simplex virus in patients with HIV [^115bpQX6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Three randomized controlled trials of valacyclovir for the management of recurrences of genital herpes in HIV-infected persons were conducted between 1991 and 2002. One study evaluated episodic therapy for the treatment of genital herpes, and 2 studies evaluated continuous suppressive therapy. Valacyclovir at 1000 mg twice daily for 5 days was comparable to acyclovir at 200 mg 5 times daily in accelerating healing of a single episode of genital herpes (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8–1.2; p = 0.89). Valacyclovir at 500 mg twice daily was effective in preventing or delaying recurrences of genital herpes compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.13–0.30; P < .001) and with valacyclovir at 1000 mg once daily (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40–0.80; p = 0.001), in 6-month and 48-week studies, respectively. The safety profile of valacyclovir was similar to that of acyclovir. Valacyclovir is well tolerated, safe, and effective for the treatment and suppression of recurrent genital herpes in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons.

Asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing (with confirmatory testing, if needed) should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection.
For patients with serological evidence of HSV-2 (with combination testing if needed) without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.
Because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

HSV-1 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Persons with virologic laboratory-documented symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes infection should be educated that the risk for recurrent genital herpes and genital shedding is lower with HSV-1 infection, compared with HSV-2 infection.
Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences.
For patients with frequently recurring HSV-1 genital herpes, suppressive therapy might be considered. Suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-1 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.

For persons with symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes or asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, suppressive therapy can be considered for those who have substantial psychosocial distress caused by the diagnosis of genital herpes. For women who have genital herpes, the providers who care for them during pregnancy and those who will care for their newborn infant should be informed of their infection (see Genital Herpes During Pregnancy).

Management of Sex Partners

The sex partners of persons who have symptomatic genital herpes can benefit from evaluation and counseling. Symptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as patients who have symptomatic genital herpes. Asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have symptomatic genital herpes should be asked about a history of genital symptoms and offered type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2. For partners without genital herpes, no data are available on which to base a recommendation for PEP or PrEP with antiviral medications or that they would prevent acquisition, and this should not be offered to patients as a prevention strategy.

### Population-level effect of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence of HIV in sub-saharan Africa [^117LvqDN]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection increases acquisition and transmission of HIV, but the results of trials measuring the impact of HSV-2 therapy on HIV genital shedding and HIV acquisition are mixed, and the potential impact of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence of HIV at the population level is unknown.

Methods

The effects of episodic and suppressive HSV-2 therapy were simulated using the individual-level model STDSIM fitted to data from Cotonou, Benin (relatively low HIV prevalence) and Kisumu, Kenya (high HIV prevalence). Clinician- and patient-initiated episodic therapy, started when symptomatic, were assumed to reduce ulcer duration. Suppressive therapy, given regardless of symptoms, was also assumed to reduce ulcer frequency and HSV-2 infectiousness.

Results

Clinician-initiated episodic therapy in the general population had almost no effect on the incidence of HIV. The impact of patient-initiated therapy was higher because of earlier treatment initiation, but still low (< 5%) unless symptom recognition and treatment-seeking behaviour were very high. Suppressive therapy given to female sex workers (FSW) in Kisumu had little effect on population HIV incidence. In Cotonou, suppressive therapy in FSW with high coverage and long duration reduced population HIV incidence by > 20% in the long term. Impact was increased in both cities by also treating a proportion of their clients. Long-term suppressive therapy with high coverage in the general population could reduce HIV incidence by more than 30%.

Conclusions

These results show that HSV-2 therapy could potentially have a population-level impact on the incidence of HIV, especially in more concentrated epidemics. However, a substantial impact requires high coverage and long duration therapy, or very high symptom recognition and treatment-seeking behaviour.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116aemba]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy and HSV management in people with HIV — suppressive therapy and primary disease: Due to increased renal clearance, the recommended dose of acyclovir for suppressive therapy during pregnancy is 400 mg three times a day (AII), and given its simplified dosing schedule, valacyclovir 500 mg twice a day is an option for suppressive therapy during pregnancy (BII). Laboratory testing to diagnose mucocutaneous HSV infections is the same during pregnancy as for other people with HIV, and for primary HSV disease during pregnancy, antiviral therapy should be administered orally for 7 to 10 days (or longer, if lesions are incompletely healed).

### Estimating the public health impact of the effect of herpes simplex virus suppressive therapy on plasma HIV-1 viral load [^117DPqYs]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Trials of herpes simplex virus (HSV) suppressive therapy among HSV-2/HIV-1-infected individuals have reported an impact on plasma HIV-1 viral loads (PVLs). Our aim was to estimate the population-level impact of suppressive therapy on female-to-male HIV-1 sexual transmission.

Design and Methods

By comparing prerandomization and postrandomization individual-level PVL data from the first two HSV suppressive therapy randomized controlled trials in sub-Saharan Africa, we estimated the effect of treatment on duration of asymptomatic infection and number of HIV-1 transmission events for each trial.

Results

Assuming that a reduction in PVL is accompanied by an increased duration of HIV-1 asymptomatic infection, 4–6 years of HSV suppressive therapy produce a 1-year increase in the duration of this stage. To avert one HIV-1 transmission requires 8.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.9–14.9] and 11.4 (95% CI, 7.8–27.5) women to be treated from halfway through their HIV-1 asymptomatic period, using results from Burkina Faso and South African trials, respectively. Regardless of the timing of treatment initiation, 51.6 (95% CI, 30.4–137.0) and 66.5 (95% CI, 36.7–222.6) treatment-years are required to avert one HIV-1 infection. Distributions of set-point PVL values from sub-Saharan African populations suggest that unintended adverse consequences of therapy at the population level (i.e. increased HIV-1 transmission due to increased duration of infection) are unlikely to occur in these settings.

Conclusion

HSV suppressive therapy may avert relatively few HIV-1 transmission events per person-year of treatment. Its use as a prevention intervention may be limited; however, further research into its effect on rate of CD4 cell count decline and the impact of higher dosing schedules is warranted.

### Valaciclovir for suppression of recurrent genital herpes… [^116vSCmi]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Infection with genital herpes simplex virus causes significant morbidity for millions of infected persons. Without therapy, more than 90 percent of patients experience clinical recurrences, but a decade of experience has demonstrated that daily suppressive therapy with acyclovir, in a dosage of 400 mg twice daily, is effective and is well-tolerated by patients. Reitano and colleagues conducted a placebo-controlled study to compare this regimen with a range of once-daily dosages of valaciclovir in immunocompetent adults. A total of 1, 479 patients with documented HSV infection were selected for the study. The patients must have had at least six clinical episodes of HSV per year and been free of significant hepatic or renal disease. After screening, patients were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups. Treatment consisted of valaciclovir: 250 mg once daily, 500 mg daily, 250 mg twice daily or 1 g daily; acyclovir: 400 mg twice daily; or placebo.

Treatment continued for one year, with patients returning to the clinic monthly. Patients were instructed to contact the clinic within 24 hours of onset of a clinical recurrence of HSV infection. Hematology and clinical chemistry parameters were monitored at enrollment, at six months and after one year of therapy. Plasma acyclovir levels were determined at three, six, nine and 12 months. Patients kept diaries throughout the study to monitor adverse effects, clinical recurrences and use of other medications. The full protocol was completed by 1, 050 patients. The most common reason for not completing the protocol was loss to follow-up. Five percent of patients reported adverse experiences as a reason for discontinuing the study. Valaciclovir in a dosage of 500 mg once daily was associated with a reduction of 71 percent. The 250-mg daily dosage of valaciclovir reduced recurrence by 54 percent compared with placebo.

The safety profiles of all treatments were comparable. After an analysis of subgroups, the authors concluded that valaciclovir, in a dosage of 500 mg once daily, effectively treated patients with a history of up to 10 HSV recurrences per year. In patients with a history of 10 or more recurrences per year, the most effective daily regimens were valaciclovir in a dosage of 1 g daily or 250 mg twice daily, and acyclovir in a dosage of 400 mg twice daily.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112GqjaT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — exposure prevention and transmission reduction: Persons with HIV who are HSV-2 seronegative should consider partner testing using HSV type-specific serology before initiating sexual activity because disclosure in heterosexual HIV-negative, HSV-2-discordant couples was associated with reduced risk of transmission of HSV-2 (BIII), and consistent use of latex condoms reduced HSV-2 acquisition and should be encouraged to prevent transmission of HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). Sexual transmission of HSV most often occurs during episodes of asymptomatic viral shedding, and persons with HIV should specifically avoid sexual contact with partners who have overt genital or oral labial herpetic lesions (AII). In HSV-2 seropositive persons with symptomatic genital herpes but not HIV, suppressive antiviral therapy such as valacyclovir 500 mg once daily reduced HSV-2 transmission to susceptible heterosexual partners by 48%, but in HIV-1/HSV-2-seropositive persons not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), suppressive acyclovir 400 mg twice daily did not prevent HSV-2 transmission to HSV-2 seronegative partners; suppressive anti-HSV therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners is not recommended for persons with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection who are not on ART (AII), and there are no data available regarding use of suppressive therapy to prevent genital HSV-1 transmission.

### Daily acyclovir to decrease herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) transmission from HSV-2 / HIV-1 coinfected persons: a randomized controlled trial [^1158pVck]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Daily suppressive therapy with valacyclovir reduces risk of sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in HSV-2-serodiscordant heterosexual couples by 48%. Whether suppressive therapy reduces HSV-2 transmission from persons coinfected with HSV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is unknown.

Methods

Within a randomized trial of daily acyclovir 400 mg twice daily in African HIV-1 serodiscordant couples, in which the HIV-1-infected partner was HSV-2 seropositive, we identified partnerships in which HIV-1-susceptible partners were HSV-2 seronegative to estimate the effect of acyclovir on risk of HSV-2 transmission.

Results

We randomly assigned 911 HSV-2/HIV-1-serodiscordant couples to daily receipt of acyclovir or placebo. We observed 68 HSV-2 seroconversions, 40 and 28 in acyclovir and placebo groups, respectively (HSV-2 incidence, 5.1 cases per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% confidence interval, .83–2.20]; p = 0.22). Among HSV-2-susceptible women, vaginal drying practices (adjusted HR, 44.35; p = 0.004) and unprotected sex (adjusted HR, 9.91; p = 0.002) were significant risk factors for HSV-2 acquisition; having more children was protective (adjusted HR, 0.47 per additional child; p = 0.012). Among HSV-2-susceptible men, only age ≤ 30 years was associated with increased risk of HSV-2 acquisition (P = 0.016).

Conclusions

Treatment of African HSV-2/HIV-1-infected persons with daily suppressive acyclovir did not decrease risk of HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners. More-effective prevention strategies to reduce HSV-2 transmission from HIV-1-infected persons are needed.

### Treatment to prevent recurrent genital herpes [^117AEUuT]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Genital herpes is the leading cause of genital ulcer disease worldwide and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Recurrent genital herpes is associated with major medical and psychosocial morbidities; therefore, suppressive therapy is required, especially in patients with frequent and/or severe episodes.

Recent Findings

A recent meta-analysis evaluated prophylactic regimens in immunocompetent hosts, and proposed four alternatives with similar efficacies: three twice-daily regimens (i.e. acyclovir 400 mg, valaciclovir 250 mg and famciclovir 250 mg) and one once-daily regimen (valaciclovir 500 mg). Immunocompromised patients may have more prolonged, frequent and severe episodes of genital herpes. Valaciclovir 500 mg twice daily maintains the benefits of acyclovir treatment in terms of clinical efficacy and safety. Alternative therapies in case of clinical failure are discussed. Development of new strategies is moving in three directions: improvement in antiviral therapy or identification of new drug targets; local immune therapy; and vaccination. Many prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination approaches have been explored, but no effective vaccine is presently available.

Summary

In 2007 control of herpes recurrence remains an important goal because of the impact it has on the quality of life of millions of people and its relationship with transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases, especially HIV infection.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing recurrence — suppressive therapy with oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir is effective in preventing recurrences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions and is preferred for patients with severe or frequent recurrences or who want to minimize recurrences (AI). Suppressive therapy for HSV may be continued indefinitely, without regard to improved CD4 count, with the need for continued therapy addressed on an annual basis, particularly if immune reconstitution has occurred (BIII). Persons starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 counts < 250 cells/mm³ have an increased risk of HSV-2 shedding and genital ulcer disease (GUD) in the first 6 months on ART; suppressive acyclovir decreases the risk of GUD nearly 60%, and may be recommended for persons with CD4 counts < 250 cells/mm³ starting ART (BI). In persons with HIV not on ART, suppressive anti-HSV therapy decreases HIV RNA levels in plasma, anal, and genital secretions and lowers risk of HIV progression; however, antiviral regimens for herpes do not decrease risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners and should not be used in place of ART to delay HIV progression. In persons on ART, suppressive HSV antivirals do not delay HIV progression, improve CD4 recovery, or decrease markers of systemic inflammation and are not useful for these ends (AI).

HSV suppressive therapy dosing in people with HIV — valacyclovir, acyclovir, and famciclovir: Valacyclovir can be given at 500 mg twice daily (AI), 500 mg once daily (CIII), or 1,000 mg once daily (CIII) for suppression; the 500-mg daily dose is less likely to be effective in people with 10 or more recurrences per year, and 500 mg twice daily is the only dose specifically studied in people with HIV; 1,000 mg daily can be considered in people with HIV with more recurrences per year. Oral acyclovir 400 mg twice a day and oral famciclovir 250 mg twice a day are also acceptable options for suppressive therapy (AI), and suppressive therapy for HSV may be continued indefinitely with the need for continued therapy addressed at least annually, particularly if immune reconstitution has occurred (BIII).

### Fifteen-minute consultation: approach to recurrent cutaneous and ophthalmic herpes simplex virus infection [^115Vd76F]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in children is a common and challenging disease characterised by frequent misdiagnosis, a variety of treatment protocols and frequent recurrences from latent infection. With potential consequences such as pain, disfigurement, self-esteem issues, school exclusion and vision loss in eye disease, early diagnosis, informed management and appropriate interventions to prevent recurrences are essential. Management of HSV disease typically involves the use of oral antivirals for cutaneous disease and a combination of oral and topical treatment for eye disease. For children with recurrent disease, management options include episodic or chronic suppressive treatment for cutaneous disease, while longer-term suppressive therapy is often recommended for eye disease.

### Antiviral agents for treatment of herpes simplex virus infection in neonates [^116xCdb9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a rare but serious neonatal pathogen. Prior to the availability of antiviral drugs the mortality associated with all but localised neonatal infection was high, with 85% of infants with disseminated HSV infection and 50% of infants with encephalitis dying by one year of age. The morbidity in the survivors of multiorgan infection was also high, with up to 50% experiencing long-term neurological sequelae.

Objectives

To determine the effect of antiviral agents in the treatment of neonatal HSV infections on mortality, progression of disease and neurodevelopmental sequelae at approximately one year. The secondary objective was to assess the effect of antiviral agents on major complications associated with the use of these agents including nephrotoxicity and bone marrow suppression.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2008), MEDLINE (1996 - Nov 2008), EMBASE (1982 - Nov 2008) and reference lists of published trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antiviral therapy in infants less than one month of age with virologically proven HSV infection were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and the analyses performed independently by two review authors. Studies were analysed for methodological quality using the criteria of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. All data were analysed using RevMan 5.1. When possible, meta-analysis was performed to calculate typical relative risk, typical risk difference, along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Two eligible studies of a total of 273 infants were included. Both studies were randomized controlled trials. One study treated 63 infants with vidarabine or placebo (Whitley 1980) and the other study treated 210 infants with aciclovir or vidarabine (Whitley 1991). In the study comparing vidarabine with placebo (Whitley 1980), infants with all forms of neonatal HSV disease were included [disseminated disease, central nervous system (CNS) disease alone, and skin, eye and mouth (SEM) disease]. There was no significant reduction in the risk of mortality when analyzed as an entire group; however, mortality was significantly reduced when data from infants with CNS disease or disseminated disease were combined. There was no difference in the rate of neurological abnormalities in survivors at one year when analyzed as an entire group or by disease category. There was no difference between aciclovir and vidarabine (Whitley 1991) in preventing mortality from neonatal HSV disease, in preventing disease progression, in reducing the incidence of neurological abnormality at one year, or in the incidence of drug-induced renal or bone marrow toxicity. In infants with SEM disease, there was no significant difference in neurological outcome with aciclovir compared vidarabine treatment. Both drugs were well tolerated in the newborn period.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient trial evidence to evaluate the effects of antiviral agents with controls or with each other. The rarity of the condition makes effectively powered clinical trials difficult to perform. The efficacy of newer antiviral agents with better bioavailability (e.g. valaciclovir, valganciclovir) for the treatment of neonatal disease needs to be evaluated in randomised trials. The efficacy of oral formulations need to be evaluated as they may be useful for infants with skin, eye or mouth HSV disease or in the treatment of infants with recurrences after the neonatal period.

### Effect of aciclovir on HIV-1 acquisition in herpes simplex virus 2 seropositive women and men who have sex with men: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111pB23c]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Across many observational studies, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is associated with two-fold to three-fold increased risk for HIV-1 infection. We investigated whether HSV-2 suppression with aciclovir would reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition.

Methods

We undertook a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial in HIV-negative, HSV-2 seropositive women in Africa and men who have sex with men (MSM) from sites in Peru and the USA. Participants were randomly assigned by block randomisation to twice daily aciclovir 400 mg (n = 1637) or matching placebo (n = 1640) for 12–18 months, and were seen monthly for dispensation of study drug, adherence counselling and measurement by pill count and self-reporting, and risk reduction counselling, and every 3 months for genital examination and HIV testing. The primary outcome was HIV-1 acquisition and secondary was incidence of genital ulcers. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00076232.

Findings

3172 participants (1358 women, 1814 MSM) were included in the primary dataset (1581 in aciclovir group, 1591 in control group). The incidence of HIV-1 was 3.9 per 100 person-years in the aciclovir group (75 events in 1935 person-years of follow-up) and 3.3 per 100 person-years in the placebo group (64 events in 1969 person-years of follow-up; hazard ratio 1.16 [95% CI 0.83–1.62]). Incidence of genital ulcers on examination was reduced by 47% (relative risk 0.53 [0.46–0.62]) and HSV-2 positive genital ulcers by 63% (0.37 [0.31–0.45]) in the aciclovir group. Adherence to dispensed study drug was 94% in the aciclovir group and 94% in the placebo group, and 85% of expected doses in the aciclovir group and 86% in the placebo group. Retention was 85% at 18 months in both groups (1028 of 1212 in aciclovir group, 1030 of 1208 in placebo group). We recorded no serious events related to the study drug.

Interpretation

Our results show that suppressive therapy with standard doses of aciclovir is not effective in reduction of HIV-1 acquisition in HSV-2 seropositive women and MSM. Novel strategies are needed to interrupt interactions between HSV-2 and HIV-1.

Recurrent HSV-1 Genital Herpes

Recurrences are less frequent after the first episode of HSV-1 genital herpes, compared with genital HSV-2 genital herpes, and genital shedding rapidly decreases during the first year of infection. No data are available regarding the efficacy of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission among persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection. Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences through shared clinical decision-making between the patient and the provider.

Episodic Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Episodic treatment of recurrent herpes is most effective if therapy is initiated within 1 day of lesion onset or during the prodrome that precedes some outbreaks. The patient should be provided with a supply of drug or a prescription for the medication with instructions to initiate treatment immediately when symptoms begin. Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir appear equally effective for episodic treatment of genital herpes.

Recommended Regimens for Episodic Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes*
Acyclovir 800 mg orally 2 times/day for 5 days
or
Acyclovir 800 mg orally 3 times/day for 2 days
or
Famciclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 1 day
or
Famciclovir 500 mg orally once, followed by 250 mg 2 times/day for 2 days
or
Famciclovir 125 mg orally 2 times/day for 5 days
or
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 days
or
Valacyclovir 1 g orally once daily for 5 days
*Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 5 days is also effective but is not recommended because of frequency of dosing.

### Reduction of HIV-1 RNA levels with therapy to suppress herpes simplex virus [^1152RwNf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic data suggest that infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is associated with increased genital shedding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA and HIV-1 transmissibility.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of HSV suppressive therapy with valacyclovir (at a dose of 500 mg twice daily) in Burkina Faso among women who were seropositive for HIV-1 and HSV-2; all were ineligible for highly active antiretroviral therapy. The patients were followed for 24 weeks (12 weeks before and 12 weeks after randomization). Regression models were used to assess the effect of valacyclovir on the presence and quantity of genital and plasma HIV-1 RNA and genital HSV-2 DNA during treatment, adjusting for baseline values, and to evaluate the effect over time.

Results

A total of 140 women were randomly assigned to treatment groups; 136 were included in the analyses. At enrollment, the median CD4 cell count was 446 cells per cubic millimeter, and the mean plasma viral load was 4.44 log10 copies per milliliter. With the use of summary-measures analysis, valacyclovir therapy was found to be associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of genital HIV-1 RNA (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 to 0.80) and in the mean quantity of the virus (log(10) copies per milliliter, -0.29; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.15). However, there was no significant decrease in detection of HIV (risk ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.07). HSV suppressive therapy also reduced the mean plasma HIV-1 RNA level by 0.53 log(10) copy per milliliter (95% CI, -0.72 to -0.35). Repeated-measures analysis showed that these effects became significantly stronger during the 3 months of follow-up.

Conclusions

HSV suppressive therapy significantly reduces genital and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels in dually infected women. This finding may have important implications for HIV control. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00158509 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

### Therapeutic vaccine for genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection: findings from a randomized trial [^115Ed4to]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

(.)

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a common sexually transmitted pathogen that often causes recurrent genital lesions. Transmission occurs largely from asymptomatic genital tract virus shedding, making this a key target for a therapeutic HSV vaccine. The management of genital herpes currently includes episodic or daily suppressive therapy with nucleoside analogues, which abrogates most recurrences but only partly reduces viral shedding and transmission.

GEN-003 contains a transmembrane deletion mutant of glycoprotein D (gD2ΔTMR), a primary target antigen for neutralizing antibody and T cells, combined with a large fragment of infected cell protein 4 (ICP4.2), an HSV-2 T-cell antigen prioritized through human T-cell screens. This antigen was selected by comparing T-cell responses of HSV-2–seropositive but asymptomatic and HSV-2–exposed seronegative individuals to individuals with recurrent disease, using high-throughput HSV-2 proteomic screens. GEN-003 is a combination of these 2 proteins with a novel adjuvant, Matrix-M2™. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that GEN-003 elicits antibody and T-cell responses in mice and is protective in a guinea pig model of recurrent HSV-2 infection.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase 1/2 study of GEN-003 to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and effect on viral shedding of this candidate immunotherapy (clinical trials registration NCT01667341).

### Changes in plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA associated with herpes simplex virus reactivation and suppression [^116wZ1JU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In early trials of antiretroviral therapy, acyclovir was associated with increased survival by an unknown mechanism. The hypothesis that subclinical herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation was associated, in vivo, with increased plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA and suppression with a reduced plasma HIV RNA load was investigated. HSV cultures were performed daily on HSV-2-positive/HIV-positive patients, and plasma HIV-1 RNA loads were measured at regular intervals. A subset of patients prior to, during, and after HSV suppression with high-dose acyclovir was measured to determine whether HSV suppression was associated with a decrease in HIV replication. Most (25/27 HSV-2-positive/HIV-positive persons) reactivated HSV. Total HSV shedding rate was strongly correlated with plasma HIV-1 RNA load (R = 0.54; p = 0.004), and the plasma HIV-1 RNA level at a given CD4 cell count was 48% lower when treated with acyclovir. These data indicate that frequent mucosal HSV reactivation influences HIV replication in vivo and daily HSV suppression may be important in the management of HSV-positive/HIV-positive persons.

HSV suppression and HIV disease outcomes in people with HIV: In people not taking effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), suppressive anti-HSV therapy decreases HIV RNA levels in plasma, anal, and genital secretions and lowers risk of HIV progression; however, suppressive anti-HSV medications should not be used in place of ART to delay or reduce the risk of HIV progression (AIII). In people who are taking ART, suppressive HSV antivirals do not delay HIV progression, improve CD4 recovery, or decrease markers of systemic inflammation and are not useful for these outcomes.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116rFMpx]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in children and adolescents with HIV — panel recommendations include the following: Condoms should be used to prevent HSV infection (and other sexually transmitted diseases) in adolescents and young adults with HIV (strong; low), although the data regarding the level of protection provided by condoms are very limited for individuals with HIV in general, and for youth specifically. Adolescents and young adults with HIV who suffer severe, frequent, and/or troubling recurrent genital HSV infection will benefit from anti-HSV suppression therapy (strong; moderate). Children and youth with HIV who have severe mucocutaneous HSV infections should be treated with intravenous (IV) acyclovir; when improvement is noted, they can be switched to oral therapy until healing is complete (strong; moderate). For non-severe disease, oral anti-HSV drugs will shorten the duration and reduce the severity of infections in children and adolescents with HIV, and oral valacyclovir and famciclovir have superior pharmacokinetic profiles compared with oral acyclovir (strong; moderate). For acyclovir-resistant HSV, foscarnet is the therapy of choice (strong, very low), and ideally, the viral isolate should be tested to determine the antiviral resistance pattern.

### Acyclovir: a new use for an old drug [^1162QUma]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) are responsible for two epidemics and that, by overlapping in risk populations, they reinforce the spreading of both HIV-1 disease and genital herpes. Randomized controlled trials have investigated whether acyclovir (ACV), a synthetic drug designed to suppress herpes viruses, might provide an inexpensive and safe way to drastically reduce HIV-1 spreading around the world. The controversial results of these trials are reviewed below in light of the recent discovery of the direct suppression of HIV-1 by ACV.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown that although ACV therapy does not prevent HIV-1 transmission, it decreases plasma, genital, rectal, and seminal HIV-1 RNA levels. The decrease of HIV-1 load has been believed to be the result of an indirect mechanism and explained by reduction of HSV-2-mediated inflammation. The discovery of the direct inhibitory activity of ACV on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase brings new insights into the interpretation of these results. Also, it is important to understand why HSV-2-suppressive therapy with ACV did not reduce HIV-1 acquisition/transmission.

Summary

The direct suppression of HIV-1 by ACV activated by coinfecting HSV-2 may in part explain the ACV-induced decrease of HIV load reported in several clinical trials. If this is the case, other herpes viruses capable of ACV activation may contribute to this effect. New basic studies and new targeted clinical trials are needed to understand whether ACV therapy can also be beneficial for HSV-2-negative patients. These studies will show whether ACV therapy should be included in HIV-1 treatment as well as whether ACV-based drugs specifically targeting HIV-1 can be developed.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in pregnancy with HIV — transmission to fetuses and neonates born to pregnant women with HSV/HIV coinfection can occur, but the likelihood is low. Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens may decrease, but not prevent, maternal genital HSV shedding and recurrence of genital lesions. Use of acyclovir or valacyclovir near term suppresses genital HSV outbreaks and shedding in late pregnancy in women with recurrent genital herpes who do not have HIV and reduces the need for cesarean delivery for recurrent HSV. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes who do not have HIV be offered suppressive antiviral therapy at or beyond 36 weeks.

### Herpes simplex virus and HIV-1: deciphering viral synergy [^114KqPXL]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Recent proof-of-concept randomised controlled trials have shown a causal relation between herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infection and HIV-1 replication in co-infected individuals. We explore the mechanisms that may operate to enhance reciprocal viral replication. Direct interactions could involve HIV-1-related immune deficiency, disruption of mucosal barrier by HSV infection/reactivation, HSV-induced mucosal cell recruitment, transactivation of HIV-1 replication by HSV proteins, and immune modulation by HSV decoys. Indirect interactions might coexist through disturbances of the vaginal flora during HSV shedding and systemic immune activation. In co-infected individuals, suppressive HSV treatment reduces HIV-1 genital and systemic excretion. This finding is a likely result of efficacious prevention of HSV2 reactivations, and perhaps of other herpesviruses. Strategies to control HSV2 and other herpesviruses deserve urgent attention and should become part of the HIV-1 prevention and care package.

### Oral antiviral therapy for prevention of genital herpes outbreaks in immunocompetent and nonpregnant patients [^116w8Hf6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) or 2 (HSV-2). Some infected people experience outbreaks of genital herpes, typically, characterized by vesicular and erosive localized painful genital lesions.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of three oral antiviral drugs (acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir) prescribed to suppress genital herpes outbreaks in non-pregnant patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the search portal of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and pharmaceutical company databases up to February 2014. We also searched US Food and Drug Administration databases and proceedings of seven congresses to a maximum of 10 years. We contacted trial authors and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

We selected parallel-group and cross-over randomized controlled trials including patients with recurrent genital herpes caused by HSV, whatever the type (HSV-1, HSV-2, or undetermined), with at least four recurrences per year (trials concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients or pregnant women were not eligible) and comparing suppressive oral antiviral treatment with oral acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir versus placebo or another suppressive oral antiviral treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected eligible trials and extracted data. The Risk of bias tool was used to assess risk of bias. Treatment effect was measured by the risk ratio (RR) of having at least one genital herpes recurrence. Pooled RRs were derived by conventional pairwise meta-analyses. A network meta-analysis allowed for estimation of all possible two-by-two comparisons between antiviral drugs.

Main Results

A total of 26 trials (among which six had a cross-over design) were included. Among the 6950 randomly assigned participants, 54% (range 0 to 100%) were female, mean age was 35 years (range 26 to 45.1), and the mean number of recurrences per year was 11 (range 6.3 to 17.8). Duration of treatment was two to 12 months. Risk of bias was considered high for half of the studies and unclear for the other half. A total of 14 trials compared acyclovir versus placebo, four trials compared valacyclovir versus placebo and 2 trials compared valacyclovir versus no treatment. Three trials compared famciclovir versus placebo. Two trials compared valacyclovir versus famciclovir and one trial compared acyclovir versus valacyclovir versus placebo. We analyzed data from 22 trials for the outcome: risk of having at least one clinical recurrence. We could not obtain the outcome data for four trials. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a low quality evidence that the risk of having at least one clinical recurrence was reduced with acyclovir (nine parallel-group trials, n = 2049; pooled RR 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.58), valacyclovir (four trials, n = 1788; pooled RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.69), or famciclovir (two trials, n = 732; pooled RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.64). The six cross-over trials showed larger treatment effects on average than the parallel-group trials. We found evidence of a small-study effect for acyclovir placebo-controlled trials (adjusted pooled RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.75). In analyzing parallel-group trials by daily dose, no clear evidence was found of a dose-response relationship for any drug. In head-to-head trials, the risk of having at least one recurrence was increased with valacyclovir rather than acyclovir (one trial, n = 1345; RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.34) and was not significantly different from that seen with famciclovir as compared with valacyclovir (one trial, n = 320; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.63). We included 16 parallel-arm trials in a network meta-analysis and we were unable to determine which of the drugs was most effective in reducing the risk of at least one clinical recurrence (after adjustment for small-study effects, pooled RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.11 for valacyclovir vs acyclovir; pooled RR 1.04, 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.49 for famciclovir vs acyclovir; and pooled RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.75 for famciclovir vs valacyclovir). Safety data were sought but were reported as total numbers of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Owing to risk of bias and inconsistency, there is low quality evidence that suppressive antiviral therapy with acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir in pacients experiencing at least four recurrences of genital herpes per year decreases the number of pacients with at least one recurrence as compared with placebo. Network meta-analysis of the few direct comparisons and the indirect comparisons did not show superiority of one drug over another.

### Progress in meeting today's demands in genital herpes: an overview of current management [^115yW1b7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of genital herpes requires accurate diagnosis, patient support, and effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually straightforward for classic presentations characterized by vesicular lesions but can be challenging for atypical presentations, which are more common. Diagnosis of asymptomatic infection requires access to molecular technology or type-specific serologic assays. Misconceptions about herpes simplex infection are common and patient education is essential. Patient concerns extend beyond disease frequency and severity-the psychological impact should not be underestimated. Antiviral therapy is relevant at all stages of infection. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective and well tolerated for genital herpes treatment. Continuous suppressive therapy controls all symptoms of recurrent disease and helps to relieve disease complications. The prodrugs valacyclovir and famciclovir offer easier, less-frequent dosing than required for acyclovir. Valacyclovir achieves effective suppression when taken once a day. Interventions to prevent genital herpes transmission and to control the global problem are urgently required.

### Valacyclovir for herpes simplex virus infection: long-term safety and sustained efficacy after 20 years' experience with acyclovir [^115rk6jJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

An extensive clinical trial program combined with 5 years' postmarketing experience with valacyclovir provides evidence of favorable safety and efficacy in herpes simplex virus (HSV) management. Valacyclovir enhances acyclovir bioavailability compared with orally administered acyclovir. Long-term use of acyclovir for up to 10 years for HSV suppression is effective and well tolerated. Acyclovir is also approved for use in children, is available in some countries over the counter in cream formulation for herpes labialis, and has been monitored in over 1000 pregnancies. Safety monitoring data from clinical trials of valacyclovir, involving over 3000 immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons receiving long-term therapy for HSV suppression, were analyzed. Safety profiles of valacyclovir (≤ 1000 mg/day), acyclovir (800 mg/day), and placebo were similar. Extensive sensitivity monitoring of HSV isolates confirmed a very low rate of acyclovir resistance among immunocompetent subjects (< 0.5%). The incidence of resistance among immunocompromised patients remains low at about 5%.

### Effect of herpes simplex suppression on incidence of HIV among women in tanzania [^117Qp44W]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is associated with an increased risk of acquiring infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study tested the hypothesis that HSV-2 suppressive therapy reduces the risk of HIV acquisition.

Methods

Female workers at recreational facilities in northwestern Tanzania who were 16 to 35 years of age were interviewed and underwent serologic testing for HIV and HSV-2. We enrolled female workers who were HIV-seronegative and HSV-2-seropositive in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of suppressive treatment with acyclovir (400 mg twice daily). Participants attended mobile clinics every 3 months for a follow-up period of 12 to 30 months, depending on enrollment date. The primary outcome was the incidence of infection with HIV. We used a modified intention-to-treat analysis; data for participants who became pregnant were censored. Adherence to treatment was estimated by a tablet count at each visit.

Results

A total of 821 participants were randomly assigned to receive acyclovir (400 participants) or placebo (421 participants); 679 (83%) completed follow-up. Mean follow-up for the acyclovir and placebo groups was 1.52 and 1.62 years, respectively. The incidence of HIV infection was 4.27 per 100 person-years (27 participants in the acyclovir group and 28 in the placebo group), and there was no overall effect of acyclovir on the incidence of HIV (rate ratio for the acyclovir group, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.83). The estimated median adherence was 90%. Genital HSV was detected in a similar proportion of participants in the two study groups at 6, 12, and 24 months. No serious adverse events were attributable to treatment with acyclovir.

Conclusions

These data show no evidence that acyclovir (400 mg twice daily) as HSV suppressive therapy decreases the incidence of infection with HIV. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN35385041 [controlled-trials.com].).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^116hQWg4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Genital Herpes Management

Antiviral medication offers clinical benefits to symptomatic patients and is the mainstay of management. The goals for use of antiviral medications to treat genital herpes infection are to treat or prevent symptomatic genital herpes recurrences and improve quality of life and suppress the virus to prevent transmission to sexual partners. Counseling regarding the natural history of genital herpes, risks for sexual and perinatal transmission, and methods for reducing transmission is also integral to clinical management.

Systemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and symptoms of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and recurrent episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy. However, these drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after the drug is discontinued. Randomized trials have indicated that three FDA-approved antiviral medications provide clinical benefit for genital herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Valacyclovir is the valine ester of acyclovir and has enhanced absorption after oral administration, allowing for less frequent dosing than acyclovir. Famciclovir also has high oral bioavailability. Topical therapy with antiviral drugs offers minimal clinical benefit and is discouraged.

First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes

Newly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged clinical illness with severe genital ulcerations and neurologic involvement. Even persons with first-episode herpes who have mild clinical manifestations initially can experience severe or prolonged symptoms during recurrent infection. Therefore, all patients with first episodes of genital herpes should receive antiviral therapy.

Recommended Regimens for First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes*
Acyclovir † 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days
or
Famciclovir 250 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days
or
Valacyclovir 1 g orally 2 times/day for 7–10 days
* Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy.
† Acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times/day is also effective but is not recommended because of the frequency of dosing.

### Famciclovir treatment options for patients with frequent outbreaks of recurrent genital herpes: the RELIEF trial [^1135RNrR]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent genital HSV outbreaks are common among those suffering from the disease. Antiviral medications taken as suppressive therapy can reduce the frequency of these recurrences and reduce viral shedding occurring in between recurrences.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of oral famciclovir as episodic (125 mg twice daily for 5 days) and suppressive (250 mg twice daily) treatment of recurrent genital herpes (RGH).

Study Design

This was a randomized, multicenter, 6-month, open-label study. Efficacy variables were time to first recurrence of RGH symptoms, and change in total score of the Recurrent Genital Herpes Quality of Life (RGHQoL) questionnaire. Subject satisfaction questions were summarized.

Results

384 subjects were randomized. There was a highly statistically significant difference between treatments in time to first recurrence of symptoms in favor of suppressive treatment (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between treatments in total score of the RGHQoL or in subject satisfaction with treatment.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that, compared to episodic treatment, suppressive treatment with oral famciclovir may extend the time to symptomatic outbreaks in patients with frequent recurrences of genital herpes.

### Population-level effect of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence of HIV in sub-saharan Africa [^113YZ5mq]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Background:

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection increases acquisition and transmission of HIV, but the results of trials measuring the impact of HSV-2 therapy on HIV genital shedding and HIV acquisition are mixed, and the potential impact of HSV-2 therapy on the incidence of HIV at the population level is unknown.

Methods:

The effects of episodic and suppressive HSV-2 therapy were simulated using the individual-level model STDSIM fitted to data from Cotonou, Benin (relatively low HIV prevalence) and Kisumu, Kenya (high HIV prevalence). Clinician- and patient-initiated episodic therapy, started when symptomatic, were assumed to reduce ulcer duration. Suppressive therapy, given regardless of symptoms, was also assumed to reduce ulcer frequency and HSV-2 infectiousness.

Results:

Clinician-initiated episodic therapy in the general population had almost no effect on the incidence of HIV. The impact of patient-initiated therapy was higher because of earlier treatment initiation, but still low (< 5%) unless symptom recognition and treatment-seeking behaviour were very high. Suppressive therapy given to female sex workers (FSW) in Kisumu had little effect on population HIV incidence. In Cotonou, suppressive therapy in FSW with high coverage and long duration reduced population HIV incidence by > 20% in the long term. Impact was increased in both cities by also treating a proportion of their clients. Long-term suppressive therapy with high coverage in the general population could reduce HIV incidence by more than 30%.

Conclusions:

These results show that HSV-2 therapy could potentially have a population-level impact on the incidence of HIV, especially in more concentrated epidemics. However, a substantial impact requires high coverage and long duration therapy, or very high symptom recognition and treatment-seeking behaviour.

Special considerations regarding antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in people with HIV and HSV: Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision to start ART in people with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected people, particularly in those with low CD4 counts, and in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes are often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

### HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 epidemiological synergy: misguided observational evidence? A modelling study [^114tShXm]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The biological interactions and epidemiological synergy between HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections have been intensely investigated. There is ample observational evidence for a strong HIV/HSV-2 association, and that HSV-2 enhances HIV acquisition. Mathematical models incorporating this synergy estimated that HSV-2 has been a major contributor to the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

Nevertheless, HIV and HSV-2 share the same sexual mode of transmission and propagate on the same sexual networks. It is 'natural' for these two infections to be strongly associated regardless of any HIV/HSV-2 biological interaction. Observational studies attempted to control for this confounding factor by adjusting the measured associations for sexual behaviour, often by controlling for the number of self-reported sexual partners. As adjusted associations were still positive and strong, this supported the existence of a biological interaction, and consequently an epidemiological synergy, between these two infections. As most self-reported sexual data are egocentric, network effects could not be adjusted for in these observational studies.

The difficulty of controlling for network effects, however, limits the validity of these observational studies. The risk of acquiring an STI depends not only on a person's behaviour, but also on the "ecology" of the person within the sexual network, including the partners and partners' partners behaviour, past and present. Sexual networks, therefore, play a critical role in determining STI patterns. For example, it has been hypothesised that concurrency is a main driver of the generalised HIV epidemics in SSA.

Several clinical trials were conducted to target the HIV/HSV-2 epidemiological synergy, by suppressing HSV-2 reactivation to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission, but these trials reached negative outcomes. Different explanations have been advanced for these negative results, such as ineffective HSV-2 suppression, insufficient dose or therapy duration, and poor adherence. It is natural, however, to also question the very existence of this epidemiological synergy — that is, the observed HIV/HSV-2 association could be a spurious association not reflecting a genuine biological effect; it arose from intrinsic biases in study design due to failure to adequately control for confounding by sexual behaviour.

Preventing recurrence of mucocutaneous disease — duration of suppressive therapy and pregnancy considerations: Suppressive therapy may be continued indefinitely, without regard to improved CD4 count; however, the need for continued therapy should be re-evaluated at least annually, particularly if immune reconstitution has occurred (BIII). For pregnancy, suppressive therapy with either valacyclovir or acyclovir is recommended starting at 36 weeks gestation for pregnant women with past genital herpes (AI), whereas suppressive therapy for pregnant women who are seropositive for HSV-2 but without history of genital lesions is not recommended (BIII).

### Advances in the treatment of neonatal herpes simplex infections [^1129Rnr4]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Neonatal HSV disease is a potentially devastating illness with significant mortality and morbidity. Collaborative research efforts over the past 25 years have provided therapeutic options that were beyond hope just a generation ago. The use of high-dose acyclovir for the treatment of acute neonatal HSV disease has reduced mortality rates to their lowest level ever. Application of PCR to clinical specimens from neonates suspected of having neonatal HSV infection largely has eliminated the need to perform invasive brain biopsies, while at the same time providing a new tool with which to re-define the natural history of neonatal HSV disease. A limitation of PCR is the lack of standardisation in methodologies from laboratory to laboratory, which can impede a clinician's ability to interpret the PCR results. As such, all test results, including those from PCR, must be evaluated in the context of the patient's medical condition. Areas for continued research for further means of improvement in disease outcome include raising awareness of neonatal HSV disease so that the time between disease onset and the initiation of antiviral therapy can be shortened, as well as the evaluation of monoclonal antibodies as adjunctive therapy to high-dose acyclovir. Utilisation of suppressive oral acyclovir following acute neonatal disease is another therapeutic option under clinical investigation with the potential to improve morbidity outcomes of neonatal HSV disease survivors.

Anti-HSV therapies are only suppressive because they do not eliminate latent HSV present in ganglionic neurons, the source of recurrent disease. We have developed a potentially curative approach against HSV infection, based on gene editing using HSV-specific meganucleases delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Gene editing performed with two anti-HSV-1 meganucleases delivered by a combination of AAV9, AAV-Dj/8, and AAV-Rh10 can eliminate 90% or more of latent HSV DNA in mouse models of orofacial infection, and up to 97% of latent HSV DNA in mouse models of genital infection. Using a pharmacological approach to reactivate latent HSV-1, we demonstrate that ganglionic viral load reduction leads to a significant decrease of viral shedding in treated female mice. While therapy is well tolerated, in some instances, we observe hepatotoxicity at high doses and subtle histological evidence of neuronal injury without observable neurological signs or deficits. Simplification of the regimen through use of a single serotype (AAV9) delivering single meganuclease targeting a duplicated region of the HSV genome, dose reduction, and use of a neuron-specific promoter each results in improved tolerability while retaining efficacy. These results reinforce the curative potential of gene editing for HSV disease.

Regarding specific circumstances for genital herpes, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (primary prevention), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to do not administer suppressive anti-HSV therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners in patients with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection not on antiretroviral therapy.

Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes

Almost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 genital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of genital lesions. Intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs among persons with HSV-2 genital herpes infection, even those with longstanding clinically silent infection. Antiviral therapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either as suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions. Certain persons, including those with mild or infrequent recurrent outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, options for treatment should be discussed. Many persons prefer suppressive therapy, which has the additional advantage of decreasing the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to susceptible partners.

### Congenital herpes simplex virus in the newborn: a diagnostic dilemma [^1151DcUF]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Although congenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is rare, it is associated with severe morbidity. We report a 36-week gestational age infant who presented with atypical skin lesions, presumably mitigated by exposure to maternal antiviral suppressive therapy. The initial absence of typical herpetic vesicles and lack of viral detection in skin lesions delayed the correct diagnosis, highlighting the importance of differentiating HSV from other neonatal rashes.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in pregnancy — delivery planning, suppressive therapy, and neonatal transmission emphasizes that the rate of neonatal HSV transmission is highest with primary HSV-1 or HSV-2 genital infection during late pregnancy, and cesarean delivery is recommended for pregnant women with a genital herpes prodrome or visible HSV genital lesions at the onset of labor (AII). For pregnant women with past genital herpes, suppressive therapy with either valacyclovir or acyclovir is recommended starting at 36 weeks gestation (AI), and for primary outbreaks in the third trimester, continuing antiviral therapy until delivery may be considered. All of these interventions are likely to be similarly effective in people with HIV as in those without. Suppressive therapy for pregnant women who are seropositive for HSV-2 but without history of genital lesions is not recommended (BIII). Postnatal transmission can occur rarely, and to prevent postnatal transmission, pregnant women with herpetic lesions on any part of the body should take special precautions with handwashing prior to handling the neonate.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116QuZuS]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Secondary prevention — adolescents and young adults with HIV and recurrent genital HSV: Adolescents and young adults with HIV who suffer severe, frequent, and/or troubling recurrent genital HSV infection will benefit from anti-HSV suppression therapy (strong; moderate). Placebo-controlled trials in adults with HIV who are receiving ART demonstrated that antiviral drugs for recurrent HSV disease reduced symptomatic recurrences by 60% to 75%, and chronic suppressive therapy also reduced HSV-2 transmission to susceptible partners without HIV by 25% to 75%; this is an option for patients with frequent, severe, or troubling HSV recurrences.
