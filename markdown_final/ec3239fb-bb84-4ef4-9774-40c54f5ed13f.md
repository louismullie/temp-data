## Question

Klebsiella pneumonia uti treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infections, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the UTI syndrome and severity. Then, I should verify risk factors for resistance and the need for cultures. Next, I will consider empiric therapy choices by severity and local epidemiology, followed by definitive therapy once susceptibilities return. After that, I need to check special populations and stewardship considerations, and finally, I will review duration, IV-to-oral switch criteria, and follow-up testing, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because treatment hinges on whether this is uncomplicated cystitis, complicated UTI, or pyelonephritis, and whether there are systemic features or sepsis. Uncomplicated cystitis is lower-tract disease in a nonpregnant, immunocompetent woman without structural or functional urinary abnormalities, whereas complicated UTI involves obstruction, catheters, recent instrumentation, immunosuppression, pregnancy, or male sex, and pyelonephritis implies upper-tract involvement with flank pain, fever, or systemic features; sepsis requires urgent broad-spectrum therapy and source control, so I need to ensure I categorize correctly before choosing antibiotics [^112bLb2m] [^116wywDX] [^116FkURv].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance risk factors and the need for cultures before starting empiric therapy. Prior ESBL colonization or infection, recent broad-spectrum antibiotics, healthcare exposure, indwelling devices, and travel to regions with high CRE prevalence all raise the likelihood of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella; obtaining a urinalysis and urine culture with susceptibilities, and two sets of blood cultures if sepsis is suspected, are essential to guide de-escalation and avoid prolonged broad-spectrum exposure [^112qhcUu] [^114dEX5z] [^116AYxK5].

> I will now examine empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis due to Klebsiella, but hold on, I should confirm which oral agents are appropriate. Nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin are first-line options when the isolate is susceptible, but nitrofurantoin has no activity against Proteus and variable activity against Klebsiella, so I need to check local susceptibility before choosing it; ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin are reasonable alternatives if resistance is low locally, and pivmecillinam is newly approved and active against Enterobacterales including Klebsiella, offering another oral option in women with limited alternatives [^1142eqNf] [^111ZLLwx] [^117RCSCu] [^114NDdVN] [^112BZxh4].

> Next, I should review empiric therapy for complicated UTI without sepsis. Third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones are appropriate initial choices based on local epidemiology and patient risk factors; I need to ensure I avoid carbapenems up front unless the patient is high risk for ESBL or CRE, and I should remember that ceftriaxone is reasonable if susceptibility is likely, while cefepime offers broader Gram-negative coverage including some ESBLs when needed [^112xZtgT] [^1176hGec] [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach when sepsis is present or the patient is critically ill. In that scenario, carbapenems such as meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred empirically because they reliably cover ESBL-producing Enterobacterales; if Pseudomonas is a concern, I should add an antipseudomonal agent or choose a carbapenem with antipseudomonal activity, and I must not forget to obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible and to address source control promptly [^116FkURv] [^115rp3Xo].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy. I should confirm that beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone or ampicillin are preferred, and that nitrofurantoin is acceptable in the second trimester but avoided near term; aminoglycosides should be used cautiously due to fetal ototoxicity risk, so I need to weigh severity and alternatives carefully [^notfound].

> For pediatrics, I should double-check that third-generation cephalosporins remain appropriate empiric therapy for most community-onset UTIs, with local resistance patterns guiding choices; in neonates and young infants, ampicillin plus gentamicin is standard, and for suspected ESBL, amikacin retains high susceptibility and can spare carbapenems when clinically stable, with total durations typically 10–14 days for cUTI and early IV-to-oral switch when improving [^1155TKup] [^1141U6vd] [^113wtma2].

> Now, I need to ensure definitive therapy is tailored once susceptibilities return. If ESBL-producing Klebsiella is identified, carbapenems are preferred for pyelonephritis or cUTI, with TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as oral step-down options if susceptible; I should avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL pyelonephritis or cUTI despite in vitro susceptibility because of inferior outcomes, and I should de-escalate promptly to the narrowest active agent [^115rp3Xo] [^115SPMPY].

> But wait, what if the isolate is carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. I should confirm that preferred agents include ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, or cefiderocol based on the resistance mechanism, with TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin reasonable if susceptible; for OXA-48–like producers, ceftazidime-avibactam is preferred and cefiderocol is an alternative, whereas meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam have limited activity and are not suggested; aminoglycosides such as plazomicin can be considered when options are limited, and polymyxins should generally be avoided except as a last resort for uncomplicated CRE cystitis due to nephrotoxicity and inferior outcomes [^117Nsaet] [^1121i1EA] [^113TCsBM] [^116CDg2U].

> I should double-check the role of piperacillin-tazobactam in ESBL UTIs. Observational data suggest piperacillin-tazobactam may be noninferior to carbapenems for nonbacteremic ESBL pyelonephritis, but IDSA guidance still recommends carbapenems as preferred for ESBL pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis and the patient is improving, no change is needed, but I should avoid it for ESBL pyelonephritis or cUTI when alternatives are available [^112wumTy] [^115SPMPY].

> Next, I should review duration and the IV-to-oral switch strategy. For uncomplicated cystitis, 5–7 days is typical, for complicated UTI 7–14 days, and for pyelonephritis 10–14 days, with longer durations for abscesses or slow response; switching to oral therapy is appropriate once the patient is clinically improving, hemodynamically stable, afebrile for 24–48 hours, and able to tolerate oral intake, with step-down choices guided by susceptibilities and patient factors [^116wywDX].

> I need to ensure follow-up and source control are not overlooked. Repeat urine cultures are not routinely needed for uncomplicated cystitis if symptoms resolve, but for complicated infections or persistent symptoms, repeat cultures are warranted; in catheter-associated UTI, catheter removal or exchange improves outcomes, and in sepsis, timely source control is critical to reduce mortality and recurrence risk [^115Xk6Uu].

> Let me reconsider stewardship and local epidemiology, because these shape empiric choices. I should verify local antibiograms and, when available, urinary-specific antibiograms that incorporate patient risk factors, as they can reveal higher ESBL prevalence in certain populations and guide narrower empiric therapy; avoiding unnecessary carbapenems up front and de-escalating promptly once cultures return are key stewardship actions that also reduce selection pressure for CRE [^112qhcUu].

> Finally, I should confirm that I have addressed emerging options and special caveats. Cefiderocol is an important agent for CRE with limited alternatives, ceftazidime-avibactam has robust data for cUTI including pyelonephritis, and prolonged or continuous infusion of beta-lactams can optimize pharmacodynamics in severe infections; for uncomplicated cystitis in women with limited options, sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid is newly approved and can be considered when susceptibility allows [^116Uup1J] [^116xSGsm] [^114NDdVN].

Klebsiella pneumoniae UTIs require **culture-guided therapy** [^115EMcVZ] due to rising resistance [^111Toron]. For uncomplicated cystitis, use **nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX** if susceptible; **fosfomycin** is an alternative [^112pWagD] [^111ZLLwx] [^117Y6SAC]. For complicated infections or pyelonephritis, use **third-generation cephalosporins** (ceftriaxone, cefepime) or **carbapenems** if ESBL is suspected; avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL pyelonephritis [^115rp3Xo] [^115SPMPY]. For CRE, use **ceftazidime-avibactam**, **meropenem-vaborbactam**, or **cefiderocol**; reserve aminoglycosides or polymyxins for limited options [^117Nsaet] [^116CDg2U]. Adjust therapy to **susceptibilities** [^115EMcVZ], treat for 7–14 days, and monitor for clinical response and adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and resistance patterns

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a **major uropathogen** [^111Toron], particularly in complicated UTIs, and exhibits increasing resistance to multiple antibiotic classes [^114ikvdE]. Resistance patterns include:

- **ESBL production**: Common, limiting cephalosporin use [^115rp3Xo].
- **Carbapenem resistance**: Increasing globally, necessitating alternative agents [^117Nsaet].
- **MDR phenotypes**: Frequent, complicating empiric therapy [^114ikvdE].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns**, patient-specific factors, and illness severity [^116uTTsD]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Nitrofurantoin <br/> - TMP-SMX <br/> - Fosfomycin (if susceptible) [^112pWagD] [^111ZLLwx] [^117RCSCu] |
| Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis | - Ceftriaxone <br/> - Cefepime <br/> - Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem) if ESBL suspected [^112xZtgT] [^115SPMPY] |
| Severe infection or sepsis | - Carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin) [^116FkURv] <br/> - Piperacillin-tazobactam (if Pseudomonas suspected) [^112xZtgT] |

---

## Definitive therapy based on culture and susceptibility results

Definitive therapy should be **tailored to culture and susceptibility results**:

- **ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae**: Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem) are preferred [^115rp3Xo].
- **Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRE)**: Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, or cefiderocol are preferred [^117Nsaet].
- **Limited options**: Aminoglycosides (amikacin, plazomicin) or polymyxins (colistin) may be considered [^116CDg2U] [^113TCsBM].

---

## Duration of therapy

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: 5–7 days [^notfound].
- **Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis**: 10–14 days [^notfound].
- **Catheter-associated UTI**: 10–14 days, with catheter removal or replacement when possible [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence

Clinical outcomes depend on the **timeliness and appropriateness of therapy** [^112GMCtc]. Delayed or inappropriate therapy increases the risk of clinical failure, recurrence, and progression to severe infections such as pyelonephritis or sepsis [^111ZpmEj]. Recurrence is common, particularly in patients with structural abnormalities, immunocompromised states, or ongoing risk factors such as indwelling catheters [^111wiGoG].

---

## Adverse effects and monitoring

Adverse effects vary by antibiotic class:

- **Beta-lactams**: Hypersensitivity reactions, gastrointestinal upset [^notfound].
- **Carbapenems**: Gastrointestinal upset, seizures (rare) [^notfound].
- **Aminoglycosides**: Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, neurotoxicity [^notfound].
- **Polymyxins**: Nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity [^116CDg2U].

Regular monitoring for **clinical response**, **adverse effects**, and **necessity of therapy adjustments** is essential [^116wywDX].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel approaches

Emerging therapies include **novel beta-lactamase inhibitors** (e.g. vaborbactam, relebactam) and **siderophore cephalosporins** (e.g. cefiderocol) [^117Nsaet]. These agents show promise in treating MDR K. pneumoniae infections, particularly carbapenem-resistant strains [^114enDaW]. Additionally, **non-antibiotic approaches** such as bacteriophage therapy and anti-virulence strategies are under investigation [^114miavC].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **infection control measures**, **antibiotic stewardship**, and **patient education**. In healthcare settings, strict adherence to hand hygiene, catheter care protocols, and antimicrobial stewardship programs significantly reduce the incidence of K. pneumoniae UTIs [^notfound]. Patient education on hygiene, hydration, and adherence to prescribed antibiotic regimens is also critical [^114MAVrC].

---

Klebsiella pneumoniae UTIs require **culture-guided therapy** due to rising resistance [^112xZtgT]. For uncomplicated cystitis, use nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX if susceptible; fosfomycin is an alternative [^112pWagD] [^117RCSCu]. For complicated infections or pyelonephritis, use third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefepime) or carbapenems if ESBL is suspected; avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL pyelonephritis [^112xZtgT] [^115SPMPY]. For CRE, use ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, or cefiderocol; reserve aminoglycosides or polymyxins for limited options [^117Nsaet] [^116CDg2U]. Adjust therapy to susceptibilities, treat for 7–14 days, and monitor for clinical response and adverse effects [^notfound].

### Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options [^111Toron]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.

### Prognosis of urinary tract infection caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: the impact of inappropriate empirical treatment [^112GMCtc]. The Journal of Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is scarce information on the prognosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp).

Objetive

To investigate the association between KPC-Kp aetiology and clinical failure and all cause mortality and to explore the impact of inappropriate empirical treatment.

Material and Methods

This is a retrospective observational study of hospitalized patients with UTI due to K. pneumoniae. We explored clinical failure at day 21 and 30-day all-cause mortality using different models of adjusted analysis.

Results

We analyzed 142 episodes of UTI; 46 episodes (32.4%) were due to KPC-Kp and 96 episodes (67.6%) were due to non-KPC-Kp strains (62 wild type and 34 EBSL producer). Clinical failure was more frequent in the KPC-Kp group (41.3% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.001). KPC-Kp aetiology and inappropriate empirical therapy were associated in the non-adjusted analysis with clinical failure. When analysed in separate adjusted models, both were found to be associated; inappropriate empirical treatment (OR 2.51; 95% CI, 1.03–6.12; p = 0.04) and KPC-Kp (OR 2.73; 95% CI, 1.03–7.22; p = 0.04) were associated with increased risk of failure. All-cause 30-day mortality was higher in patients with KPC-Kp UTI (39.1% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.002). Bacteraemia was more frequent in patients with KPC-Kp etiology (23.9% vs. 10.4%; p = 0.034). In both cases, the association was not confirmed in the adjusted analysis.

Conclusion

KPC-Kp UTI is associated with higher clinical failure and may be due to an increase in inappropriate empirical treatment.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^116j5Mhf]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^115ZZ8x3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Recently, a double-carbapenem combination (ertapenem-doripenem) has been proposed as a potential treatment strategy for KPC-producing bacteria. Data come from in vitro experiments on a murine animal model as well as in vivo. Regarding the latter, three patients with bacteremia or urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pan-resistant KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and one ICU patient with bacteremia and sepsis caused by colistin-resistant KPC-producing K. pneumoniae were reported to have been successfully treated with a double-carbapenem combination. Most recently, Karaiskos and colleagues reported treating 14 patients with bacteremias and UTIs, including two patients with septic shock caused by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae with double-carbapenems therapy, as follows: 1 g ertapenem IV daily, followed 1 hour later by meropenem at 2 g every 8 hours infused over 3 hours. All treated patients experienced clinical and microbiological cure at 1-month follow-up, although four patients experienced a recurrence of their UTI. Nevertheless, since the clinical experience with this salvage therapy is still limited, concerns for promoting further carbapenem resistance remain, and the MICs of many carbapenem-producing organisms are sufficiently high to render carbapenems ineffective, this treatment strategy is not routinely recommended for clinical practice at the present time.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^1142eqNf]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Proquin XR is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms listed below. Proquin XR is not interchangeable with other ciprofloxacin extended-release or immediate release oral formulations. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PROQUIN XR IN TREATING PYELONEPHRITIS, COMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS, AND INFECTIONS OTHER THAN UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. Alternative therapy should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic or develop fever and back pain while on treatment with Proquin XR.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Proquin XR and other antibacterial drugs, Proquin XR should only be used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and sensitivity information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Treatment and clinical outcomes of urinary tract infections caused by KPC-producing enterobacteriaceae in a retrospective cohort [^113PgB7f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment regimens for infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are not well-defined.

Objectives

This study describes the treatment and outcomes in patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from adult inpatients with bacteriuria caused by KPC-positive organisms treated at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from June 1, 2006, to February 1, 2008. KPC-positive isolates were identified utilizing disk-diffusion susceptibility testing and confirmed to contain bla(KPC) via molecular methods.

Results

Twenty-one patients met the inclusion criteria and all were classified as having symptomatic UTI. The majority of patients were female (15/21 [71%]), and the mean (SD) age was 62.4 (15.2) years. Successful clinical and microbiologic responses were observed in 16 patients (76%) for both outcomes. Patients with urinary catheters had them removed or replaced in 9 of 15 cases (60%). Antibiotics active against the isolated pathogen were provided in 14 of 21 cases (67%), often after considerable delay (median, 72.5 hours [range, 4–312 hours]). All 7 patients receiving aminoglycoside therapy had successful clinical and microbiologic responses, and in vitro testing of an extended antibiotic panel revealed high susceptibility rates for tigecycline (28/29 [97%]), minocycline (22/29 [76%]), and fosfomycin (25/29 [86%]) against the KPC-positive isolates.

Conclusions

Although receipt of appropriate therapy was delayed in many cases, clinical outcomes investigated revealed high rates of successful response in this defined group of patients Aminoglycosides and tetracycline derivatives suggested therapeutic promise in the treatment of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae UTI.

### Time to appropriate antibiotic therapy is a predictor of outcome in patients with bloodstream infection caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^11731b5i]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is an urgent public health threat requiring immediate action. As a matter of fact, carbapenem-resistant (CR) Kp infections are associated with high attributable mortality (2118 attributable deaths out of a total of 15,947 infections), and with a median number of total disability-adjusted life years of 11.5 per 100,000 population. Mortality rates of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by KPC-Kp range from 40 to 50%.

Treatment of patients with BSIs caused by KPC-Kp represents a challenge for clinicians, and no data from randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotic strategies are currently available. Observational studies indicate that combination therapies are more effective than monotherapies. Moreover, a retrospective study performed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock showed that an antibiotic regimen containing at least two in vitro active antibiotics is associated with improved survival. Novel drugs represent new promising treatment options, but larger studies are needed to evaluate their impact on survival of patients with KPC-Kp infections. Thus, the optimal therapy of KPC-Kp BSI has not been defined.

Timely and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is critically important for treatment of patients with BSI. Recent studies highlighted that inappropriate empiric treatment is associated with poor outcome of patients with urinary tract or any type of infection due to KPC-Kp. Among non-neutropenic patients with BSI due to KPC-Kp, Satlin et al. did not find any association between timing of active therapy and mortality, but a trend to higher mortality rates was observed in patients who did not receive active therapy within the first 12 h from BSI onset; however, the majority of patients (84%) acquired infection in the community or in non-ICU wards. Thus, the relationship between timing of appropriate therapy and outcome of BSI caused by KPC-Kp has not been specifically investigated in ICU patients.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the time to appropriate antibiotic therapy and the clinical outcome in ICU patients with BSI caused by KPC-Kp.

### Interpretable machine learning-based decision support for prediction of antibiotic resistance for complicated urinary tract infections [^116VfxPM]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent years have seen rapid increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which is threatening the efficacy of many antibiotic therapies, and ultimately leading to treatment failure –. Although new drugs are urgently needed, new antibiotic development is restricted by costs, limited government support, and regulatory requirements. For instance, as of 2019, major pharmaceutical corporations, commonly known as "big pharma", were progressively divesting themselves of antibiotic research and development (R&D) assets. This shift restricts the opportunities available to smaller companies and their investors, leading to heightened financial constraints and a lack of infrastructure for antibiotic R&D.

Furthermore, antibiotic resistance leads to increased reliance on broad-spectrum therapies, which select for further resistance, exacerbating the issue at hand. To avoid these risks, it is critical for clinicians to accurately align available antibiotic therapies with the precise susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens. Ideally, this alignment should occur when initiating empirical treatment, even before culture results are obtained (which might take several days to be available). In this study, we present interpretable machine learning (ML)-based methods for predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which decreases the risk of non-susceptible and therefore, ineffective treatment, and facilitates rapid effective clinical intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these systems for urinary tract infections (UTIs), where the problem of antibiotic resistance is of particular importance.

UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide, affecting more than 150 million people each year. The pathogens that cause UTIs, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, can be carried asymptomatically and thus, are frequently exposed to antibiotics, including those intended for other infections. This exposure, combined with high recurrence rates, often results in multidrug-resistant strains, with resistance rates of over 20% for commonly used drugs. As treatment-outcome is associated with the infecting pathogen's susceptibilities, clinicians are faced with the challenging task of correctly prescribing patients with the most appropriate antibiotics. However, to offer rapid intervention, treatment is commonly administered empirically, lacking insight into the specific antibiotics that the infecting pathogen may be susceptible to. This scenario adds to the potential of choosing an inadequate treatment regimen.

### Treatment strategy for a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella UTI [^112sCToH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the management strategy for a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI).

Case Summary

A 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of recurrent UTIs and a right-lung transplant presented with fever to 101.4°F, chills, malaise, and cloudy, foul-smelling urine for approximately 1 week. She was found to have a MDR Klebsiella UTI that was sensitive to tigecycline and cefepime. To further evaluate the degree of resistance Etest minimum inhibitory concentrations were requested for cefepime, amikacin, meropenem, and ertapenem. The patient received a 14-day course of amikacin, which resulted in resolution of her symptoms. One month later, the patient's UTI symptoms returned. The urine culture again grew MDR Klebsiella, sensitive only to tigecycline. Fosfomycin was initiated and resulted in limited resolution of her symptoms. Colistin was started, however, therapy was discontinued on day 5 secondary to the development of acute kidney injury. Despite the short course of therapy, the patient's symptoms resolved.

Discussion

The case presented lends itself well to numerous discussion items that are important to consider when determining optimal treatment for MDR Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs). Susceptibility testing is an important tool for optimizing antibiotic therapy, however, automated systems may overestimate the susceptibility profile for a MDR GNB. Treatment strategies evaluated to treat MDR GNB, include combination therapy with a carbepenem and synergy using polymyxin.

Conclusion

We have described the management strategy for a MDR Klebsiella UTI, the consequences of the initial management strategy, and potential strategies to manage these types of infections in future patients.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115rp3Xo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infections: evaluation of methodological quality using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation II instrument [^115wCJ11]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Reliance on evidence-based medicine requires high methodological standards from guideline developers. We sought to determine the methodological quality of guidelines on pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). We included guidelines published by national or international committees in the last 10 years providing recommendations for antibiotic type or duration. We applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II checklist, adding under each item the specific focus relevant to bacterial infections, addressing antibiotic resistance and local epidemiology. Three assessors scored each guideline independently. Mean aggregated scores, converted to percentage per domain, are presented. We included 13 guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia and seven guidelines for the treatment of UTI. 'Scope and purpose' scored 69.4% for pneumonia and 71.4% for UTI. Guidelines were downgraded for lack of an epidemiological overview relevant to intended users. 'Stakeholder involvement' scored 39.5% for pneumonia and 44.5% UTI, with the major fault being lack of patient consultation. 'Rigour of development' scored 42.8% for pneumonia and 56.9% for UTI. Commonly, the search process lacked precision, no risk of bias assessment was performed, outcomes in primary studies were not critically assessed or used to direct recommendations, and there was no formal methodology for formulating recommendations. 'Clarity of presentation' scored highest: 67.7% for pneumonia and 68.5% for UTI. 'Applicability' of the guidelines in antibiotic stewardship programmes was usually not addressed: 16.9% and 25.4%, respectively. 'Editorial independence' scored 30.6% for pneumonia and 55.6% for UTI. Formal examination of guidelines in infectious diseases showed worrying findings related to core methodology and potential bias caused by competing interests.

### Outcomes of empirical antimicrobial therapy for pediatric community-onset febrile urinary tract infection in the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance [^113wtma2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common cause of fever in children. Despite the increasing numbers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in the community, the empirical therapy of choice is still third-generation cephalosporins. This study was performed to investigate whether inappropriate empirical therapy (IAT) of community-onset UTI results in adverse clinical outcomes.

Methods

We retrospectively studied a cohort of pediatric patients with first-episode community-onset UTI caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus spp. at Ramathibodi Hospital from 2011 to 2017. The patients were classified into IAT and appropriate empirical therapy (AT) groups. Medical records were reviewed to assess clinical outcomes.

Results

One hundred fifty-one eligible patients were enrolled in this study. The most common causative organism was E. coli (88.8% and 96.2% in the AT and IAT groups, respectively). Among the causative organisms, 19.8% were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms. There was no significant difference in clinical failure, microbiologic failure, relapse or time to defervescence between the 2 groups. No patients in either group developed sepsis after receiving empirical therapy. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the IAT than AT group [4.00 (4.50–6.00) vs. 7.00 (5.00–11.25) days, respectively; P = 0.000].

Conclusions

No significant difference in treatment outcomes was found between pediatric patients receiving AT and IAT for the treatment of UTI. In the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, third-generation cephalosporins may still be a good choice as an empirical antimicrobial for children diagnosed with community-onset UTI.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases and clinical outcomes: current data [^115JhTEJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Nosocomial infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria complicate therapy and limit treatment options. However, the clinical significance of infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria remains unclear. A critical examination of the literature provides divergent views of the effect of ESBL carriage on morbidity and mortality and suggests that ESBL production may have its most marked effect on ceftazidime. Effective strategies for the empirical and directed treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens include the use of carbapenems and, possibly, the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. Studies indicate that the use of cefepime to treat serious nosocomial infections (e.g., bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections) is associated with high rates of microbiological and clinical success. The probability of attaining time above the minimum inhibitory concentration targets of at least 70% of the dosing interval, an important pharmacodynamic indicator of clinical success, is higher with cefepime than with other antimicrobials against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains exhibiting ESBL phenotypes. However, for non-ESBL-producing strains, there is no difference in the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration between ceftazidime and cefepime. When used appropriately in institutional settings, cefepime reduces the overall use of cephalosporins, thereby decreasing selection pressure for presumptive ESBL-producing pathogens.

### Clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia developing secondary Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection [^114PNqc8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is a gram-negative, encapsulated, bacterium in the environment. The bacterium typically colonizes human mucosal surfaces, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and oropharynx. Once the bacteria enter the body, they can exhibit a high degree of toxicity and antibiotic resistance. KP pneumonia accounts for approximately 11.8% of all hospital-acquired pneumonia cases cases worldwide and nearly 15% of all cases of pneumonia in developing countries. Patients with KP pneumonia often display a poor prognosis. Even with optimal treatment, the mortality rate of KP pneumonia is between 30 and 50%. KP bloodstream infection (KP-BSI) is one of the most fatal infections and is associated with high mortality ranging from 20 to 40%, whereas mortality was reported to reach 67.6% in ICU patients. The most important prognostic variables in KP-BSI are the main site of infection (i.e. pneumonia more than urinary tract infection), the severity of the underlying disease (i.e. septic shock or a higher APACHE II score) and the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy. Indeed, the prognosis, including hospital stays, mortality and hospitalization costs, is usually worse in patients with KP pneumonia once they are complicated with bacteremia. However, whether the outcomes of patients with KP pneumonia developing into secondary KP-BSI (KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI) would be worse than in the patients with KP-pneumonia alone or which risk factors contribute to the development of secondary KP-BSI from KP pneumonia alone are largely unknown.

### Time to appropriate antibiotic therapy is a predictor of outcome in patients with bloodstream infection caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^111ZpmEj]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) are associated with high mortality. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between time to administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and the outcome of patients with BSI due to KPC-Kp hospitalized in intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

An observational study was conducted in the ICUs of two academic centers in Italy. Patients with KPC-Kp bacteremia hospitalized between January 2015 to December 2018 were included. The primary outcome was the relationship between time from blood cultures (BC) collection to appropriate antibiotic therapy and 30-day mortality. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the association of different treatment regimens with 30-day mortality and a composite endpoint (30-day mortality or nephrotoxicity). A Cox regression analysis to identify factors independently associated with 30-day mortality was performed. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

Results

A total of 102 patients with KPC-Kp BSI were included. The most common sources of infection were intra-abdominal (23.5%), urinary tract (20.6%), and skin and skin structure (17.6%). The 30-day mortality was 45%. Median time to appropriate antibiotic therapy was shorter in patients who survived (8.5h [IQR 1–36]) versus those who died (48h [IQR 5–108], p = 0.014). A propensity score matching showed that receipt of an in vitro active therapy within 24h from BC collection was associated with lower 30-day mortality (HR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.188–0.690, p = 0.0021). At Cox regression analysis, factors associated with 30-day mortality were primary bacteremia (HR 2.662 [95% CI 1.118–6.336], p = 0.027), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.196 [95% CI 1.082–4.457], p = 0.029), time (24-h increments) from BC collection to appropriate therapy (HR 1.382 [95% CI 1.132–1.687], p = 0.001), SOFA score (HR 1.122 [95% CI 1.036–1.216], p = 0.005), and age (HR 1.030 [95% CI 1.006–1.054], p = 0.012). Ceftazidime-avibactam-containing regimens were associated with reduced risk of composite endpoint (30-day mortality OR nephrotoxicity) (HR 0.231 [95% CI 0.071–0.745], p = 0.014) compared to colistin-containing regimens.

Conclusions

Time to appropriate antibiotic therapy is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with KPC-Kp BSI. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should begin within 24h from the collection of BC.

### Pivmecillinam for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection: new efficacy analysis [^112BZxh4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In April 2024-over 40 years after its first approval in Europe-pivmecillinam received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI) in women aged ≥ 18 years, caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Herein, we describe the reanalysis from previously published clinical trials, conducted in accordance with current FDA efficacy criteria, which formed the basis for this regulatory approval.

Methods

Of 14 studies reviewed, 3 randomized, controlled trials offered suitable subject-level data from patients with uUTI treated with 185 mg pivmecillinam 3 times daily for 3–7 days. Efficacy endpoints for reanalysis were rates of overall (composite clinical and microbiological), clinical, and microbiological response in the microbiological intention-to-treat population (urine culture ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units/mL; ≤ 2 microorganism species; no baseline pathogen nonsusceptible to active comparator).

Results

Across the 3 primary studies, overall success rates with pivmecillinam at test of cure (Days 7–15) were 62.0%-71.7% (clinical success, 63.5%-82.7%; microbiological success, 74.3%-86.9%). Overall success was higher for pivmecillinam than for placebo (95% confidence interval for the difference, 41.2–62.0) or ibuprofen (31.2–56.5) and similar to cephalexin (-15.6 to 7.4). Response to pivmecillinam was demonstrated in uUTIs caused by Enterobacterales, including E. coli, P. mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as gram-positive S. saprophyticus.

Conclusions

This reanalysis of randomized, controlled trial data confirmed the efficacy of oral pivmecillinam in uUTI and was used to support its recent approval in the United States.

### Current antibiotic resistance patterns of rare uropathogens: survey from central European urology department 2011–2019 [^116ZLneU]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

With approximately 150–250 million cases occurring globally per year, urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent some of the most common infectious diseases in humans. Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. are their most common causative agents. UTIs occur more frequently among women than in men: 50% of females will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. Recurrences are common and besides associated morbidity, UTIs put pressure on health care systems, too. While the cost of treatment of a single UTI episode is insignificant, their frequent incidence means they consume a non-negligible part of the health care budget: in France alone, the expense for adult female UTIs amounted to 58 million euro in 2012. Complicated UTIs are even more costly: one episode of a complicated UTI costs between 4028 and 7740 euro depending on the health care system.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a major concern threathening many an advance of medicine in the twenty-first century. Uropathogenic microorganisms are no exception to this: rates of AMR among Enterobacteriaceae are increasing globally, albeit with temporal and spatial differences. Antibiotic consumption is a primary driver for the spread of AMR as evidenced on local and country levels. For instance, southern European states exhibit higher AMR rates than northern ones. Of note, four top antibiotic prescribers in Europe (Greece, Cyprus, France and Italy) belong among south European countries.

International guidelines for UTI treatment are freely available; yet, poor antibiotic prescription remains common. Thirty percent of primary care antibiotic prescriptions were inadequate in a report from the United States. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was reported in 68% of adult cystitis cases and only 46% of pyelonephritis cases in another survey.

### Pathogen-focused clinical development to address unmet medical need: cefiderocol targeting carbapenem resistance [^116Uup1J]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Historically, the regulatory requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for developing new antibiotics have not addressed pathogen-focused indications for drug approval. The design of the necessary randomized controlled trials traditionally involves the enrollment of patients with site-specific infections caused by susceptible as well as resistant pathogens. Cefiderocol has undergone a streamlined clinical development program to address serious carbapenem-resistant infections. The regulatory approach, and the pivotal clinical trials, differed between the FDA and EMA. In the United States, the APEKS-cUTI (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Stenotrophomonas-complicated urinary tract infection) study was conducted to provide the basis for FDA approval of a site-specific cUTI indication. The EMA, however, preferred the CREDIBLE-CR (A MultiCenter, RandomizED, Open-label ClInical Study of S-649266 or Best AvailabLE Therapy for the Treatment of Severe Infections Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Gram-negative Pathogens) study, in which patients with nosocomial pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or cUTIs were enrolled if they had a carbapenem-resistant pathogen. The resulting European label will be pathogen focused rather than infection site specific (ie, treatment of gram-negative infection in patients with limited treatment options). The implications and limitations of these different regulatory processes are discussed.

### Consensus review of the epidemiology and appropriate antimicrobial therapy of complicated urinary tract infections in Asia-Pacific region [^1127rChk]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the general population. They cause a substantial financial burden in the community and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in hospitals. With increased rates of antimicrobial resistance, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, treatment of complicated UTIs (cUTIs) can be challenging for clinicians. Consideration of an optimal antimicrobial agent should be based on local resistance patterns, patient-specific factors, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, and cost. In the Asia-Pacific region, nearly half of Escherichia coli urinary isolates were resistant (including intermediate and resistant) to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin and ≥ 30% were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) and cefepime. Overall, 33% of urinary E. coli isolates exhibited extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing phenotypes. Prevalence of ESBL-producing urinary E. coli was highest in India (60%), followed by Hong Kong (48%) and Singapore (33%). All urinary isolates of E. coli were susceptible to both ertapenem and imipenem. All urinary isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible to imipenem and 4% of them were resistant to ertapenem. Care should be exercised when using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins for the empirical treatment of UTIs, particularly cUTI among moderately to severely ill patients. Empiric antimicrobial treatment for serious cUTIs in which risk factors for resistant organisms exist should include broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam. Aminoglycosides, tigecycline, and polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) can be used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms or serious cUTIs when first-line options are deemed inappropriate or patients fail therapy. Because of considerable variability in different countries, local epidemiological data is critical in the effective management of UTIs in the Asia-Pacific region.

### Is piperacillin-tazobactam effective for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms? [^112wumTy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) for the management of nonbacteremic pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter observational study comparing clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with ESBL-producing pyelonephritis who were receiving TZP versus carbapenems, using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria were met: (1) urine cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis at ≥ 50 000 colony-forming units/mL; (2) identification of an ESBL gene; (3) pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells per high powered field in the urine); and (4) dysuria and fever plus at least 1 of the following symptoms: emesis, rigors, hypotension, or flank pain.

Results

There were 186 patients included in the propensity score-weighted cohort; 45 (24%) received TZP and 141 (76%) received a carbapenem. Of these 186 patients, 27% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 48% were immunocompromised, and 45% had underlying urologic abnormalities. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the proportion of patients (20% vs 25%) with recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis with the same ESBL-producing organism within 30 days (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, .31–1.81; p = 0.52). There were no differences in the resolution of clinical symptoms by Day 7 or in 30-day mortality. There was 1 (2%) patient in the TZP arm and 11 (8%) patients in the carbapenem arm who had incident carbapenem-resistant organisms isolated within 30 days (P = 0.09).

Conclusions

TZP may be a reasonable alternative to carbapenems for the management of ESBL-producing pyelonephritis and may mitigate the risk of emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms, compared with carbapenem therapy.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1155TKup]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1141U6vd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Estimated undertreatment of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in eight low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study [^116Q1v5T]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

We made some adjustments to the total CRGN bacterial infection-related deaths from the GRAM study to ensure that our estimates were as conservative as possible and accurately reflected the deaths of patients from infections that required treatment with an agent with specific activity against CRGN bacterial infections. The first adjustment attempted to account for the fact that, for the selected countries, the literature shows that although resistance remains high, up to 30% of carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa isolates might be sensitive to other antibiotics (eg, fluoroquinolones). Thus, we conservatively removed 40% of the deaths caused by carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa from the total CRGN bacterial infection-related deaths. For the second adjustment, we excluded a proportion of deaths related to complicated urinary tract infections (UTI), primarily to exclude deaths of patients with infections that could be treated with aminoglycoside monotherapy in line with current guidelines; data from the literature suggest that up to 40% of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria in LMICs are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Thus, for this second adjustment, we assumed that of the 40% of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria potentially susceptible to aminoglycosides, 85% could have been successfully treated with aminoglycoside monotherapy, and we removed 35% (ie, 40% of 85%) of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria from further calculations (further details are in the appendix [p 1]).

Next, we estimated an overall case fatality rate for CRGN bacterial infections. We began by pooling available estimates from the literature, to calculate an overall distribution of CRGN bacterial infection types considered the major drivers of mortality according to the GRAM study(ie, bloodstream infections, lower respiratory tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, and UTIs). We multiplied these estimates by literature-based case fatality rates for each of these infection types (table 1) to obtain an overall weighted case fatality rate for CRGN bacterial infections. Due to the low availability of high-quality data in LMICs, estimates for infection distribution and case fatality rates were drawn from data for adults in high-income countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia; these infection-specific case fatality rates were drawn from estimated case fatality rates for treated adults identified as having a CRGN infection (predominantly carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella). We tested variation in the overall case fatality rate with robustness tests.

### Bacterial adhesion strategies and countermeasures in urinary tract infection [^114miavC]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are compounded by antimicrobial resistance, which increases the risk of UTI recurrence and antibiotic treatment failure. This also intensifies the burden of disease upon healthcare systems worldwide, and of morbidity and mortality. Uropathogen adhesion is a critical step in the pathogenic process, as has been mainly shown for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Proteus, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus species. Although many bacterial adhesion molecules from these uropathogens have been described, our understanding of their contributions to UTIs is limited. Here we explore knowledge gaps in the UTI field, as we discuss the broader repertoire of uropathogen adhesins, including their role beyond initial attachment and the counter-responses of the host immune system. Finally, we describe the development of therapeutic approaches that target uropathogenic adhesion strategies and provide potential alternatives to antibiotics.

RECOMMEND (NCT02364284; D4280R00005) assessed treatment patterns and outcomes associated with initial antibiotic therapy (IAT; antibiotics received < 48 h post-initiation of antibiotic therapy) in healthcare-associated infections across five countries.

Methods

Data from medical records of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 18 years with healthcare-associated complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) are presented. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified potential risk factors associated with IAT failure.

Results

Mean (SD) age was 68.7 (17.4) years (n = 408). In patients with microbiological documentation (357/408), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were most common (47.1%, 21.6% and 11.8%, respectively); 46.1% of patients had a multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogen isolated. Most patients received monotherapy IAT (72.5%). Mean IAT duration was 7.8 days. IAT failure, in-hospital mortality, and mortality 30-day post-discharge were 54.4%, 35.0% and 37.3%, respectively. IAT failure was associated with age, Deyo-Charlson comorbidity score, country, MDR status and ICU admission in the univariate analysis; and country and age in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

This study provides real-world insights into the high rates of IAT failure and morbidity observed in patients with cUTI. Further study is imperative to understand the epidemiology of cUTI, support appropriate IAT selection and management, and reduce the burden of this disease.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: a new invasive syndrome [^113BLx4T]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well known human nosocomial pathogen. Most community-acquired K pneumoniae infections cause pneumonia or urinary tract infections. During the past two decades, however, a distinct invasive syndrome that causes liver abscesses has been increasingly reported in Asia, and this syndrome is emerging as a global disease. In this Review, we summarise the clinical presentation and management as well the microbiological aspects of this invasive disease. Diabetes mellitus and two specific capsular types in the bacterium predispose a patient to the development of liver abscesses and the following metastatic complications: bacteraemia, meningitis, endophthalmitis, and necrotising fasciitis. For patients with this invasive syndrome, appropriate antimicrobial treatment combined with percutaneous drainage of liver abscesses increases their chances of survival. Rapid detection of the hypervirulent strain that causes this syndrome allows earlier diagnosis and treatment, thus minimising the occurrence of sequelae and improving clinical outcomes.

### The role of carbapenems in initial therapy for serious Gram-negative infections [^115A2LHM]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with serious Gram-negative infections must be both prompt and correct. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mortality risk is significantly increased when the initial antibiotic regimen does not adequately cover the infecting pathogen. Furthermore, changing to an appropriate regimen once culture results are available does not reduce this risk. Therefore, one must empirically treat serious infections with a regimen that covers likely pathogens. Selecting such a regimen is complicated by the increasing prevalence of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Moreover, multidrug-resistant pathogens, once limited to hospital-acquired infections, are increasingly being detected in community-acquired infections, especially those involving the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts or in immunocompromised patients. Consequently, the initial antibiotic regimen must have a broad spectrum of activity that includes potential resistant pathogens, as indicated by the local antibiogram. Many multidrug-resistant pathogens remain susceptible to carbapenems despite increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance. This article reviews the role played by carbapenems in the initial treatment of serious Gram-negative infections and the potential effect of emerging resistance on this role.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^113SwCtf]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin

Fosfomycin is another old broad-spectrum antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and has in vitro activity against CRE. The oral formulation achieves high concentrations in the urine and is usually effective in the treatment of non-complicated UTIs. The IV formulation (fosfomycin disodium) is not available in the US and other countries, although it has been used successfully in Greece, mostly as an adjuvant drug in combination therapies. For example, a study of 11 critically ill patients with nosocomial infections caused by KPC K. pneumoniae were treated with IV fosfomycin (2 to 4 g every 6 hours) in combination with colistin (n = 6), gentamicin (n = 3), and piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 1). All patients were reported to have good treatment-related microbiological and clinical outcomes, while the all-cause hospital mortality was 18.2% (two patients). The emergence of resistance to fosfomycin during therapy for bacteremia with KPC K. pneumoniae has been reported and is especially concerning since fosfomycin was used as an adjunct in combination therapy in these cases. Recently, parenteral fosfomycin administered in combination with colistin or tigecycline was studied in a prospective observational multicenter trial in 11 ICUs in Europe. In total, 41 patients with bacteremia or ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae were treated with a median dose of 24 g of fosfomycin per day for a total of 14 days. Microbiological cure was reported in 56.5% of cases, with an all-cause 28-day mortality of 43.5% and emergence of resistance in three patients.

### Sulopenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis: a phase 3, randomized trial [^111Uescw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of infections caused by extended–spectrum β–lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacterales has been increasing worldwide in both hospital- and community-acquired settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's analysis of data reported in 2011–2014 to the National Healthcare Safety Network revealed that the proportion of Escherichia coli resistant to extended–spectrum cephalosporins that caused hospital–acquired infections was 13.4% nationally, with rates as high as 24% in some states. That analysis also demonstrated that more than one-third of E. coli isolates in 2014 were resistant to fluoroquinolones. In 2017, ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections occurred in 197 400 hospitalized patients in the United States, causing 9100 deaths; the estimated attributable healthcare costs for those infections that year was $1.2 billion. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are both important causes of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and pyelonephritis. A 2019 report by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network noted that in 2018, more than half of E. coli isolates were resistant to at least 1 of the antimicrobial groups, including the aminopenicillins (57.4%), fluoroquinolones (25.3%), third–generation cephalosporins (15.1%), and aminoglycosides (11.1%). More than 30% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (31.7%) and fluoroquinolones (31.6%). Coresistance rates among E. coli that are resistant to either fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) have exceeded 45%.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Nitrofurantion macrocrystals [^111ZLLwx]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals is specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections when due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain susceptible strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals and other antibacterial drugs, Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^111wiGoG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States (US), primarily affecting women. In the US, half of women experience ≥ 1 UTI by the age of 35 years, and 1 in 3 women experiences ≥ 1 UTI requiring antibiotic treatment in her lifetime, with 11% experiencing ≥ 1 UTI per year. UTI incidence in the US increased by 52% between 1998 and 2011, resulting in 400 000 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of $2.8 billion in 2011. UTIs have also been increasing in outpatient settings and cause substantial negative impact on activity and health-related quality of life.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen causing UTIs. Escherichia coli accounts for up to 80% of uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs), which typically affect otherwise healthy individuals without underlying structural abnormalities or instrumentation, and approximately a quarter of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), which occur in the presence of structural abnormalities or instrumentation compromising the urinary tract. Other gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B Streptococcus can also cause UTIs. Following an initial uUTI, subsequent UTIs are common and may be caused by the same or different pathogens.

Antibiotic treatment for UTI is often empiric without urine culture or susceptibility testing, and is usually based on national guidelines and local resistance profiles. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy. UTIs also have a high recurrence rate, leading to increased use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has been increasing, resulting in increased risk of treatment failure, patient morbidity, healthcare costs, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further exacerbating antibiotic resistance.

Given the continued burden of UTIs, current data on repeated occurrence of UTI are needed. Also, despite global increases in multidrug resistance (MDR), recent data on antibiotic resistance of uropathogens are lacking, especially antibiotic resistance patterns for those patients experiencing UTI recurrences. Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) from a cohort of individuals with uUTI at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), we described the antibiotic resistance of subsequent uUTIs and cUTIs (from 2016–2021) following an initial uUTI (from 2016–2020).

### Aztreonam (Azactam) [^115Q6jXD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AZACTAM (aztreonam for injection, USP) and other antibacterial drugs, AZACTAM should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Impact of mandatory indications for outpatient antibiotic orders on accurate tracking of antibiotic indications [^115Kudcx]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, both antibiotic appropriateness and congruence between ICD10 code and charted diagnoses increased in the post-implementation group compared to the pre-implementation group. This may be explained by the concept of accountable justification where providers are asked to document a justification for each prescription and are therefore more likely to preserve their professional reputation by acting in line with injunctive norms and recommended clinical guidelines. – Although not directly asked to justify the antibiotic choice and indication, by having to choose the associated indication, the provider, is in effect, having to justify that prescription.

Despite the effect of accountable justification, we found a high percent of inappropriate antibiotic choice in both the pre- and post-implementation groups (37% and 32%, respectively). These findings were consistent with previously published literature where 14.4%–49% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were inappropriate.– However, implementation of mandatory indications was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in the post-implementation group. The main reason for inappropriate prescriptions was due to a high degree of failure to follow both national guidelines and local guidance. It is particularly challenging to counter national guidelines when they may not provide the best treatment based on local antibiograms, despite existence of local guidance documents, due to the ready availability of national resources. For example, at our institution, cephalexin has good susceptibility against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, has good bioavailability, and gets adequate penetration into the urine to effectively treat cystitis, making cephalexin a good choice for simple cystitis. However, national guidelines list cephalexin as a less well-studied choice compared to nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or fosfomycin due to lack of data. Notably, UTI guidelines are pending a new update and there has been subsequent literature to support use of cephalexin for uncomplicated UTI. – Dissemination of updated evidence and implementation into practice is often delayed.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam versus doripenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis: RECAPTURE, a phase 3 randomized trial program [^116EwwHC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a substantial cause of global morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. UTIs are considered complicated (cUTI) when associated with acute pyelonephritis, chronic urinary retention in men, or obstruction, urinary catheters, recent urinary instrumentation, or urologic abnormalities. The gram-negative bacteria frequently implicated in cUTI, including various Enterobacteriaceae (particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, often harbor multidrug resistance mechanisms (particularly extended-spectrum β-lactamases [ESBLs]) that limit the effectiveness of antibiotics previously considered first-line treatments. The risks of initial antimicrobial therapy failure, which include increased mortality, are thus driving ever-increasing reliance on carbapenems. The global emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa is undermining the effectiveness of the carbapenems, and highlights the urgent need for new antimicrobial treatments.

Ceftazidime-avibactam combines ceftazidime and avibactam, a first-in-class non–β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor which restores the in vitro activity of ceftazidime against Ambler class A (eg, ESBL and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase), class C (eg, AmpC), and some class D β-lactamase–producing bacteria; it is not active against metallo-β-lactamases. Ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg/500 mg every 8 hours) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on phase 2 data (including a phase 2 cUTI trial [NCT00690378] evaluating efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam 500 mg/125 mg every 8 hours) for the treatment of cUTI, including acute pyelonephritis, and complicated intra-abdominal infections (in combination with metronidazole) in adults with limited/no alternative treatment options. Approval of ceftazidime-avibactam has also been granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) based on additional data from the phase 3 RECAPTURE program, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg/500 mg every 8 hours) in patients with cUTI including acute pyelonephritis.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^1175K86Y]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the 1990s, the emergence and diffusion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) has been a global concern. In 2021, the rate of invasive ESBL-E isolates has reached 7.5% in French healthcare settings. ESBL-E infections treatment is becoming challenging due to high frequency of co-resistance mechanisms to other antibiotics classes, such as fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; therefore, therapeutic options are often very limited. Carbapenems have long been considered to be the reference treatment for infections caused by ESBL-E. Unfortunately, their large prescription constitutes a strong selective pressure, which has led to the emergence and rapid worldwide spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales.

One possible alternative to carbapenems could be cefoxitin, a cephamycin developed in the 1970s, resistant to ESBL hydrolysis and highly active against ESBL-E in vitro. Currently, cefoxitin is the standard treatment for perioperative surgical prophylaxis, and is proposed as second-line antibiotic therapy for acute ESBL- Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) pyelonephritis in adults. Indeed, cefoxitin and other cephamycins have been shown to be effective in several small cases series of mild infections, such as urinary tract infections and bacteremia without signs of severity. In a multicenter retrospective study, Senard et al. showed no significant difference in clinical and microbiological success between cefoxitin and carbapenems as the definitive treatment of ESBL-EC urinary tract infections in men.

ESBL- Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) infections are also common nosocomial infection, but clinical data on their treatment with cefoxitin are scarce. In Guadeloupe University Hospital, the observed incidence rate of nosocomial ESBL-E infections is one of the highest in France, with a large predominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Since 2015, to limit the use of carbapenems, antibiotic guidelines in our intensive care unit (ICU) proposed cefoxitin rather than carbapenems as definitive treatment in cefoxitin-susceptible ESBL-E systemic infections, whenever clinical condition and microbiological findings are compatible. Until now this therapeutic strategy had not been formally evaluated. The aim of our study was thus to compare the clinical efficacy of cefoxitin as definitive antibiotic therapy for ICU patients with ESBL-KP bacteremia, versus standard carbapenem therapy. Selection of cefoxitin- and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales in both groups was also analyzed.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam use for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae infections: a retrospective observational multicenter study [^114enDaW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A growing body of observational evidence supports the value of ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) in managing infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed observational data on use and outcomes of CAZ-AVI therapy for infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify variables independently associated with 30-day mortality. Results were adjusted for propensity score for receipt of CAZ-AVI combination regimens versus CAZ-AVI monotherapy.

Results

The cohort comprised 577 adults with bloodstream infections (n = 391) or nonbacteremic infections involving mainly the urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, and intra-abdominal structures. All received treatment with CAZ-AVI alone (n = 165) or with ≥ 1 other active antimicrobials (n = 412). The all-cause mortality rate 30 days after infection onset was 25% (146/577). There was no significant difference in mortality between patients managed with CAZ-AVI alone and those treated with combination regimens (26.1% vs 25.0%, P = 0.79). In multivariate analysis, mortality was positively associated with presence at infection onset of septic shock (P = 0.002), neutropenia (P < .001), or an INCREMENT score ≥ 8 (P = 0.01); with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (P = 0.04); and with CAZ-AVI dose adjustment for renal function (P = 0.01). Mortality was negatively associated with CAZ-AVI administration by prolonged infusion (P = 0.006). All associations remained significant after propensity score adjustment.

Conclusions

CAZ-AVI is an important option for treating serious KPC-Kp infections, even when used alone. Further study is needed to explore the drug's seemingly more limited efficacy in LRTIs and potential survival benefits of prolonging CAZ-AVI infusions to ≥ 3 hours.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Lomefloxacin hydrochloride (Maxaquin) [^1146q1xc]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment

Maxaquin (lomefloxacin HCl) film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below: (See Dosage and Administration for specific dosing recommendations.)

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT

Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis.

NOTE: MAXAQUIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR THE EMPIRIC TREATMENT OF ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT S PNEUMONIAE IS A CAUSATIVE PATHOGEN. S PNEUMONIAE EXHIBITS IN VITRO RESISTANCE TO LOMEFLOXACIN, AND THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF LOMEFLOXACIN IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS CAUSED BY S PNEUMONIAE HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. IF LOMEFLOXACIN IS TO BE PRESCRIBED FOR GRAM–STAIN–GUIDED EMPIRIC THERAPY OF ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS, IT SHOULD BE USED ONLY IF SPUTUM GRAM STAIN DEMONSTRATES AN ADEQUATE QUALITY OF SPECIMEN (> 25 PMNs/LPF) AND THERE IS BOTH A PREDOMINANCE OF GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS AND NOT A PREDOMINANCE OF GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS.

URINARY TRACT

Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and CLINICAL STUDIES — UNCOMPLICATED CYSTITIS .)

Complicated Urinary Tract Infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter diversus, or Enterobacter cloacae.

NOTE: In clinical trials with patients experiencing complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to P aeruginosa, 12 of 16 patients had the microorganism eradicated from the urine after therapy with lomefloxacin. None of the patients had concomitant bacteremia. Serum levels of lomefloxacin do not reliably exceed the MIC of Pseudomonas isolates. THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF LOMEFLOXACIN IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH PSEUDOMONAS BACTEREMIA HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before antimicrobial treatment in order to isolate and identify microorganisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to lomefloxacin. In patients with UTIs, therapy with Maxaquin film-coated tablets may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once these results become available, appropriate therapy should be continued. In patients with an acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, therapy should not be started empirically with lomefloxacin when there is a probability the causative pathogen is S pneumoniae.

Beta-lactamase production should have no effect on lomefloxacin activity.

### Cefepime hydrochloride (cefepime) [^115HeM6s]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

1.1 Pneumonia

Cefepime for Injection is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia (moderate to severe) caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Enterobacter species.

1.2 Empiric Therapy for Febrile Neutropenic Patients

Cefepime for Injection as monotherapy is indicated for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. In patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia), antimicrobial monotherapy may not be appropriate. Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of cefepime monotherapy in such patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.3 Uncomplicated and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (including pyelonephritis)

Cefepime for Injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis) caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, when the infection is severe, or caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis, when the infection is mild to moderate, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia with these bacteria.

1.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Cefepime for Injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes.

1.5 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (used in combination with metronidazole)

Cefepime for Injection is indicated in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with metronidazole) in adults caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, viridans group streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, or Bacteroides fragilis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.6 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefepime for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefepime for Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Before instituting treatment with Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA

ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophi/us influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains) or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS (complicated and uncomplicated) caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA

UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA (cervical/urethral and rectal) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: (when) might we still consider treating with carbapenems? [^111edga4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) are increasing in frequency worldwide. CPKP isolates exhibit extensive drug resistance phenotypes, complicate therapy, and limit treatment options. Although CPKP isolates are often highly resistant to carbapenems, a proportion of these have relatively low MICs for carbapenems, raising the question of whether this class of agents has any therapeutic potential against CPKP infections. Results from animal studies and patient outcome data indicate that carbapenems retain meaningful in vitro activity against CPKP isolates with carbapenem MICs of ≤ 4 mg/L. Accumulating clinical experience also suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of carbapenems against CPKP isolates with MICs of ≤ 4 mg/L is enhanced when these agents are administered in combination with another active antibiotic. The results of human pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies are in line with the above observations; it is highly probable that a high-dose/prolonged-infusion regimen of a carbapenem would attain a time above the MIC value of 50% for CPKP isolates with MICs up to 4 mg/L, ensuring acceptable drug exposure and favourable treatment outcome. The analyses summarized in this review support the notion that carbapenems have their place in the treatment of CPKP infections and that the currently proposed EUCAST clinical breakpoints could direct physicians in making treatment decisions.

### Sulopenem versus amoxicillin / clavulanate for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^115ZBWec]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Existing antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections are becoming less reliably effective owing to increasing antimicrobial resistance. Our objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sulopenem/probenecid for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial of 5 days of sulopenem versus amoxicillin/clavulanate for women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection. The primary end point was overall success, defined as combined clinical cure and microbiologic eradication by day 12, evaluated in the microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population, which comprised all randomly assigned patients who received any trial medication and had a positive urine culture with 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/ml or more of an Enterobacterales uropathogen (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species).

Results

A total of 2222 patients were enrolled, and the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 35–62 years). Ninety-one (9.2%) patients in the primary population (microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population), the combined population of patients with a positive baseline urine culture and without regard to amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility, had a baseline pathogen resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics. Overall success in the microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population occurred in 318 of 522 (60.9%) participants treated with sulopenem versus 260 of 468 (55.6%) participants treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -0.8 to 11.5), meeting criteria for noninferiority. In the primary population with a baseline uropathogen susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, success occurred in 296 of 480 (61.7%) participants treated with sulopenem versus 243 of 442 (55.0%) participants treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, 6.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 13.0). In the primary population with a baseline uropathogen not susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, success occurred in 22 of 42 (52.4%) patients treated with sulopenem versus 17 of 25 (68.0%) patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, -15.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -37.5 to 9.1]. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred more frequently with sulopenem compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate, including diarrhea (8.1% vs. 4.1%), nausea (4.3% vs. 2.9%), and headache (2.2% vs. 1.5%).

Conclusions

Sulopenem was noninferior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of adult women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but was associated with more frequent mild adverse events. (Funded by Iterum Therapeutics; REASSURE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05584657.).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^112VtasZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

### Aztreonam [^1174jav8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Aztreonam for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, aztreonam for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112xZtgT]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Nitrofurantoin oral suspension [^115Ah4Gv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP is specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections when due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain susceptible strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for

systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^112bLb2m]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections, with an estimated annual incidence of > 150 million cases worldwide. In the United States, UTIs result in approximately 10.5 million office visits as well as 3 million emergency department (ED) encounters and 400 000 hospitalizations annually with an estimated annual cost > $4.8 billion. UTIs primarily affect women, followed by male infants and older men. Based on epidemiologic data from a study in the United States, about 1 in 3 women have at least 1 UTI diagnosed by a clinician that requires antibiotic medication, and the lifetime risk of UTIs among women is > 60%.

Clinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs) can be differentiated into lower (cystitis) and upper (pyelonephritis). uUTIs typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy. Approximately 75% of uUTIs are caused by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and other pathogens. Complicated UTIs are associated with factors compromising the urinary tract or host defense, such as urinary obstruction, immunosuppression, renal failure/transplantation, and indwelling catheterization. In the United States, 70% to 80% of complicated UTIs are attributable to indwelling catheters, accounting for 1 million cases per year.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117RCSCu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Clonal background and routes of plasmid transmission underlie antimicrobial resistance features of bloodstream Klebsiella pneumoniae [^112E5a1A]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The Gram-negative commensal bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae typically inhabits human mucosal surfaces, including the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract. It is also an opportunistic pathogen that is responsible for a wide range of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, which often lead to adverse clinical and health-economic outcomes. The disease presentations of K. pneumoniae include pneumonia, bloodstream infection, meningitis, urinary tract infections, wound or soft tissue infections, and liver abscess. K. pneumoniae can invade normally sterile sites of the body, such as the blood, through localized infectious diseases, surgical procedures, and the presence of catheters and other intravascular medical devices. The entry and proliferation of bacteria in the bloodstream can lead to a strong immune response, including organ failure and dysfunction, that can be fatal if not treated promptly and appropriately. Worldwide, K. pneumoniae is the third leading cause of bloodstream infections.

### Efficacy of ceftazidime-avibactam salvage therapy in patients with infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae [^115dZrhp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) has been approved in Europe for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections, as well as hospital-acquired pneumonia, and for gram-negative infections with limited treatment options. CAZ-AVI displays in vitro activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzyme producers, but clinical trial data on its efficacy in this setting are lacking.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 138 cases of infections caused by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) in adults who received CAZ-AVI in compassionate-use programs in Italy. Case features and outcomes were analyzed, and survival was then specifically explored in the large subcohort whose infections were bacteremic.

Results

The 138 patients started CAZ-AVI salvage therapy after a first-line treatment (median, 7 days) with other antimicrobials. CAZ-AVI was administered with at least 1 other active antibiotic in 109 (78.9%) cases. Thirty days after infection onset, 47 (34.1%) of the 138 patients had died. Thirty-day mortality among the 104 patients with bacteremic KPC-Kp infections was significantly lower than that of a matched cohort whose KPC-Kp bacteremia had been treated with drugs other than CAZ-AVI (36.5% vs 55.8%, P = 0.005). Multivariate analysis of the 208 cases of KPC-Kp bacteremia identified septic shock, neutropenia, Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 3, and recent mechanical ventilation as independent predictors of mortality, whereas receipt of CAZ-AVI was the sole independent predictor of survival.

Conclusions

CAZ-AVI appears to be a promising drug for treatment of severe KPC-Kp infections, especially those involving bacteremia.

### Treatment of KPC-producing enterobacteriaceae: suboptimal efficacy of polymyxins [^116bbQre]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections (KPC-EI) remains a challenge. Combined therapy has been proposed as the best choice, but there are no clear data showing which combination therapy is superior. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial regimens for treating KPC-EI. This was a retrospective cohort study of KPC-EI nosocomial infections (based on CDC criteria) between October 2009 and June 2013 at three tertiary Brazilian hospitals. The primary outcomes were the 30-day mortality for all infections and the 30-day mortality for patients with bacteraemia. Risk factors for mortality were evaluated by comparing clinical variables of survivors and nonsurvivors. In this study, 118 patients were included, of whom 78 had bacteraemia. Catheter-related bloodstream infections were the most frequent (43%), followed by urinary tract infections (n = 27, 23%). Monotherapy was used in 57 patients and combined treatment in 61 patients. The most common therapeutic combination was polymyxin plus carbapenem 20 (33%). Multivariate analysis for all infections (n = 118) and for bacteremic infections (n = 78) revealed that renal failure at the end of treatment, use of polymyxin and older age were prognostic factors for mortality. In conclusion, polymyxins showed suboptimal efficacy and combination therapy was not superior to monotherapy.

### Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice – an observational study [^116gqoyM]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Guideline recommendations on therapy in urinary tract infections are based on antibiotic resistance rates. Due to a lack of surveillance data, little is known about resistance rates in uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in general practice in Germany. In a prospective observational study, urine cultures of all women presenting with urinary tract infections in general practice were analysed. Resistance rates against antibiotics recommended in German guidelines on UTI are presented.

Methods

In a prospective, multi-center observational study general practitioner included all female patients ≥ 18 years with clinically suspected urinary tract infection. Only patients receiving an antibiotic therapy within the last two weeks were excluded.

Results

40 practices recruited 191 female patients (mean age 52 years; range 18–96) with urinary tract infections. Main causative agent was Escherichia coli (79%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (14%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%).

Susceptibiliy of E.coli as the main causative agent was highest against fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, with low resistance rates of 4,5%; 2,2%. In 17,5%, E.coli was resistant to trimethoprim and in 8,5% to ciprofloxacin.

Conclusions

Resistance rates of uropathogens from unselected patients in general practice differ from routinely collected laboratory data. These results can have an impact on antibiotic prescribing and treatment recommendations.

### Secular trends in gram-negative resistance among urinary tract infection hospitalizations in the United States, 2000–2009 [^1165MZUr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common among hospitalized patients. Selection of an appropriate antibiotic for this infection requires knowledge of both its general microbiology and the epidemiology of drug-resistant organisms. We sought to determine secular trends in UTI hospitalizations that involve gram-negative (GN) multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA), extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).

Design

Survey.

Patients

Patients with UTI in US hospitals between 2000 and 2009.

Methods

We first derived the total number of UTI hospitalizations in the United States from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample database years 2000–2009. Based on a literature review, we then determined what proportion of all UTIs arise due to each of the organisms of interest, irrespective of resistance pattern. Finally, we assessed the prevalence of resistance within each pathogen based on the Eurofins Surveillance Network database 2000–2009. Susceptibility patterns served as phenotypic surrogates for resistance.

Results

Between 2000 and 2009, the frequency of UTI hospitalizations increased by approximately 50%, from 53 to 77 cases per 1,000 hospitalizations. Infections due to all GN bacteria followed a similar trajectory, whereas those caused by resistant GN pathogens increased by approximately 50% (MDR-PA) to approximately 300% (ESBL). CRE emerged and reached 0.5 cases per 1,000 hospitalizations in this 10-year period.

Conclusions

The epidemiology and microbiology of GN UTI hospitalizations has shifted over the past decade. The proportion of all hospitalizations involving this infection has climbed. Resistant GN bacteria are becoming more prevalent and are implicated in an increasing proportion of UTIs among hospitalized patients.

### A genomic surveillance framework and genotyping tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae and its related species complex [^114ikvdE]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria commonly colonize the mammalian gut, but are also recognized as a major public health threat due to their ability to cause severe infections in healthcare settings and their association with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Reports of K. pneumoniae gut colonization frequencies vary by country and demographics; prevalence rates as low as 4% and as high as 87% have been reported –. K. pneumoniae colonization is implicated in chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract including inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. There is also a growing body of evidence highlighting colonization as a reservoir for extraintestinal infections (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, wound or surgical site infections, sepsis) in vulnerable individuals such as neonates, the elderly, immunocompromized and hospitalized patients. Treatment of healthcare-associated (HA) K. pneumoniae infections is often limited by multidrug resistance (MDR) resulting from the accumulation of horizontally acquired AMR genes and mutations in core genes. Treatment is further complicated by increasing frequencies of strains producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and/or carbapenemases, prompting increased reliance on colistin and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. The World Health Organization has accordingly prioritized K. pneumoniae as a target for new drugs and therapies.

Outside healthcare settings, K. pneumoniae is also recognized as a causative agent of community-acquired infections including urinary tract infection and pneumonia, but also invasive infections such as pyogenic liver abscess, endophthalmitis and meningitis. Invasive community-acquired infections are generally associated with so-called hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) and are most commonly reported in East and Southeast Asia, or in individuals with East Asian ancestry. Features associated with hvKp include a K1, K2 or K5 polysaccharide capsule and horizontally acquired virulence factors encoding the siderophores aerobactin (Iuc) and salmochelin (Iro), the genotoxin colibactin (Clb), and a hypermucoid phenotype (conferred by the rmpADC locus) –. HvKp are rarely MDR and most strains remain susceptible to drugs except ampicillin, to which K. pneumoniae are intrinsically resistant due to the chromosomally encoded β-lactamase SHV. However, there have been increasing reports of hvKp carrying AMR plasmids and co-occurrence of AMR and virulence determinants in non-hvKp isolates. The convergence of AMR and virulence in K. pneumoniae potentiates invasive and difficult-to-treat infections, and at least one fatal outbreak has been documented in China where carbapenemase-producing hvKp are increasingly common –.

### Trimethoprim [^116cCYUa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of trimethoprim tablets, USP and other antibacterial drugs, trimethoprim tablets, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

For the treatment of initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, including S. saprophyticus.

Cultures and susceptibility tests should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria to trimethoprim. Therapy may be initiated prior to obtaining the results of these tests.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116AYxK5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In neonates and infants < 2 months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. group B streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical IV ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal UTI by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered with maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancyor maternal ESBL-E cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates, although if unable to access these, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

Antibiotic Duration and Timing of IV to Oral Switch

For most children with cUTI, there is not enough evidence to support varying from current practice and expert opinion recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D).
When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D).
Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal USS is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B).
For frequently relapsing UTI with the same organism, investigations should assess for an ongoing focal source of infection (GRADE D).
Shorter total durations (6–9 days) and a single dose IV component show early promise, but prospective studies are needed with more children with complicated UTI (GRADES C and D).

Question 3.6 — infections outside of the urinary tract caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) with OXA-48-like production: Suggested approach: Ceftazidime-avibactam is the preferred treatment option for OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales infections. Cefiderocol is an alternative treatment option. If OXA-48-like enzymes are produced by an Enterobacterales clinical isolate, ceftazidime-avibactam is preferred and cefiderocol is an alternative option, and more than 95% of OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales isolates are susceptible to both agents. Meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam have limited activity against OXA-48-like producing isolates because vaborbactam and relebactam are unlikely to inhibit OXA-48-like enzymes and are not suggested, even if susceptible in vitro. Clinical trial data comparing ceftazidime-avibactam vs cefiderocol are not available, and an observational study including 171 patients with OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales infections treated with ceftazidime-avibactam identified 30-day mortality in 22%.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Development of a urinary-specific antibiogram for gram-negative isolates: impact of patient risk factors on susceptibility [^112qhcUu]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional antibiograms guide clinicians in selecting appropriate empiric antimicrobials, but they lack data on syndrome/disease-specific susceptibility, isolate location, polymicrobial infections, and patient risk factors. The aim of this study was to develop a urinary-specific antibiogram and to evaluate the impact of risk factors on antimicrobial susceptibility.

Methods

This retrospective descriptive study used culture and susceptibility data from January 1 to December 31, 2012. A urinary antibiogram specific for Escherichia coli (EC), Proteus mirabilis (PM), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was developed. Urinary and standard antibiogram susceptibilities were compared. Urinary isolates were then stratified by risk factors-residence before admission, age, systemic antimicrobial use for ≤ 30 days, hospitalization for ≤ 30 days, and hospital unit-to determine the impact on antimicrobial susceptibility.

Results

There were 2,284 urinary isolate encounters. Overall antimicrobial susceptibility was increased, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly greater (KP, 14% vs 7% [P = 0.001]; EC, 13% vs 9% [P < .001]; PM, 18% vs 10% [P = 0.004]) in the urinary antibiogram vs the standard antibiogram. Health care facility residence had the greatest impact on susceptibility for all urinary isolates, especially on fluoroquinolone susceptibility for EC and PM.

Conclusions

Using a syndromic antibiogram and incorporating patient risk factors into susceptibility data may be more useful in guiding clinicians in selecting more appropriate empiric therapy.

Question 3.3 — CRE infections outside the urinary tract that are not carbapenemase producing: For isolates that exhibit susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem (ie, MICs ≤ 1 μg/mL) but are not susceptible to ertapenem (ie, MICs ≥ 1 μg/mL), the use of extended-infusion meropenem (or imipenem-cilastatin) is suggested; if such isolates do not exhibit susceptibility to any carbapenem, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are preferred treatment options. The rationale notes that less than 3% of the 1249 isolates resistant to ertapenem but susceptible to meropenem and imipenem contained a carbapenemase gene, and that standard-infusion meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin may be reasonable for uncomplicated cUTIs. For isolates susceptible to meropenem but not imipenem (and vice versa), the panel suggests basing treatment on severity of illness and site of infection. The panel suggests against the use of meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam to treat ertapenem-resistant, meropenem-susceptible and imipenem-susceptible infections, and suggests against the use of extended-infusion carbapenems with or without a second agent when susceptibility to meropenem or imipenem has not been demonstrated. Tigecycline or eravacycline are alternative options for CRE infections not involving the bloodstream or urinary tract.

### About Klebsiella… [^113vKokq]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Klebsiellais a type of bacteria normally found in human stool that can cause healthcare-associated infections. Klebsiellacan cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis.
- Some Klebsiellabacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Overview Klebsiella is a type of gram-negative bacteria normally found in human stool that can cause HAIs. Klebsiella are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including carbapenems. Signs and symptoms Klebsiella can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. Who is at risk In healthcare settings, Klebsiella infections commonly occur among sick patients receiving treatment for other conditions.

Patients with devices like ventilators or intravenous catheters, and patients taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for Klebsiella infections. Healthy people usually do not get Klebsiella infections. How it spreads
- Person-to-person contact.
- Contact with contaminated water or soil.
- Contact with contaminated equipment or intravenous catheters).
- Wounds caused by injury or surgery. Klebsiella does not spread through the air. Prevention Patients Patients should clean their hands often, including:

- Before preparing or eating food.
- Before touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
- Before and after changing wound dressings or bandages.
- After using the restroom.
- After blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
- After touching hospital surfaces such as bed rails, bedside tables, doorknobs, remote controls or the phone.

Healthcare providers Healthcare staff should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Testing and diagnosis To determine if someone has a Klebsiella infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory. Testing can also determine what treatment will work best. Treatment and recovery Klebsiella infections are generally treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, some Klebsiella bacteria are resistant to multiple antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae in healthcare settings… [^114MAVrC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Klebsiella bacteria are normally found in the human intestines. They are also found in human stool. In healthcare settings, Klebsiella infections commonly occur among sick patients who are receiving treatment for other conditions. Patients whose care requires devices like ventilators or intravenous catheters, and patients who are taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for Klebsiella infections. Healthy people usually do not get Klebsiella infections. Drug-resistant Klebsiella Some Klebsiella bacteria have become highly resistant to antibiotics. When bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae produce an enzyme known as a carbapenemase, then the class of antibiotics called carbapenems will not work to kill the bacteria and treat the infection.

Klebsiella species are examples of Enterobacterales, a normal part of the human gut bacteria, that can become carbapenem-resistant. CRE, which stands for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, are an order of germs that are difficult to treat because they have high levels of resistance to antibiotics. Unfortunately, carbapenem antibiotics often are the last line of defense against Gram-negative infections that are resistant to other antibiotics. Treating Klebsiella infections Klebsiella infections that are not drug-resistant can be treated with antibiotics. Infections caused by KPC-producing bacteria can be difficult to treat because fewer antibiotics are effective against them. In such cases, a microbiology laboratory must run tests to determine which antibiotics will treat the infection. What should patients do if they think they have a Klebsiella–related illness. See a healthcare provider.

What should patients do if they have been diagnosed with a Klebsiella–related illness. They must follow the treatment regimen prescribed by the healthcare provider. If the healthcare provider prescribes an antibiotic, patients must take it exactly as the healthcare provider instructs. Patients must complete the prescribed course of medication, even if symptoms are gone. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and the patient may become re-infected. Patients must wash their hands as often as possible and follow all other hygiene recommendations.

### Notes from the field: clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate… [^1114EHCs]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate cultured from the urinary tract in a man aged 65 years. The specimen was collected on December 17, 2018. It tested positive for carbapenemase activity by the modified carbapenem inactivation method and positive for genes encoding the carbapenemases New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase, Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase, and OXA-48–type beta-lactamase, by polymerase chain reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by broth microdilution showed resistance to 15 antibiotics tested but low minimum inhibitory concentrations to colistin and tigecycline. CDC recommends a public health response when organisms with emerging forms of antibiotic resistance, such as the metallo-beta-lactamases this isolate harbored, are identified † because such organisms are often difficult to treat and have the potential to spread rapidly in health care settings.

Since September 2017, the patient had been treated at a local outpatient urology clinic in King County, Washington, for lower urinary tract symptoms that included urinary retention and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Procedures at facility A before identification of CR-Kp included cystoscopy, urinary catheter placement, and computed tomography scan of the urinary tract. On November 1, 2018, he underwent outpatient urodynamic studies at a hospital in Punjab, India, where urinary and rectal catheters were placed for cystometric and pressure flow studies; he did not undergo cystoscopy and was not hospitalized. Lower urinary tract symptoms persisted, and upon the patient's return to the United States, a urinalysis at facility A on December 17 revealed an elevated white blood cell count and presence of leukocyte esterase, which led to the urine culture that identified CR-Kp.

The patient's chronic symptoms and signs remained unchanged, and he was not treated at the time of CR-Kp identification per standard guidelines. Urinary and rectal specimens to screen for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were collected on February 18, 2019; both specimens were negative by polymerase chain reaction and culture.

### Piperacillin / tazobactam versus carbapenems in non-bacteremic UTI due to-ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae (CAPITIS) [^111tdCp2]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Piperacillin/Tazobactam Versus Carbapenems in Non-bacteremic UTI Due to -ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study evaluates the efficacy in achieving clinical cure in non-bacteremic urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae producers of extended-spectrum β-lactamases in adult patients. Half of participants will receive Piperacillin/Tazobactam as treatment, while the other half will receive Carbapenems. Currently the appropriate treatment of UTI is a growing concern in the medical community because Gram-negative, specifically Enterobacteriaceae, bacteria have acquired genes encoding antibiotic resistance mechanisms. The β-lactamase spread spectrum are documented with increasing frequency among microorganisms causing UTI. Current treatment options for ESBL bacteria include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides.

The investigators will compare between piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems the effectiveness in achieving clinical cure for non-bacteremic UTI caused by ESBL microorganisms. Researchers principal hypothesis is that Piperacillin/tazobactam is not inferior to carbapenems in achieving clinical cure in the targeted treatment of UTI caused by non-bacteremic due to E. coli or K. pneumoniae ESBL in adults requiring hospitalization. Researchers will verify too if Piperacillin/Tazobactam is not associated with increased risk of adverse events during the targeted treatment of non-bacteremic ITU caused by E. coli or K. pneumoniae ESBL in adults requiring hospital admission, compared with Carbapenems therapy.

To perform the protocol researchers follows the recommendations for the design of trials investigating treatment options for resistant bacteria multidrug of the United States Agency for Food and Drug Administration.
- **Diagnosis of UTI confirmed by**: 1) fever, 2) urine culture > 100000 CFU with isolation E. coli or K. pneumoniae ESBL susceptible to piperacillin / tazobactam and carbapenems, and 3) lumbar and / or abdominal pain with or without low urinary symptoms, and 4) no other cause that explains the patient's symptoms.
