## Question

Can severe tricuspid regurgitation resolve?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether severe tricuspid regurgitation can resolve on its own or with medical therapy, and in what situations it might improve or persist. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causes of tricuspid regurgitation and how primary and secondary mechanisms differ. Then, I should verify the historical belief that functional TR resolves after treating the left-sided lesion and whether contemporary evidence refutes that. Next, I will examine exceptions where TR does improve, including traumatic TR and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. After that, I need to assess the natural history of chronic severe TR and the pathophysiology that makes spontaneous resolution unlikely. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and the role of interventions, and synthesize a clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the etiologic framework, because the likelihood of resolution hinges on mechanism. Severe tricuspid regurgitation is either primary, due to intrinsic leaflet or chordal pathology, or secondary (functional), due to right-sided volume/pressure overload, tricuspid annular dilation, and right ventricular remodeling; functional TR accounts for the vast majority of severe cases, and its persistence is driven by structural changes in the annulus and RV rather than a transient hemodynamic perturbation [^115dE2xc] [^1147bhwZ] [^113GrU88].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the outdated teaching. The traditional view was that functional TR would resolve once the upstream left-sided lesion was corrected, but multiple contemporary sources refute this, noting that TR frequently persists or progresses despite successful treatment of mitral disease, reflecting irreversible annular dilation, leaflet tethering, and RV remodeling that perpetuate regurgitation even after afterload reduction [^115MQ7BW] [^114wCEZG] [^111EJAKK] [^1147bhwZ].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are exceptions where TR actually improves without tricuspid surgery. Yes, there are notable scenarios: traumatic TR with chordal rupture can regress with conservative management in selected hemodynamically stable patients, as illustrated by a case report of spontaneous improvement after blunt chest trauma. And severe functional TR may improve after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy when pulmonary pressures fall dramatically, with about 70% experiencing resolution in one series, though this reflects correction of a causal upstream pulmonary vascular disease rather than spontaneous reversal of chronic annular/RV remodeling [^113WkyEb] [^1146CSRD].

> I need to check the natural history of chronic severe TR to ensure I'm not overstating reversibility. Chronic severe TR is typically progressive and self-perpetuating: annular dilation and RV enlargement worsen TR, which in turn drives further RV failure and adverse remodeling; progression is common even when initial severity is only moderate, and increasing TR severity correlates with higher mortality, underscoring that late presentation often means irreversible right-heart changes that are unlikely to resolve spontaneously [^116TjCYX] [^112XF8Z3] [^111U7xBi].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology more carefully, because it explains why medical therapy alone rarely reverses severe TR. Functional TR arises from tricuspid annular dilation, leaflet tethering, and RV dysfunction; once these structural changes are established, simply treating pulmonary hypertension or left-sided disease medically does not reliably normalize annular geometry or restore coaptation, so TR persists unless the valve apparatus itself is mechanically corrected, which is why guidelines emphasize concomitant tricuspid intervention at the time of left-sided surgery when TR is significant or annular dilation is marked [^115dE2xc] [^114m8g3Z] [^1128rkfn].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my conclusions align with standards. ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS guidelines recommend addressing significant TR at the time of left-sided valve surgery and support isolated tricuspid surgery for symptomatic severe primary or selected secondary TR, reflecting recognition that TR does not reliably improve with treatment of the primary left-sided lesion alone; they also endorse transcatheter options for inoperable or high-risk patients, acknowledging that medical therapy is supportive but not disease-modifying for severe TR [^1128rkfn] [^115pR8mb] [^112o9nGE].

> I should double-check the role of medical therapy, because patients often ask if diuretics and afterload reduction can "fix" severe TR. Medical management can palliate congestion and optimize hemodynamics, and in secondary TR it is appropriate to treat pulmonary hypertension, left-sided disease, and atrial fibrillation, but diuretics and disease-directed therapies do not reverse established annular dilation or RV remodeling; thus, while symptoms may improve, the severe TR itself typically persists without procedural correction [^114DJysK] [^115LVq5E] [^114Wwzzj].

> But wait, what if the TR is "massive" or "torrential" — does that change expectations? The newer severity strata recognize that more extreme TR carries worse prognosis, and even with transcatheter therapies, outcomes correlate with the degree of TR reduction achieved; importantly, randomized data for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and valve replacement show improvements in symptoms and quality of life and substantial TR reduction, reinforcing that meaningful resolution generally requires mechanical intervention rather than spontaneous or medical reversal [^115LPfrK] [^117WmeJs] [^114r6a2N].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Severe tricuspid regurgitation does not typically resolve spontaneously or with medical therapy alone once structural annular and RV remodeling have occurred; exceptions include select traumatic TR cases and scenarios where a causal upstream pulmonary vascular disease is definitively corrected, but these are not the norm for chronic severe functional TR. Persistent or progressive TR is common after left-sided valve surgery if the tricuspid valve is not addressed, and contemporary guidelines accordingly recommend concomitant tricuspid repair or replacement when TR is severe or when annular dilation and risk factors for progression are present, with transcatheter options for high surgical risk patients [^1128rkfn] [^114m8g3Z] [^112o9nGE].

> Finally, I should confirm practical implications for follow-up and referral. Given the progressive nature of TR and the limitations of medical therapy, patients with severe TR should have periodic echocardiographic surveillance and early referral to a Heart Valve Team to assess candidacy for intervention before irreversible RV failure or end-organ damage occurs. This proactive approach helps avoid the late-stage, high-risk presentations that have historically limited surgical benefit [^115QYKzJ] [^111d6tQj] [^1161enLW].

Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) **does not typically resolve spontaneously** [^115MQ7BW]. Spontaneous resolution is rare and usually limited to specific, reversible causes such as acute pulmonary embolism or transient right ventricular (RV) dysfunction [^notfound]. Most cases of severe TR are **functional and progressive**, driven by RV dilation, annular enlargement, and pulmonary hypertension; without definitive treatment, they persist or worsen over time [^1147bhwZ]. Medical therapy alone does not correct severe TR, though it may temporarily reduce symptoms [^114Wwzzj]. Definitive improvement requires surgical or transcatheter intervention, with outcomes dependent on RV function and timing [^112iJ69z] [^114GsYSv].

---

## Pathophysiology and natural history

Severe TR is broadly classified as **primary**, due to intrinsic valve pathology (e.g. prolapse, endocarditis), or **secondary (functional)**, due to RV dilation, annular enlargement, and pulmonary hypertension [^113C3ysg] [^113GrU88]. Functional TR is the most common form and is typically progressive, with a self-perpetuating cycle of RV volume overload, annular dilation, and worsening regurgitation [^1147bhwZ].

---

## Factors influencing spontaneous resolution

Spontaneous resolution of severe TR is rare and generally occurs only when the underlying cause is **reversible**. Key factors include:

- **Reversible RV dysfunction**: Acute RV dysfunction due to transient ischemia, myocarditis, or acute pulmonary embolism may improve with treatment, leading to TR reduction [^1122BjGg].

- **Correction of underlying causes**: Improvement in pulmonary hypertension, left-sided heart failure, or atrial fibrillation may reduce TR severity [^111QVuTY].

- **Acute TR due to transient factors**: Traumatic TR or transient ischemia may resolve spontaneously in select cases [^113WkyEb].

---

## Clinical evidence on spontaneous resolution

Clinical studies consistently show that severe TR **rarely resolves spontaneously**. A notable exception is a study of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, in which severe functional TR improved in 70% of patients after pulmonary pressure reduction, though this reflects intervention rather than true spontaneous resolution [^1146CSRD]. Most data indicate that without definitive treatment, severe TR persists or progresses, leading to chronic RV failure and increased mortality [^112XF8Z3].

---

## Medical management and its limitations

Medical therapy (diuretics, afterload reduction, heart failure management) can alleviate symptoms but **does not correct the underlying valve pathology or annular dilation** [^114DJysK]. Thus, medical therapy alone is insufficient for definitive resolution of severe TR [^114Wwzzj].

---

## Surgical and transcatheter interventions

Definitive improvement in severe TR typically requires **intervention**:

- **Surgical repair or replacement**: Annuloplasty or valve replacement can significantly reduce TR severity and improve symptoms, particularly when performed before advanced RV dysfunction occurs [^112iJ69z] [^112rPGKq].

- **Transcatheter therapies**: Edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) and transcatheter valve replacement (TTVR) have emerged as effective minimally invasive options, especially for high-risk patients [^117WmeJs] [^114r6a2N].

- **Outcomes**: Success depends on RV function, pulmonary pressures, and timing of intervention. Early intervention before irreversible RV remodeling yields better results [^112iJ69z].

---

## Prognostic implications of persistent severe TR

Persistent severe TR is associated with **increased mortality**, more heart failure hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life [^112XF8Z3]. RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension further worsen prognosis, underscoring the importance of timely intervention [^111U7xBi].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Factor** | **Evidence on spontaneous resolution** |
|-|-|
| Functional TR | Rarely resolves spontaneously; progressive without intervention [^115dE2xc] |
| Primary TR | Does not resolve spontaneously; requires surgical correction [^1128rkfn] |
| Medical therapy | Symptom relief only; no definitive resolution [^114Wwzzj] |
| Surgical intervention | Effective definitive treatment; timing critical [^114GsYSv] |
| Transcatheter therapy | Effective minimally invasive option for high-risk patients [^114r6a2N] |

### Mechanism and implications of the tricuspid regurgitation: from the pathophysiology to the current and future therapeutic options [^113Ng5gg]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

The tricuspid valve was virtually ignored for a long time in the past. However, significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) often accompanies left-side heart valve pathology and does not always reverse with its correction. If left untreated, TR can progress and result in progressive right ventricular failure. Current guideline recommendations still hold minor differences. Nevertheless, there is a consensus to operate on patients with severe TR undergoing left-sided valve surgery (class I) or those with mild to moderate TR with a dilated annulus (≥ 40 or ≥ 21 mm 2, Class IIa). However, in case of the primary TR, surgical options is limited by a relatively high risk of mortality and morbidity. For these patients, new percutaneous approaches are becoming available but no long-term data are still available. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects of TR, and the current and future directions of therapy.

Heart failure management after tricuspid intervention: Continuation of a multipronged heart failure (HF) treatment regimen is required postintervention, with attention to determining effective decongestion and maintaining euvolemia with diuretics following hospital discharge. Determining euvolemia may be challenging; both relief of dyspnea and attaining preadmission body weight are poor markers, and patients with severe TR and right-sided HF may not display typical left-sided congestion findings on examination. Although noninvasive parameters have been used as surrogates for increased filling pressures, including RA pressure > 7 mm Hg or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 18 mm Hg, their value in detecting the optimal euvolemic point without residual hemodynamic congestion is unclear. Overemphasis on serial biomarker levels as volume surrogates might prompt inappropriate loop diuretic dose escalation without significant residual congestion and increase risks such as hypotension and renal dysfunction. With these limitations, a combination of clinical, bedside appraisal, and biomarker/imaging assessment is reasonable when assessing adequate diuresis, and postintervention considerations include maintenance or addition of spironolactone as a K+ (potassium ion)–sparing diuretic and to counter secondary hyperaldosteronism related to residual hepatic congestion.

### Transcatheter valve replacement in severe tricuspid regurgitation [^114r6a2N]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study TRISCEND II was published by Rebecca T Hahn and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Tricuspid regurgitation. In the TRISCEND II study, the trial question was: what is the role of transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation? In the TRISCEND II study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TRISCEND II study, the population was: 392 patients (296 female, 96 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation. The key exclusion criteria were tricuspid valve anatomic contraindications; need for emergent or urgent surgery or any planned cardiac surgery within next 12 months; hemodynamic instability; refractory HF requiring advanced intervention. In the TRISCEND II study, the interventions were: n = 259 valve replacement (transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement and medical therapy) n = 133 medical therapy (medical therapy alone). In the TRISCEND II study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in a hierarchical composite of death, implantation of RV assist device or heart transplantation, postindex tricuspid valve intervention, hospitalization for HF, improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary of ≥ 10 points, improvement in NYHA functional class of ≥ 1 point, improvement of at least 30 minutes on the 6 minutes walk distance at 1 year (62.1% vs. 30.7%; WR 2.02, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.62). In the TRISCEND II study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in tricuspid regurgitation reduction to ≤ moderate at 6 months (98.8% vs. 21.6%; AD 77.1%, 95% CI 31.35 to 122.85). In the TRISCEND II study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death from any cause, death from cardiovascular cause. significant differences in severe bleeding at 1 year (15.4% vs. 5.3%), arrhythmia and conduction disorder resulting in permanent pacing (17.8% vs. 2.3%). In the TRISCEND II study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation, valve replacement was superior to medical therapy with respect to a hierarchical composite of death, implantation of RV assist device or heart transplantation, postindex tricuspid valve intervention, hospitalization for HF, improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary of ≥ 10 points, improvement in NYHA functional class of ≥ 1 point, improvement of at least 30 minutes on the 6 minutes walk distance at 1 year.

### Comparative early outcomes of tricuspid valve repair versus replacement for secondary tricuspid regurgitation [^113XBAFP]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Key questions

Secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the predominant cause of severe TR in North America. Despite the deleterious effect of severe TR on long-term outcomes, contemporary data on tricuspid valve (TV) surgery remain limited. This is likely multifactorial due to modest annual volume of TV surgery, under-recognition of TV disease, delayed clinical presentation, high prevalence of comorbidities in these patients, and lack of consensus on the approach and timing of TV surgery. Once the patient is referred for TV surgery for severe TR, the decision to repair or replace the valve is also complex and depends on the patient's age and comorbidities, the degree of right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, the need for a concomitant procedure, and surgical expertise. Comparative outcome data on tricuspid valve repair (TVr) versus tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) for secondary TR are limited. A recent meta-analysis by Choi et al suggested more favourable outcomes with TVr, but this was confounded with the inclusion of patients with primary TR and concomitant operations. The purpose of this study is to assess in-hospital morbidity and mortality, length of stay and cost in patients with severe secondary TR undergoing isolated TVr versus TVR using a contemporary national representative database.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112rPGKq]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation surgery — outcomes and timing: In patients with symptomatic severe primary tricuspid regurgitation (TR), tricuspid valve surgery can alleviate systemic venous and hepatic congestion and decrease reliance on diuretics. In atrial fibrillation (AF)-related TR, there is rapid progression of TR severity with right-sided chamber dilation, and in appropriately selected symptomatic patients with AF-related severe TR, quality of life and symptoms can be improved by surgical intervention for TR; overall outcomes are better in those without severe right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or end-organ damage. With newer surgical techniques and better selection, an acceptable operative mortality rate (< 4% to 5%) for isolated TR in selected patients is reported. The optimal timing of tricuspid valve surgery for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic severe primary TR has not been established, and in otherwise healthy patients without other comorbidities such as trauma-related severe TR, the surgical risk is low (< 1% to 2% operative mortality).

### Diagnosis and treatment of tricuspid valve disease: current and future perspectives [^115dE2xc]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The assessment and management of tricuspid valve disease have evolved substantially during the past several years. Whereas tricuspid stenosis is uncommon, tricuspid regurgitation is frequently encountered and is most often secondary in nature and caused by annular dilatation and leaflet tethering from adverse right ventricular remodelling in response to any of several disease processes. Non-invasive assessment of tricuspid regurgitation must define its cause and severity; advanced three-dimensional echocardiography, MRI, and CT are gaining in clinical application. The indications for tricuspid valve surgery to treat tricuspid regurgitation are related to the cause of the disorder, the context in which it is encountered, its severity, and its effects on right ventricular function. Most operations for tricuspid regurgitation are done at the time of left-sided heart valve surgery. The threshold for restrictive ring annuloplasty repair of secondary tricuspid regurgitation at the time of left-sided valve surgery has decreased over time with recognition of the risk of progressive tricuspid regurgitation and right heart failure in patients with moderate or lesser degrees of tricuspid regurgitation and tricuspid annular dilatation, as well as with appreciation of the high risks of reoperative surgery for severe tricuspid regurgitation late after left-sided valve surgery. However, many patients with unoperated severe tricuspid regurgitation are also deemed at very high or prohibitive surgical risk. Novel transcatheter therapies have begun to emerge for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation in such patients. Experience with such therapies is preliminary and further studies are needed to determine their role in the management of this disorder.

### Effect of tricuspid valve repair or replacement on survival in patients with isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation [^114GsYSv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Controversies remain in the management strategy for isolated tricuspid regurgitation (TR) because of adverse prognosis and uncertainties regarding the benefits of tricuspid valve surgery. We compared the characteristics and outcomes of a large cohort of patients with isolated TR, based on downstream tricuspid valve surgery versus medical management. Consecutive patients with isolated TR graded at least moderate-to-severe by echocardiography identified between January 2004 and December 2018 (n = 9,031, age 70 ± 15 years, 60% women) were retrospectively studied. The primary end point was time to all-cause mortality during follow-up. Outcomes were compared by management strategy using unadjusted and adjusted survival and multivariable regression analyses. Tricuspid valve surgery was performed in 632 of 9,031 of the cohort (7%), including 514 valve repairs and 118 valve replacements, with in-hospital mortality in 19 patients (2.9%). Overall, there were 3,985 all-cause deaths (44%) over mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 3.3 years. Tricuspid valve surgery was independently associated with lower mortality rate during follow-up, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.64), and the association persisted in both primary and secondary TR subgroups. Tricuspid valve surgery also had a significantly higher rate of infective endocarditis and heart failure hospitalizations rates during follow-up, at HRs of 5.55 (95% CI 4.00 to 7.71) and 1.29 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.43), respectively. In conclusion, tricuspid valve surgery is rarely performed in isolated TR, but it is independently associated with greater survival for the overall cohort and both primary and secondary etiology subgroups. Increasing the utilization of this surgery at specialized centers is encouraged to try to improve the clinical outcomes for this challenging clinical entity.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^115KK98i]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation — integrative evaluation emphasizes using multiple parameters rather than a single measurement, beginning by assessing whether a majority of specific signs point toward either mild or severe regurgitation; if most signs and indices are concordant, there is confidence in the interpretation and no further quantitation is needed, whereas if signs or values fall in the intermediate range between mild and severe, most likely the severity is moderate. Further subclassing tricuspid regurgitation severity into four grades by quantitative criteria has not been validated in the literature; echocardiographers with experience may quantitate RVols and EROA to refine intermediate lesions, and when transthoracic echocardiography is difficult with significant internal inconsistency or discordant clinical findings, further evaluation by other modalities may be warranted to more accurately assess the mechanism and severity.

### Tricuspid regurgitation management for heart Failure [^1131Zv7c]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

There is growing evidence that severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) impacts clinical outcomes in a variety of cardiovascular disease states. The late presentation of patients with advanced TR highlights the underappreciation of the disease, as well as the pitfalls of current guideline-directed medical management. Given the high in-hospital mortality associated with isolated tricuspid valve surgery, transcatheter options continue to be explored with the hope of improved survival and reduced heart failure hospitalizations. In this review, we explore the physiology of TR, discuss the etiologic classes of TR, and explore the transcatheter options for treatment and who might benefit from device therapy.

### Tricuspid valve academic research consortium definitions for tricuspid regurgitation and trial endpoints [^114oSGqR]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Highlights

There is an independent relationship between increasing TR and worse outcomes, but gaps exist in understanding of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
Refinement of classification categories, novel methods for assessing and grading TR, and better selection of outcome measures should inform the design of clinical trials.
This document provides recommendations for classification of disease etiology, standardized definitions and methods to assess disease severity, and trial endpoints.
Transcatheter alternatives to surgical intervention are under investigation; yet, more work is needed to define patient selection criteria, goals of therapy, and clinical outcomes.

Interest in the pathophysiology, etiology, management, and outcomes of patients with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has grown significantly over the last 10 years given the natural history studies showing a high disease prevalenceand poor outcomes associated with increasing TR severity, even after adjusting for comorbidities. However, a number of gaps in our understanding of the disease as well as the rapid expansion of transcatheter solutions for structural heart disease have increased the need for further research and trials. Indications for isolated tricuspid valve (TV) surgery have poor penetration into clinical practice, which may be related to reported high in-hospital mortality rates, partly associated with late clinical diagnosis. Transcatheter alternatives to surgical intervention are being investigated; yet, appropriate patient selection, goals of therapy, and clinically meaningful outcomes are unknown.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation — key points include that physiologic mild tricuspid regurgitation is common in normal individuals; in patients with more than mild tricuspid regurgitation, identifying the mechanism is important, and the precise mechanism should be specified and reported; no single Doppler or echocardiographic parameter is precise enough to quantify severity, so integration of multiple parameters is required and concordant parameters allow high‑probability grading; there is less experience with PISA or volumetric flow than with MR and AR; severe, wide‑open tricuspid regurgitation may have low velocity without aliasing or turbulence and may be difficult to see as a distinct color Doppler jet; chronic severe tricuspid regurgitation almost always leads to dilated right atrium and right ventricle, with normal chamber volumes unusual; CMR assessment is less established; and additional testing with TEE or CMR is indicated when TTE does not define a mechanism for significant tricuspid regurgitation, parameters are discordant or inconclusive regarding severity, or there is discrepancy with the clinical setting.

Regarding surgical interventions for tricuspid regurgitation, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, symptomatic patients, EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider performing surgery in patients (symptomatic or having RV dilatation) with severe secondary TR (with or without previous left-sided surgery), in the absence of severe RV or LV dysfunction and severe pulmonary vascular disease/hypertension.

### Basis for intervention on functional tricuspid regurgitation [^114wCEZG]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Functional tricuspid regurgitation is a complex valvular lesion. Its optimal management remains controversial in the current era as the result of uncertainties regarding accurate diagnosis, surgical indication, the appropriate surgical procedure, and the late results of surgical treatment. It is no longer regarded a benign problem and does not resolve spontaneously after correction of left-sided heart valve lesions as once believed. It carries a significant morbidity and has an adverse impact on survival. Current techniques to repair functional tricuspid regurgitation are associated with a significant degree of residual or recurrent regurgitation mainly because of failure to address all the components of this challenging entity. This review article highlights emerging concepts and advances that provide an insight into the understanding of this perplexing lesion and attempts to define the basis of intervention on functional tricuspid regurgitation.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114g5iA6]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease — stage B medical therapy emphasizes that in early valvular heart disease (VHD) there are currently no therapies to prevent disease progression in the valve leaflets, so recommendations are directed toward patient monitoring with the intent to intervene once severe disease is present with symptoms or abnormal cardiovascular function. The document highlights inclusion gaps, noting that women and minorities often are underrepresented in clinical trials and calls for directed efforts to include all patient groups with numbers adequate to perform separate data analysis. It notes that, given the relatively low risk of intervention and improved options, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intervention for severe asymptomatic VHD are important and in progress for some conditions, such as severe aortic stenosis (AS), and that clinical equipoise exists for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) with normal LV function and a high likelihood of valve repair, and the role of intervention for tricuspid regurgitation (TR); long-term follow-up is needed to ensure the lifetime risks of a prosthetic valve or valve repair are balanced against any benefits attributable to earlier intervention.

### Should we repair moderate tricuspid regurgitation? An expert opinion [^117UMgeN]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Lack of consensus on the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has limited operative management for decades. However, emerging evidence indicates that intervening on moderate tricuspid regurgitation during concomitant cardiac surgery can be beneficial with appropriate patient selection. Furthermore, advances in transcatheter therapies have changed the landscape of managing tricuspid disease.

### Tricuspid regurgitation in mitral valve disease incidence, prognostic implications, mechanism, and management [^1114k2Wm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with mitral valve (MV) disease is associated with poor outcome and predicts poor survival, heart failure, and reduced functional capacity. It is common if left untreated after MV replacement mainly in rheumatic patients, but it is also common in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation. It is less common, however, in those with degenerative mitral regurgitation. It might appear many years after surgery and might not resolve after correcting the MV lesion. Late TR might be caused by prosthetic valve dysfunction, left heart disease, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and dilation, persistent pulmonary hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, or by organic (mainly rheumatic) tricuspid valve disease. Most commonly, late TR is functional and isolated, secondary to tricuspid annular dilation. Outcome of isolated tricuspid valve surgery is poor, because RV dysfunction has already occurred at that point in many patients. MV surgery or balloon valvotomy should be performed before RV dysfunction, severe TR, or advanced heart failure has occurred. Tricuspid annuloplasty with a ring should be performed at the initial MV surgery, and the tricuspid annulus diameter (≥ 3.5 cm) is the best criterion for performing the annuloplasty. In this article we will review the current data available for understanding the prognostic implications, mechanism, and management of TR in patients with MV disease.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112iJ69z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Surgery for isolated tricuspid regurgitation (TR) — the optimal timing of referral is undefined and surgery has commonly been performed when patients present with right-sided heart failure (HF), deteriorating right ventricular (RV) function, or worsening hepatic or renal function. Per the 2020 ACC/AHA guideline, isolated tricuspid valve (TV) surgery can be beneficial to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations in patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe A-STR who are poorly responsive to medical therapy, and TV surgery can be considered for select patients after prior cardiac surgery who have progressive right-sided HF poorly responsive to medical therapy; the increased risks with reoperative surgery require careful multidisciplinary team (MDT) assessment and shared decision making, and surgery is not usually offered with severe PA hypertension or advanced RV dysfunction. Reduction of TR severity can improve hepatic congestion and reduce diuretic requirements, and TV surgery for primary TR is best performed before advanced ventricular dysfunction or severe pulmonary hypertension (PH); with successful surgery for primary TR, right atrial (RA) pressure drops and congestion generally resolves as RV function improves. Reported outcomes for isolated TR include early mortality rates of 8%-10%, smaller series with postoperative mortality of 3.2% to 5.1%, and a national database analysis of 13,587 patients reporting early mortality of 5.6% (6%-7% for patients without infective endocarditis as the indication for surgery).

Right ventricular (RV) failure — general therapeutic considerations with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) emphasize supportive care and candidacy limits: "Aside from therapy of the underlying disease, there is no known specific treatment for RV failure". "Volume management and decongestion with diuretics are standard". Moreover, "Any therapies that improve LV function and promote reverse remodeling (eg, GDMT, cardiac resynchronization therapy) will likely improve RV function and thus potentially reduce TR". However, "Advanced degrees of nonremediable RV dysfunction are generally considered a contraindication to surgical or transcatheter intervention".

A sizeable proportion of patients requiring surgery for pathologies of the left heart manifest moderate-to-severe regurgitation of the tricuspid valve (TR) that is functional in nature. Functional TR occurs in the absence of organic tricuspid leaflet pathology and is caused by a variable combination of right atrial and tricuspid annular dilatation, right ventricular (RV) remodeling, and subvalvular tethering. These maladaptive changes disrupt the geometric alignment of the tricuspid apparatus and disallow it from achieving a sufficient amount of leaflet coaptation necessary to maintain valvular competency. Regardless of its contributing causes, the hemodynamic consequence of TR is characterized by volume overload of the RV and a vicious cycle of further dilatation and TR that can lead to chronic RV failure and death.

The relevance of functional TR has been a topic of great debate, with initial reports suggesting that it was an innocuous byproduct that resolved after surgical correction of the primary left-sided heart pathology — most commonly mitral regurgitation or stenosis. Later reports employing more sensitive echocardiographic techniques to quantify TR argued that moderate-to-severe TR was, quite contrarily, associated with a heightened risk of mortality and morbidity if left untreated at the time of mitral valve surgery. Concerned about the risk of latent mortality and progressive TR requiring reoperation, North American and European guidelines have since recommended a more liberal approach to performing concomitant tricuspid valve surgery when TR is severe, or even when it is mild or moderate and deemed to have a high likelihood of progression (for example, when there is RV dysfunction or tricuspid annular dilatation).

To date, the clinical practice of performing concomitant tricuspid valve repair for mild or moderate degrees of functional TR remains lower than would be expected based on these guidelines. The hesitancy stems from lingering doubts about the true prognostic impact of non-severe functional TR, with the evidence being particularly thin outside of the mitral valve literature. Indeed, recent data largely have supported concomitant tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral surgery. However, there is lack of data to help clinicians differentiate cases of non-severe TR that will evolve favorably or unfavorably after left heart surgery. Thus, we sought to address these knowledge gaps by determining the prognostic impact of functional TR in a large contemporary cohort of patients undergoing diverse cardiac surgeries, examining the effect-modifying role of patient characteristics in identifying groups of patients in whom TR confers a greater risk of adverse outcomes. This is important particularly with advances in transcatheter therapies for the tricuspid valve.

Introduction

The tricuspid valve (TV) was long known as the 'forgotten valve', because tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was considered resolved by left disease surgery. However, various researchers found that left heart valve treatment did not correct tricuspid annular dilatation or improve right ventricular (RV) function. Follow-up studies also observed TR persistence or progression in patients who had not undergone TV surgery and even in those who had. For instance, Shiran and Sagie found that only 33% of severe/moderate TR cases became mild after mitral valvuloplasty.

TR is frequent in patients with concomitant heart disease, especially valve disease. The prevalence of TR is 15% overall and higher in patients with left disease, and it is the most frequent complication of mitral disease. In cases of heart failure (HF), TR grade > 2/4 has been reported in 35% overall, in 30% of those with severe mitral regurgitation, and in 50% of those treated with mitral valve surgery.

The surgical technique of choice remains under debate, although valve repair is the most common approach, especially rigid ring annuloplasty, with reports that 15% of the patients have residual TR in comparison to 20%–35% of those undergoing other procedures. Additional techniques applied in cases of marked valve deformity or ventricular remodelling include anterior leaflet extension, neochordae implantation, decalcification or commissuroplasty. Prosthetic replacement is a last resort.

The presence of residual TR and its grade are independent predictors of mortality, which is more likely with higher severity. The persistence of TR grade 3–4/4 after mitral valve replacement is associated with worse functional class and with higher mortality rates for HF and all causes.

The frequency of residual TR after tricuspid surgery ranges between 10% and 30%according to the baseline characteristics of patients and the surgical approach, among other factors. In one follow-up study, only 32% of patients had no residual TR at 3 months postsurgery and only 22% at 5 months, while TR grade 3/4 was recorded at the same time points in 11% and 17% of patients, respectively.TR grade 3/4 was observed in 12% of patients after rigid ring annuloplasty, 16% after flexible prosthesis implantation, 24% after De Vega annuloplasty, 44% after periguard annuloplasty, and 19% after Kay's annuloplasty.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114m8g3Z]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) supportive considerations — perioperative risk, procedure choice, and progression factors: Severe TR of either a primary or secondary etiology may not improve predictably after treatment of the left-sided valve lesion and reduction of RV afterload; as such, severe TR should be addressed as part of the index procedure. Reoperation for severe, isolated TR after left-sided valve surgery is associated with a perioperative mortality rate of 10% to 25%. Tricuspid valve repair does not add appreciably to the risks of surgery and is preferable to replacement, but replacement may be necessary if there is marked dilation of the annulus or intrinsic disease of the tricuspid leaflets. Left uncorrected at the time of left-sided valve surgery, mild or moderate secondary TR may progress in approximately 25% of patients; risk factors for persistence or progression include tricuspid annulus dilation (> 40 mm diameter or 21 mm/m^2 diameter indexed to body surface area on preoperative TTE measured at end diastole; > 70 mm diameter on direct intraoperative measurement of the intercommissural distance).

Tricuspid regurgitation — medical therapy states that in patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided heart failure (HF) attributable to severe TR (Stages C and D), diuretics can be useful. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF attributable to severe secondary TR (Stages C and D), therapies to treat the primary cause of HF (for example, pulmonary vasodilators to reduce elevated pulmonary artery pressures, GDMT for HF with reduced LVEF, or rhythm control of AF) can be useful.

Table 1
Summary of Parameters for Grading Tricuspid Regurgitation by Echocardiography. Both Massive and Torrential Grades Have Clear Prognostic Importance With Increased Mortality; Notably These Grades Are Relatively Newer Designations and Only Have Well‐Defined Semiquantitative and Quantitative Parameters

Overall, the approach to diagnosis of severe TR is based on a comprehensive assessment of regurgitant jet area with vena contracta and presence of hepatic vein reverse flow. The umbrella grade of "severe" TR is specified into the following subgroups: severe, massive, and torrential (Table 1). At the most extreme end, torrential TR has the lowest 10‐year survival rate and overall worse prognosis compared with both severe and massive grades and similarly with massive versus severe. Given the prognostic implications it is important to specify the subgroup of severe TR, which may guide consideration and timing of intervention. If data from TTE are in question, a direct measurement of pressures may be required via right heart catheterization. The 2020 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular disease provides a class IIa recommendation for invasive hemodynamic testing with right heart catheterization. This is particularly important in cases when physical examination and TTE findings of estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are discordant or inadequate. Data from right heart catheterization can help resolve uncertainty in such cases.

Cardiac

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) has high spatial resolution allowing delineation of complex tissue structures. This strength is particularly relevant for umbrella grades of "severe" TR, which commonly have complex RV structure and function that make quantitative assessment challenging. An advantage of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the reference stroke volume can be reliably calculated, which can be used for TR quantification. With the addition of late gadolinium enhancement, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can further quantify RV impairment and fibrotic remodeling. Calculated stroke volumes and quantified myocardial impairment have been proposed to have prognostic implications in TR; however, more validation is needed to improve cardiac magnetic resonance imaging use in clinical practice. Crisp anatomic images of the TV and RV in any plane making it a useful and relevant tool for interventional planning.

Consequences of progressive tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction — The development of right-sided heart failure (HF) and progressive TR is associated with increased mortality, more HF hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life, and most patients with severe TR have left-sided heart disease. Over time, with TV annular dilatation and worsening TR, the right ventricle dilates further and ultimately fails, leading to increased RV diastolic pressure. In advanced, severe TR with RV failure, the interventricular septum shifts toward the left ventricle, leading to decreased LV cavity size and restricted LV filling, further increasing the already elevated LV diastolic and pulmonary artery pressures, likely exacerbating RV-PA uncoupling. The resulting elevated left atrial and right atrial pressures can lead to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, irreversible RV failure, and death, and earlier medical and procedural management of TR is essential to avoid deleterious downstream effects, such as cardiorenal and cardiohepatic syndromes, which can exclude candidacy for advanced therapies.

Transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI) options for severe symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation (TR) include transcatheter valve repair with transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), transcatheter valve replacement (orthotopic), transcatheter annuloplasty, and heterotopic caval valve implantation, with distinct pros and cons. For TEER, pros include "Applies to wide range of anatomies" and "Minimal prosthetic material = lower risk of device thrombosis", while cons include "Requires excellent leaflet imaging resolution", "Steep learning curve", and "Modest TR reduction". For orthotopic transcatheter valve replacement, pros include "Most effective at reducing TR" and "Can treat CIED-TR and wide range of pathology", whereas cons include "Available device sizes limits the ability to treat very dilated annuli", "Risk of hemodynamic compromise in patients with severe RV dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension", and "Risk of leaflet thrombosis". For transcatheter annuloplasty, pros include "Directly treats annular enlargement, may be favorable for A-STR" with cons of "Long procedural time", "High screen fail rate", and "Cannot use for leaflet pathology". For heterotopic caval valve implantation, pros include "May be best suited to treat extreme annular dilatation, unfavorable anatomy for orthotopic device delivery, and/or severe RV dysfunction" and "Implantation is more simple and requires less demanding imaging compared to other modalities", with cons of "Reduces regurgitant flow but may have less positive effect on forward stroke volume compared to other modalities" and "Heightened risk of stent thrombosis".

### Uncertainties and challenges in surgical and transcatheter tricuspid valve therapy: a state-of-the-art expert review [^113QUPRS]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a frequent and complex problem, commonly combined with left-sided heart disease, such as mitral regurgitation. Significant TR is associated with increased mortality if left untreated or recurrent after therapy. Tricuspid regurgitation was historically often disregarded and remained undertreated. Surgery is currently the only Class I Guideline recommended therapy for TR, in the form of annuloplasty, leaflet repair, or valve replacement. As growing experience of transcatheter therapy in structural heart disease, many dedicated transcatheter tricuspid repair or replacement devices, which mimic well-established surgical techniques, are currently under development. Nevertheless, many aspects of TR are little understood, including the disease process, surgical or interventional risk stratification, and predictors of successful therapy. The optimal treatment timing and the choice of proper surgical or interventional technique for significant TR remain to be elucidated. In this context, we aim to highlight the current evidence, underline major controversial issues in this field and present a future roadmap for TR therapy.

### Anatomic relationship of the complex tricuspid valve, right ventricle, and pulmonary vasculature: a review [^114tVxzz]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Severe functional or secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with poor long-term outcomes in natural history studies as well as specific disease states. An understanding of the physiologic causes of the TR is lacking precluding a systematic approach to treatment.

Observations

The complex anatomic relationship between the tricuspid valve apparatus and structure of the right side of the heart lends insight into the functional changes seen with secondary TR. The association of these changes with changes in pulmonary vascular hemodynamics can lead to a cascade of events that result in disease progression.

Conclusions and Relevance

Appreciating the role of pulmonary vascular hemodynamics on right ventricular and tricuspid valve morphology and function improves our understanding of the pathophysiology of secondary TR. The limitations of current therapeutic approaches for secondary TR have stimulated interest in improving outcomes with this morbid disease. Changes in timing or approach to intervention require a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology.

### Survival outcomes in isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation according to therapeutic modalities: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Gmocf]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of published studies reporting mortality rates associated with isolated TR, regardless of its aetiology. Patients were categorised according to management, including medical, percutaneous or surgical approaches. Studies reporting mortality of isolated TR at 1-year follow-up, with TR severity classified as moderate-to-severe or worse, were included. Exclusion criteria were: (1) TR associated with left-heart disease, notably aortic or mitral valvular disease or congenital heart disease; (2) combined valvular procedures for the percutaneous and surgical groups, defined as associated concomitant management of the mitral and/or aortic valve and (3) studies without mortality data.

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, searches were conducted in the PubMed and Medline databases using the terms "severe tricuspid regurgitation". Publications were initially screened based on their titles, followed by abstract screening if the title was deemed relevant. Full manuscripts of relevant abstracts were retrieved for inclusion. Studies published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2023 were considered eligible. This timeline was chosen to ensure that only relatively recent research was included, thereby minimising the potential for heterogeneity in medical therapies and clinical practices that might arise from older studies. Two trained physicians (GS and JM) independently conducted the screening, with results subsequently consolidated. Any discrepancies were resolved through collegial discussion. To avoid duplicates, when multiple studies originated from the same database, either trial or registry, only the most relevant manuscript with the largest number of patients or reporting the primary endpoint was included.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomography (CT) considerations for TR quantification are specified, including CMR severity categories by regurgitant fraction (RF) and risk-associated thresholds, and limitations of CT. TR RF categories are "mild (RF ≤ 15%), moderate (RF 16%-49%), and severe (RF > 48%)", and natural history data show "CMR-derived RVol ≥ 45 mL/beat and RF ≥ 50% associate with the highest risk of 1-year mortality", a cutoff "concordant with echocardiographic RVol cutoffs for severe TR based on PISA of 45 mL/beat". Three-dimensional phase-contrast CMR "has the ability to directly measure TV inflow for calculation of RVol (TV inflow stroke volume [SV] - aortic or pulmonic outflow SV = TV RVol)". CT is "currently of limited value in the quantification of TR severity and should not be used for this purpose as part of routine clinical care", and "CT-based flow models are being developed but are not currently available for routine use".

### Residual tricuspid regurgitation after tricuspid valve interventions: what do we know? [^115uMsVE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although no survival differences after 1 or 2 years have been observed for patients with mild versus moderate residual TR, the amount of TR reduction which is usually more pronounced after TTVR compared to TEER is associated with the degree of symptomatic outcome, QoL improvement, and more pronounced RVRR. Balancing the benefits and risks, the goal of any TTVI should be to achieve the maximum possible TR reduction.

### Functional tricuspid regurgitation in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation: an evidence-based narrative review [^111ccwxr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic mitral regurgitation leads to a series of downstream pathologic changes, including pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dilation, tricuspid leaflet tethering, and tricuspid annular dilation, which can result in functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR). The five-year survival rate for patients with severe FTR is reported to be as low as 34%. While FTR was often left uncorrected during left-heart valvular surgery, under the assumption that correction of the left-sided lesion would reverse the right-heart changes that cause FTR, recent data largely have supported concomitant tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral surgery. In this review, the authors discuss the potentially irreversible nature of the changes leading to FTR, the likelihood of progression of FTR after mitral surgery, and the evidence for and against concomitant tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral valve intervention. Lastly, this narrative review also examines advances in transcatheter therapies for the tricuspid valve and the evidence behind concomitant transcatheter tricuspid repair at the time of transcatheter mitral repair.

### Implications of tricuspid regurgitation severity in patients undergoing mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair [^111ndweL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Transcatheter edge‐to‐edge repair (TEER) for mitral regurgitation (MR) has become widespread, exceeding a cumulative volume of 200 000 cases globally. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is commonly observed in subjects referred to the procedure and, when substantial or not improved following it, may signify a less favorable outcome. The exact TR threshold, both pre‐ and postprocedure, and trends that are associated with adverse events in a modern‐day, real‐world mitral TEER setting, as well as the former's burden and correlates, and whether all these apply to all MR causes and TEER devices, are not well established. This is because previous, relatively small‐scale studies (n = 102–766) either have encompassed heterogenous or unbalanced MR populations, some of which were exposed to concomitant non‐TEER interventions, were centered on predominately early‐generation delivery systems, analyzed TR grade and change as dichotomous variables, disregarded moderate‐to‐severe and above‐severe TR as separate entities, or used limited multivariable models. In view of currently available percutaneous treatment options for TR, resolving such uncertainties may carry practical implications. Hence, we examined the characteristics and postprocedural trajectory of a large, contemporary cohort of patients undergoing mitral TEER as a function of the full spectrum of baseline TR extent. Also, we evaluated the evolution in TR severity following the procedure and assessed its impact on the interventional aftermath as well.

### Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement [^111V1iFD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) has emerged as a promising intervention for the treatment of severe tricuspid regurgitation with complex valve morphology. This consensus document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of orthotopic TTVR, focusing on patient selection, procedural details, and follow-up care. Clinical outcomes from initial studies and compassionate use cases are discussed, highlighting the effectiveness of TTVR in reducing tricuspid regurgitation, inducing reverse right ventricular remodeling, and enhancing patients' quality of life. This review paper also addresses potential complications and challenges associated with TTVR, such as new-onset conduction disturbances, bleeding complications, and afterload mismatch, and provides expert recommendations for the periprocedural management, anticoagulation strategies, and long-term follow-up. With the commercial approval of the first TTVR system in the United States and Europe, it intends to serve as a reference for clinicians and researchers involved in the evolving field of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions.

Tricuspid regurgitation — timing of intervention includes the following recommendations: In patients with severe TR (Stages C and D) undergoing left-sided valve surgery, tricuspid valve surgery is recommended. In patients with progressive TR (Stage B) undergoing left-sided valve surgery, tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial in the context of either tricuspid annular dilation with tricuspid annulus end diastolic diameter > 4.0 cm or prior signs and symptoms of right-sided HF. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe primary TR (Stage D), isolated tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe isolated secondary TR attributable to annular dilation (in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or left-sided disease) who are poorly responsive to medical therapy (Stage D), isolated tricuspid valve surgery can be beneficial to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations. In asymptomatic patients with severe primary TR (Stage C) and progressive RV dilation or systolic dysfunction, isolated tricuspid valve surgery may be considered. In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe TR (Stage D) who have undergone previous left-sided valve surgery, reoperation with isolated tricuspid valve surgery may be considered in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension or severe RV systolic dysfunction.

### Tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair versus medical management for tricuspid regurgitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115AkjPL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with poor prognosis, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) alone has limited efficacy. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) has emerged as a promising therapeutic option, but its impact on clinical outcomes remains debated.

Aims

Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of T-TEER compared to GDMT.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central were searched for clinical trials and observational studies through February 2025, for studies comparing the clinical outcomes of T-TEER to GDMT. The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization (HFH), cardiovascular mortality, residual TR, NYHA class improvement, stroke and new permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) or hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. Subgroup analysis was done based on study design.

Results

Seven studies with 4220 patients were included. T-TEER was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64–0.98; p = 0.03) and HFH (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53–0.91; p < 0.01) compared to GDMT. No difference was observed in cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.37–2.52) or stroke (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.32–3.56). T-TEER significantly improved TR severity (RR: 9.12; 95% CI:4.43–18.77; p < 0.001) and reduction in NYHA functional class (RR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.15–4.88; p = 0.019), without increasing the risk of new PPM implantation (RR: 1.83; 95% CI: 0.80–4.21; p = 0.153).

Conclusion

T-TEER is associated with improved survival, a lower risk of HFH, higher reduction in NYHA class and effective TR severity reduction without significantly increasing the risk of stroke or the need for PPM implantation. Further studies would be needed to identify optimal patient subgroup based on disease severity and clinical phenotype.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) synopsis — treatment targets and evolving practice: Treatment of secondary TR is targeted at pulmonary hypertension or myocardial disease. Intervention for isolated severe TR has had a high reported operative mortality rate (up to 8% to 20%), but most of these interventions were performed after end-organ damage. There is renewed interest in earlier surgery for patients with severe isolated TR before the onset of severe RV dysfunction or end-organ damage, attributable to more patients presenting with right-sided HF from isolated TR, more advanced surgical techniques, and better selection processes, resulting in lower operative risk with documented improvement in symptoms. There is growing interest in the development of catheter-based therapies for these patients with severe isolated TR.

### Survival outcomes in isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation according to therapeutic modalities: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1119U1JF]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this review, whose strengths lie in its contemporary nature and substantial sample size notably in the percutaneous group, underscore several key points: (1) In patients with severe isolated TR, long-term mortality is high regardless of therapeutic option; (2) While selection bias (such as right ventricular dysfunction or heart failure) could not be accounted for, invasive management, through either percutaneous or surgical interventions, does not seem to be associated with lower mortality rates compared with medical management after meta-regression and (3) Surgery could be associated with the lowest long-term mortality, although in younger, fitter and selected patients.

Indications for intervention in severe TR

Invasive management of isolated TR is an unsolved challenge. Online supplemental table 4 provides a summary of changes in European and North American guidelines for TR management over time. In the 2006 AHA/ACC (American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology) guidelines, surgery was not recommended for asymptomatic patients, while surgical intervention was considered reasonable for symptomatic patients. The 2007 ESC (European Society of Cardiology) guidelinesmarked the first acknowledgement that surgical therapy may be considered for asymptomatic patients with right ventricle dilatation or dysfunction (IIbC), although specific thresholds were not provided. The 2014 ACC/AHA guidelinesproposed therapy for asymptomatic patients with progressively worsening degrees of right ventricular dilation and/or systolic dysfunction. In 2021, transcatheter therapy was mentioned in the ESC guidelinesfor patients deemed inoperable (IIbC). Interestingly, the 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines did not include a recommendation for transcatheter therapy in severe TR.

Medical treatment group

The medical management group reports major mortality rates of 14% at 1 year and 46% at 5 years. The substantial proportion of patients receiving medical treatment for severe TR in most cohortslikely stems from several factors. Chief among these is the limited level of evidence supporting intervention and the considerable risk associated with surgery, which remains the gold-standard treatment to date.

Indications for surgery

Perspectives of the problem

There are various problems in solving the equation of the treatment of secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation. First is the definition of the indications for surgery; second, the choice between repair and replacement of the tricuspid valve; and third, the effectiveness of different methods of repair and/or the type of prosthesis to be used in case of replacement.

With respect to indications, the decision is difficult because there is no reliable method of judging the degree of reversibility after correction of the problems on the left-side valves, the quantification of the TR is difficult as there are no reproducible methods to measure it, and, finally, there are no satisfactory methods of assessment of RV function. On the other hand, if there is no argument about the need to intervene on severe TR, the question of what to do with lesser degrees of TR remains unanswered. Finally, how to predict which patients will return after successful surgery of the mitral valve with persistent symptomatic TR?

As discussed above, one good reason for intervening on the tricuspid valve during left heart valve surgery is that secondary TR accompanied by marked dilatation of the annulus can produce an irreversible deterioration of RV function, and it is well known that RV dysfunction affects the postoperative prognosis negatively. In addition, the surgical risk is also increased in cases where there is a significant degree of clinical and haemodynamic deterioration.

It is also evident that the quality of 'repair' of the left-side valvulopathy plays a key role in the evolution of the disease. Any incomplete or unsatisfactory result is usually associated with persistence of TR. But even with a perfect and complete repair of the left heart disease, in many cases progression of the TR can occur and surgery for isolated TR may be necessary. A much referred work by Dreyfus et al appeared to demonstrate that tricuspid valves with a dilated annulus, even without or with minimal regurgitation, often evolved to more severe degrees of regurgitation. The authors measured, intraoperatively, the larger diameter of the tricuspid valve between the commissures bordering the anterior leaflet and found values above 70 mm to be predictive of negative outcome. These values correspond to the 40 mm measured by echocardiography. In practice, the latter is more relevant as the decision to intervene on the tricuspid valve must be made before the patient goes on the operating table.

### Epiphenomenon or prognostically relevant interventional target? A novel proportionality framework for severe tricuspid regurgitation [^1147bhwZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Long‐standing tricuspid regurgitation (TR) translates into poor survival, and mortality increases with rising stages of TR severity. However, TR has long been a forgotten valve disease of benign reputation, leading to the consequence that > 90% of patients with clinically relevant TR are not offered any treatment beyond conservative management. Functional TR, which accounts for > 80% of cases, was traditionally believed to improve upon resolution of the underlying cause, such as severe aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation, but a growing body of evidence demonstrates that TR persists in a substantial number of cases, for example, after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The once triggered and later self‐sustaining vicious circle of volume overload and increased wall stress of the right ventricle, detrimental remodeling including tricuspid annulus dilatation and papillary muscle displacement, and further worsening of TR, could be interrupted by transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI).

In the absence of randomized controlled trials, 2 propensity score–matched analyses comparing TTVI with standard medical treatment in inoperable or surgical high‐risk patients with severe TR provide the best level of evidence to date that TTVI is associated with better survival rates. However, a 1‐size‐fits‐all approach is not necessarily applicable to heterogeneous patient populations as encountered in patients with severe TR, and it may even place some patients at risk for futile or even harmful interventions. A stratification system that considers the heterogeneity in etiology, cardiac status, and comorbidities is therefore necessary to properly evaluate the expected benefit of TTVI.

Akin to the conceptual framework by Grayburn et al, who distinguish proportionate and disproportionate functional mitral regurgitation to explain distinct outcomes following interventions directed at the mitral valve, Fortuni et alproposed to adapt this concept to conservatively managed patients with moderate or severe TR by relating the extent of valvular insufficiency to the degree of tricuspid annulus dilatation. However, it should be debated which pathology best serves to distinguish proportionate from disproportionate TR. The prognostic significance of pulmonary hypertension (PH) for survival after TTVI is well established. To place severity of TR into the context of potentially elevated pulmonary artery pressures therefore provides at least 3 advantages:
It relates TR severity to a pathology that is causally upstream of the interventional target.
PH is unlikely to resolve upon restoration of tricuspid valve integrity.
Persistent extra‐tricuspid valve cardiac damage such as PH represents an important determinant of prognosis following TTVI.

### Surgical management of tricuspid regurgitation: a new algorithm to minimise recurrent tricuspid regurgitation [^113hP1my]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Inadequate evidence is available on TV surgical indications and the relevant preoperative factors, leading to discrepant recommendations and a variability in protocols among centres and even among surgeons in the same centre. Moreover, repair techniques other than annuloplasty are much less widely applied in TV than in mitral valve surgery and are more complex, besides the lesser experience accrued in centres. A consensus has generally been reached on the management of severe TR but not on the approach to lower grades of TR, for which divergent recommendations have even been published.

American guidelinesprescribe surgery when TR is severe and in the presence of certain other factors, including symptoms, left surgery, right HF and RV dilatation or progressive dysfunction. They do not expressly refer to lower TR grades except for 'progressive TR with annulus dilatation or history of HF and concomitant left surgery', based on evidence level IIA and with no definition of progressive TR. The same surgical indications for severe TR are included in European guidelines; however, they also make recommendations for moderate TR with concomitant left surgery and for mild or moderate TR with annulus dilatation and concomitant left surgery. Hence, unlike American guidelines, they support surgery for annulus dilatation even in patients with mild TR grades.

Following clinical practice guidelines (symptoms, progressive dilatation or RV dysfunction), all patients with severe or moderate-to-severe TR underwent TV intervention. For those with a lesser degree of TR, an exhaustive bibliographic searchwas carried out, selecting variables referred to in the literature associated with the persistence of TR after surgery and its magnitude. In this way, preoperative clinical and echocardiographic variables were selected for the decision to intervene or not intervene on the TV in patients with mild or moderate TR (table 1).

When there were anatomical factors (table 1) that hindered or could predict valve repair failure with simple annuloplasty, an extended repair was chosen as the technique of first choice.

When valve distortion or RV remodelling was so marked that even advanced repair was inadequate, prosthesis implantation was the last surgical technique of choice. Regarding selection of the type of prosthesis, 72% of the implanted prostheses were biological. Only five mechanical prostheses were implanted, by decision of the patients after receiving detailed information on their advantages and disadvantages.

### Evaluation of tricuspid valve percutaneous repair system… [^111bAd3x]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of Tricuspid Valve Percutaneous Repair System in the Treatment of Severe Secondary Tricuspid Disorders ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Tricuspid regurgitation is a long-overdue valvular pathology. Its prevalence is significant and increasing with the aging of the population. It is often a consequence of chronic left cardiac pathologies or atrial fibrillation. Surgical treatment is recommended in severe symptomatic TR or when the tricuspid annulus is dilated with TR identified prior to scheduled left heart valve surgery. TR are mainly secondary and pose a difficult problem related to the prognosis. The risk of death or hospitalization is high under medical treatment. Nevertheless, the surgical results are disappointing with significant morbidity and mortality, which are increased by associated comorbidities that are frequent in these sorts of patients.

The benefit-risk assessment of surgery is limited by multiple confounders. This justifies the evaluation of alternative methods aimed at correcting TR with less interventional risk. The Clip for the tricuspid valve has been evaluated in the TRILUMINATE trial. The Triclip system appears to be safe and effective at reducing tricuspid regurgitation by at least one grade. This reduction could translate to significant clinical improvement at 6 months post-procedure. It justified the European Conformity mark obtention. A very similar system for the mitral valve was previously tested in the randomized EVEREST II study against conventional surgery. The results of the EVEREST II trial justified the recourse to percutaneous edge-to edge mitral repair in patients with primary mitral regurgitation when the patient is contraindicated to conventional surgery.

For secondary TR, several series underscored its prevalence and its clinical consequences. TR treatment justifies the proposal for a randomized study. As a matter of fact, evidence for treating are seriously lacking. Surgical surveys report hospital mortality ~ 8. 8%. It, therefore, seems necessary to conduct a study as robust as possible to evaluate the contribution of clip for the tricuspid valve compared to conventional pharmacological treatment in patients who are unsuitable for a surgical isolated correction of the TR and who has suitable anatomy for clip for the tricuspid valve.

### Long-term clinical outcomes in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation [^111CXTqq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common echocardiographic finding, and it is encountered in 70% to 90% of the general population. TR has been believed to be a benign disease as it is often asymptomatic and can be managed conservatively with treatments such as diuretic therapy. However, it can sometimes cause right‐sided heart failure and require surgical or catheter intervention. Recent studies demonstrated that increased TR severity was associated with higher mortality. Although surgical mortality can be adversely affected by delayed surgical intervention, the optimal timing of intervention for TR remains controversial. A recent study also reported that the prognosis of surgically treated moderate or greater TR did not differ significantly from that treated using medical therapy. Thus, the natural history and risk factors associated with poor outcomes in isolated severe TR remain understudied. Therefore, we aimed to determine the long‐term clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with isolated severe TR to determine the optimal timing for intervention.

### Management of tricuspid regurgitation – what's next? [^113tEuGr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation is a highly prevalent condition, particularly in the aging population, and has gained significant attention over the past decade with the advent of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions. This renewed interest has led to significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of TR, including the introduction of a new classification, advancements in imaging and TR quantification with the refinement of tricuspid valve anatomy nomenclature and grading scale, and the development of dedicated prognostic risk scores. The role of less-invasive therapeutic options in driving these advances should not be underestimated, including their influence on the development of new classifications that favor the demonstration of positive outcomes from these therapies.

Surgical decision-making in severe regurgitation — severity confirmation and tricuspid considerations: As management trends toward earlier intervention, "it is important that early preemptive surgery be performed only in those with truly severe regurgitation", and "surgery in symptomatic patients is recommended only when AR or MR is considered severe enough to be the cause of symptoms". In secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with mitral valve (MV) disease, "surgical repair of severe TR is indicated at the time of MV surgery whether or not there are clinical signs of severe TR", and "the decision for concomitant TV repair is driven principally by imaging evidence of severe TR or severe dilatation of the tricuspid annulus", whereas "in patients with primary TR, the clinical presentation is also of great importance".

Figure 1 — Pathway for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) evaluation and management — organizes care from identification through follow-up. Identification highlights "TR symptoms or signs" and assessment of "Clinical context". Severity assessment directs clinicians to "Determine Severity" using quantitative metrics (RVol, EROA, RF), associated findings (RA and RV size and function, TA dimension, IVC size, VCW, hepatic vein flow, PASP, left-sided structures/function), and other testing (TEE, 3-D TEE, CMR, cardiac CT, left/right heart catheterization), then classifies TR as "Mild", "Moderate", or " ≥ Severe". Treatment is structured around an MDT with options including "Optimal Medical Therapy" (left-sided heart disease management, diuretics, pulmonary vasodilators, OAC and rhythm control for AF), "Surgery" (left-sided VHD management, tricuspid valve repair or replacement, CIED management, minimize need for PPM), and "TTVI" (left-sided VHD management, T-TEER, TTVR, CIED management, minimize need for PPM). Follow-up emphasizes responsible clinicians and ongoing "Symptoms/exam", "Surveillance TTE", and "OMT, CIED management".

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) clinical presentation — most encountered cases, symptom progression, and examination findings are described as follows: Most TR cases clinically encountered are secondary in nature and not related to primary diseases of the valve leaflets or chordae, such as infective endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, carcinoid, and Ebstein anomaly. Mild-to-moderate degrees of TR are usually well tolerated in the short to intermediate term and may be clinically silent, but with increasing TR severity, symptoms of systemic venous congestion, such as edema and those reflective of reduced forward cardiac output, including dyspnea and fatigue, may emerge, and more advanced manifestations of right-sided congestion, such as abdominal bloating, worsening peripheral edema, weight gain, and anorexia, are ominous. Most patients with chronic severe secondary TR are older and have a significant burden of other cardiac and systemic comorbidities, and women outnumber men in most large observational series and atrial fibrillation (AF) is common. TR on bedside physical examination is more often "seen" than "heard", with severe TR showing elevated venous pressure and a prominent, systolic cv wave with a rapid y descent (in the absence of tricuspid stenosis), and the murmur of chronic TR being holosystolic in timing, high or medium pitched, and best heard at the lower left sternal border. An increase in murmur intensity during inspiration (Carvallo sign) can help distinguish it from other holosystolic murmurs, but when right atrial (RA) pressure is very high the murmur may not increase with inspiration, and in rare severe TR a diastolic murmur of functional tricuspid stenosis owing to enhanced diastolic flow can be appreciated.

### Tricuspid valve academic research consortium definitions for tricuspid regurgitation and trial endpoints [^112f2VDU]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Interest in the pathophysiology, etiology, management, and outcomes of patients with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has grown in the wake of multiple natural history studies showing progressively worse outcomes associated with increasing TR severity, even after adjusting for multiple comorbidities. Historically, isolated tricuspid valve surgery has been associated with high in-hospital mortality rates, leading to the development of transcatheter treatment options. The aim of this first Tricuspid Valve Academic Research Consortium document is to standardize definitions of disease etiology and severity, as well as endpoints for trials that aim to address the gaps in our knowledge related to identification and management of patients with TR. Standardizing endpoints for trials should provide consistency and enable meaningful comparisons between clinical trials. A second Tricuspid Valve Academic Research Consortium document will focus on further defining trial endpoints and will discuss trial design options.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) diagnostic approach and referral — relative value of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and referral triggers are stated as follows: The physical examination is far less sensitive and specific than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for the detection and characterization of TR, and TR is often first appreciated on a TTE study done for another indication, with findings on TTE potentially discordant from those clinically detected and diuretic therapy reducing signs of congestion. Additionally, the severity of TR may wax and wane with time, necessitating longitudinal follow-up as a component of clinical decision-making. Referral to a MDT for optimization of medical and rhythm management, and assessment of candidacy for TV intervention should be considered for patients with severe TR in whom advanced treatments would not be considered futile, with emphasis on early recognition of progressive TR and prompt referral given the excess morbidity and mortality associated with late intervention in high-risk patients.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) outcomes with left-sided therapies — cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), TAVI, and M-TEER — are quantified as follows: in a study of CRT, "852 patients" included "184 (22%)" with moderate-to-severe TR at baseline and "75 (41%)" showed improvement "at 6 months". In a Medicare TAVI registry, "3% had severe TR", and "76.4% improved to moderate or less TR 30 days after transcatheter aortic valve replacement", while "Severe residual TR at 30 days predicted a higher 1-year mortality (27.4% severe TR vs 18.7% for moderate TR and 16.8% for mild TR; P < 0.0001)". Registry data also found "2.3% of patients undergoing TAVI and 14.7% of those undergoing M-TEER have severe TR at baseline", and after M-TEER, "TR severity is expected to improve in approximately 30% to 40%". Patients with severe concomitant TR had "a higher burden of comorbidities and lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Overall, summary scores at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year", and were "less likely to be 'alive and well' at 1 year after TAVI or M- TEER". In surgical series of primary MR, "In a report of 213 patients… impaired RV function was frequent (30%)", and "RV recovery was associated more strongly with LV reverse remodeling and septal function than with changes in PA pressures".

### Severe tricuspid regurgitation and atrioventicular block caused by blunt thoracic trauma in an elderly woman [^113WkyEb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Symptomatic cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma is relatively rare, and valvular injury is even more rare. The valves most commonly affected are tricuspid. Automobile accidents are mostly responsible for this type of injury.

Objectives

Unlike with the mitral valve, post-traumatic tricuspid heart valve insufficiency is usually well tolerated. Indeed, severe tricuspid regurgitation can resolve spontaneously.

Case Report

A 68-year-old woman with no previous cardiac or medical history was brought to our Emergency Department after an automobile accident. She had chest pain and shortness of breath upon admission. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination revealed severe tricuspid regurgitation with rupture of the chordae tendineae and prolapse of the valve cusps into the right atrium during systole. An electrocardiogram was consistent with second-degree Mobitz II atrioventricular block on admission, which subsequently progressed to complete atrioventricular block on day 3. During follow-up with close hemodynamic monitoring, her symptoms disappeared and repeat echocardiography revealed a regression in the severity of tricuspid regurgitation. Operative repair of the tricuspid valve was deemed unnecessary and the patient was discharged with medical therapy on the eighth day after admission.

Conclusions

It is important to be aware of traumatic tricuspid regurgitation after non-penetrating chest trauma. Close follow-up may suffice in some patients with stable hemodynamic conditions, and regression of tricuspid regurgitation can be expected during follow-up.

### Patient-reported goals in tricuspid regurgitation: a qualitative analysis of patient and care partner perspectives [^112LNGgD]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common valvular heart condition that is often a result of concurrent heart disease such as left-sided heart failure or atrial fibrillation leading to atrial enlargement. When symptomatic, the natural history of TR includes earlier mortality and significant detriments in quality of life. Optimization of a patient's health status (ie, symptoms, functional status, and quality of life) is a central goal in the treatment of heart disease and plays a pivotal role in the determination of efficacy of therapeutic approaches in multiple heart failure trials. More recently, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been incorporated into the assessment of transcatheter devices to treat valvular heart disease, particularly those to treat TR.

Until recently, treatment options for severe symptomatic TR were limited to diuretic therapy to manage the common physical signs of right-sided congestion, most commonly lower leg swelling. The more insidious symptoms of fatigue and overall debility due to low energy are often attributed to aging or inactivity rather than severe TR, complicating diagnosis. In the context of previously limited treatment options, patients were less likely to be appropriately diagnosed or educated about the disease or its natural history by their clinicians as there was little research supporting new developments.

Surgical therapy for severe TR is offered rarely and typically only in the context of concomitant procedures (ie, mitral valve repair), albeit with some risk. Isolated tricuspid valve (TV) surgery is associated with high in-hospital mortality among older patients presenting with heart failure symptoms, in part, because of the late presentation and multiple comorbidities of this population.

With the development of novel transcatheter repair and replacement devices, the literature on diagnosis and treatment of TR has skyrocketed. No longer forgotten, research on the TV is flourishing, including topics such as disease prevalence and natural history, intersections with heart failure, role of atrial fibrillation, concomitant valvular heart disease, mortality risk scores for surgery and transcatheter device therapies, and PROs. However, data on the patient experience are lacking.

### The tricuspid valve: current perspective and evolving management of tricuspid regurgitation [^1172eqWS]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular specialists have entered an era of renewed interest and enthusiasm surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of valvular heart disease, driven in part by emerging percutaneous therapies for the treatment of aortic, pulmonic, and mitral valve disease. Despite this wave of investigation, little or no attention has been given to the treatment of tricuspid valve disease. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) occurs mainly from tricuspid annular dilation, which can result from left-sided heart failure from myocardial or valvular causes, right ventricular volume and pressure overload, or dilation of cardiac chambers. If untreated at the time of surgical mitral valve repair, significant residual TR negatively impacts perioperative outcomes, functional class, and survival. TR does not reliably resolve after successful mitral valve surgery. If present at the time of mitral valve surgery, TR can usually be effectively addressed with ring annuloplasty. Because reoperations for recurrent TR carry high mortality rates, few patients are offered reoperation for redo tricuspid repair or replacement. As transcatheter therapies for mitral regurgitation arise, parallel percutaneous approaches for TR may be necessary. In this article, we review the anatomy, pathophysiology, and value of mechanical correction of TR, including potential transcatheter therapies for TR.

### Isolated tricuspid regurgitation: outcomes and therapeutic interventions [^117TUu94]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Isolated severe TR results in progressive right heart failure and adversely impacts survival. Surgery remains the only definitive treatment but is rarely performed. There are little data to guide management of isolated TR; however, surgery is reasonable in patients with right heart failure who are at low operative risk prior to the development of RV dysfunction and end-organ damage. Further research is needed to identify markers of disease progression and to aid in the optimal timing for surgical referral.

### Contemporary trends in the use and outcomes of surgical treatment of tricuspid regurgitation [^114BWXSt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is prevalent and negatively affects long‐term outcomes. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 However, TR remains undertreated because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with tricuspid valve (TV) surgery. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Nevertheless, recent developments in the field of transcatheter valve interventions have stimulated a renewed interest in the "forgotten" TV. 11, 12, 13 Early in‐human experiences demonstrated the feasibility of several transcatheter tricuspid repair and replacement systems in treating TR, but they also highlighted the particularly challenging anatomical features of the TV, subvalvular apparatus, and right ventricle. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 A handful of transcatheter TV therapies are being tested in early feasibility trials (clinicaltrials.gov trial: NCT‐02787408, NCT‐02339974, NCT‐02574650, NCT‐02981953, NCT‐02471807). 13 Given the growing interest in transcatheter TV therapies, contemporary outcomes of TV surgery are relevant and can be used as a benchmark for early investigations of these therapies. Previous investigations of TV surgery outcomes included small numbers, noncontemporary design, or heterogeneous groups of patients. 6, 7, 8, 9

We aim to use a large contemporary nationwide registry to assess characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing TV surgery in the United States between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2014, with a special emphasis on isolated TV repair (TVr) and replacement (TVR).

### Surgical strategies for functional tricuspid regurgitation [^111EJAKK]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Functional or secondary tricuspid regurgitation commonly is found in the setting of left-sided heart disease and, when severe, is associated with substantially poorer functional outcomes and survival if untreated. The traditional view that functional tricuspid regurgitation generally resolves with surgical correction of the primary lesions is no longer held. Data showing late development of severe tricuspid regurgitation in patients with mild regurgitation at time of mitral valve surgery have heralded a new era of aggressive intervention on the tricuspid valve. Tricuspid ring annuloplasty can be performed with minimal incremental morbidity and negligible additional mortality. Therefore, in addition to patients with severe regurgitation, annuloplasty is now also recommended for patients with risk factors for developing late tricuspid insufficiency (typically patients with moderate tricuspid regurgitation or severe annular dilation at time of left-sided cardiac procedures). In this work we review the current indications for tricuspid valve repair in patients undergoing other cardiac surgery operations and also the various options available to the surgeon.

### Tricuspid regurgitation: from imaging to clinical trials to resolving the unmet Need for Treatment [^1144UZn7]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous valvular disease, independently associated with excess mortality and high morbidity in all clinical contexts. TR is profoundly undertreated by surgery and is often discovered late in patients presenting with right-sided heart failure. To address the issue of undertreatment and poor clinical outcomes without intervention, numerous structural tricuspid interventional devices have been and are in development, a challenging process due to the unique anatomic and physiological characteristics of the tricuspid valve, and warranting well-designed clinical trials. The path from routine practice TR detection to appropriate TR evaluation, to conduction of clinical trials, to enriched therapeutic possibilities for improving TR access to treatment and outcomes in routine practice is complex. Therefore, this paper summarizes the key points and methods crucial to TR detection, quantitation, categorization, risk-scoring, intervention-monitoring, and outcomes evaluation, particularly of right-sided function, and to clinical trial development and conduct, for both interventional and surgical groups.

### Tricuspid regurgitation: a review of current interventional management [^114Wwzzj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Conservative Management

Medical management for TR is limited. TTE surveillance is used to monitor progression of TR severity. Neither the American Society of Echocardiography or AHA/ACC guidelines provide a specific recommendation for the frequency of surveillance. However, the 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines suggest TTE every 3 to 6 months for patients with severe mitral regurgitation. A similar approach may be reasonable to use in patients with severe TR to monitor annular dilation and RV function. The workhorse for medical management in TR is loop diuretics to relieve symptoms of right‐sided HF. No particular loop diuretic has demonstrated significant advantages versus others. It is important to note diuretics in TR have no morbidity or mortality benefit. Current medical management of iTR is solely based on symptom relief.

When to Refer to Valve Team

Centers that offer innovative valvular intervention do so with valve teams which consist of cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, nursing coordinators, research coordinators, and often neurologists. The 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines suggest consideration of intervention when a patient has TR with refractory right HF to address symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations. Progressive annular dilation and presence of congestive hepatopathy are associated with poor long‐term outcomes and should prompt consideration of referral to a valve team. When it becomes severe, TR causes progressive right heart remodeling, which over time increasingly affects morbidity and mortality. Although RV remodeling is associated with poor outcomes it is not well understood if improved TR severity through intervention improves outcomes through RV remodeling. Outcomes following TV repair have been correlated to RV ejection fraction and end‐diastolic volumes; however, this is not well defined and there are no widely accepted quantifiable cutoffs to help guide which patients benefit most. This means we currently do not have a good understanding of which patients are optimal for intervention. We suggest referral to a valve team in any symptomatic patient with severe TR. The goal is to prevent irreversible right heart remodeling which is a chronic process. Therefore, the earlier referral the better.

### Does lowering pulmonary arterial pressure eliminate severe functional tricuspid regurgitation? Insights from pulmonary thromboendarterectomy [^1146CSRD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Because pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) can result in an immediate reduction in pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, we sought to evaluate the effect of PTE on severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) without tricuspid annuloplasty.

Background

Few data exist regarding the frequency and magnitude of functional TR improvement after reduction in PA pressure.

Methods

We identified 27 patients with severe TR, defined by a regurgitant index (RI) > 33%, who underwent PTE. The RI, tricuspid annular diameter (TAD), apical displacement of leaflet coaptation, and estimated PA systolic pressure were determined on pre- and post-PTE echocardiograms. Patients were stratified based on resolution (RI ≤ 33%) or persistence (RI > 33%) of severe TR.

Results

Comparing pre- and post-PTE echocardiography results, severe TR resolved in 19 of 27 (70%) patients. This group had a more effective PA systolic pressure reduction after PTE (49 ± 20 mm Hg vs. 32 ± 16 mm Hg by echocardiography, p = 0.075, and 37 ± 16 mm Hg vs. 16 ± 13 mm Hg by catheter measurement, p = 0.004). No difference was observed in TAD, apical displacement of the tricuspid valve, or other features compared with the group with persistent severe TR. There was a trend toward longer hospital stays in the group with persistent severe TR (19 ± 15 days vs. 14 ± 9 days; p = 0.55).

Conclusions

After significant PA pressure reduction by PTE, severe functional TR with a dilated annulus may improve without annuloplasty despite dilated tricuspid annulus diameters.

In patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF attributable to severe secondary TR (Stages C and D), therapies to treat the primary cause of HF (eg, pulmonary vasodilators to reduce elevated pulmonary artery pressures, GDMT for HF with reduced LVEF, or rhythm control of AF) can be useful.

Clinical Approach With an Illustrative Case

Clinically, the most important process is appropriate patient selection for referral to a valve team to consider intervention (Figure 6). All patients with primary or isolated severe TR, once medically optimized, should be referred to a valve team. Patients with secondary severe TR require a more nuanced approach, maximally addressing underlying cause and if severe TR persists these patients should also be referred to a valve team.

Flow diagram guiding management of patients with severe TR on TTE.

In any patients with symptomatic severe TR the first management step is medical therapy through volume optimization with diuretics. Primary and isolated severe TR should always be referred to a valve team for consideration of intervention. Secondary severe TR should have underlying cause addressed first; thereafter if severe TR persists referral to valve team is recommended to consider intervention. HF indicates heart failure; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography; and TR, tricuspid regurgitation

### Tricuspid regurgitation diagnosis and treatment [^115MQ7BW]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most common lesion of the tricuspid valve (TV). Mild TR is common and usually is benign. However, moderate or severe TR can lead to irreversible myocardial damage and adverse outcomes. Despite these findings, few patients with significant TR undergo surgery. The treatment of functional (secondary) TR in particular remains controversial because of high rates of residual or recurrent TR and poor outcomes following surgical intervention. Traditional teaching that functional TR resolves on its own if the underlying disease is successfully treated has proven to be incorrect. This review aims to clarify management of TR by describing the anatomy, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of TR, including the eventual possibility of percutaneous TV therapy.

### Implications of tricuspid regurgitation severity in patients undergoing mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair [^115tZrEX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Significant TR has long been associated with increased morbidity and mortality across a wide range of clinical scenarios. In patients undergoing mitral TEER, such a hazard may be mediated by a more advanced left‐heart disease, a greater burden of comorbidities, or a direct harmful effect(s) imposed by the right‐sided valvulopathy. Despite a substantial body of literature, no TR severity cutoff has been consistently demonstrated to date as an outcome predictor in the mitral TEER arena, presumably due to discrepancies in TR grading systems, analytical approaches, and MR mechanisms studied. Consequently, TR severity has not been acknowledged in all TEER‐specific risk models. As for TR evolution following TEER, current literature assigns a protective role for postprocedural TR improvement; however, supportive data either have stemmed from considerably small cohorts or have been based on limited or mixed pre/postprocedural variables regression models as well as highly variable TR assessment timings (eg, 40–152 days post‐TEER in 1 study). In either case, no attention has been paid to TR cause.

### Surgical management of tricuspid regurgitation: a new algorithm to minimise recurrent tricuspid regurgitation [^114tRq8X]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Annulus dilatation is known to be a preoperative predictor of residual TR. However, there is no consensus on other potential predictors, including the presence of right HF, pulmonary hypertension, increased atrial volume, atrial fibrillation (AFib), rheumatic mitral valve disease, marked RV remodelling/dysfunction or a history of ischaemic heart disease. There is wide agreement on the therapeutic response to severe TR, but the approach to lesser grades remains controversial. Thus, American clinical practice guidelinescentre on severe or progressive TR, while European guidelinesinclude recommendations for lower grades associated with certain predictors of residual TR. The evidence underlying European guidelines includes data on: the association of severe TR with congestive HF; poor outcomes in isolated severe TR cases attributed to late patient management; good survival rates after combined tricuspid and mitral valve surgery, and the predictive capacity of annulus size. Brescia et al followed European clinical practice guidelines in patients with functional TR and reported absent or only moderate TR in a large proportion of patients, with the persistence of good RV function. Other authors underscored the need for careful patient selection to improve outcomes. In contrast, one study found that survival was not improved by surgery in comparison to medical treatment. American guidelines cite multiple references related to TR of different grades/etiologies and associated predictive factors; however, almost all focus on the study of severe TR.

With the above background, we hypothesised that the TR rate at 1 year would be reduced by selecting the surgical approach in accordance with a set of preoperative clinical and echocardiographic variables. A corresponding algorithm was implemented in this study, following up patients during 1 year after TV surgery to evaluate TR recurrence. The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of this novel algorithm for surgical intervention to TR, considering the residual TR as primary endpoint. Secondary objectives were to determine the mortality for all causes and for cardiovascular disease with implementation of the algorithm and to evaluate predictors of TR at 1 year and predictors of early and late mortality.

### Isolated tricuspid regurgitation: outcomes and therapeutic interventions [^116R7YE1]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Isolated tricuspid regurgitation (TR) can be caused by primary valvular abnormalities such as flail leaflet or secondary annular dilation as is seen in atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension and left heart disease. There is an increasing recognition of a subgroup of patients with isolated TR in the absence of other associated cardiac abnormalities. Left untreated isolated TR significantly worsens survival. Stand-alone surgery for isolated TR is rarely performed due to an average operative mortality of 8%-10%and a paucity of data demonstrating improved survival. When surgery is performed, valve repair may be preferred over replacement; however, there is a risk of significant recurrent regurgitation after repair. Existing society guidelines do not fully address the management of isolated TR. We propose that patients at low operative risk with symptomatic severe isolated TR and no reversible cause undergo surgery prior to the onset of right ventricular dysfunction and end-organ damage. For patients at increased surgical risk novel percutaneous interventions may offer an alternative treatment but further research is needed. Significant knowledge gaps remain and future research is needed to define operative outcomes and provide comparative data for medical and surgical therapy.

Symptomatic outcomes, functional capacity and quality of life improvement

Given that prospective randomized controlled clinical trials in the field of TTVI have so far demonstrated an impact only on QoL, but not on hard clinical endpoints such as survival or HFH, it is important to also examine the impact of TR reduction on these symptomatic endpoints. The current literature suggests that the majority of symptomatic endpoints are significantly correlated with the absolute degree of TR reduction. In EuroTR, the proportion of patients with an improvement of New York Heart Association functional class by one or two degrees increased with the degree of TR reduction (TR reduction by one grade: 51%, by two grades 60%, by three grades 63%). Within the TRILUMINATE trial, QoL as expressed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) did not improve from baseline to 1‐year follow‐up in patients with worsening or unchanged TR. On the other hand, in patients with one grade TR reduction it improved by a mean of 10 points and in case of two or more grades TR reduction by 17 points. Equivalent results were reported for 6‐min walking distance (6MWD). Worsening or unchanged TR was associated with a worsening in 6MWD while functional capacity improved in parallel with TR reduction. Similarly, a sub‐analysis from the TRISCEND II study confirmed those findings. Patients with massive or torrential TR at baseline presented with more pronounced KCCQ improvement compared to those with 'only' severe TR at baseline and thus a smaller absolute degree of TR reduction.

### Secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation: a forgotten entity [^116EwAtM]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Natural history and follow-up

The natural history of severe TR includes a prolonged asymptomatic period with progressive enlargement of the right atrium and RV due to volume overload. There are limited data regarding predictors of TR progression. Recently, Shiran et al reported that increased pulmonary artery pressure and permanent atrial fibrillation were the most powerful risk factors for TR progression. The disease was considered benign unless associated with pulmonary hypertension or right or left heart failure. However, Nath et al examined the mortality associated with TR in a retrospective series of 5223 patients with a follow-up of 4 years. They concluded that moderate and severe TR were associated with increased mortality and also that increasing TR severity was associated with worse survival regardless of biventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary hypertension. Also, it has to be emphasised that uncorrected severe TR is self-perpetuating and progressive and becomes very incapacitating, with patients needing large amounts of diuretics and frequently developing liver dysfunction.

Jhawar et al also found that secondary TR is associated with increased mortality and decreased surgery-free survival. Due to its functional physiology, secondary TR may diminish or disappear with improvement of the RV function and also after successful correction of left-side lesions. However, TR can persist or even increase after left-heart surgery, hence tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral surgery is nowadays recommended in cases of severe TR or dilated tricuspid annulus.

The prognostic role of pulmonary hypertension is still controversial. It appears that patients with moderate pulmonary hypertension preoperatively generally have RV failure and dilatation, and many of these patients maintain TR after mitral valve surgery, when not dealt with simultaneous surgery of the tricuspid valve. On the other hand, patients with severe pulmonary hypertension often show regression of TR and almost a third of them experience complete resolution following mitral surgery without intervention on the tricuspid valve.

### Functional tricuspid regurgitation in mitral valve disease: epidemiology and prognostic implications [^117Aom6m]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

In this review we summarize the data on epidemiology and natural history of functional tricuspid valve regurgitation as it applies to surgery for mitral valve disease. Tricuspid regurgitation in the context of mitral valve disease is frequent and is associated with substantial reduction in survival and quality of life. In many patients, the correction of left-sided cardiac lesions does not lead to resolution of tricuspid regurgitation. Significant tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve surgery portends a poor prognosis, a course that is often not altered by subsequent surgical therapy. Although a liberal approach to tricuspid annuloplasty is widely practiced, the evidence that this approach alters the natural history of functional tricuspid regurgitation is not yet available, so it is not certain how much of the negative impact of tricuspid regurgitation is causative, rather than confounding, and to what degree we will improve long-term outcomes of mitral valve surgery by liberal tricuspid annuloplasty.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) hemodynamic assessment caveats — A weak TR signal or the presence of severe TR may result in underestimation of pulmonary systolic pressure; direct invasive measurement can resolve this uncertainty. Direct measurements of right atrial pressure may also be useful for clinical decision-making. Right ventriculography may further aid in the evaluation of the severity of TR and the status of the RV. Thermodilution cardiac output measurements may be inaccurate with severe TR, and thus a Fick cardiac output should be measured to apply the calculation of pulmonary resistance.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) natural history and prevalence in heart failure (HF) show substantial burden across phenotypes, with the European Society of Cardiology registry reporting that the prevalence of moderate-to-severe TR is "equally distributed across HF phenotypes, ranging from 18% in HF with mildly reduced EF to 20% in HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) and 21% in HFpEF", while Viennese data suggest higher rates "33% in HFpEF and HF with mildly reduced EF, and 50% in HFrEF". In HFrEF specifically, secondary TR is "present in approximately 21% of patients with HFrEF", and progression is common as "in another series of 212 patients with HFrEF and moderate or less TR, a significant worsening of TR occurred in 22% for 5 years".

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) mortality risk in heart failure (HF) is consistently elevated and increases with severity, with a U.S. database of 435,679 patients showing higher all-cause mortality for severe TR versus no TR at baseline (adjusted HR: 1.34 [95% CI: 1.28–1.39]) at 1.5 years and for severe TR developing during follow-up (adjusted HR: 2.4 [95% CI: 2.2–2.57]). In a French cohort of isolated secondary TR, 722 patients (mean age 75 years; 62% women; 81% atrial fibrillation) had all-cause mortality of 24% at a median follow-up of 22 months, with nearly 50% cardiac deaths. In a registry of at least moderate TR (n = 13,611) with predominantly secondary TR, five phenotypes had 5-year mortality rates of 38%, 68%, 71%, 67%, and 83%, and as < 5% underwent tricuspid valve surgery these represent untreated natural history; TR in HFpEF is also associated with increased mortality risk, and moderate or greater TR with aortic or mitral valve disease or group 1 pulmonary hypertension carries excess hazard of death. At transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), moderate or greater TR is associated with a 2-fold increase in mortality risk.

### Isolated tricuspid regurgitation: outcomes and therapeutic interventions [^113C3ysg]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

More than 1.6 million Americans have at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), yet fewer than 8000 tricuspid valve (TV) operations are performed annually in the USA. The aetiology of TR is divided into primary and secondary causes. Historically, primary TR was thought to be limited to patients with congenital heart disease and rarely observed in adults. Secondary TR is associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), left-sided valvulopathy or myocardial disease. However, there is an emerging population of adult patients without left-sided heart disease, PH or congenital abnormalities who nonetheless develop symptomatic isolated TR.

The incidence of isolated TR appears to be rising along with the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and intracardiac devices. This has prompted interest in corrective therapies; however, existing guidelines do not fully address management. In this article, we examine the natural history, presentation and evaluation of isolated TR. Next, we review surgical guidelines, evaluate postoperative outcomes and propose a management algorithm for isolated disease. Finally, we discuss percutaneous devices and address areas for future research.

Echocardiography for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) severity classification emphasizes transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as first-line, with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) used when images are suboptimal and to assess morphology, and guidelines recommend assessing TR severity with a combination of structural, qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative measures; TR is commonly graded as mild (1+), moderate (2+), or severe (3+), with severe (3+) TR defined by a vena contracta diameter of ≥ 0.7 cm, effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) of > 0.4 cm2, and/or tricuspid regurgitant volume (RVol) ≥ 45 mL/beat, while hepatic vein flow reversal is a specific sign of clinically significant TR; conventional proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) methods can underestimate secondary TR severity in approximately 50% of patients and EROA by PISA underestimates 3D vena contracta area by approximately 40%, yet the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines recommend the use of an uncorrected EROAby PISA to define TR severity; because of complex leaflet morphology and asymmetric orifice shape, the use of quantitative Doppler and 3D TEE color Doppler has been recommended to improve assessment, additional TR grades of massive and torrential have prognostic relevance, and underestimation by standard guideline-recommended color Doppler methods may contribute to undertreatment.

### Current evidence on tricuspid regurgitation interventions in heart failure [^116SuKAH]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is seen in up to a quarter of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and exceeds 50% in those with advanced HF symptoms. In patients with HF, the increasing severity of TR is associated with progressively worse survival. Data supporting the medical management of HF and TR continue to evolve with a greater appreciation of the pathophysiologic relationship between these diseases. The results of isolated tricuspid valve surgery vary based on the timing of the intervention and coexisting comorbidities. However, earlier intervention with timing optimized by the use of risk scores may improve these outcomes. Transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions have become a viable therapeutic option, particularly for high surgical risk patients, with a repair and replacement device currently commercially available, but they have yet to show mortality or HF hospitalization benefit. The timing and type of intervention as well as the expected clinical benefit of device therapy require further study.

### State-of-the-art review of echocardiographic imaging in the evaluation and treatment of functional tricuspid regurgitation [^1121DKSj]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Functional or secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most common cause of severe TR in the Western world. The presence of functional TR, either isolated or in combination with left heart disease, is associated with unfavorable natural history. Surgical mortality for isolated tricuspid valve interventions remains higher than for any other single valve surgery, and surgical options for repair do not have consistent long-term durability. In addition, as more patients undergo transcatheter left valve interventions, developing transcatheter solutions for functional TR has gained greater momentum. Numerous transcatheter devices are currently in early clinical trials. All patients require an assessment of valve morphology and function, and transcatheter devices typically require intraprocedural guidance by echocardiography. The following review will describe tricuspid anatomy, define echocardiographic views for evaluating tricuspid valve morphology and function, and discuss imaging requirements for the current transcatheter devices under development for the treatment of functional TR.

### Transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions: current devices and associated evidence [^112RqCdG]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common finding in patients with chronic cardiopathy, and often a marker of an advanced disease. Being silent or with symptoms intertwined with the primitive left heart disease, TR has often been neglected, leading to the late referral of patients with advanced right-heart failure. Hence, isolated tricuspid surgery has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, the worse of all valve interventions, and medical management has been limited to symptomatic treatment. In this context, percutaneous therapies for severe TR have gained traction, addressing the unmet therapeutic gap for a less invasive disease-modifying management. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview on transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions, focusing on devices' characteristics, associated evidence, and future perspectives.

### Determinants of tricuspid regurgitation progression and its implications for adequate management [^116TjCYX]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with an increased mortality. Previous studies have analyzed predictors of TR progression and the clinical impact of baseline TR. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the natural history of TR: the pattern of change and clinical impact of progression.

Objectives

The authors sought to evaluate predictors of TR progression and assess the prognostic impact of TR progression.

Methods

A total of 1,843 patients with at least moderate TR were prospectively followed up with consecutive echocardiographic studies and/or clinical evaluation. All patients with less than a 2-year follow-up were excluded. Clinical and echocardiographic features, hospitalizations for heart failure, and cardiovascular death and interventions were recorded to assess their impact in TR progression.

Results

At a median 2.3-year follow-up, 19% of patients experienced progression. Patients with baseline moderate TR presented a rate progression of 4.9%, 10.1%, and 24.8% 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. Older age (HR: 1.03), lower body mass index (HR: 0.95), chronic kidney disease (HR: 1.55), worse NYHA functional class (HR: 1.52), and right ventricle dilation (HR: 1.33) were independently associated with TR progression. TR progression was associated with an increase in chamber dilation as well as a decrease in ventriculoarterial coupling and in left ventricle ejection fraction (P < 0.001). TR progression was associated with an increased cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Marked individual variability in TR progression hindered accurate follow-up. In addition, TR progression was a determinant for survival regardless of initial TR severity.

Conclusions

Interest in pathophysiology, etiology, management, and outcomes of patients with TR has grown as a consequence of natural history studies showing progressively worse outcomes independently associated with increasing TR severity. This first TVARC document proposes standardized definitions of disease etiology and severity, as well as endpoints for trials that aim to address the gaps in our knowledge related to identification and management of patients with TR (Central Illustration). Standardizing endpoints for trials should provide consistency and enable meaningful comparisons between clinical trials. A second TVARC document will focus on further defining trial endpoints and discuss trial design options.
