## Question

what stent to choose for stemi in elderly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which stent should be selected for an elderly patient with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, and how to adjust the stent choice and antiplatelet therapy considering the specific risks and benefits in geriatric patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline position on stent type in STEMI. Then, I should verify whether age modifies that recommendation. Next, I will examine comparative efficacy and safety data for drug-eluting stents (DES) versus bare-metal stents (BMS), including stent thrombosis and restenosis. After that, I need to consider second-generation DES performance and any differences among DES. Then, I should review elderly-specific evidence and bleeding risk trade-offs. Finally, I will integrate DAPT duration, access strategy, and shared decision-making to synthesize a practical recommendation anchored in current guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the guideline foundation so I don't jump to conclusions: contemporary ESC and ACC/AHA/SCAI guidance uniformly recommend DES over BMS for STEMI, emphasizing reduced restenosis and improved device-oriented outcomes without compromising safety, and they do not carve out an exception for older adults, which argues against defaulting to BMS solely due to age [^113JJXGf] [^116Ystww].

> Wait, let me verify whether age alters this stance. The ESC explicitly advises applying the same diagnostic and treatment strategies in older patients as in younger patients, and to individualize decisions using a holistic, geriatric-informed approach rather than using age alone to restrict stent choice, which supports using DES in the elderly when feasible [^116Ystww] [^111j8T5Q].

> Next, I should review head-to-head evidence. A patient-level network meta-analysis of 10,979 STEMI patients showed DES significantly reduced the composite of cardiac death, reinfarction, or target lesion revascularization versus BMS, with no difference among specific DES and with second-generation DES showing lower definite/probable stent thrombosis than BMS and first-generation DES, reinforcing DES as the default in STEMI including older adults [^115LTXAW].

> Hold on, I should double-check stent thrombosis concerns that often drive BMS selection in the very old. Randomized data like EXAMINATION demonstrated lower stent thrombosis with everolimus-eluting stents versus BMS at 1 year, and pooled analyses of newer-generation DES showed fewer thrombotic events than BMS, while large registries indicate newer-generation DES have early/late stent thrombosis rates comparable to BMS and lower than older DES, mitigating historical very-late thrombosis worries seen with first-generation devices [^114JkkiH] [^115soZvB] [^114ve91t].

> I will now examine elderly-specific data. In HORIZONS-AMI, patients aged 70 years or older benefited from paclitaxel-eluting stents with reduced ischemic target vessel revascularization and a trend toward fewer major adverse cardiac events, and importantly, the SENIOR trial in patients over 75 showed DES with short DAPT reduced major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events versus BMS without excess bleeding, supporting DES efficacy and acceptable safety even in older cohorts [^115PEAjF].

> But wait, what if bleeding risk is paramount; I need to ensure the antiplatelet regimen is aligned with geriatric risk. The DAPT-STEMI randomized trial found that 6 months of DAPT after second-generation DES was non-inferior to 12 months for net adverse clinical events, and guidelines endorse tailoring antithrombotic choice and dose to renal function, frailty, and bleeding risk, with transradial access preferred to reduce bleeding and vascular complications in older adults [^111LXbWM] [^111CT9Zf] [^1178qMjk].

> Let me consider stent selection nuances among DES. Although network meta-analyses show broadly similar efficacy across DES with second-generation devices having the most favorable safety signal, everolimus-eluting stents have repeatedly demonstrated lower stent thrombosis compared with BMS and some first-generation DES, so if all else is equal, an everolimus-eluting platform is a reasonable default in STEMI, including elderly patients, while acknowledging no head-to-head DES superiority has been conclusively proven in STEMI-specific comparisons [^115LTXAW] [^115972XK] [^114JkkiH].

> I should confirm the procedural context. Guidelines advise stenting the infarct-related artery during the index primary PCI, and in multivessel disease the revascularization strategy should be individualized to clinical status and anatomy, which matters for older adults with limited physiologic reserve, where culprit-first strategies are typical and complete revascularization may be staged based on risk and frailty considerations [^114kBU59] [^117UyMqi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could deferred stenting avoid stent-related complications? Randomized and meta-analytic data show deferred stenting does not reduce mortality and is not routinely recommended, so it should not be used as a strategy to avoid DES in the elderly, especially when a definitive DES can be placed safely with appropriate antithrombotic therapy [^111gBuPe] [^116FAuuK].

> Let me synthesize: for an elderly STEMI patient undergoing primary PCI, I should prefer a second-generation DES, with everolimus-eluting stents as a strong default given consistent reductions in stent thrombosis and restenosis versus BMS, deploy it in the culprit vessel during the index procedure, use transradial access to mitigate bleeding, and tailor DAPT to a shorter 6-month course when bleeding risk is high or stability is achieved, provided the patient is event-free at 6 months, while individualizing antithrombotic agent choice and dose to renal function, frailty, and drug interactions through shared decision-making [^114kBU59] [^115972XK] [^114JkkiH] [^111LXbWM] [^111CT9Zf] [^1178qMjk].

> Hold on, I should verify edge cases. If there is an overriding bleeding hazard that cannot be mitigated or a requirement for unavoidable early interruption of P2Y12 therapy, a BMS may be considered, but I need to ensure this is the exception and that the patient understands the higher risk of restenosis and repeat revascularization, reinforcing that the balance of contemporary evidence and guidelines favors DES even in the elderly when a careful, geriatric-informed plan is in place.

For elderly STEMI patients, **second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES)** are preferred over bare-metal stents (BMS) because they reduce target vessel revascularization and stent thrombosis without increasing bleeding risk [^113JJXGf] [^114JkkiH] [^115soZvB]. Everolimus-eluting stents are the **preferred DES** for their low stent thrombosis and restenosis rates [^114JkkiH] [^115LTXAW]. Use a **short DAPT course (6 months)** when bleeding risk is high, and tailor antithrombotic therapy to renal function and frailty [^111LXbWM] [^111CT9Zf]. Radial access is recommended to minimize bleeding and vascular complications [^1178qMjk]. Individualize decisions for patients ≥ 85 years or with severe frailty, considering life expectancy and goals of care [^111j8T5Q].

---

## Evidence supporting drug-eluting stents in elderly STEMI patients

- **Reduced restenosis and repeat revascularization**: DES significantly reduce target vessel revascularization (TVR) compared to BMS in STEMI, including elderly patients [^115t7Dw7] [^115PEAjF].

- **Lower stent thrombosis**: Second-generation DES, particularly everolimus-eluting stents, have lower stent thrombosis rates than BMS and first-generation DES [^114JkkiH] [^115LTXAW].

- **Improved clinical outcomes**: The EXAMINATION trial showed everolimus-eluting stents reduced stent thrombosis and repeat revascularization without increasing bleeding, supporting their use in elderly STEMI patients [^114JkkiH].

---

## Specific drug-eluting stents recommended for elderly STEMI patients

| **Stent type** | **Clinical evidence** | **Outcomes in elderly patients** |
|-|-|-|
| Everolimus-eluting stents (EES) | - EXAMINATION trial [^114JkkiH] <br/> - Network meta-analyses [^115LTXAW] | - Lower stent thrombosis <br/> - Reduced TVR <br/> - Improved clinical outcomes |
| Zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES) | - DAPT-STEMI trial [^111LXbWM] <br/> - SENIOR trial [^113E5K4W] | - Effective in elderly <br/> - Short DAPT strategies [^111LXbWM] |
| Biolimus-eluting stents (BES) | - COMFORTABLE-AMI trial [^115soZvB] | - Reduced stent thrombosis <br/> - Lower TVR compared to BMS |

---

Everolimus-eluting stents are **particularly recommended** due to their superior safety and efficacy profile in elderly STEMI patients [^114JkkiH] [^115LTXAW].

---

## Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) considerations

- **Standard DAPT duration**: 12 months of aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) is recommended after DES implantation [^111LXbWM].

- **Shortened DAPT in elderly**: For elderly patients at high bleeding risk, a shortened DAPT duration (6 months) is reasonable and supported by the DAPT-STEMI trial [^111LXbWM].

- **Individualized approach**: DAPT duration should be tailored based on bleeding risk, renal function, and frailty [^114tLWa9].

---

## Access site and procedural considerations

Radial access is **preferred** over femoral access in elderly patients to reduce bleeding, vascular complications, and length of stay [^1178qMjk]. Transradial access is **particularly beneficial** in elderly patients, reducing major bleeding and improving clinical outcomes.

---

## Special considerations in very elderly patients (≥ 85 years)

In patients aged ≥ 85 years, a **holistic, individualized approach** is recommended, incorporating frailty, cognitive function, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^111j8T5Q]. BMS may be considered for patients with limited life expectancy or high bleeding risk, but DES remain the preferred option when feasible [^113JJXGf]. Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with patient preferences and goals of care [^112fqddF].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Preferred stent**: Second-generation DES, particularly everolimus-eluting stents, are recommended for elderly STEMI patients [^114Ppxf4] [^114JkkiH].

- **DAPT duration**: Standard 12-month DAPT; consider 6 months for high bleeding risk patients [^111LXbWM].

- **Access site**: Radial access is preferred to minimize bleeding and vascular complications [^1178qMjk].

- **Individualization**: Tailor decisions for very elderly or frail patients based on comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences [^111j8T5Q].

---

Second-generation DES, especially everolimus-eluting stents, are the **preferred choice** for elderly STEMI patients due to their superior efficacy and safety. DAPT duration and procedural approach should be individualized based on bleeding risk, renal function, and frailty, with a holistic approach for very elderly patients.

### Preventive stenting in acute myocardial infarction [^114JQ11Y]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Current practice guidelines advocate culprit vessel intervention alone in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) found to have multivessel coronary disease during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The debate on the timing of noninfarct artery intervention has recently been reinvigorated by the PRAMI (Preventive Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, in which patients undergoing preventive PCI of significant nonculprit lesions at the time primary PCI for STEMI had reduced rates of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and refractory angina. Given that previous literature has cautioned against multivessel PCI during STEMI, this raises the question of whether technical and pharmacological advances in PCI may have opened the door to safely revisit this issue with additional clinical rigor. The impact of STEMI pathophysiology on nonculprit vessel plaque, how treatment of nonculprit lesions alters the natural history of coronary disease after STEMI, and whether this results in a clinical benefit remain unclear, and much of the existing data are retrospective. Additionally, the PRAMI trial did not include a staged PCI, leaving questions as to how this approach might fare compared with simultaneous preventive PCI. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of nonculprit vessel plaque in STEMI, provide a summary of the existing literature on the topic, and discuss the PRAMI trial in the face of previous data and possible future directions for further study.

Complete versus culprit-only revascularization in older adults with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — prior trials have mostly excluded older patients (≥ 75 years of age). The COMPLETE trial showed that complete revascularization was superior to culprit-only at reducing death or MI in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with a mean participant age of 62 years among 4041 participants, and the FULL REVASC trial enrolled 1542 patients with a mean age of 65 years. To address sparse evidence in older adults, the FIRE trial enrolled 1445 participants age ≥ 75 years from 34 sites with STEMI or non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and multivessel disease with ≥ 1 nonculprit lesion (minimum vessel diameter 2.5 mm, visually estimated stenosis 50% to 99%), randomized after successful culprit PCI to culprit-only versus physiology-guided complete revascularization. The primary composite outcome (death, MI, stroke, or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization) at 1 year occurred in 113 patients (15.7%) in the complete revascularization group versus 152 patients (21.0%) in the culprit-only group.

### Retrospective multicenter observational study of the interventional management of coronary disease in the very elderly: the NINETY [^1157kQ66]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this observational, multicenter study was to describe the outcome of very elderly patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

There is a paucity of data among nonagenarians undergoing PCI.

Methods

All consecutive patients 90 years of age or older undergoing PCI with stent implantation between April 2002 and June 2009 were included in the study. The primary endpoint was the long-term rate of net adverse cardiac events (NACE), that is, death, myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion revascularization, and life-threatening or major bleedings.

Results

One hundred forty-six nonagenarians were divided in three groups according to clinical setting: 27 (group A) stable angina or silent ischemia, 85 (group B) unstable angina or non-ST elevation MI, and 34 (group C) with ST elevation MI (STEMI). At 30 days, the incidence of NACE was significantly lower in patients in Group A vs. B or C (0% vs. 17.3% vs. 31.2%, P = 0.006), and the frequency of definite stent thrombosis was higher in Group C vs. A or B (9.4% vs. 0% vs. 0%, P = 0.007), respectively. Up to a median follow-up of 24 months, NACE rate was 33.3% in group A, 49.3% in group B, and 50% in group C (P = 0.32). There were no significant differences between groups in the individual components of the primary endpoint.

Conclusions

PCI in nonagenarians is safe and feasible with acceptable major bleeding rates. However, long-term results show high mortality rates particularly in the STEMI group.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to consider administering bivalirudin, rather than a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus UFH, in older patients with NSTEMI, both initially and at PCI, given similar efficacy but less bleeding risk.

### Invasive strategy with intended percutaneous coronary intervention versus conservative treatment in older people with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis [^113yLcAt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Cohorts

Thirteen patient cohorts were considered (see Table 1). All of these were either registry analyses or retrospective case series with unadjusted comparisons of PCI to CON. Five studies, followed a monocentric design, and the others were conducted as multicentric or even nationwide reports.

Table 1
Characteristics of Included Studies and Patients

In total, 102 158 older adults were included. Of these, 31 629 (31%) were assigned to PCI and 70 529 (69%) were managed conservatively. The first patient was treated in 2003, and the last patient was managed in December 2019. Most patients (98%) were included in registries reporting on nonagenarians. The baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

The STEMI definitions met the criteria of contemporary classifications and were comparable to the greatest possible extent (see Supporting Information Appendix, Table S1). CON was defined as medical therapy on individual study level. Reported reasons to not perform PCI included but were not limited to refusal of the patient, absence of a culprit lesion, anatomy not suitable for PCI, cardiogenic shock, frailty, cognitive impairment, or significant comorbidities as judged by the treating interventional cardiologist. In 5 trials, patients in the CON group were referred for coronary angiography but did not receive PCI.

In PCI group, the angioplasty rate varied from 82.2% to 100% whenever reported. Of these, 77.8% to 92.3% of patients were treated with stent implantation. Stent implantation data were given for only 318 patients in PCI group (1%) and were not reported for remaining patients. In detail, 146 (45.9%) were treated with bare metal stents and 172 (54.1%) received drug‐eluting stents.

Antithrombotic treatment regimens were sparsely reported, so direct comparison between CON and PCI was not feasible (see Supporting Information Appendix, Table S2). The follow‐up period ranged from 30 days to 26.5 months.

### Invasive strategy with intended percutaneous coronary intervention versus conservative treatment in older people with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis [^116VLrZR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Ultimately, timely patient selection for invasive strategy in older people with STEMI remains a challenge in daily routine. Age itself should not per se determine the allocation to a treatment strategy as even older people might be long‐term survivors. A prospective randomized controlled trial assessing the optimized treatment strategy of older patients with STEMI is desired. But recruitment could become an insuperable challenge, and extensive screening efforts could be anticipated from comparable AMI trials in older patients. Beyond the well‐established end points the use of patient‐oriented outcomes might add further value because a potential gain or loss in quality of life might contribute to decision making.

### 10-year outcomes of deferred or conventional stent implantation in patients with STEMI (DANAMI-3-DEFER) [^117KB6zS]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting is recommended in ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. Immediate stenting may cause distal embolization, microvascular damage, and flow disturbances, leading to adverse outcomes. We report the 10-year clinical outcomes of deferred stenting versus conventional PCI in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.

METHODS:

We conducted a 10-year follow-up study of the open-label, randomized DANAMI-3-DEFER trial (Third Danish Study of Optimal Acute Treatment of Patients With STEMI – Deferred Stent Implantation Versus Conventional Treatment), conducted in 4 PCI centers in Denmark. Patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction and acute chest pain < 12 hours were randomized to deferred stenting > 24 hours after the index procedure or conventional PCI with immediate stenting. In the deferred group, immediate stable Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow II to III was established, and intravenous administration of either a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist or bivalirudin for > 4 hours after the index procedure was recommended. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalization for heart failure or all-cause mortality. Key secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary outcome and target vessel revascularization.

RESULTS:

Of 1215 patients, 603 were randomized to deferred stenting and 612 to conventional PCI. After 10 years, deferred stenting did not significantly reduce the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.67–1.02]; P = 0.08). In the deferred group, 124 (24%) died versus 150 (25%) in the conventional PCI group (hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.75–1.19]). Hospitalization for heart failure was lower in patients treated with deferred stenting compared with conventional PCI (odds ratio, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.39–0.88]). Target vessel revascularization was similar in both groups (odds ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.81–1.79]).

CONCLUSIONS:

Deferred stenting did not reduce all-cause mortality or the composite primary outcome after 10 years but reduced hospitalization for heart failure compared with conventional PCI.

Regarding specific circumstances for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to adapt the choice and dosage of antithrombotic agents and secondary prevention medications to renal function, concurrent medications, comorbidities, frailty, cognitive function, and specific contraindications.

### Invasive versus conservative management among older adult Patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116noReg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The management of acute coronary syndromes has evolved over the past decade with the use of newer‐generation drug‐eluting stents, radial artery access, intracoronary imaging, and safer antiplatelet regimens. Approximately 30% to 40% of patients admitted with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are older adults and have higher inpatient mortality, ischemic events, and bleeding compared with younger patients. This has been attributed to the complex vascular anatomy, age‐related renal changes, atypical clinical presentations, geriatric syndromes, and reduced pharmacokinetics in these patients. The 2021 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association revascularization guidelines recommend an invasive approach to NSTEMI, especially in patients with high‐risk factors, such as recurrent angina, ischemia with low levels of activity despite antianginal therapy, systolic dysfunction, and prior coronary revascularization. However, older adult patients were underpresented in most clinical trials. The After Eighty study and the Italian Elderly ACS trial have attempted to investigate the efficacy of an invasive compared with a conservative medical approach in the older adult population with inconsistent results. Further comparisons between community‐based registries, such as NRMI (National Registry of Myocardial Infarction), GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events), and CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the ACC/AHA Guidelines), and landmark trials have found that geriatric syndromes, such as multicomorbidities, frailty, and renal dysfunction, are more prevalent in the community than in these trials. This exclusion of key social and geriatric factors was further explored in more recent trials, such as the MOSCA‐FRAIL (Invasive and Conservative Strategies in Elderly Frail Patients With Non‐STEMI) and SENIOR‐RITA (Older Patients With Non–ST‐Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Randomized Interventional Treatment) trials. However, these trials were underpowered to detect statistically significant findings. Given the lack of robust data on the management of NSTEMI in the geriatric population, we performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of all current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to investigate the efficacy of an invasive versus a conservative medical approach in older adult patients with NSTEMI.

### Clinical outcomes with drug-eluting and bare-metal stents in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: evidence from a comprehensive network meta-analysis [^115972XK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The authors investigated the relative safety and efficacy of different drug-eluting stents (DES) and bare metal stents (BMS) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) using a network meta-analysis.

Background

The relative safety of DES and BMS in patients with STEMI continues to be debated, and whether advances have been made in this regard with second-generation DES is unknown.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing currently U.S. approved DES or DES with BMS in patients with STEMI were searched using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Information on study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample characteristics, and clinical outcomes was extracted.

Results

Twenty-two trials including 12,453 randomized patients were analyzed. At 1-year follow-up, cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stents (CoCr-EES) were associated with significantly lower rates of cardiac death or myocardial infarction (MI) and stent thrombosis (ST) than BMS. Differences in ST were apparent as early as 30 days and were maintained for 2 years. CoCr-EES were also associated with significantly lower rates of 1-year ST than paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES). Sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) were also associated with significantly lower rates of 1-year cardiac death/myocardial infarction than BMS. CoCr-EES, PES, and SES, but not zotarolimus-eluting stents, had significantly lower rates of 1-year target vessel revascularization (TVR) than BMS, with SES also showing lower rates of TVR than PES.

Conclusions

In patients with STEMI, steady improvements in outcomes have been realized with the evolution from BMS to first-generation and now second-generation DES, with the most favorable safety and efficacy profile thus far demonstrated with CoCr-EES.

### Drug-eluting versus bare-metal stents in the treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113oCW9g]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes for drug-eluting stents (DES) and bare-metal stents (BMS) for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

Despite some controversy related to late stent thromboses, DES are approved for use in many patients undergoing stenting. However, there are several types of patients in whom implanting a DES would be regarded as off-label use, and this study compares DES and BMS for one of these groups.

Methods

New York's percutaneous coronary intervention registry was used to identify 772 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI who received BMS and 1,154 STEMI patients who received DES between October 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004. These patients were tracked through December 31, 2005. Mortality, target vessel PCI, and subsequent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery within 2 years of undergoing the procedure were captured. Adverse outcomes were adjusted using proportional hazards methods to account for baseline differences in patients' severity of illness.

Results

The BMS patients had significantly higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] vs. DES = 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21 to 3.34, risk-adjusted mortality = 8.6% vs. 5.0%, p = 0.007) and significantly higher subsequent CABG surgery (adjusted HR vs. DES = 2.33, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.16, risk-adjusted rate = 6.4% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.004) rates. There was no difference by type of DES (adjusted HR for paclitaxel-eluting stent versus sirolimus-eluting stent; mortality 0.72, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.72), subsequent CABG surgery (adjusted HR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.40), and target vessel PCI (adjusted HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.58).

Conclusions

In this observational study, DES were associated with lower mortality and subsequent CABG surgery when used for STEMI patients.

### Are drug-eluting stents any better than bare metal? New evidence in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [^112dJNGV]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has benefitted from the widespread use of evidence-based, protocol-driven management. This is particularly the case in the management of myocardial infarction (MI) with ST elevation (STEMI) where prompt recognition and reperfusion, preferably via percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now a well-established standard of care. The management of ACS without ST elevation (NSTEACS) presents a greater challenge in determining optimal therapy for what is potentially a more nuanced and heterogeneous clinical situation. Uncertainty can occur in relation to risk stratification, the optimal timing and strategy for PCI and in the use of bare metal (BMS) versus drug-eluting (DES) stent.

A new study by Remkes et al published in Open Heart seeks to address the latter. The question is a relevant one and there have been no randomised trials of DES versus BMS looking specifically at the NSTEACS population. Despite seeming to have a milder form of acute coronary disease, with relative rather than total occlusion of a coronary artery, patients with NSTEACS have similar rates of mortality, readmission and revascularisation as patients with STEMI. This demonstrates that this population tends to be older, with more complex coronary disease, more coronary risk factors and greater comorbidity.

### Invasive strategy with intended percutaneous coronary intervention versus conservative treatment in older people with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis [^116TZpT2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The meta‐analysis indicates a potential underuse of PCI in older patients with STEMI in the published literature. PCI was advantageous in short‐ and long‐term survival compared with conservative treatment, but these results were affected by confounding with more unfavorable characteristics in conservatively managed patients.

Surprisingly, the half of the older patients with STEMI not referred for invasive management survived for at least 1 year or longer. This observation in combination with the comparable rate of major bleeding both challenge the ad hoc triage to conservative management in this cohort with more morbidity.

Ultimately, these findings have hypothesis‐generating implications. But they emphasize the limited predictive value of age in the triage of STEMI and that PCI should not be automatically withheld in older patients. There is still demand for a RCT assessing efficacy of PCI in STEMI in older patients, but recruiting of representative patients might be an insuperable challenge.

### Six months versus 12 months dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (DAPT-STEMI): randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority trial [^111LXbWM]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been used primarily to avoid abrupt thrombotic closure of the vessel after stent implantation. The recommended duration of DAPT has been changed in the last decades, particularly after introduction of the first generation drug-eluting stents. The observed high rates of stent thrombosis with these devices motivated the interventional community to extend DAPT to 12 months, although there was a lack of evidence for this approach. The introduction of second generation drug-eluting stents has drastically reduced the risk of stent thrombosis compared with first generation and bare metal stents. Different trials and meta-analyses have shown that shorter DAPT regimens after PCI with second generation drug-eluting stents are equally safe; however, the optimal duration of DAPT remains a matter of debate. Current international guidelines recommend at least six months of DAPT after PCI for stable ischaemic coronary disease and 12 months in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. For acute coronary syndromes this recommendation is derived from two randomised trials. However, the observed benefit was noted only in the first months and may have been biased by the positive influence of upstream preloading with DAPT.

DAPT reduces the risk of thromboembolic events in general, but it is also associated with a higher risk of major bleeding that can sometimes be fatal. The risk of bleeding is unique to each patient and is not always known before PCI, particularly before primary PCI in the setting of a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). So far, no trial has shown that extending DAPT from six to 12 months after primary PCI for STEMI is associated with a meaningful improvement of stent thrombosis and other safety outcomes such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. As the safety and efficacy profiles of second generation drug-eluting stents are superior to those of first generation drug-eluting stents and bare metal stents, and considering the unknown risk of bleeding before primary PCI, it may be appealing to consider a shorter DAPT for patients with STEMI treated with second generation drug-eluting stents.

Therefore, we performed a prospective, randomised trial of six versus 12 months of DAPT after second generation drug-eluting stent implantation in patients presenting with STEMI (DAPT-STEMI trial) to evaluate whether six months of DAPT is non-inferior to 12 months of DAPT, in patients that are event-free at six months follow-up after primary PCI.

Concurrent Changes in Preferred Stent Type and Medications During the Study Period

Almost simultaneously to the introduction of ticagrelor and prasugrel in STEMI, the recommendations for the preferred stent type were changed in the guidelines. 4, 5, 6 Thus, bare metal stents were preferably implemented before 2012 and drug‐eluting stents were used in most elderly patients with STEMI after 2011 in the present study. It can be debated what impact new‐generation stents had on outcome for elderly patients with STEMI undergoing emergency PCI. A meta‐analysis showed that the advantage of drug‐eluting stents over bare metal stents in randomized controlled trials was often mainly generated by including target‐lesion, target‐vessel‐revascularization, or in‐stent‐restenosis events into the composite end points, with no benefit for mortality or reinfarction rates. 20 These findings were confirmed in the NORSTENT (Norwegian Coronary Stent Trial). 21 Because the MACCE definition in the present study did not include target‐lesion/target‐vessel‐revascularization events, confounding by type of stent may not play a decisive role.

There were some differences on comedication between the clopidogrel versus ticagrelor group. β Blockers were more likely to be given in combination with clopidogrel, probably to avoid bradycardias, a known adverse effect of ticagrelor. In contrast, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers as well as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were more likely to be given in combination with ticagrelor.

The role of β‐blocker therapy in survivors of acute MIs is not established, at least not for patients with a preserved ejection fraction. One observational study found a benefit for β‐blocker medication in patients with STEMI at higher risk (eg, advanced age) 22; however, a recently published study by Puymirat et al 23 failed to show a prognostic impact of β‐blocker medication with respect to mortality within 1 year after infarction. Similarly, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, despite their proven prognostic effect in patients with reduced ejection fraction, have failed to have a significant positive impact, if medication is started directly after acute MI. 24

### Efficacy and safety of stents in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^115LTXAW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, no specific drug-eluting stent (DES) has fully proven its superiority over others in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of coronary artery stents in STEMI patients in a patient-level network meta-analysis.

Methods

Eligible studies were dedicated randomized controlled trials comparing different stents in STEMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with at least 12 months of clinical follow-up. Of 19 studies identified from the published data, individual patient data were collected in 15 studies with 10,979 patients representing 87.7% of patients in the overall network of evidence. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiac death, reinfarction, or target lesion revascularization.

Results

Overall, 8,487 (77.3%) of 10,979 STEMI patients were male and the mean age was 60.7 years. At a median follow-up of 3 years, compared with bare-metal stents (BMS), patients treated with paclitaxel-, sirolimus-, everolimus-, or biolimus-eluting stents had a significantly lower risk of the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs]: 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63 to 0.88], 0.65 [95% CI: 0.49 to 0.85], 0.70 [95% CI: 0.53 to 0.91], and 0.66 [95% CI: 0.49 to 0.88], respectively). The risk of primary endpoint was not different between patients treated with BMS and zotarolimus-eluting stents (adjusted HR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.51 to 1.38]). Among patients treated with DES, no significant difference in the risk of the primary outcome was demonstrated. Treatment with second-generation DES was associated with significantly lower risk of definite or probable stent thrombosis compared with BMS (adjusted HR: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.42 to 0.89]) and first-generation DES (adjusted HR: 0.56 [95% CI: 0.36 to 0.88]).

Conclusions

In STEMI patients, DES were superior to BMS with respect to long-term efficacy. No difference in long-term efficacy and safety was observed among specific DES. Second-generation were superior to first-generation DES in reducing stent thrombosis.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) with multivessel disease (MVD) — evidence on multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided strategies: The FIRE trial enrolled 1445 elderly patients (median age, 80 years) with multivessel disease defined by a nonculprit artery with minimum vessel diameter > 2.5 mm and angiography estimated stenosis 50% to 99% and ~65% had NSTE-ACS, and multivessel PCI reduced the risk of MACE as well as all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The SMILE trial enrolled 584 patients and showed that multivessel PCI in a single procedure reduces risk of MACE at 1 year. The BIOVASC trial randomized 1525 patients with ACS (~60% with NSTE-ACS) and found multivessel PCI in a single procedure was noninferior to staged PCI for MACE at 1 year with no evidence of interaction by NSTE-ACS versus STEMI. In FAME, a secondary analysis including 328 NSTE-ACS patients randomized to angiography-guided PCI (if diameter stenosis ≥ 50%) or FFR-guided PCI (if FFR ≤ 0.80) showed FFR-guided PCI reduced the number of stents and incidence of MACE at 2 years. The FRAME-AMI trial enrolled 562 ACS patients (~53% with NSTE-ACS) randomized to FFR-guided PCI (if FFR ≤ 0.80) or angiography-guided PCI (diameter stenosis of > 50%), and FFR-guided PCI reduced the number of stents and risk of MACE at 3.5 years with no evidence of interaction between NSTE-ACS and STEMI.

### Are drug-eluting stents any better than bare metal? New evidence in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [^113gyHCL]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Remkes et al have provided some high-quality data to fill this gap in the evidence base. They report a randomised, multicentre trial with blinding of operator and outcome assessors and independent assessment of clinical and angiographic outcomes. It is a substudy of their ELISA-3 trial into immediate versus delayed revascularisation in patients with NSTEACS with high-risk characteristics. However, it also includes a further registry of patients who consented to clinical but not angiographic follow-up or who were not eligible for ELISA-3. Consequently, 178 patients were included for 9-month angiographic follow-up with a further 296 randomised patients also contributing to 2-year clinical outcomes.

The angiographic outcome, for which the study was powered showed a significantly lower rate of restenosis with DES compared with BMS (minimal lumen diameter 2.37 ± 0.63 vs 1.84 ± 0.62 mm, p < 0.001). Rates of binary restenosis were much lower at 1.9% vs 16.7% (p = 0.01). Among the clinical outcomes, there was a significant reduction in target vessel revascularisation (TVR) with DES at 2 years (4% vs 10.4%, p = 0.009). Differences in the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis (ST) did not reach statistical significance though the study was not powered for these.

Overall, then, this trial seems to provide good evidence supporting the current preference for DES in this setting. Superior performance of the stent over time due to the antiproliferative effect of the stent coating translates into a lower rate of repeat angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery for the vessel. There may even be small but not statistically detectable benefits for clinical outcomes such as mortality and repeat MI. However, it can be dangerous to extrapolate from proxy outcomes (angiographic restenosis) to those of greater importance. The data from this study should therefore be interpreted in light of some further recently published work.

The NORSTENT trial was a large multicentre randomised trial of DES versus BMS in all clinical settings (stable coronary artery disease, NSTEACS and STEMI). In total, 9013 patients were randomised and clinical follow-up was for 6 years. In keeping with the ELISA-3 substudy, rates of TVR were lower with DES (5.3% vs 10.3%, p < 0.001). However, despite this, there was no overall difference in rates of mortality or MI.

### Randomised comparison of drug-eluting versus bare-metal stenting in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^112twbDU]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stent implantation is associated with high restenosis rates as compared to the first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES). The second-generation everolimus-eluting stent (EES) has shown a strong antiproliferative effect with a non-inferior efficacy profile compared to the first-generation DES but with an improved safety profile. While the effect of DE versus BM stenting in ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) populations has been extensively evaluated, consistently showing that the second-generation DES are as safe as bare-metal stents (BMS) in terms of stent thrombosis while reducing restenosis rates, there are no randomised studies comparing DES versus its BMS counterpart in the setting of non-STEMI (NSTEMI). This subset of patients, however, comprises up to 50% of patients included in some stent trials, particularly those with an all-comer design. This evidence has translated into a class I, level of evidence a recommendation in current clinical guidelines for the use of new-generation DES over BMS.

Montalescot et al demonstrated that patients with STEMI and NSTEMI have similar in hospital and long-term prognoses as well as similar independent correlates of outcome, despite different in-hospital management and despite differences in lesion pathology. In STEMI, the culprit artery is usually occluded by a red thrombus, whereas in NSTEMI the culprit artery is usually patent with a non-occlusive white thrombus. Also, patient characteristics differ; the NSTEMI population is older, has a higher cardiovascular risk profile more often with diabetes and hypertension. Patients with NSTEMI have more extensive coronary artery disease than patients with STEMI and more often a personal history of coronary heart disease.

In this randomised study, we focus on the effects of the use of an EES on the incidence of restenosis and on long-term safety in terms of MACE in this population with NSTEMI, treated with either DES or its bare metal counterpart.

### Contemporary revascularization dilemmas in older adults [^113E5K4W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Type of Approach and Stent: Should They Be Different for Older Adults?

Older age has been used as a factor to decide on stent type, as reported in some studies. For instance, in a study analyzing temporal, geographic, and sociodemographic factors associated with use of drug‐eluting stents (DESs) in patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI, after adjusting for clinical variables, older age was associated with a decreased use of DESs compared with bare metal stents (BMSs). 56 However, in the XIMA (Xience or Vision Stents for the Management of Angina in the Elderly) trial comparing DESs with BMSs, it was shown that octogenarians have similar procedural success as the younger patients; the rate of all‐cause mortality, MI (4.3% versus 8.7%; P = 0.01), and target vessel revascularization (2.0% versus 7%; P = 0.001) was significantly lower in DES versus the BMS group. The incidence of major bleeding events did not increase despite longer use of dual antiplatelet therapy in the DES‐treated group versus the BMS group. 57 In the SENIOR (Drug‐Eluting Stents in Elderly Patients With Coronary Artery Disease) trial, outcomes were compared in 1200 patients aged > 75 years who received DESs and BMSs for stable angina, silent ischemia, or ACS. The primary outcome of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (composite of all‐cause mortality, MI, stroke, or ischemia‐driven target revascularization) was compared between the DES and BMS group in an intention‐to‐treat population at 30 days, 180 days, and 1 year. The primary outcome occurred in 12% of patients in the DES group and 16% of patients in the BMS group (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.94; P = 0.02). Both groups infrequently experienced bleeding complications (5% DES versus 5% BMS; RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.51–1.54; P = 0.68) and stent thrombosis (1% DES versus 1% BMS; RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.00–1.48; P = 0.13) at 1 year. 58 Therefore, on the basis of the current limited data, among elderly patients who have PCI, a DES and short duration of dual antiplatelet therapy have been shown to be better than BMS and a short duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in regard to all‐cause mortality, MI, stroke, and ischemia‐driven target lesion revascularization.

### Guidelines for percutaneous coronary interventions. the task force for percutaneous coronary interventions of the European Society of Cardiology [^1158ZqCj]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with stable CAD, PCI can be considered a valuable initial mode of revascularization in all patients with objective large ischaemia in the presence of almost every lesion subset, with only one exception: chronic total occlusions that cannot be crossed. In early studies, there was a small survival advantage with CABG surgery compared with PCI without stenting. The addition of stents and newer adjunctive medications improved the outcome for PCI. The decision to recommend PCI or CABG surgery will be guided by technical improvements in cardiology or surgery, local expertise, and patients' preference. However, until proved otherwise, PCI should be used only with reservation in diabetics with multi-vessel disease and in patients with unprotected left main stenosis. The use of drug-eluting stents might change this situation. Patients presenting with NSTE-ACS (UA or NSTEMI) have to be stratified first for their risk of acute thrombotic complications. A clear benefit from early angiography (< 48 h) and, when needed, PCI or CABG surgery has been reported only in the high-risk groups. Deferral of intervention does not improve outcome. Routine stenting is recommended on the basis of the predictability of the result and its immediate safety. In patients with STEMI, primary PCI should be the treatment of choice in patients presenting in a hospital with PCI facility and an experienced team. Patients with contra-indications to thrombolysis should be immediately transferred for primary PCI, because this might be their only chance for quickly opening the coronary artery. In cardiogenic shock, emergency PCI for complete revascularization may be life-saving and should be considered at an early stage. Compared with thrombolysis, randomized trials that transferred the patients for primary PCI to a 'heart attack centre' observed a better clinical outcome, despite transport times leading to a significantly longer delay between randomization and start of the treatment. The superiority of primary PCI over thrombolysis seems to be especially clinically relevant for the time interval between 3 and 12 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms on the basis of its superior preservation of myocardium. Furthermore, with increasing time to presentation, major-adverse-cardiac-event rates increase after thrombolysis, but appear to remain relatively stable after primary PCI. Within the first 3 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms, both reperfusion strategies seem equally effective in reducing infarct size and mortality. Therefore, thrombolysis is still a viable alternative to primary PCI, if it can be delivered within 3 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms. Primary PCI compared with thrombolysis significantly reduced stroke. Overall, we prefer primary PCI over thrombolysis in the first 3 h of chest pain to prevent stroke, and in patients presenting 3–12 h after the onset of chest pain, to salvage myocardium and also to prevent stroke. At the moment, there is no evidence to recommend facilitated PCI. Rescue PCI is recommended, if thrombolysis failed within 45–60 min after starting the administration. After successful thrombolysis, the use of routine coronary angiography within 24 h and PCI, if applicable, is recommended even in asymptomatic patients without demonstrable ischaemia to improve patients' outcome. If a PCI centre is not available within 24 h, patients who have received successful thrombolysis with evidence of spontaneous or inducible ischaemia before discharge should be referred to coronary angiography and revascularized accordingly — independent of 'maximal' medical therapy.

### Preventive PCI versus culprit lesion stenting during primary PCI in acute STEMI: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116MUEqB]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of culprit coronary artery is the standard of care for patients presenting with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the literature is conflicting regarding the benefit of PCI for significant stenoses in non-infarct arteries after successful primary PCI. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines states that: "Primary PCI should not be performed in a noninfarct artery at the time of primary PCI in patients with STEMI who are hemodynamically stable" and "PCI is reasonable in a noninfarct artery at a time separate from primary PCI in patients with intermediate- or high-risk findings on noninvasive testing". The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines state that PCI for STEMI should be limited to the culprit lesion except in patients with cardiogenic shock.

In congruence with the clinical guidelines, several meta-analyses of observational and non-randomised studies show no benefit from PCI of the non-infarct artery. However, conclusions from these non-randomised and observational studies are limited by the potential for selection bias. A recent randomised clinical trial demonstrated benefit of preventive PCI in acute STEMI. Although this trial demonstrated benefit in the primary end point (composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or refractory angina), there was no benefit in all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. Earlier, two randomised clinical trials also failed to show mortality benefit associated with preventive PCI. Since these studies were not powered individually to assess for mortality, we systematically reviewed the benefit of preventive PCI in a randomised patient population presenting with acute STEMI.

### Incidence, predictors, and clinical impact of early prasugrel cessation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^114txLgC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early withdrawal of recommended antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel adversely affects prognosis following percutaneous coronary interventions. Optimal antiplatelet treatment is essential following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) given the increased risk of thrombotic complications. This study assessed the frequency, predictors, and clinical impact of early prasugrel cessation in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary interventions.

Methods and Results

We pooled patients with STEMI discharged on prasugrel in 2 prospective registries (Bern PCI Registry [NCT02241291] and SPUM-ACS (Inflammation and Acute Coronary Syndromes) [NCT01000701]) and 1 STEMI trial (COMFORTABLE-AMI (Comparison of Biomatrix Versus Gazelle in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) [NCT00962416]). Prasugrel treatment status at 1 year was categorized as no cessation; crossover to another P2Y 12 -inhibitor; physician-recommended discontinuation; and disruption because of bleeding, side effects, or patient noncompliance. In time-dependent analyses, we assessed the impact of prasugrel cessation on the primary end point, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Of all 1830 included patients (17% women, mean age 59 years), 83% were treated with new-generation drug-eluting stents. At 1 year, any prasugrel cessation had occurred in 13.8% of patients including crossover (7.2%), discontinuation (3.7%), and disruption (2.9%). Independent predictors of any prasugrel cessation included female sex, age, and history of cerebrovascular event. The primary end point occurred in 5.2% of patients and was more frequent following disruption (hazard ratio 3.04, 95% confidence interval,1.34–6.91; P = 0.008), without significant impact of crossover or discontinuation. Consistent findings were observed for all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis following prasugrel disruption.

Conclusions

In this contemporary study of patients with STEMI, early prasugrel cessation was not uncommon and primarily involved change to another P2Y 12 -inhibitor. Disruption was the only type of early prasugrel cessation associated with statistically significant excess in ischemic risk within 1 year following primary percutaneous coronary interventions.

### Effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on quality of life: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^115F59e7]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome [NSTE-ACS]) — primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and invasive strategies are associated with fewer adverse events and early quality of life (QoL) gains. In pooled analyses, primary PCI is associated with reduced mortality, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, reinfarction, and recurrent ischemia compared with fibrinolysis, and re-PCI for recurrent nonfatal MI is considerably lower in PCI cohorts than in fibrinolytic-treated patients. For STEMI, use of stent, or intervention with balloon angioplasty is associated with early (i.e., 6 months) improvement in QoL. In NSTE-ACS, a routine invasive strategy reduces the composite risk of death or nonfatal MI, severe angina, and rehospitalization over the ensuing 1–2 years versus an ischemia-guided approach, and compared with a non-invasive strategy, an invasive strategy reduces duration of initial hospital stay, readmission rate, anginal symptoms, and the number of required anti-anginal medications.

### Invasive strategy with intended percutaneous coronary intervention versus conservative treatment in older people with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis [^114yK7je]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This meta‐analysis was conducted using a protocol and reproducible plan for literature search and synthesis. The meta‐analysis was prospectively registered (International Prospective Register of Systematic ReviewsCRD42024551601). It was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis guidelines. Data are available and can be extracted from studies included. We did not obtain ethical approval for this meta‐analysis because we did not collect data from individual human subjects.

The systematic literature search was performed in three data bases including Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy for each database is provided in the Supporting Information Appendix. The first search was performed on May 27, 2024, and the last search update was performed on August 27, 2024. No restrictions on publication date, language, or study size were applied. After exclusion of duplicates and screening of titles and abstracts according to the eligibility criteria, full texts of the remaining articles were assessed. Additional handsearching of screened references was performed. The study selection was independently performed by 2 reviewers (S.M. D.D.). In case of any disagreement, this was resolved by consensus with the senior authors (C.F. T.S.).

Controlled trials comparing invasive strategy with intended primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI group) to conservative strategy (CON group) in patients aged ≥ 80 years with STEMI were considered.

RCTs and nonrandomized controlled studies of interventions (NRSIs) were eligible. In NRSI adjusted data were preferred over crude data whenever eligible. Studies treating patients before Food and Drug Administration approval of coronary stents in 1994 were excluded as they underly an inherent risk of performance bias in the PCI group throughout. This criterion was added as a post hoc adjustment. No other restrictions were applied for specific interventional or conservative treatment strategies, follow‐up duration, or timing of the intervention itself.

Double publications, case reports, case series without control groups, reviews, meta‐analyses and conference abstracts, or posters were excluded. Studies grouping revascularization techniques (eg, PCI and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting) or studies with solely coronary artery bypass grafting revascularization were excluded. Studies including younger patients (< 80 years) and without providing separate reports on outcomes of older patients were excluded.

### Outcome of 1051 octogenarian patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention: observational cohort from the london heart attack group [^115frV13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Western populations are gradually aging. Between 1985 and 2010, the number of people aged > 80 years in the developed world has more than doubled to 53 million, and this trend is predicted to continue. 1 Coronary artery disease is common in elderly patients: An estimated 13% of ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Western cohorts occurs in patients aged > 80 years. 2 Consequently, as the population ages, we can expect to see more elderly patients presenting with STEMI. Furthermore, STEMI in elderly patients is associated with high mortality, estimated to be up to 47% at 1 year, which is unsurprising, given that comorbidities increase with age. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) has been shown to be beneficial in younger patients with STEMI and is increasingly being used in octogenarians. 9 PPCI in octogenarians is associated with improved survival compared with medical therapy alone, albeit often in subgroup analyses; 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 however, advanced age has been associated with worse outcomes after PPCI compared with younger patients in several recent cohort studies. 2, 16, 17, 18, 19 Moreover, there is a paucity of evidence on the optimal management of STEMI in octogenarians as a result of their underrepresentation in clinical trials, the perceived increased risks related to comorbidities, and the presumed limited scope for symptomatic improvement. Nonetheless, there is no upper age limit for offering PPCI in current guidelines. 20, 21

In this large cohort of elderly patients, we aimed to describe the population and their short‐ and long‐term outcomes after PPCI for STEMI. We also compared the clinical outcomes with a younger group of patients, examined changes over time, and investigated any associations between outcome and procedural characteristics.

### Prognosis of PCI in AMI setting in the elderly population: outcomes from the multicenter prospective e-ULTIMASTER registry [^1154qPYP]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Elderly patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are usually excluded from major trials.

Hyopthesis

This study sought to assess 1‐year clinical outcomes following PCI with a drug‐eluting stent in patients older than 80 years old with STEMI.

Methods

The large all‐comer, multicontinental e‐ULTIMASTER registry included 7507 patients with STEMI who underwent PCI using the Ultimaster stent. The primary clinical endpoint was 1‐year target lesion failure, a composite of cardiac death (CD), target vessel‐related myocardial infarction (TV‐MI), or clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD‐TLR).

Results

There were 457 (6.1%) patients in the elderly group (≥ 80 years old) that were compared to 7050 (93.9%) patients < 80 years. The elderly patients included more female patients and had significantly more comorbidities and had more complex coronary anatomy. The primary endpoint occurred in 7.2% of the elderly, compared to 3.1% of the younger group (p < .001). All‐cause mortality was significantly higher among the elderly group compared to the younger group (10.1% vs. 2.3%, p < .0001), as well as CD (6.1% vs. 1.6%, p < .0001), but not TV‐MI (1.1% vs. 0.7%, p = .34) or CD‐TLR (1.1% vs. 1.4%, p = .63).

Conclusion

Elderly patients with STEMI presentation had a higher incidence of the composite endpoint than younger patients. All‐cause and CD were higher for elderly patients compared to patients younger than 80 years old. However, there was no difference in the incidence of TV‐MI or target lesion revascularizations. These findings suggest that PCI for STEMI in elderly patients is relatively safe.

### Natural history and clinical outcomes after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction without stent insertion [^113XEQwb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

After restoration of coronary perfusion in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), discrete severe stenotic coronary lesions are not always apparent. There remains ambiguity whether drug-eluting stent (DES) insertion or initial medical management is best practice. We sought to assess short-term clinical outcomes in patients presenting with STEMI without initial stent insertion. Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI between 2014 and 2020 were prospectively enrolled and assessed for inclusion. Patients presenting with in-stent restenosis or stent thrombosis, or who did not survive to hospital discharge were excluded. Of 13,871 patients presenting, 456 (3.3%) were treated without initial stenting. These patients were older than those treated with DES (66.1 ± 13.6 vs 62.3 ± 12.4 years, p < 0.001), had higher rates of diabetes (23.5% vs 16.0%, p < 0.001) and previous revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention (14.0% vs 7.3%, p < 0.001) or coronary artery bypass graft (3.5% vs 1.8%, p = 0.008). Thirty-day mortality was elevated in patients treated without stenting compared to those receiving DES (4.2% vs 0.9%, p < 0.001), as were rates of myocardial infarction (1.3% vs 0.5%, p = 0.026) and major adverse cardiac events (10.5% vs 2.4%, p < 0.001). After propensity matching, a trend toward increased mortality remained (4.2% vs 2.0%, p = 0.055). In conclusion, a no-stenting initial strategy, compared with DES insertion, is associated with increased 30-day mortality in those presenting with STEMI without severe stenosis. These data suggest when appropriate, current-generation DES insertion should be undertaken.

Regarding quality improvement for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to healthcare system and hospital requirements, pre-hospital settings, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to ensure that:

- pre-hospital management of patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI is based on regional networks designed to deliver reperfusion therapy expeditiously and effectively, with efforts made to make primary PCI available to as many patients as possible

- patients transferred for primary PCI bypassing the emergency department and coronary care unit/ICU and are transferred directly to the catheterization laboratory

- emergency medical services transfer patients with suspected STEMI to a PCI-capable center bypassing non-PCI centers

- strategies are in place to facilitate the transfer of all patients with suspected ACS after resuscitated cardiac arrest directly to a hospital offering 24/7 primary PCI via one specialized emergency medical service

- ambulance teams are trained and equipped to identify ECG patterns suggestive of acute coronary occlusion and to administer initial therapy, including defibrillation and fibrinolysis when applicable

- all emergency medical services participating in the care of patients with suspected STEMI record and audit delay times and work together to achieve and maintain quality targets.

### Early invasive therapy or conservative management for… [^111L34gQ]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical Question How effective is early invasive treatment of patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction compared with conservative management. Evidence-Based Answer Compared with conservative management, early invasive treatment of patients with UA or NSTEMI using coronary angiography with or without revascularization reduces rehospitalization and refractory angina within the first year and significantly reduces mortality and myocardial infarction at two to five years. Patients undergoing early invasive treatment are more likely to have short-term complications such as bleeding and procedure-related myocardial infarction.

1. 2 Patients with NSTEMI have elevated cardiac enzymes, whereas those with UA do not. Emergency coronary angiography followed by appropriate stenting or coronary artery bypass grafting has become the preferred treatment for STEMI.

For patients with UA or NSTEMI, there are two treatment strategies: routine coronary angiography or conservative management. The authors of this Cochrane review examined the evidence to determine whether emergent coronary angiography is more beneficial than conservative management for patients with UA or NSTEMI. Objectives: To determine the benefits of an invasive compared with a conservative strategy for treating UA/NSTEMI in the stent era. Search Strategy: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and EMBASE were searched from 1996 to September 2005 with no language restrictions. The authors conclude that an early invasive strategy is preferable to a conservative management strategy in the treatment of patients with UA or NSTEMI; however, the absolute difference between strategies in long-term mortality was not large.

Forty-three people would need to be treated with an early invasive strategy to prevent one death at two to five years, and a comparable number of patients will experience bleeding or procedure-related myocardial infarction. 3 In addition, future studies should include more women and have longer durations. For now, the most current practice guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force give Level of Evidence A to an early invasive strategy in patients with UA or NSTEMI.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

### 10-year outcomes of deferred or conventional stent implantation in patients with STEMI (DANAMI-3-DEFER) [^114YMuvT]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting is recommended in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Immediate stenting may cause distal embolization, microvascular damage, and flow disturbances, leading to adverse outcomes. We report the 10-year clinical outcomes of deferred stenting versus conventional PCI in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.

Methods

We conducted a 10-year follow-up study of the open-label, randomized DANAMI-3-DEFER trial (Third Danish Study of Optimal Acute Treatment of Patients With STEMI - Deferred Stent Implantation Versus Conventional Treatment), conducted in 4 PCI centers in Denmark. Patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction and acute chest pain < 12 hours were randomized to deferred stenting > 24 hours after the index procedure or conventional PCI with immediate stenting. In the deferred group, immediate stable Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow II to III was established, and intravenous administration of either a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist or bivalirudin for > 4 hours after the index procedure was recommended. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalization for heart failure or all-cause mortality. Key secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary outcome and target vessel revascularization.

Results

Of 1215 patients, 603 were randomized to deferred stenting and 612 to conventional PCI. After 10 years, deferred stenting did not significantly reduce the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.67–1.02]; P = 0.08). In the deferred group, 124 (24%) died versus 150 (25%) in the conventional PCI group (hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.75–1.19]). Hospitalization for heart failure was lower in patients treated with deferred stenting compared with conventional PCI (odds ratio, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.39–0.88]). Target vessel revascularization was similar in both groups (odds ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.81–1.79]).

Conclusions

Deferred stenting did not reduce all-cause mortality or the composite primary outcome after 10 years but reduced hospitalization for heart failure compared with conventional PCI.

### Safety and effectiveness of drug eluting stent in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty [^1132yoKK]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Drug eluting stents (DES) have recently been proven to further reduce restenosis and revascularization rate in comparison to bare metal stents in elective procedures. Most early DES trials did not include patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation MI, because these patients tend to have lower restenosis rates than other patient groups and delayed endothelization of these stents raises concern about a possible increase of thrombotic complications in the setting of STEMI.

Aim

To confirm the safety and effectiveness of DES in patients with STEMI in a real-world scenario.

Methods

From January 2004 to December 2006, clinical and angiographic data of 370 patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI have been analyzed. Patients were retrospectively followed for the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE): death, reinfarction and target vessel revascularization (TVR).

Results

Overall, 120 patients received DES (32%, DES group) and 250 received bare metal stents (68%, BMS group) in the infarct related artery. Compared with the BMS group, DES patients were younger, (mean age 56 ± 12 vs. 65 ± 10; P < 0.001) had more often diabetes mellitus (47% vs. 14% P < 0.001), anterior localization (65% vs. 45%; P < 0.0011) and less cardiogenic shock at admission (4% vs. 7%; P < 0.001). The angiographic characteristics in the DES group showed longer lesions (23 mm vs. 19 mm) and smaller diameter of vessels (2.5 mm vs. 3.0 mm). After a median follow-up of 24 ± 9 months, there was no significant difference in the rate of stent thrombosis (1.6% in the DES group vs. 1.2% in the BMS group, P = ns). The incidence of MACE was significantly lower in the DES group compared with the BMS group (HR 0.56 [95% CI: 0.3–0.8]; P = 0.01), principally due to the lower rate of TVR (HR 0.41 [95% CI: 0.2–0.85]; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Utilization of DES in the setting of primary PCI for STEMI, in our "real world", was safe and improved the 3-year clinical outcome compared with BMS reducing the need of TVR.

### Updated evidence on selection and implementation of an invasive treatment strategy for older patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111LmMbP]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is the most common acute coronary syndrome diagnosis in older patients. In the UK, there are ~20000 NSTEMI cases annually in patients aged ≥ 75 years. Despite therapeutic advances in pharmacological and invasive management, studies show that older patients with NSTEMI experience worse in-hospital and long-term outcomes than younger patients, suggesting a clear need for robust evidence in this cohort. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend that invasive management should be considered holistically with no specified age cut-offs. However, older patients are less likely to receive invasive management due to a paucity of evidence from trials that represent contemporary clinical characteristics of older adults. Recruiting older patients realistic of those encountered in clinical practice is hugely challenging. Chronological age alone does not reflect the heterogeneity of the older population; ~30% of older patients with NSTEMI are frail, ~65% are cognitively impaired and most live with at least two additional comorbidities that can influence risk. Weighing the risk of an NSTEMI in an older adult against competing risks attributable to underlying frailty, comorbidities and cognitive impairment poses a key challenge. Recently, the SENIOR-RITA trial showed that invasive management in older patients with NSTEMI is safe and reduces non-fatal myocardial infarction and subsequent revascularisation but does not improve mortality. Individualised risk assessment and shared decision-making is necessary to guide these nuanced decisions. This review discusses the latest evidence regarding invasive management in the older population with NSTEMI, including the impact of geriatric syndromes on clinical outcomes.

### Drug coated balloon in young patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a viable treatment option? [^116g2Amw]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The concept of drug coated balloon (DCB) was initially developed to address restenosis associated with implanted intracoronary stents. Additionally, it offers advantages such as the absence of a permanent metallic implant and improved vasomotion. Based on solid level of evidence it has been widely accepted across scientific community for treatment of in‐stent restenosis and small vessel disease. Although there is evidence of non‐inferiority compared with drug eluting stents (DES) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) DES are preferred and recommended treatment strategy in patients with ACS from European Society of Cardiology (ESC Guidelines).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to consider performing CABG over PCI in older patients with NSTEMI being appropriate candidates, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus or complex 3-vessel coronary artery disease (such as SYNTAX score > 22), with or without involvement of the proximal LAD, to reduce CVD events and readmission and to improve survival.

### Stent thrombosis up to 3 years after stenting for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction versus for stable angina – comparison of the effects of drug-eluting versus bare-metal stents [^115wAsPj]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term safety of drug-eluting stents (DES) for the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unclear and may differ from that in stable angina (stable) patients as noted in autopsy studies.

Methods

To assess this problem, 210 consecutive STEMI and 323 stable patients, randomized 2:1 to DES versus bare-metal stents (BMS), were followed up for 3 years for definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and cardiac death/myocardial infarction. Events occurring during the initial 6 months were separated from later events.

Results

The 3-year rate of ST was 8.1% in STEMI vs 3.4% in stable patients (P = 0.02), with corresponding rates of 9.4% vs 2.9% (P = 0.01) for DES and of 5.6% vs 4.3% (P = 0.71) for BMS patients, respectively. This difference appeared only after 6 months: 4.6% in STEMI vs 1.7% in stable patients (P = 0.05) and in DES-treated patients (6.2% vs 2.0%, P = 0.05). Results of ST were paralleled by findings of clinical events, although here differences were less pronounced, but also seen only late after stenting. Thus, in STEMI patients, late events occurred more frequently after DES vs BMS implantation (11.6% vs 3.0%, P = 0.04), compared to results in stable patients (DES 6.4%, BMS 1.9%, P = 0.08).

Conclusions

In this pilot study, we observed an increased rate of late ST and a trend to more related clinical events in patients after stenting for STEMI vs for stable angina, particularly if treated with DES. This may explain outcome differences between results of pivotal trials in stable patients vs those of "real-world" patients.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1136eU9A]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Revascularization in ST–segment–elevation MI (STEMI) — reperfusion strategies and epidemiology in older adults: In the United States, ≈780 000 people experience an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) each year, 30% of whom have STEMI, and 30% of all patients admitted with STEMI are ≥ 75 years of age. Using national inpatient data for PCI in patients ≥ 90 years of age (2003–2014), the representation of nonagenarians among all PCI hospitalizations increased more than 2-fold (0.60% to 1.4%; Ptrend < 0.001), and the proportion of PCIs performed for STEMI increased from 23.1% to 30.9% (Ptrend < 0.001); by 2050, adults > 75 years will number ≈46 million, representing 11.5% of the US population. In the APEX–AMI trial, among 5745 patients, those > 75 years (n = 977) were significantly less likely to achieve angiographic success after primary PCI (pPCI), had less frequent ST-segment resolution, and had higher rates of in-hospital bleeding, electrical, and mechanical complications than patients < 65 years; in multivariate analysis, age was the strongest predictor of death at 90 days (hazard ratio, 2.07 per 10-year increase [95% CI, 1.84–2.33]), and patients > 75 years were almost 6 times more likely to die within 90 days (5.64 [4.20–7.56]; P < 0.001). Older patients are more likely to present with atypical symptoms and delays to first medical contact, and studies have consistently demonstrated that older patients are less likely to receive reperfusion and other guideline-directed medical therapies.

### Impact of advanced age on the safety and effectiveness of paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty: the HORIZONS-AMI trial [^115PEAjF]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the impact of age on safety and efficacy of paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) implantation during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

The benefits of paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) implantation during primary PCI were confirmed by the long-term results of the HORIZONS-AMI trial. Whether the effects of PES are independent of age has not been reported.

Methods

Data on 3,006 patients from the HORIZONS-AMI study randomized in a 3:1 ratio to PES or bare-metal stent (BMS) in whom at least one stent was implanted were assessed. There were 2,302 (76.6%) patients < 70, and 704 patients ≥ 70 years of age.

Results

At 3 years, among older patients a trend toward lower risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; death from any cause, stroke, reinfarction and unplanned revascularization for ischemia) related to PES use was observed (PES vs. BMS: 18.0% vs. 21.3%; P = 0.07). There was also a trend for reduction of MACE related to PES in older patients (26.4% vs. 33.1%; P = 0.09). Both, patients < 70 and ≥ 70 years of age treated with PES were at lower risk for ischemic target vessel revascularization. However, a higher risk of major bleeding in elderly patients treated with PES was observed (P = 0.02 for interaction between age group and PES effects). No interaction between age and stent type in terms of the risk of other clinical end points, including all-cause death, was confirmed.

Conclusions

For STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI, the implantation of PES as compared with BMS reduced ischemic TVR, and this effect was independent of age.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1115ND2q]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) with multivessel disease — evidence on multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided strategies: The FIRE trial enrolled 1445 elderly patients (median age, 80 years) with multivessel disease (nonculprit artery minimum vessel diameter > 2.5 mm; angiography stenosis 50% to 99%) and ~65% had NSTE-ACS, and multivessel PCI reduced the risk of MACE and reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The SMILE trial enrolled 584 patients and showed that a single-procedure multivessel PCI reduces risk of MACE at 1 year driven by lower revascularization. The BIOVASC trial randomized 1525 ACS patients (~60% NSTE-ACS) and found single-procedure multivessel PCI was noninferior to staged PCI for MACE at 1 year without interaction by NSTE-ACS versus STEMI. In a FAME secondary analysis of 328 NSTE-ACS with multivessel disease, FFR-guided PCI (FFR ≤ 0.80) versus angiography-guided PCI (diameter stenosis ≥ 50%) reduced stent number and MACE at 2 years. In FAMOUS-NSTEMI, 350 NSTE-ACS with multivessel disease were randomized to FFR-guided PCI (FFR ≤ 0.80) or angiography-guided PCI (diameter stenosis > 30%), FFR-guided PCI reduced revascularization at 1 year; the trial was prematurely terminated and enrolled < 50% of the planned 1292 patients. In FRAME-AMI, 562 ACS patients with multivessel disease (~53% NSTE-ACS) randomized to FFR-guided PCI (FFR ≤ 0.80) or angiography-guided PCI (diameter stenosis > 50%) showed FFR-guided PCI reduced stent number and MACE at 3.5 years with no evidence of interaction between NSTE-ACS and STEMI.

### Treatment choices in elderly patients with ST: elevation myocardial infarction-insights from the vital heart response registry [^116ThmAo]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The demographic shift with increasingly aging population, results in higher incidence of elderly patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Significant age-associated heterogeneity in baseline characteristics has been described to account for some of the differences in mortality from acute myocardial infarction (MI) in subgroups of elderly patients. There is a gap between the evidence from ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) randomised controlled trials (RCT's) and real life due to under-representation of elderly patients in these trials. The proportion of patients eligible for reperfusion strategy decreases with advancing age and elderly patients are still less likely to receive reperfusion even if eligible. Furthermore data suggests that morbidity and mortality from STEMI is higher in elderly compared to younger patients. With the existing reperfusion therapies there is still uncertainty about their use in the elderly despite evidence for mortality benefit for both fibrinolysis and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) from RCTs and registries. Accordingly, we compared the baseline characteristics, reperfusion strategies and outcomes between elderly (≥ 75 years of age) and younger patients within an inclusive 'real world registry'. Additionally, we assessed the outcomes according to the reperfusion strategy used specific to the elderly group.

### Randomised comparison of drug-eluting versus bare-metal stenting in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^111xst2y]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

A large meta-analysis in 2007 comparing BMS and first-generation DES strengthened concerns about late and very late stent thrombosis with paclitaxel-eluting stents. Recently, however, it has been shown that second-generation polymers (ie, polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene (PVDF-HFP)) used in current DES provide a more biocompatible surface than early-generation polymersand Kolandaivelu et al showed in a controlled model of early ST that drug-eluting polymer-coated stents are even consistently less, not more, thrombogenic than matched bare metal platforms.

Continuous refinement in stent design and the development of thinner stent struts has resulted in significantly lower rates of stent thrombosis; thus nowadays even larger sample sizes are required to accurately estimate differences between stents and as such many RCTs are presently underpowered for this endpoint. For this reason, Palmerini et al conducted a large network meta-analysis of RCTs comparing the risk of thrombosis between bare-metal, first-generation and second-generation DES. They reported a profound reduction of stent thrombosis with cobalt-chromium EES, compared with other DES as well as with BMS at 2-year follow-up. These findings were corroborated by the results of another meta-analysis of 4896 patients comparing the cobalt-chromium EES with its uncoated otherwise identical metallic counterpart, showing improvement in cardiovascular outcomes including cardiac survival, MI and overall stent thrombosis with the cobalt-chromium EES.

The issue of restenosis is often thought of as trivial, not having any influence at clinical end points, but there is evidence that in ∼10% of cases, patients with in-stent restenosis present with reMI instead of just angina.

In our study, restenosis rates were highly significantly lower in the EES group at 9 months angiographic follow-up, which is consistent with findings in previous trials.

Our study, however, is the first randomised trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of second-generation DES in a NSTEMI population. Patients with NSTEMI differ from those with STEMI. In STEMI, the culprit artery is usually occluded by a thrombus, whereas in NSTEMI the culprit artery is usually patent with a non-occlusive thrombus, but both conditions stem from the same pathophysiological process. Thereby, patients with STEMI are older and have more comorbidity as compared to patients with STEMI, reflecting their worse long-term clinical outcome. This study shows that DE stenting in this patient population is safe and improves long-term target vessel revascularisation.

### Invasive strategy with intended percutaneous coronary intervention versus conservative treatment in older people with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis [^115KkvgY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The present meta‐analysis comprehensively assessed efficacy and safety of an invasive triage with intended PCI compared with conservative treatment in older patients with STEMI. The main and novel findings were:
The minority of the older patients with STEMI (31%) were triaged to invasive strategy with PCI; these data are dominated by all‐comer registries with reduced quality of evidence
PCI was associated with a more favorable overall survival and short‐ and long‐term mortality, but patients referred for PCI were specifically selected as candidates for reperfusion indicating confounding
Every second patient in CON group survived for 1 year or longer despite the deprivation of PCI
There was no difference in major bleeding between PCI and CON indicating an acceptable risk profile
Heart failure hospitalizations and any hospitalizations were more likely in PCI group

In patients with STEMI the triage to invasive strategy including PCI represents the standard of care. This contemporary STEMI guideline recommendation is independent of age. Accordingly, preexisting observational reports proved technical feasibility of PCI and showed acceptable short‐ and midterm survival in older patients with STEMI. In addition, PCI was superior to fibrinolysis in older patients with AMI. These findings support that PCI might be preferred over other treatment strategies even in older patients with STEMI. Nonetheless, the present systematic analysis indicates an underuse of PCI in older patients in the published literature. This discrepancy was mostly driven by national registries reporting on nonagenarians. Ageism might be hypothesized, but the individual reasons against invasive management remain unclear in study‐level meta‐analysis. Some authors clarified the decision‐making process. The predominant reasons to not triage older patients to invasive strategy were age, cognitive impairment, known comorbidities, cardiogenic shock, or resuscitation. Additionally, impaired functional status, frailty, impaired mobility, or admission from residential care were reported. This emphasized that the CON group had an inherent risk of worse outcome reflecting clinical variation between the groups. Consequently, the advantageous overall survival following invasive triage to PCI was an expected finding and the positive selection process in this group might have even intensified the observed outcome difference.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the stent thrombosis (ST) rate up to 3 years in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with new-generation drug-eluting stents (n-DES) compared with bare-metal stents (BMS) and old-generation drug-eluting stents (o-DES) enrolled in the SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry).

Methods

From January 2007 to January 2013, 34,147 patients with STEMI were treated by PCI with n-DES (n = 4,811), o-DES (n = 4,271), or BMS (n = 25,065). The risks of early/late (up to 1 year) and very late definite ST (after 1 year) were estimated.

Results

Cox regression landmark analysis showed a significantly lower risk of early/late ST in patients treated with n-DES (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43 to 0.99; p = 0.04) and o-DES (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.89; p = 0.01) compared with the BMS group. The risk of very late ST was similar between the n-DES and BMS groups (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 0.78 to 2.98; p = 0.21), whereas a higher risk of very late ST was observed with o-DES compared with BMS (HR: 2.88; 95% CI: 1.70 to 4.89; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Patients treated with n-DES have a lower risk of early/late ST than patients treated with BMS. The risk of very late ST is low and comparable between n-DES and BMS up to 3 years of follow-up, whereas o-DES treatment is associated with an increased risk of very late ST. The current STEMI guidelines might require an update in light of the results of this and other recent studies.

### Effects on mortality of abciximab in ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention including stent implantation [^111gsnDa]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of abciximab on mortality in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) including stent implantation.

Design

Meta-analysis of three selected randomized studies and analysis of data from the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR).

Subjects

Pooled data from randomized studies containing in total 1,736 patients undergoing PCI with stent implantation because of STEMI with duration between symptom and treatment < 12 h, and 7,436 patients from SCAAR treated with PCI because of STEMI (52% treated with abciximab) in Sweden 2000–2004.

Results

Analyses of pooled data showed that abciximab was associated with a decreased risk of reinfarction [odds ratio (OR) 0.38] and urgent target vessel revascularization (OR 0.38) at 30 days. No effect was seen on mortality at 30 days or 6 months. Multivariate analysis of data from SCAAR showed that abciximab reduced the risk of death during 14 months of follow-up (hazard ratio 0.82).

Conclusions

The results are encouraging and support the ACC/AHA and ESC recommendation to use abciximab in treatment of STEMI with PCI including stent implantation. Considering that the pooled results from previous trials showed no effect of abciximab on mortality and the registry part of the present study was observational, the results encourage carrying out new randomized studies of abciximab in STEMI treated with PCI, including stent implantation, with sufficient size and length of follow-up.

### Primary angioplasty with routine stenting compared with thrombolytic therapy in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction [^115TWW8c]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Prior studies have yielded conflicting data on the advantage of primary angioplasty compared with thrombolysis in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These studies, however, were performed before the contemporary widespread use of intracoronary stents and glycoprotien IIb/IIIa antagonists.

Methods

We prospectively compared the outcome of 130 consecutive elderly patients (aged ≥ 70 years) with ST-elevation AMI who were admitted to 2 similar neighboring medical centers. Patients were assigned to receive either thrombolytic therapy with accelerated tissue-type plasminogen activator (center I) or primary angioplasty with routine stenting (center II).

Results

Of the patients assigned to receive primary angioplasty, 91% underwent stenting. At 6 months, patients treated with primary angioplasty, compared with those treated with thrombolytic therapy, had a lower incidence of reinfarction (2% vs 14%, P = 0.053) and revascularization for recurrent ischemia (9% vs 61%, P < .001) and a significant reduction in the prespecified combined end point of death, reinfarction, or revascularization for recurrent ischemia (29% vs 93%, P < .01). Primary angioplasty remained an independent predictor of the triple combined end point after controlling for potential covariables (relative risk 0.63, 95% CI 0.38–0.84). Major bleeding complications were also significantly reduced in the primary angioplasty group (0% vs 17%, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Compared with thrombolysis, primary angioplasty with routine stenting in elderly patients with AMI is associated with better clinical outcomes and a lower risk of bleeding complications.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to indications for primary PCI, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to decide on revascularization strategy (infarct-related artery PCI, multivessel PCI/CABG) in patients with multivessel disease based on the patient's clinical status and comorbidities and their disease complexity according to the principles of management of myocardial revascularization.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction excluded from the harmonizing outcomes with revascularization and stents in acute myocardial infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial [^112CyCvb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials assessing new drugs and devices tend to exclude subjects who are at greatest risk. The Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial incorporated broader inclusion criteria in an attempt to include a more representative spectrum of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). To identify the differences between this modern trial and the real world, we analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of patients with STEMI who were screened but not enrolled at a high-volume recruiting center. Of 318 consecutive patients with STEMI who were screened, 200 (62.9%) were randomized, and 118 (37.1%) were excluded. The baseline characteristics and 30-day and 1-year clinical outcomes were compared in the 2 groups. The excluded patients had numerous high-risk features compared to those randomized, including being older (67.0 ± 12.8 vs 63.0 ± 11.4 years, p = 0.004), more often had had a previous MI (34.7% vs 8.0%, p < 0.001), Killip class III-IV (27.4% vs 4.0%, p < 0.001), and lower hemoglobin (13.4 ± 2.3 vs 14.8 ± 1.5 g/dl, p < 0.001). The excluded patients had markedly greater 30-day and 1-year rates of all-cause mortality (17.4% vs 2.0%, p < 0.001, and 27.6% vs 2.5%, p < 0.001, respectively), major adverse cardiovascular events (death, MI, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, and stroke), major bleeding, and net adverse clinical events (major adverse cardiovascular events or major bleeding). On multivariate analysis, Killip class III-IV at presentation, age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 were independent predictors of outcome. In conclusion, despite the broadened entry criteria of the HORIZONS-AMI trial, 37.1% of all patients presenting with STEMI at a center with a high rate of enrollment were judged to be ineligible and were excluded. The excluded patients had a significantly greater risk profile and markedly increased mortality and adverse events compared to the trial-eligible group.

### 10-year outcomes of deferred or conventional stent implantation in patients with STEMI (DANAMI-3-DEFER) [^111gBuPe]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) caused by plaque rupture and thrombus formation, timely percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including stenting, is the recommended treatment to secure coronary blood flow and prevent re-occlusion. However, stenting may cause distal embolization with microvascular obstruction and subsequently reduced coronary blood flow. – These complications are associated with larger infarcts and the potential development of heart failure, with a subsequent poor prognosis; in addition, no protective therapy has been shown to be effective.– Notably, omitting stenting may, in selected patients with STEMI, be an alternative to stenting to avoid procedure-related complications.

Myocardial protection to preserve the integrity of the left ventricle in relation to the restoration of blood flow has been investigated by strategies such as deferred stenting and distal protection.– Thus, delaying stenting after securing a stable blood flow has been shown to decrease the incidence of flow disturbances and distal embolization. Nevertheless, this effect did not translate into reduced myocardial damage or improved short-term clinical outcomes. –, Moreover, leaving a culprit lesion without stenting may increase the risk of acute re-occlusion.

The DANAMI-3-DEFER trial (Third Danish Study of Optimal Acute Treatment of Patients With STEMI – Deferred Stent Implantation Versus Conventional Treatment) investigated the effect of deferred stenting versus conventional PCI in 1215 patients with STEMI. During a median of 42 months, the primary outcome of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, recurrent myocardial infarction, or unplanned target vessel revascularization did not differ between the 2 treatment groups. As a result, the routine use of deferred stenting is discouraged in the European guidelines.

This 10-year follow-up study of DANAMI-3-DEFER examines the long-term outcomes of deferred stenting versus conventional PCI with immediate stenting. In addition, as 84 (14%) patients did not receive a stent, we also evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients with STEMI treated without stenting.

### Comparison of newer-generation drug-eluting with bare-metal stents in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a pooled analysis of the EXAMINATION (clinical evaluation of the xience-V stent in acute myocardial INfArcTION) and COMFORTABLE-AMI (comparison of biolimus eluted from an erodible stent coating with bare metal stents in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction) trials [^115soZvB]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to study the efficacy and safety of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with bare-metal stents (BMS) in an appropriately powered population of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

Among patients with STEMI, early generation DES improved efficacy but not safety compared with BMS. Newer-generation DES, everolimus-eluting stents, and biolimus A9-eluting stents, have been shown to improve clinical outcomes compared with early generation DES.

Methods

Individual patient data for 2,665 STEMI patients enrolled in 2 large-scale randomized clinical trials comparing newer-generation DES with BMS were pooled: 1,326 patients received a newer-generation DES (everolimus-eluting stent or biolimus A9-eluting stent), whereas the remaining 1,329 patients received a BMS. Random-effects models were used to assess differences between the 2 groups for the device-oriented composite endpoint of cardiac death, target-vessel reinfarction, and target-lesion revascularization and the patient-oriented composite endpoint of all-cause death, any infarction, and any revascularization at 1 year.

Results

Newer-generation DES substantially reduce the risk of the device-oriented composite endpoint compared with BMS at 1 year (relative risk [RR]: 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43 to 0.79; p = 0.0004). Similarly, the risk of the patient-oriented composite endpoint was lower with newer-generation DES than BMS (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.96; p = 0.02). Differences in favor of newer-generation DES were driven by both a lower risk of repeat revascularization of the target lesion (RR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.52; p < 0.0001) and a lower risk of target-vessel infarction (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.92; p = 0.03). Newer-generation DES also reduced the risk of definite stent thrombosis (RR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.75; p = 0.006) compared with BMS.

Conclusions

Among patients with STEMI, newer-generation DES improve safety and efficacy compared with BMS throughout 1 year. It remains to be determined whether the differences in favor of newer-generation DES are sustained during long-term follow-up.

### Acute coronary care in the elderly, part II: ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association council on clinical cardiology: in collaboration with the society of geriatric cardiology [^114pHY1B]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Age is an important determinant of outcomes for patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, community practice reveals a disproportionately lower use of cardiovascular medications and invasive treatment even among elderly patients who would stand to benefit. Limited trial data are available to guide care of older adults, which results in uncertainty about benefits and risks, particularly with newer medications or invasive treatments and in the setting of advanced age and complex health status.

Methods and Results

Part II of this American Heart Association scientific statement summarizes evidence on presentation and treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction in relation to age (< 65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and ≥ 85 years). The purpose of this statement is to identify areas in which the evidence is sufficient to guide practice in the elderly and to highlight areas that warrant further study. Treatment-related benefits should rise in an elderly population, yet data to confirm these benefits are limited, and the heterogeneity of older populations increases treatment-associated risks. Elderly patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction more often have relative and absolute contraindications to reperfusion, so eligibility for reperfusion declines with age, and yet elderly patients are less likely to receive reperfusion even if eligible. Data support a benefit from reperfusion in elderly subgroups up to age 85 years. The selection of reperfusion strategy is determined more by availability, time from presentation, shock, and comorbidity than by age. Additional data are needed on selection and dosing of adjunctive therapies and on complications in the elderly. A "one-size-fits-all" approach to care in the oldest old is not feasible, and ethical issues will remain even in the presence of adequate evidence. Nevertheless, if the contributors to treatment benefits and risks are understood, guideline-recommended care may be applied in a patient-centered manner in the oldest subset of patients.

Conclusions

Few trials have adequately described treatment effects in older patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. In the future, absolute and relative risks for efficacy and safety in age subgroups should be reported, and trials should make efforts to enroll the elderly in proportion to their prevalence among the treated population. Outcomes of particular relevance to the older adult, such as quality of life, physical function, and independence, should also be evaluated, and geriatric conditions unique to this age group, such as frailty and cognitive impairment, should be considered for their influence on care and outcomes. With these efforts, treatment risks can be minimized, and benefits can be placed within the health context of the elderly patient.

### Deferred versus immediate stenting in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FAuuK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Search Results

The literature search yielded 2996 potentially relevant articles (Figure 1). Through a review of titles and abstracts, 2962 articles were excluded for being duplicated or not relevant. The remaining 34 full‐text articles were reviewed and assessed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ultimately, 9 articles 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta‐analysis (Figure 1), yielding a total of 2175 patients. Among them, 3 studies (1456 patients) were RCTs, and the other 6 studies (719 patients) were observational studies.

Figure 1
Flowchart of the study selection procedure.

Study Characteristics

The baseline characteristics of individual studies were summarized in Table 2. Trials varied from each other with respect to sample size. The smallest of the studies included only 74 subjects. The largest trial enrolled 1214 subjects. Most participants were males with an average age varying from 57.5 to 68 years between studies. Of all patients 30% to 56% had hypertension, 7.5% to 27% had diabetes, 3% to 28% had a history of prior MI, and 34.5% to 74% were smokers. The deferral interval between the initial reperfusion and stent implantation was quite different in each study and ranged from 4 hours to 7 days. The follow‐up period ranged from 6 months to 2 years except for 3 studies that had no postdischarge events reported. The quality scales of these studies are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

### Safety and efficacy of drug-eluting stent for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in an unselected consecutive cohort [^114jUGWV]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical outcome of a large cohort of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with drug-eluting stents (DES) compared to bare metal stents (BMS).

Background

Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that PCI with the routine use of DES is safe and effective in patients with STEMI. However as randomized trials have strict inclusion criteria, further studies in unselected patient populations are needed.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of the Mayo Clinic PCI database. A total of 552 consecutive STEMI patients who underwent a DES implantation between May 2003 and April 2006 were included in the study and compared to 557 who had BMS for STEMI earlier. No specific patient subsets were excluded.

Results

Procedural success was achieved in 532 patients (96%). During initial hospitalization, 16 patients (2.9%) died and 8 (1.5%) suffered from a recurrent myocardial infarction. The median follow-up was 23 months (IQR: 13–27 months). At 12 months post discharge, the rate of target lesion revascularization and death were 2.9% and 3.7%, respectively, and survival free of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 90.9%. These rates were similar to or lower than those of patients treated for STEMI with BMS prior to the availability of DES.

Conclusion

DES are safe and effective in the treatment of STEMI in an unselected cohort; 90.9% of patients are free of MACE at 12 months post discharge.

### Age-related differences in the use of guideline-recommended medical and interventional therapies for acute coronary syndromes: a cohort study [^114zSYLm]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the use of guideline-recommended medical and interventional therapies in older and younger patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs).

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Fifty-five hospitals in Switzerland.

Participants

Eleven thousand nine hundred thirty-two patients with ACS enrolled between March 1, 2001, and June 30, 2006. ACS definition included ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina pectoris (UA).

Measurements

Use of medical and interventional therapies was determined after exclusion of patients with contraindications and after adjustment for comorbidities. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) per year increase in age.

Results

Elderly patients were less likely to receive acetylsalicylic acid (OR = 0.976, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.969–0.980) or beta-blockers (OR = 0.985, 95% CI = 0.981–0.989). No age-dependent difference was found for heparin use. Elderly patients with STEMI were less likely to receive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis (OR = 0.955, 95% CI = 0.949–0.961). Elderly patients with NSTEMI or UA less often underwent PCI (OR = 0.943, 95% CI = 0.937–0.949).

Conclusion

Elderly patients across the whole spectrum of ACS were less likely to receive guideline-recommended therapies, even after adequate adjustment for comorbidities. Prognosis of elderly patients with ACS may be improved by increasing adherence to guideline-recommended medical and interventional therapies.

### Six months versus 12 months dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (DAPT-STEMI): randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority trial [^111SiU2W]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Interventions

All patients with STEMI were treated according to standard clinical practice. The choice of the vascular access route (ie, radial v femoral) was left to the discretion of the operator, although radial approach was strongly recommended to avoid bleeding complications at the puncture site. Thrombus aspiration and lesion predilatation were left to the discretion of the operator. The stent device used was the Resolute Integrity second generation zotarolimus-eluting stent (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA).

In accordance with international revascularisation guidelines, the DAPT consisted of aspirin loading dose of 150–300 mg orally or 250–500 mg intravenously followed by 75–100 mg orally daily. The P2Y12 inhibitors were prasugrel, ticagrelor, or clopidogrel. The initial dose for prasugrel was 60 mg orally followed by 10 mg orally daily. Patients aged 75 years and over and with a body weight of less than 60 kg were treated with an initial dose of 60 mg prasugrel orally followed by 5 mg prasugrel orally daily. The initial dose of ticagrelor was 180 mg orally followed by 90 mg orally twice daily. The initial dose for clopidogrel was 600 mg orally followed by 75 mg orally daily. After six months, patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomised, to either discontinue DAPT (ie, aspirin only) or continue DAPT for another six months after randomisation (ie, until 12 months after primary PCI) (see supplementary materials, fig e1). In all patients, 80–100 mg aspirin daily was continued indefinitely.

If required, additional (scheduled) staged revascularisations in non-culprit lesions were performed within 45 days from the primary PCI. However, even in these cases, the time of six months follow-up was based on the date of the initial (primary) PCI. All patients that were randomised were followed for 18 months after randomisation (ie, 24 months after primary PCI).

### Long-term outcome after drug-eluting versus bare-metal stent implantation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: 3-year follow-up of the randomized DEDICATION (drug elution and distal protection in acute myocardial infarction) trial [^114zAx1a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare long-term clinical outcomes after implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES) and bare-metal stents (BMS) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

The evidence of long-term efficacy and safety after implantation of DES in patients with complex lesions is scarce.

Methods

We randomly assigned 626 patients with STEMI referred within 12 h to have a DES or a BMS implanted in the infarct-related lesion with or without distal protection during primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

Results

At 3 years, target lesion revascularization was 6.1% in the DES group compared with 16.3% in the BMS group (p < 0.001), and the rate of major adverse cardiac events was 11.5% versus 18.2%, respectively (p = 0.02). Whereas all-cause mortality did not differ significantly, the rate of cardiac death was higher in the DES group, 6.1% versus 1.9% for the BMS group (p = 0.01). The occurrence of reinfarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis was similar.

Conclusions

Implantation of DES in patients with STEMI reduces the long-term rate of major adverse cardiac events compared with BMS, but patients with DES had a higher risk of cardiac death not attributed to myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis.

### Effectiveness of primary percutaneous coronary intervention compared with that of thrombolytic therapy in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction [^111BfcQs]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Few data exist from a community-based perspective on the relative effectiveness of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as compared with thrombolytic therapy (TT) in elderly patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), particularly in the current era of coronary stents and newer antithrombotic agents.

Methods

We evaluated data from patients, aged ≥ 70 years, with STEMI who were enrolled in the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events study between April 1999, and September 2002.

Results

Of the 2975 elderly patients eligible for reperfusion therapy, 365 (12.7%) underwent primary PCI and 769 (26.7%) received TT. The median delay from hospital arrival to therapy was 105 minutes for primary PCI and 40 minutes for TT. Inhospital complications for primary PCI versus TT included mortality (13.5% vs 14.8%), reinfarction (1.1% vs 5.7%), composite of death or reinfarction (14.3% vs 18.7%), cardiogenic shock (11.3% vs 11.6%), major bleeding (8.6% vs 5.9%), and stroke (1.1% vs 2.8%). After adjustment for baseline differences and propensity score, patients receiving primary PCI showed a lower rate of reinfarction (odds ratio [OR], 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05–0.44) and mortality (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39–0.96) and the composite of reinfarction or death (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35–0.79), with no difference in other outcome measures.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that, compared with TT, primary PCI is associated with a decrease in reinfarction and mortality, with no change in other outcome measures, in elderly patients with STEMI. These findings from an observational registry require further confirmation in future randomized clinical trial assessing the optimal reperfusion strategy in the elderly cohort with STEMI.

Acute coronary syndromes — revascularization strategy in multivessel disease highlights evidence gaps: in patients with non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), the role of multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus culprit-only PCI needs further supportive data, and whether multivessel PCI should be guided by angiography or physiology is still a matter of debate; it also clarifies that recommendations for PCI of nonculprit arteries in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are for patients who are not intended for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and that the optimal strategy for those with more complex anatomy is less clear.

### Randomized comparison of everolimus-eluting stents and sirolimus-eluting stents in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction: RACES-MI trial [^115qeWrL]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the current study was to compare everolimus-eluting stents (EES) with sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in patients undergoing primary angioplasty.

Background

Drug-eluting stents may offer benefits in terms of repeat revascularization. However, as shown for first-generation drug-eluting stents, they may be counterbalanced by a potential higher risk of stent thrombosis, especially among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). No data have been reported so far on the long-term benefits and safety of the new generation of drug-eluting stents in STEMI.

Methods

Consecutive STEMI patients admitted within 12 h of symptom onset and undergoing primary angioplasty and stent implantation at a tertiary center with 24-h primary percutaneous coronary intervention capability were randomly assigned to SES or EES. The primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiac event at 3-year follow-up. The secondary endpoints were death, reinfarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis, and target vessel revascularization at 3-year follow-up. No patient was lost to follow-up.

Results

From April 2007 to May 2009, 500 patients with STEMI were randomized to EES (n = 250) or SES (n = 250). No difference was observed in terms of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between the groups. No difference was observed between the groups in terms of number of implanted stents per patient or total stent length. However, a larger reference diameter was observed with SES (3.35 ± 0.51 mm vs. 3.25 ± 0.51 mm, p = 0.001), whereas patients randomized to EES more often received glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (54.4% vs. 42.4%, p = 0.006). Follow-up data were available in all patients (1,095 ± 159 days). No significant difference was observed between EES and SES in major adverse cardiac events (16% vs. 20.8%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5 to 1.13], p = 0.17), cardiac death (4.4% vs. 5.6%, adjusted HR: 0.77 [95% CI: 0.35 to 1.71], p = 0.53), recurrent MI (6.4% vs. 10%, adjusted HR: 0.62 [95% CI: 0.33 to 1.16], p = 0.13), and target vessel revascularization (4.8% vs. 4.8%, adjusted HR: 1.00 [95% CI: 0.45 to 2.32], p = 0.99). However, EES was associated with a significant reduction in stent thrombosis (1.6% vs. 5.2%, adjusted HR: 0.3 [95% CI: 0.1 to 0.92], p = 0.035).

Conclusions

This study shows that among STEMI patients undergoing primary angioplasty, EES has similar efficacy as SES, but is associated with a significant reduction in stent thrombosis.

### Use of drug-eluting stents in acute myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115t7Dw7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The primary aim of the analysis was to compare outcomes by stent type for death, myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR), and stent thrombosis in randomized trials of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A secondary analysis was performed among registry studies.

Background

It is not known whether there are differences in outcomes between drug-eluting stents (DES) and bare-metal stents (BMS) for STEMI.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Internet sources for articles comparing outcomes between DES and BMS among patients with STEMI between January 2000 and October 2008. Randomized controlled trials and registries including patients 18 years of age and older receiving a DES or BMS were included. We extracted variables related to the study design, setting, participants, and clinical end points.

Results

Thirteen randomized trials were identified (N = 7,352). Compared with BMS, DES significantly reduced TVR (relative risk [RR]: 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35 to 0.55), without increasing death (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.14), MI (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.05), or stent thrombosis (RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.28). These observations were durable over 2 years. Among 18 registries (N = 26,521), DES significantly reduced TVR (RR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.74) without an increase in MI (RR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.23). Death was significantly lower in the DES group within 1 year of the index percutaneous coronary intervention, but there were no differences within 2 years (p = 0.45).

Conclusions

The use of DES appears safe and efficacious in randomized trials and registries of patients with STEMI. The DES significantly reduce TVR compared with BMS, without an increase in death, MI, or stent thrombosis within 2 years of the index procedure.

### Outcomes with drug-eluting stents versus bare metal stents in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: results from the strategic transcatheter evaluation of new therapies (STENT) group [^113mgSrj]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study compares outcomes with drug-eluting stents (DES) versus bare metal stents (BMS) in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

DESs have been effective in elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but their safety and efficacy in patients with STEMI have not been well studied.

Methods

The STENT Registry is a multicenter United States registry evaluating outcomes of DES. Our study population includes patients with STEMI treated with either a DES or BMS who completed 9-month or 2-year follow-up. Outcomes were adjusted using propensity score analysis.

Results

DES patients were younger, had less prior infarction and prior bypass surgery, but had smaller vessels and longer lesions. After adjusting for differences in baseline variables, there were no significant differences between DES and BMS in death, reinfarction, or major adverse cardiac events (MACE). DES had lower rates of stent thrombosis at 9 months (1.0% vs. 2.7%, HR 0.40 [0.17–0.95]) and lower rates of target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 9 months (4.0% vs. 7.5%, HR 0.55 [0.34–0.88]) and 2 years (8.0% vs. 11.3%, HR 0.57 [0.35–0.92]). There was a nonsignificant increase in stent thrombosis with DES versus BMS from 1 to 2 years (1.1% vs. 0.3%, P = 0.28).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that DES used with primary PCI for STEMI are more effective than BMS in reducing TVR and are safe for up to 2 years. Whether DES are safe beyond 2 years and whether the reduction in TVR is enough to justify their use in STEMI will have to wait for the results of large randomized trials.

Practice guidelines reflect a consensus of expert opinion for patient care after a thorough review of clinical trials relevant to a given patient population. However, in keeping pace with the influx of new data, these recommendations need to be revised periodically to remain current. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published the Guidelines for the Management of Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in 2004 and the Guidelines for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in 2005 with their respective Focused Updates in 2007. Now, 2 years later, further revision of these guidelines has been published as Focused Updates of 2009.

### Mortality following placement of drug-eluting and bare-metal stents for ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction in the global registry of acute coronary events [^111NVn52]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess mortality after drug-eluting stent (DES) or bare-metal stent (BMS) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Methods and Results

In this multinational registry, 5093 STEMI patients received a stent: 1313 (26%) a DES and 3780 (74%) only BMS. Groups differed in baseline characteristics, type, or timing of percutaneous coronary intervention, with a higher baseline risk for patients receiving BMS. Two-year follow-up was available in 55 and 60% of the eligible BMS and DES patients, respectively. Unadjusted mortality was lower during hospitalization, similar for the first 6 months after discharge, and higher from 6 months to 2 years, for DES patients compared with that of BMS patients. Overall, unadjusted 2-year mortality was 5.3 vs. 3.9% for BMS vs. DES patients (P = 0.04). In propensity- and risk-adjusted survival analyses (Cox model), post-discharge mortality was not different up to 6 months (P = 0.21) or 1 year (P = 0.34). Late post-discharge mortality was higher in DES patients from 6 months to 2 years (HR 4.90, P = 0.01) or from 1 to 2 years (HR 7.06, P = 0.02). Similar results were observed when factoring in hospital mortality.

Conclusion

The observation of increased late mortality with DES vs. BMS suggests that DES should probably be avoided in STEMI, until more long-term data become available.

### Selective drug-eluting stent implantation for high-risk patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: rationale and safety [^115DCzCN]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A selective policy of drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients at high risk of restenosis may maximize the benefit from restenosis reduction and minimize risk from late stent thrombosis (LaST).

Objectives

We sought to prospectively determine the safety of selective DES implantation for long lesions (> 20 mm), small vessels (< 2.5 mm) and diabetic patients in patients with STEMI using a prospective single-center registry.

Methods

A total of 252 patients who underwent primary PCI between January 2005 and December 2006 were included: 126 consecutive patients receiving DES were compared with 126 age-, sex-, and vessel-matched controls with STEMI who received bare-metal stents. Composite major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (death, AMI, and target vessel revascularization) were used as the primary outcome measure.

Results

Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics and outcomes were similar between groups except for the prespecified diabetes, lesion length, and maximum stent diameter. Long-term outcomes at a median follow up of 34 ± 6 months showed significant reductions in reinfarction (2% vs. 11%, P = 0.03), target vessel revascularization (TVR) (10% vs. 24%, P = 0.02), and composite MACE (18% vs. 31%, P = 0.03) with DES, with no excess of death (9% vs. 7%, P = NS) or LaST (2% vs. 1%, P = NS). In a Cox multivariate model, clopidogrel cessation at long-term follow-up was the most powerful predictor of hierarchical MACE (HR: 5.165; 95%CI: 2.019–13.150, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Selective DES implantation in patients with high-risk STEMI appears safe, and exposes fewer patients to the risk of LaST. A randomized comparison of selective versus routine DES use in patients with STEMI should be considered.

### Benefit of primary percutaneous coronary interventions in the elderly with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [^115QbKS7]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The success of P-PCI has been so remarkable that recommendations have been extended to improve the application of this treatment, which is closely linked to the time of completion. In Europe, the Stent for Life Initiativehas become a very active platform supporting the indications and the use of clinical guidelines in the management of myocardial infarction, defining actions that improve compliance and helping to identify barriers that may arise. In Spain, the use of reperfusion strategies has been improving year after year and, with this, mortality due to STEMI has decreased, and the incorporation of this European initiative has significantly increased the PCI rate in general and especially P-PCI.

If we take into account that age is one of the variables that best predict mortality in ACS and that P-PCI is the most effective intervention to avoid it, it is clear to what extent it is important to establish its use and usefulness in the patients aged ≥ 75 years old who present with STEMI. We must also take into account the use of fibrinolysis as a valid alternative when times or distance prevent the realisation of a P-PCI, although there are greater bleeding risks in this population.

Among the reasons that have traditionally been put forward to exclude those over 75 years of age and that have already been exposed, there is one, which we have not been able to explore, referring to the late arrival at the hospital of the elderly patient 'outside the optimal window' for perform a P-PCI. The European Society of Cardiology guidelinesestablished that 'a routine primary PCI strategy should be considered in patients presenting late (12–48 hours) after symptom onset'. This strategy should certainly be explored in depth.

In short, the elderly population with STEMI, due to the increase in prevalence, the benefits of P-PCI and the increased risk of bleeding secondary to the use of fibrinolytics, constitutes a group of special interest to be treated with invasive procedures.

The European Society of Cardiology Guidelinesstates that ' There is no upper age limit with respect to reperfusion, especially with primary PCI ' but is unusual that the decision is based only in one studythat could not complete the estimated sample size due to the difficulty of including patients older than 75 years. This situation, in addition to the difficulty of having sufficiently statistically powered randomised clinical trials, shows that doctors themselves have an inclusion bias, finding intangible reasons to excluding elderly patients in P-PCI prospective protocols.

### Prognosis of PCI in AMI setting in the elderly population: outcomes from the multicenter prospective e-ULTIMASTER registry [^11186cQt]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are usually excluded from major trials.

Hyopthesis

This study sought to assess 1-year clinical outcomes following PCI with a drug-eluting stent in patients older than 80 years old with STEMI.

Methods

The large all-comer, multicontinental e-ULTIMASTER registry included 7507 patients with STEMI who underwent PCI using the Ultimaster stent. The primary clinical endpoint was 1-year target lesion failure, a composite of cardiac death (CD), target vessel-related myocardial infarction (TV-MI), or clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR).

Results

There were 457 (6.1%) patients in the elderly group (≥ 80 years old) that were compared to 7050 (93.9%) patients < 80 years. The elderly patients included more female patients and had significantly more comorbidities and had more complex coronary anatomy. The primary endpoint occurred in 7.2% of the elderly, compared to 3.1% of the younger group (p < .001). All-cause mortality was significantly higher among the elderly group compared to the younger group (10.1% vs. 2.3%, p < .0001), as well as CD (6.1% vs. 1.6%, p < .0001), but not TV-MI (1.1% vs. 0.7%, p = .34) or CD-TLR (1.1% vs. 1.4%, p = .63).

Conclusion

Elderly patients with STEMI presentation had a higher incidence of the composite endpoint than younger patients. All-cause and CD were higher for elderly patients compared to patients younger than 80 years old. However, there was no difference in the incidence of TV-MI or target lesion revascularizations. These findings suggest that PCI for STEMI in elderly patients is relatively safe.

### Reducing time to reperfusion for ST elevation myocardial infarction patients by a simple process change in the emergency department [^116YPmNM]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Problem

Time to reperfusion for patients suffering from ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) should be as short as possible to preserve myocardium and ensure better outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality for these patients. This is achieved by the process of primary percutaneous intervention (PPCI), where the coronary artery is opened by means of inflation of a balloon in the coronary artery affected by thrombus and deployment of a coronary stent. Time to reperfusion is referred to as first medical contact to balloon (FMC-B).

Current guidelines recommend FMC-B time should be no longer than 120 minutes. Therefore it is important to identify and manage these patients rapidly, however, this presents a challenge to Emergency Departments (ED) which are not attached to interventional centres. This means that transfer time has to be added to the time from first medical contact, defined as when the patient registers at reception, or the arrival of emergency services who transport the patient to the ED.

### Comparison of safety and efficacy of sirolimus-eluting stents versus bare metal stents in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^114CCxsS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) are superior to bare metal stents (BMSs) for percutaneous coronary intervention, but data regarding SESs in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are limited. We investigated the clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI who were treated with SESs. We measured clinical characteristics and acute and long-term outcomes in 306 consecutive patients with STEMI who received a SES (n = 156) or a BMS (n = 150). Patients were followed for death, nonfatal reinfarction, and target vessel revascularization. Patients with SESs had a 0.6% in-hospital mortality rate versus 5.3% in patients with BMSs (p = 0.015). Six-month mortality rates were 1.9% (SES) and 10.1% (BMS, p = 0.003). At 6 months, patients with SESs were less likely to have target vessel revascularization (1.3% vs 8.1%, p = 0.005) and achieve the composite end point (3.2% vs 16.1%, p = 0.0001). No subacute thrombosis or clinical restenosis occurred in the SES group. Patients who received BMSs were older, received more stents, and had more myocardial damage, worse renal function, and lower ejection fractions than did those in the SES group. By multivariate discriminant analysis, stent type (SES vs BMS) was the most significant determinant of the 6-month composite end point (p = 0.01) and the need for target vessel revascularization (p = 0.02). In conclusion, SESs are safe and effective in STEMI at 6 months.

### Culprit-only vs. complete revascularization during ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^1138Bv8S]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) is the treatment of choice for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Patients with STEMI frequently have obstructive non-culprit lesions. In addition, STEMI patients with multivessel disease are at increased risk of major adverse cardiac events. However, current guidelines do not recommend revascularization of non-culprit lesions unless complicated by cardiogenic shock. Prior observational and small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated conflicting results pertaining to the optimal revascularization strategy in STEMI patients with multivessel disease undergoing primary PCI. Recent randomized studies, PRAMI, CvLPRIT, and DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI, provide encouraging data that suggest potential benefit with complete revascularization in STEMI patients with obstructive non-culprit lesions. However, further data from large RCTs are needed to investigate the impact of this strategy on recurrent myocardial infarction/death and to determine the best timing of staged procedures for complete revascularization. Until then, a personalized approach should be taken to optimize the revascularization strategy in STEMI patients with obstructive non-culprit lesions.

### Prognosis of PCI in AMI setting in the elderly population: outcomes from the multicenter prospective e-ULTIMASTER registry [^1117QTDr]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of death worldwide and is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the elderly. The population all around the world is aging, in part thanks to the progress made in medical science. The number of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has also increased in recent years, and is expected to grow even further.

Older studies have suggested that age is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes following PCI. Elderly patients (age ≥ 80) are often excluded from major clinical trials of cardiovascular interventions because of concerns about the increased risk of adverse events and limited life expectancy. In addition, older patients with CAD are less likely than younger patients to undergo invasive revascularization even in current clinical practice. In the acute setting, despite current evidence and recommendations, older patients are still less likely to receive reperfusion treatment when compared with their younger counterparts. Efforts should be made to improve this picture, as invasive strategies in ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) associate greater survival in elderly patients, and there is no upper age limit for urgent reperfusion.

Therefore, knowledge regarding the outcome of the elderly referred for PCI in the current era of improved techniques, devices, and pharmacotherapy is limited. Prior studies have shown clear clinical benefits when performing PCI over medical therapy in the elderly group presenting with STEMI. Nonetheless, the long‐term outcome of the elderly population compared to the younger one is not well established. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the characteristics and clinical outcomes in the elderly with STEMI presentation undergoing PCI in the contemporary drug‐eluting stent (DES) era from one of the largest cohorts in the world.

### Comparison of drug-eluting stents with bare metal stents in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116hHDfs]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate safety and effectiveness of early generation drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with bare-metal stents (BMS) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and to determine whether benefits and risks vary over time.

Methods and Results

We performed a meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials enrolling a total of 7867 patients comparing first-generation FDA-approved DES with BMS in patients with STEMI. Random effect models were used to assess differences in outcomes between DES and BMS among different time periods with regard to the pre-specified primary outcomes stent thrombosis (ST) and target vessel revascularization (TVR). The overall risk of definite ST was similar for DES and BMS [risk ratio (RR) = 1.08, 95% CI 0.82–1.43]. However, there were time-dependent effects, with a RR of 0.80 during the first year (95% CI 0.58–1.12) and 2.10 during subsequent years (95% CI 1.20–3.69), with a positive test for interaction between RR of ST and time (P for interaction = 0.009). Results were similar for definite or probable ST (P for interaction = 0.015). In the overall analysis, TVR was performed less frequently in patients with DES when compared with BMS (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43–0.61), with a greater benefit in the first year (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38–0.55) when compared with subsequent years (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59–0.94; P for interaction = 0.007).

Conclusion

An early benefit of early generation DES in primary PCI for STEMI with a reduction in TVR and a trend towards less definite ST is offset in subsequent years by an increased risk of very late ST.

Limitations

Confounders on individual study level and interstudy heterogeneity were acknowledged. The main concern was the evidence of significant imbalances in both confounding and selection into the study. Patients in the CON group suffered from negative selection as they were not suitable for catheterization or refused invasive strategy. The extracted data were restricted to study‐level reports. As a result, adjusted analysis stratifying for these imbalances was not possible but would have offered further value.

Most patients were nonagenarians (98%), both octogenarians and centenarians were underrepresented, and generalizability to these subgroups is limited. This very old population is at risk of underlying survivorship bias which is an unmeasurable confounder in study‐level meta‐analysis.

Moreover, the authors were not able to analyze all prespecified outcomes. Major adverse cardiac events, minor bleeding, and overall bleeding were not thoroughly reported in the analyzed studies. Outcome analysis is further affected by variance in outcome definition. Precisely, cardiac mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and major bleeding were assessed as defined in the individual trials which indicates heterogeneity.

In addition, the use of antithrombotics and revascularization therapy differed between the studies. The duration of antiplatelet therapy is a rapidly evolving research field, and stratified, patient‐oriented deescalation strategies were recently proposed. The current evidence indicates that shorter duration of antiplatelets might be equally effective and associated with lower bleeding in older patients after PCI. But high‐quality studies to direct antithrombotic treatment in older patients with STEMI are pending.

The precise angioplasty strategy was extractable for only 1% of the PCI population. This is an inherent source of bias and mainly caused by the retrospective study design of included trials. Nonetheless, PCI using bare metal stents was a prevalent strategy (45.9%) whenever the rate was reported. This might be related to the treatment periods with the first patient treated in 2003 and the last patient treated in 2019. To date, drug‐eluting stents are explicitly preferred over bare metal stents, but again older people were underrepresented in these landmark trials, and further research is warranted.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1178qMjk]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

St-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) reperfusion in older adults — preferred strategy, timelines, and key adjuncts: American and European society guidelines recommend primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) as the preferred reperfusion strategy in all acute STEMI when symptom onset to first medical contact is < 12 hours, with door-to-balloon time < 90 minutes or anticipated transfer to reperfusion time < 120 minutes (Class 1; Level of Evidence A). If pPCI is not possible, it is recommended that older patients should receive fibrinolysis when appropriate; trials demonstrated the importance of half-dose fibrinolytic therapy in patients ≥ 75 years and that in elderly patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset when pPCI was not available within 1 hour, half-dose fibrinolysis had similar safety and efficacy compared with pPCI. As adjunctive therapy with fibrinolysis, clopidogrel should be considered the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor, with patients > 75 years receiving an initial dose of 75 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg once daily; for access during pPCI, transradial access has been proven safe in older patients and should be considered the preferred access site to lower bleeding, vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and perhaps death in STEMI.

### Comparison of outcomes in patients aged [^114Bxqat]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is common in older adults and has high age-related mortality. We describe contemporary STEMI care using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines (ACTION-GWTG) database. Patients with STEMI (n = 30,188) from 285 ACTION-GWTG sites from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008 were grouped by age (< 75, 75 to 84, and ≥ 85 years) to compare baseline characteristics, reperfusion, and in-hospital outcomes. In this population, 79.7% (24,070) were < 75 years old, 14.2% (4,273) were 75 to 84 years old, and 6.1% (1,845) were ≥ 85 years old (the oldest old). Compared to younger patients, the oldest-old patients (median age 88 years, interquartile range 86 to 91) were more often women, had more hypertension, and end-organ co-morbidity (heart failure and stroke, p < 0.0001 for all). More than 42% of the oldest old were also cited as having contraindications to reperfusion, but with absolute or relative contraindications noted in only 10%, and patient preference was the most common reason indicated (45%). Even in reperfusion-eligible patients, the oldest old were less likely to receive it. Although patients who received reperfusion had better outcomes than those who did not, this was significant only for younger patients (< 75 years old, odds ratio 0.58, confidence interval 0.40 to 0.84). In conclusion, > 42% of the oldest old have reported contraindications to reperfusion, with neither mortality benefit nor harm in those who receive it. Disparities in process of care and co-morbidity may explain these observational findings. Whether efforts to optimize patient selection and initiate reperfusion therapy can improve outcomes in the oldest old with STEMI is unknown.

### Everolimus-eluting stent versus bare-metal stent in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (EXAMINATION): 1 year results of a randomised controlled trial [^114JkkiH]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Everolimus-eluting stent (EES) reduces the risk of restenosis in elective percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the use of drug-eluting stent in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is still controversial. Data regarding the performance of second-generation EES in this setting are scarce. We report the 1-year result of the EXAMINATION (clinical Evaluation of the Xience-V stent in Acute Myocardial INfArcTION) trial, comparing EES with bare-metal stents (BMS) in patients with STEMI.

Methods

This multicentre, prospective, randomised, all-comer controlled trial was done in 12 medical centres in three countries. Between Dec 31, 2008, and May 15, 2010, we recruited patients with STEMI up to 48 h after the onset of symptoms requiring emergent percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were randomly assigned (ratio 1:1) to receive EES or BMS. Randomisation was in blocks of four or six patients, stratified by centre and centralised by telephone. Patients were masked to treatment. The primary endpoint was the patient-oriented combined endpoint of all-cause death, any recurrent myocardial infarction, and any revascularisation at 1 year and was analysed by intention to treat. The secondary endpoints of the study included the device-oriented combined endpoint of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction or target lesion revascularisation, and rates of all cause or cardiac death, recurrent myocardial infarction, target lesion or target vessel revascularisation, stent thrombosis, device and procedure success, and major and minor bleeding. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00828087.

Findings

Of the 1504 patients randomised, 1498 patients were randomly assigned to receive EES (n = 751) or BMS (n = 747). The primary endpoint was similar in both groups (89 [11.9%] of 751 patients in the EES group vs 106 [14.2%] of 747 patients in the BMS group; difference -2.34 [95% CI -5.75 to 1.07]; p = 0.19). Device-oriented endpoint (44 [5.9%] in the EES group vs 63 [8.4%] in the BMS group; difference -2.57 [95% CI -5.18 to 0.03]; p = 0.05) did not differ between groups, although rates of target lesion and vessel revascularisation were significantly lower in the EES group (16 [2.1%] vs 37 [5.0%], p = 0.003, and 28 [3.7%] vs 51 [6.8%], p = 0.0077, respectively). Rates of all cause (26 [3.5%] for EES vs 26 [3.5%] for BMS, p = 1.00) or cardiac death (24 [3.2%] for EES vs 21 [2.8%] for BMS, p = 0.76) or myocardial infarction (10 [1.3%] vs 15 [2.0%], p = 0.32) did not differ between groups. Stent thrombosis rates were significantly lower in the EES group (4 [0.5%] patients with definite stent thrombosis in the EES group vs 14 [1.9%] in the BMS group and seven [0.9%] patients with definite or probable stent thrombosis in the EES group vs 19 [2.5%] in the BMS group, both p = 0.019). Although device success rate was similar between groups, procedure success rate was significantly higher in the EES group (731 [97.5%] vs 705 [94.6%]; p = 0.0050). Finally, Bleeding rates at 1 year were comparable between groups (29 [3.9%] patients in the EES group vs 39 [5.2%] in the BMS group; p = 0.19).

Interpretation

The use of EES compared with BMS in the setting of STEMI did not lower the patient-oriented endpoint. However, at the stent level both rates of target lesion revascularisation and stent thrombosis were reduced in recipients of EES.

### Highlights from the 2013 ACCF / AHA guidelines for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and beyond [^116h6b5j]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered a cardiology emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment aimed at successful and early reperfusion to ensure optimal outcomes. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction since 1990. These guidelines are based on clinical research exploring reperfusion modalities and adjunctive therapies. They are further supported by expert opinion where randomized trial evidence is lacking. In January 2013, the ACCF/AHA released the most recent guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI. This review focuses on the newest and most important recommendations taken from the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Management of STEMI and highlight important new studies that have emerged over the past year.

### Outcomes with various drug-eluting or bare metal stents in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a mixed treatment comparison analysis of trial level data from 34 068 patient-years of follow-up from randomized trials [^115HzWqQ]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is controversial. Consequently, DES implantation has a class IIa indication in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology STEMI guidelines.

Methods and Results

PUBMED, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched for randomized clinical trials, until March 2013, comparing any of the 5 Food and Drug Administration-approved durable stent and polymer DES (sirolimus eluting stent, paclitaxel eluting stent, everolimus-eluting stent [EES], zotarolimus-eluting stent, and zotarolimus-eluting stent resolute), against each other or bare metal stents (BMS), and enrolling ≥ 50 patients with STEMI. Efficacy (target vessel revascularization) and safety (death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis) outcomes at the longest reported follow-up times were evaluated. Twenty-eight randomized clinical trials with 34 068 patient-years of follow-up on subjects with STEMI fulfilled the inclusion criteria. When compared with BMS (reference rate ratio [RR] of 1), sirolimus eluting stent (RR, 0.46; 95% credibility interval [CrI], 0.36–0.56), paclitaxel eluting stent (RR, 0.69; 95% CrI, 0.53–0.87), and EES (RR, 0.42; 95% CrI, 0.26–0.62) were associated with a statistically significant reduction in rate of target vessel revascularization, with the point estimate for zotarolimus-eluting stent resolute trending in a similar direction. There was no increase in the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis with any DES compared with BMS. Moreover, EES was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of stent thrombosis when compared with sirolimus eluting stent (RR, 0.38; 95% CrI, 0.21–0.74), paclitaxel eluting stent (RR, 0.39; 95% CrI, 0.21–0.73), and even BMS (RR, 0.42; 95% CrI, 0.23–0.76). There was a 74% probability that EES had the lowest rate of any stent thrombosis when compared with all other stent types (no data on zotarolimus-eluting stent resolute). There was no increase in very late stent thrombosis with EES versus BMS (RR, 0.89; 95% CrI, 0.09–8.67).

Conclusions

In patients with STEMI, DES versus BMS was associated with substantial decrease in the risk of target vessel revascularization without compromising safety. EES had the added advantage of substantial reduction in the risk of stent thrombosis when compared with first-generation DES and BMS with no increase in very late stent thrombosis.
