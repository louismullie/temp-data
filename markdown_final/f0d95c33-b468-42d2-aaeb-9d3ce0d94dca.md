## Question

what does it mean to have excessive anal rectal descent at rest or evacuation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what excessive anorectal descent at rest or during evacuation means, how it is measured, why it happens, what it is associated with, how to interpret it in different clinical contexts, how it should influence diagnostic workup and management, and what it implies prognostically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomical definition and measurement standards. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and common coexisting pelvic floor findings. Next, I will examine the clinical significance and reconcile conflicting evidence linking descent with symptoms. After that, I need to check guideline-based diagnostic pathways and the role of imaging versus physiology. Finally, I will consider management priorities, including conservative therapies, when surgery is considered, and the prognosis including risks of prolapse progression.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical construct and measurement conventions. Excessive anorectal descent, also termed perineal descent or descending perineum syndrome, refers to downward displacement of the anorectal junction and perineum relative to fixed bony landmarks, most commonly quantified as the perpendicular distance from the anorectal junction to the pubococcygeal line on dynamic imaging; descent beyond roughly 2.5–3.5 cm is generally considered abnormal, though thresholds vary by modality and center, so I should be cautious about rigid cutoffs and confirm local norms and technique specifics [^1117fr7s] [^116rGVVc].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before assuming causality. Excessive descent reflects impaired pelvic floor support due to levator ani and connective tissue laxity, often compounded by neuropathic injury, particularly pudendal neuropathy from repetitive straining or obstetric trauma; this can establish a vicious cycle in which constipation and straining drive further descent and neuromuscular compromise, worsening outlet function and continence barriers over time [^113DV7NM] [^1133NhQx] [^114CUFCs].

> I should confirm the associated structural abnormalities because descent rarely occurs in isolation. Excessive descent frequently coexists with posterior compartment defects such as rectocele and internal rectal intussusception, and it often accompanies multicompartment pelvic organ prolapse and enteroceles or sigmoidoceles on dynamic imaging, underscoring that pelvic floor weakness is commonly generalized across compartments rather than confined to the anorectum alone [^111xnpWp] [^11216DLE] [^117DPA7t].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms solely from imaging. Clinically, excessive descent has been associated with obstructed defecation features, a sense of anorectal blockage, incomplete evacuation, and sometimes fecal incontinence or pelvic pressure, yet several studies show poor correlation between the absolute magnitude of descent and constipation severity or quality of life, supporting the notion that descent may be a marker of global pelvic floor laxity rather than a primary driver of symptom burden in many patients [^1133NhQx] [^1117fr7s] [^1124QbZU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a larger descent would necessarily portend worse constipation, but I should double-check that. In fact, a prospective study found similar symptom and quality-of-life scores regardless of whether perineal descent at rest exceeded 3.5 cm, and another dynamic MR series linked descent more strongly to prolapse symptoms than to anorectal or urinary incontinence complaints; that said, other cohorts did observe that patients with greater descent had more intussusception and enteroceles, so the clinical signal likely reflects co-traveling structural pathology rather than descent magnitude alone [^1117fr7s] [^1117fr7s] [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider epidemiologic modifiers because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing risk factors. One study associated excessive descent with older age, higher BMI, hysterectomy, and parity, suggesting it clusters with global pelvic floor weakening, but other MR-based series did not reproduce consistent associations with age, BMI, or parity, highlighting heterogeneity in populations and methods; I should therefore treat these factors as plausible but not definitive risk markers in individual patients [^1117fr7s] [^113Zruc4] [^113XaK4M].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic implications and sequence of tests. Guidelines recommend a symptom-guided, stepwise approach: begin with careful digital rectal examination assessing pelvic floor motion during simulated evacuation, followed by anorectal manometry and a balloon expulsion test to identify dyssynergia or sensorimotor abnormalities; defecography, either fluoroscopic or MRI, is considered when manometry and balloon expulsion are inconclusive or when structural lesions are suspected, especially if symptoms persist despite conservative measures [^112oZv5f] [^1148qhCt] [^115zKoFU] [^114bvahB].

> I need to ensure I integrate physiology with imaging rather than privileging one in isolation. Manometry and balloon expulsion help phenotype dyssynergic defecation and rectal sensory disturbances, but the rectoanal gradient during simulated evacuation can be negative in health, and discordance among tests is common, so confirmatory imaging is often needed when physiology and symptoms do not align; conversely, in fecal incontinence, ACOG advises against routine defecography during initial evaluation, reserving it for selected cases where structural pathology is suspected [^114ZZFTx] [^116VAtCg] [^1163Q53u] [^112E7hPw].

> Let me think about imaging nuances because measurement method matters. Both fluoroscopic and MR defecography can quantify descent relative to the pubococcygeal line and delineate associated abnormalities like rectocele, enterocele, or intussusception, with MR offering multiplanar soft-tissue detail without radiation and fluoroscopy sometimes detecting enteroceles or sigmoidoceles not appreciated clinically; emerging tools such as 3D high-resolution anorectal manometry can visualize cranio-caudal movement of the high-pressure zone correlating with descent, but quantitative agreement with defecography is imperfect and requires caution in interpretation [^111xnpWp] [^117DPA7t] [^11216DLE] [^1117Fsga].

> I will now examine how the finding should alter management, and I need to prioritize conservative therapy first. The presence of excessive descent should trigger optimization of stool form and transit to reduce straining, typically with fiber, osmotic laxatives, and behavioral strategies, and it should prompt referral for pelvic floor biofeedback when dyssynergia or difficult evacuation features are present, given high response rates to biofeedback across defecatory phenotypes even when test results are discordant [^114bvahB] [^1163Q53u] [^1123Wt3E].

> Hold on, I should verify the surgical role because it is easy to over-attribute symptoms to descent. Surgery is not indicated to "fix" descent per se; rather, operative interventions target coexistent structural defects such as significant rectocele, high-grade intussusception, or rectal prolapse, typically after multidisciplinary evaluation and dynamic imaging, with procedures like ventral rectopexy considered in appropriate prolapse phenotypes; novel perineal support procedures have only preliminary, uncontrolled data and should not be routinely adopted [^113wncv8] [^115Amv9S] [^115Amv9S].

> But wait, what about prognosis and longitudinal risk. Excessive descent likely signifies a compromised pelvic floor that may coexist with or precede structural prolapse, and while internal prolapse progression to external prolapse is uncommon in short follow-up, age-related increases in prolapse grade suggest a trajectory of progressive support failure in susceptible patients, warranting surveillance and early attention to modifiable factors like straining and stool consistency [^113STy1z] [^1124QbZU] [^1133NhQx].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the interpretation stays contextual. Excessive anorectal descent means that pelvic floor support is impaired and the anorectal junction descends abnormally on straining or even at rest, but the degree of descent alone correlates poorly with constipation severity and is better viewed as a marker of global pelvic floor laxity that often coexists with rectocele, intussusception, or multicompartment prolapse; diagnostically, it should lead to a structured evaluation with DRE, manometry, balloon expulsion, and targeted defecography when indicated, and therapeutically it should shift the focus toward conservative measures and biofeedback, reserving surgery for specific structural lesions rather than descent itself, with prognostic vigilance for prolapse progression over time [^111xnpWp] [^1117fr7s] [^114bvahB] [^1163Q53u] [^115Amv9S] [^113STy1z].

---

Excessive anorectal descent is defined as **> 3.5 cm below the pubococcygeal line at rest or > 4.5 cm during evacuation** [^111xnpWp] [^113XaK4M] on dynamic imaging, indicating abnormal downward movement of the anorectal junction [^1117fr7s]. It reflects **pelvic floor weakness or neuropathy** [^1133NhQx] and is associated with obstructed defecation, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse [^1124QbZU]. Diagnosis relies on MRI or fluoroscopic defecography [^111xnpWp], with anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion testing as adjuncts [^114bvahB] [^115zKoFU]. Management includes pelvic floor rehabilitation [^1133NhQx], biofeedback [^1163Q53u], and surgery for severe or refractory cases [^115Amv9S].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Excessive anorectal descent is the downward displacement of the anorectal junction beyond established normal limits. By definition, **normal descent** is ≤ 3.5 cm below the pubococcygeal line (PCL) [^111xnpWp] at rest and ≤ 4.5 cm during evacuation [^113XaK4M], whereas **excessive descent** is > 3.5 cm below the PCL at rest [^111xnpWp] or > 4.5 cm during evacuation [^113XaK4M]. These measurements are typically obtained using **dynamic imaging** techniques such as MRI defecography or fluoroscopic defecography [^111mvsPK].

---

## Pathophysiology

Excessive anorectal descent results from **weakened or damaged pelvic floor muscles and connective tissues**, often due to chronic straining, aging, childbirth, or neuropathic injury [^1124QbZU]. This weakness leads to abnormal downward movement of the anorectal junction, impairing anorectal function [^113DV7NM].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Excessive anorectal descent is **clinically significant** because it is associated with multiple anorectal and pelvic floor disorders, including:

- **Obstructed defecation**: Difficulty evacuating stool, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and need for manual assistance [^1133NhQx].

- **Fecal incontinence**: Loss of bowel control due to impaired sphincter function and rectal support [^111CxB52].

- **Pelvic organ prolapse**: Descent of pelvic organs, including rectocele, enterocele, and rectal prolapse [^111CxB52] [^113XaK4M].

- **Pelvic pain**: Chronic pelvic discomfort due to abnormal pelvic floor mechanics [^1157oPkh].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is **essential** to confirm the diagnosis of excessive anorectal descent and identify underlying causes:

- **Clinical examination**: Digital rectal examination (DRE) [^112oZv5f] to assess pelvic floor motion and anorectal function.

- **Anorectal manometry**: Measures anal sphincter pressures and rectoanal coordination [^114bvahB] [^116VAtCg].

- **Balloon expulsion test**: Assesses the ability to expel a rectal balloon, indicating evacuation function [^114bvahB] [^1148qhCt].

- **Dynamic imaging**: MRI defecography [^111xnpWp] or fluoroscopic defecography to visualize and quantify anorectal descent and associated structural abnormalities [^117BLc6F] [^114bvahB].

---

## Management strategies

Management of excessive anorectal descent involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes **conservative management** — pelvic floor rehabilitation, biofeedback therapy [^1163Q53u], dietary modifications, and bowel regimen optimization [^1133NhQx] — and **surgical interventions** for severe or refractory cases, such as transverse perineal support, ventral rectopexy, and other pelvic floor reconstructive procedures [^112uLfb8] [^113wncv8].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of excessive anorectal descent varies with the severity of descent, underlying causes, and treatment effectiveness. Potential complications include **chronic constipation, fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and impaired quality of life** [^111CxB52].

---

Excessive anorectal descent is characterized by abnormal downward movement of the anorectal junction, leading to significant symptoms and functional impairment. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are **essential** to improve patient outcomes and quality of life [^115zKoFU].

### Descending perineum syndrome: A review of the presentation, diagnosis, and management [^1133NhQx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Defecatory dysfunction is a relatively common and challenging problem among women that practicing pelvic reconstructive surgeons and gynecologists frequently encounter. A subset of defecatory dysfunction includes obstructed defecation, which can have multiple causes, one of which is descending perineum syndrome (DPS).

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed to identify the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of DPS.

- **Results**: Although DPS has been described in the literature for many decades, it is still uncommonly diagnosed and difficult to manage. A high index of suspicion combined with physical examination consistent with excess perineal descent, patient symptom assessment, and imaging in the form of defecography are required for the diagnosis to be accurately made. Primary management options of DPS include conservative measures consisting of bowel regimens and biofeedback. Although various surgical approaches have been described in limited case series, no compelling evidence can be demonstrated at this point to support surgical intervention.

- **Conclusions**: Knowledge of DPS is essential for the practicing pelvic reconstructive surgeon to make a timely diagnosis, avoid harmful treatments, and initiate therapy early on.

### Perineal descent does not imply a more severe clinical disorder [^1117fr7s]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

There is poor consensus in the literature about measuring perineal descent. We aimed to assess symptoms and quality of life in constipated patients with abnormal perineal descent.

- **Method**: Constipated patients were categorized into those with obstructed defaecation, colonic inertia, mixed disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome constipation types. Anal physiology was performed. KESS score, Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life, and SF-12 questionnaires were completed. The position of the perineum was measured by defaecography. Patients were divided into two groups according to the position of the perineal descent at rest: group 1 (normal) and group 2 (abnormal, perineum descended more than 3.5 cm).

- **Results**: Fifty-eight patients were identified, 23 (40%) in group 1 and 35 (60%) in group 2. Patients in group 2 were older (P = 0.007), had a higher body mass index (BMI; P = 0.003), a higher rate of hysterectomy (P = 0.04), and more vaginal deliveries (P = 0.001). Obstructed defaecation was the predominant subtype of constipation. Group 1 had more difficulty in initiating defaecation, while group 2 presented more cases with intussusception and enterocele (P = 0.03 for both). Group 2 had a lesser degree of perineal descent between rest and straining. Rectal compliance was greater in group 2 (P = 0.03). Symptoms and quality of life scores were similar between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: Radiologically determined excessive perineal descent is not indicative of worse symptoms or quality of life. This radiological finding does not warrant further investigation.

### Transverse perineal support: A novel surgical treatment for perineal descent in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome [^112uLfb8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that pathological perineal descent may be responsible for the failure of operations for obstructed defecation syndrome and that correcting excessive perineal descent may improve the outcome in this group of patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to report the short-term preliminary results of a novel surgical procedure, transverse perineal support, for the correction of pathological perineal descent.

- **Design**: This was a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label study.

- **Settings**: The study was conducted in a hospital and a university center.

- **Patients**: Among 25 patients observed with failure of previous surgery for obstructed defecation syndrome, 12 with pathological perineal descent underwent transverse perineal support, were followed up at 6 months, and constituted the object of analysis.

- **Interventions**: The surgical procedure was performed by positioning a porcine dermal implant just above the perineum superficial fascia, sutured to the periosteum membrane of ischiatic tuberosities at the insertion of the superficial transverse perineal muscle.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were obstructed defecation syndrome score and x-ray and magnetic resonance defecographic imaging evaluation of perineal descent and anorectal manometric parameters.

- **Results**: The postoperative median obstructed defecation syndrome score was 7.0 (range, 3–8), showing a statistically significant difference when compared with the preoperative score of 13.5 (range, 9–18; p = 0.0005). The mean postoperative maximum intrarectal pressure was 69.4 ± 11.1 mm Hg.

### Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the female pelvic floor-a pictorial review [^111xnpWp]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The pelvic floor works as a single entity, and pelvic weakness is frequently generalized, affecting more than one compartment. Both fluoroscopic cystocolpodefecography and MR defecography with rectal contrast opacification are appropriate and rated equally for evaluating pelvic floor disorders of different compartments, with a preference for MR defecography in assessing defecatory dysfunctions.

The pelvic floor is divided into three anatomical compartments: anterior, middle, and posterior. These are connected by structures responsible for pelvic support: craniocaudally, these are respectively the endopelvic fascia, the pelvic diaphragm, and the urogenital diaphragm.

- **Pubococcygeal line (PCL)**: The first and most important line, a straight line connecting the inferior border of the pubic symphysis to the last coccygeal joint. It represents the plane of attachment of the pelvic floor muscles, is used as a reference for measuring organ prolapses, and is drawn in the midline sagittal plane.

Although prolapses may coexist with the relaxation/laxity of the pelvic support structures and may themselves induce functional disorders from external compression, pelvic prolapses can be independent of functional disorders.

### Rectal prolapse [^111CxB52]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). High credibility.

Rectal prolapse is a condition that can be associated with chronic straining and the sensation of a bulge from the anus. Patients may experience rectal discharge, cystocele, and the presence of a rectal mass. Symptoms often include tissue protruding from the anus, rectal bleeding, and constipation. Other associated factors include anal sphincter hypotonia, a feeling of incomplete evacuation after defecation, and uterovaginal prolapse. The condition is more common in females and is linked to a feeling of rectal fullness, multiparity, rectal ulcer, age over 50 years, urinary incontinence, and fecal incontinence.

### Optimizing the utility of anorectal manometry for diagnosis and therapy: A roundtable review and recommendations [^1163Q53u]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The clinical utility of biofeedback therapy (BT) is not universally understood. Guidance is lacking on what constitutes the phenotypical patient who would benefit from BT. Among patients with clinical features of difficult evacuation, a dyssynergic defecation pattern identified by anorectal manometry (ARM), together with an abnormal balloon expulsion test, justifies consideration of BT. In cases of discordant ARM and balloon expulsion test results, perhaps a third follow-up test is needed (e.g. fluoroscopic or magnetic resonance defecography) to confirm pelvic floor dysfunction or rule out structural pathologies. When imaging is unavailable, experts used excessive colonic retention of markers and demonstrated significant improvement following BT. Regardless of follow-up test results, most providers recommend BT for discordant cases.

In clinical trials, BT effectively treats 70% to 80% of patients with dyssynergic defecation. Similarly, 76% of patients with refractory fecal incontinence (FI) reported adequate relief with BT. The likelihood and magnitude of response to BT may vary based on treatment length, diagnosis or symptoms, disease severity, or comorbid illnesses. Patients with dyssynergic defecation and lower or more normal baseline thresholds for first rectal sensation and urge were more likely to respond to BT, while depression and elevated first rectal sensory threshold volume were independent predictors of poor BT efficacy. Identifying patients with FI who may respond better to BT has been challenging. The presence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or chronic constipation in patients with dyssynergic defecation does not affect outcomes significantly.

### The international anorectal physiology working group (IAPWG) recommendations: Standardized testing protocol and the London classification for disorders of anorectal function [^115w7N4H]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

This manuscript summarizes the consensus reached by the International Anorectal Physiology Working Group (IAPWG) on the performance, terminology, and interpretation of anorectal function testing. This includes anorectal manometry (focused on high-resolution manometry), the rectal sensory test, and the balloon expulsion test. Based on these measurements, a classification system for disorders of anorectal function is proposed.

Twenty-nine working group members — clinicians and academics in the fields of gastroenterology, coloproctology, and gastrointestinal physiology — were invited to six face-to-face and three remote meetings to derive consensus between 2014 and 2018.

- **Key recommendations**: The IAPWG protocol for the performance of anorectal function testing recommends a standardized sequence of maneuvers to test rectoanal reflexes, anal tone and contractility, rectoanal coordination, and rectal sensation. Major findings not seen in healthy controls, as defined by the classification, include rectoanal areflexia, anal hypotension and hypocontractility, rectal hyposensitivity, and hypersensitivity. Minor and inconclusive findings that can be present in health and require additional information prior to diagnosis include anal hypertension and dyssynergia.

This framework introduces the IAPWG protocol and the London classification for disorders of anorectal function based on objective physiological measurements. It advocates for the use of a common language to describe the results of diagnostic tests and standard operating procedures, reaching a consensus on these practices.

### Viscoelastic assessment of anal canal function using acoustic reflectometry: a clinically useful technique [^116a88TM]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2012). Low credibility.

Anal acoustic reflectometry is a new reproducible technique that allows a viscoelastic assessment of anal canal function. Five new variables reflecting anal canal function are measured, including the opening and closing pressure, opening and closing elastance, and hysteresis.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the parameters measured in anal acoustic reflectometry are clinically valid between continent and fecally incontinent subjects. This was an age- and sex-matched study of continent and incontinent women conducted at a university teaching hospital. One hundred women (50 with fecal incontinence and 50 with normal bowel control) were included in the study, with subjects age-matched to within 5 years.

- **Main outcome measures**: Parameters measured with anal acoustic reflectometry and manometry were compared between incontinent and continent groups using a paired t-test. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using receiver operator characteristic curves.

Results indicated that four of the five anal acoustic reflectometry parameters at rest were significantly different between continent and incontinent women (e.g. opening pressure in fecally incontinent subjects was 31.6 vs. 51.5 cm H2O in continent subjects, p = 0.0001). Both anal acoustic reflectometry parameters of squeeze opening pressure and squeeze opening elastance were significantly reduced in the incontinent women compared with continent women (50 vs. 99.1 cm H2O, p = 0.0001 and 1.48 vs. 1.83 cm H2O/mm, p = 0.012). In terms of diagnostic accuracy, opening pressure at rest was found to be a significant measure.

### Correlation between echodefecography and 3-dimensional vaginal ultrasonography in the detection of perineal descent in women with constipation symptoms [^116rGVVc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

Defecography is an established method for evaluating dynamic anorectal dysfunction; however, conventional defecography does not allow visualization of anatomic structures.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to describe the use of dynamic 3-dimensional endovaginal ultrasonography for evaluating perineal descent compared to echodefecography (3-dimensional anorectal ultrasonography) and to study the relationship between perineal descent and symptoms, as well as anatomic/functional abnormalities of the pelvic floor.

- **Design**: This was a prospective study conducted at a large university tertiary care hospital.

- **Patients**: Consecutive female patients were eligible if they had pelvic floor dysfunction, obstructed defecation symptoms, and a score > 6 on the Cleveland Clinic Florida Constipation Scale.

- **Interventions**: Each patient underwent both echodefecography and dynamic 3-dimensional endovaginal ultrasonography to evaluate posterior pelvic floor dysfunction.

- **Main outcome measures**: Normal perineal descent was defined on echodefecography as puborectalis muscle displacement ≤ 2.5 cm; excessive perineal descent was defined as displacement > 2.5 cm.

Results showed that of 61 women, 29 (48%) had normal perineal descent, while 32 (52%) had excessive perineal descent. Endovaginal ultrasonography identified 27 of the 29 patients in the normal group as having anorectal junction displacement ≤ 1 cm (mean = 0.6 cm; range, 0.1–1.0 cm) and a mean anorectal junction position of 0.6 cm (range, 0–2.3 cm) above the symphysis pubis during the Valsalva maneuver.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^113XaK4M]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study was to assess the relation between the position and mobility of the perineum and patients' symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Patients' symptoms were measured with the use of validated questionnaires. Univariate logistic regression analyses were employed to investigate the relationship between the questionnaire domain scores and the perineal position on dynamic MR imaging, along with baseline characteristics such as age, body mass index, and parity.

- **Results**: Sixty-nine women were included in the analysis. Only the domain score for genital prolapse was associated with the perineal position on dynamic MR imaging, and this association was strongest at rest.

- **Conclusions**: Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms were linked to the degree of descent of the perineum on dynamic MR imaging. However, perineal descent was not related to anorectal or urinary incontinence symptoms.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of rectal prolapse [^115Amv9S]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for rectal prolapse, specifically concerning anal physiology testing, the ASCRS 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining anal physiologic testing. This testing is essential to assess and treat coexisting functional disorders associated with rectal prolapse, such as constipation or fecal incontinence.

### Normal values for high-resolution anorectal manometry in healthy women: Effects of age and significance of rectoanal gradient [^112338ed]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) is used to measure anal pressures in clinical practice, but normal values have not been available. Although rectal evacuation is assessed by the rectoanal gradient during simulated evacuation, there is substantial overlap between healthy individuals and those with defecatory disorders. The effects of age remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of age on anorectal pressures and rectal balloon expulsion in healthy women.

Anorectal pressures (HRM), rectal sensation, and balloon expulsion time (BET) were evaluated in 62 asymptomatic women ranging in age from 21 to 80 years (median age 44 years) without risk factors for anorectal trauma. Of these, 30 women were aged in their 60s, and 32 women had rectal BET, but 52 had higher anal than rectal pressures (i.e. negative gradient) during simulated evacuation. The gradient was more negative in younger women (-41 (6) mmHg) than in older women (-12 (6) mmHg) and was negatively correlated (r = -0.51, P < 0.0001) with rectal BET, explaining only 16% of the variation in rectal BET.

These observations provide normal values for anorectal pressures by HRM. Increasing age is associated with lower anal resting pressure and a more positive rectoanal gradient during evaluation.

### Measurements of pelvic floor dyssynergia: which test result matters [^1148QG8c]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Failure to expel a 60-mL balloon on manometry and abnormal relaxation of the anal sphincter on electromyographic testing are frequently used to diagnose pelvic floor dyssynergia. However, the relationship between these two test results and their relationship to defecography is poorly characterized. We aimed to describe this relationship and create a predictive model for pelvic floor dyssynergia on defecography.

From March 2008 to April 2010, consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of functional constipation were evaluated at our Pelvic Floor Disorders Center, and the results of their workups were collected prospectively. Sixty-three patients with pelvic floor dyssynergia on defecography were compared with 60 patients without dyssynergia in terms of manometry pressures, electromyographic text results, and balloon expulsion testing results.

Of 125 patients meeting Rome II symptom criteria for constipation, 123 patients underwent defecography, and of these, 63 (51.2%) had evidence of pelvic floor dyssynergia. Patients with and without dyssynergia had a slight difference in mean resting pressures (62.8 mmHg vs 49.5 mmHg, P = 0.02) and no discernable differences in rectal sensitivity and compliance: first sensation (56.5 vs 62.5, P = 0.34) and maximum tolerated volume (164.2 vs 191.2, P = 0.09).

It appeared that abnormalities in electromyographic relaxation and balloon expulsion occurred in the same patients: 84.1% of patients with abnormal electromyographic results also did not expel the balloon.

### Anal sphincter morphology in patients with full-thickness rectal prolapse [^114CrWvA]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the morphologic change of the anal canal in patients with rectal prolapse.

- **Methods**: The endoanal ultrasound scans of 18 patients with rectal prolapse were compared with those of 23 asymptomatic controls. The thickness and area of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) and submucosa were measured at three levels.

- **Results**: Qualitatively, patients with rectal prolapse showed a characteristic elliptical morphology in the anal canal with anterior/posterior submucosal distortion accounting for most of the change. Quantitatively, IAS and submucosa thicknesses and area were greater in all quadrants of the anal canal, especially the upper quadrant, in patients with rectal prolapse compared with controls. There was statistical evidence, in a regression model, of a relationship between increases in all measured variables and the finding of rectal prolapse.

- **Conclusions**: The cause of sphincter distortion in rectal prolapse is unknown but may be a response to increased mechanical stress placed on the sphincter from the prolapse or an abnormal response by the sphincter complex to the prolapse. Patients found to have this feature on endoanal ultrasound should undergo clinical examination and defecography to look for rectal wall abnormalities.

### Current and future perspectives on the utility of provocative tests of anal sphincter function: A state-of-the-art summary [^117VdFMg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

The maintenance of fecal continence depends upon coordinated interactions between the pelvic floor, anorectum, and anal sphincter complex, orchestrated by central and peripheral neural activities. Techniques to objectively measure anorectal function rely on fixed diameter catheters placed inside the anal canal, with a rectal balloon to obtain measurements of anal resting and squeeze function, and rectal compliance. Until recently, it had not been possible to measure the distensibility of the anal canal, or in other words, its ability to resist opening against increasing pressure, which has been proposed as the main determinant of a biological sphincter's function. Anal acoustic reflectometry (AAR) and the functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) are two novel, provocative techniques that dynamically assess the anal sphincter complex under volume-controlled distension. In doing so, both provide information on the viscoelastic properties of the anal canal and offer new insights into its function.

- **Purpose**: This review details the potential future applications of AAR and FLIP and highlights the unanswered questions relevant to these new technologies.

### Anal sphincter function in rectal intussusception and high and low "take-off" external rectal prolapse-a prospective observational study [^1153LDcr]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Low credibility.

The resulting measurements are used to create a graph of cross-sectional area (CSA) versus pressure to calculate anal acoustic reflectometry (AAR) variables at the point of the minimum CSA. At rest, five parameters are observed, including the opening pressure (Op, cmH₂O), which reflects the pressure at which the anal canal starts to open during distension. The closing pressure (Cp, cmH₂O) is the pressure at which the anal canal closes again following an episode of distension. Opening elastance (Oe, cmH₂O/mm²) and closing elastance (Ce, cmH₂O/mm²) reflect the resistance of the anal canal to distension or the resistance to closure, respectively. Hysteresis (Hys, %) reflects the amount of energy dissipated during one cycle of opening and closing of the anal canal.

Two parameters are calculated during voluntary contraction: squeeze opening pressure (SqOp, cmH₂O) and squeeze opening elastance (SqOe, cmH₂O/mm²). The difference between SqOp and Op is defined as the incremental squeeze opening pressure (IncSqOp, cmH₂O) and reflects the maximum pressure generated by striated muscle during a squeeze, above the Op at rest. These measured parameters and their clinical significance have been discussed previously.

### Pathophysiology of adult fecal incontinence [^113DV7NM]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence occurs when the normal anatomy or physiology that maintains the structure and function of the anorectal unit is disrupted. Incontinence usually results from the interplay of multiple pathogenic mechanisms and is rarely attributable to a single factor. The internal anal sphincter (IAS) provides most of the resting anal pressure and is reinforced during voluntary squeeze by the external anal sphincter (EAS), the anal mucosal folds, and the anal endovascular cushions. Disruption or weakness of the EAS can cause urge-related or diarrhea-associated fecal incontinence. Damage to the endovascular cushions may produce a poor anal "seal" and an impaired anorectal sampling reflex. The ability of the rectum to perceive the presence of stool leads to the rectoanal contractile reflex response, an essential mechanism for maintaining continence. Pudendal neuropathy can diminish rectal sensation and lead to excessive accumulation of stool, causing fecal impaction, mega-rectum, and fecal overflow.

The puborectalis muscle plays an integral role in maintaining the anorectal angle. Its nerve supply is independent of the sphincter, and its precise role in maintaining continence needs to be defined. Obstetric trauma, the most common cause of anal sphincter disruption, may involve the EAS, the IAS, and the pudendal nerves, singly or in combination. It remains unclear why most women who sustain obstetric injury in their 20s or 30s typically do not present with fecal incontinence until their 50s. There is a strong need for prospective, long-term studies of sphincter function.

### Relationship between anal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFLIP®) results and the clinical presentation of faecal incontinence [^1143uFKu]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Each FI patient underwent a clinical examination and a battery of pelvic floor examinations, including three-dimensional high-resolution anorectal manometry (3D-HRAM) or water-perfused anorectal manometry, depending on the time period, as well as electrophysiological and endoanal ultrasound tests. An anoscopy-rectoscopy was performed to assess anorectal intussusception and prolapse. Water-perfused anorectal manometry and 3D-HRAM, endoanal ultrasounds, electrophysiological tests, and anoscopy-rectoscopy were performed as previously described.

Regardless of the type of manometry used (3D-HR or water-perfused), maneuvers were performed with a standard sequence that included a 30-second recovery period between each maneuver:

- **Rest**: Anorectal pressures were measured with the subject relaxed following a 15-minute rest period.
- **Squeeze**: The subject was instructed to squeeze the anal canal as strongly and for as long as possible (two attempts). The best performance of the two trials was selected and used for the analysis.

The rectal sensory test involved inflating a rectal balloon with air in 10 mL increments using a handheld syringe and recording the threshold volumes and pressures for minimal sensation and maximum tolerated volume.

The likely underlying mechanisms of FI were determined based on clinical assessment, anorectal manometry, EndoFLIP®, and anoscopy-rectoscopy results. Nine possible isolated or associated underlying mechanisms for FI were identified for each patient, such as anal hypocontractility, which is characterized by abnormal maximal voluntary squeeze pressure and/or duration.

### Phenotypic variation in functional disorders of defecation [^112VuCFR]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Aims: Although obstructed defecation is generally attributed to pelvic floor dyssynergia, clinical observations suggest a wider spectrum of anorectal disturbances. Our aim was to characterize phenotypic variability in constipated patients by anorectal assessments.

Methods: Anal pressures, rectal balloon expulsion, rectal sensation, and pelvic floor structure (by endoanal magnetic resonance imaging) and motion (by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging) were assessed in 52 constipated women and 41 age-matched asymptomatic women. Phenotypes were characterized in patients by principal components analysis of these measurements.

Results: Among patients, 16 had a hypertensive anal sphincter, 41 had an abnormal rectal balloon expulsion test, and 20 had abnormal rectal sensation. Forty-nine patients (94%) exhibited abnormal pelvic floor motion during evacuation and/or squeeze. After correcting for age and body mass index, three principal components explained 71% of variance between patients. These factors were weighted most strongly by perineal descent during evacuation (factor 1), anorectal location at rest (factor 2), and anal resting pressure (factor 3). Factors 1 and 3 discriminated between controls and patients. Compared to patients with normal (n = 23) or reduced (n = 18) perineal descent, patients with increased (n = 11) descent were more likely (P 90 mm Hg) to have a normal rectal balloon expulsion test result.

Conclusions: These observations demonstrate that functional defecation disorders comprise a heterogeneous group characterized by diverse phenotypic variations.

### The international anorectal physiology working group (IAPWG) recommendations: Standardized testing protocol and the London classification for disorders of anorectal function [^113PCofV]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

The group acknowledges a number of limitations of this consensus document. Firstly, due to the nature of variability in practice, paucity of data supporting protocol elements, and in particular, the recent introduction of HR-ARM, the vast majority of recommendations reflect a coalescence of expert opinion, rather than a systematic review of clinical evidence. The reader should, therefore, bear in mind that what is not normal does not necessarily constitute disease, and outcome studies to assess the clinical utility of this classification for the direction of specific interventions are needed. Refinement of the classification system will occur as further data emerge. Nevertheless, we believe that further improvement in practice can only begin from a common starting point, and the presented consensus reflects that sentiment.

Secondly, due to the nature of the task at hand, the consensus describes only three simple office-based tests of function. In particular, as multiple factors are involved in the control of continence and evacuation, the RST and the BET are generally considered as screening tests to be used prior to a full assessment with other investigations. Should an abnormality be demonstrated, a comprehensive pelvic floor evaluation may involve a more thorough assessment with complementary investigations of structure or function, such as endoanal ultrasound, barium/magnetic resonance defecography, and the rectal barostat, which may confirm (or refute) physiological findings such as dyssynergia that are currently labeled as 'inconclusive' by the London classification.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of anal motor and rectal sensory dysfunction in male and female patients undergoing anorectal manometry for symptoms of faecal incontinence [^114CUFCs]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Overall, anal hypocontractility was the most common abnormality in both women and men. In individual studies, the prevalence of anal hypocontractility generally exceeded that of anal hypotonia, with rates of hypocontractility being nearly always greater in women than in men. The risk for anal sphincter barrier dysfunction is greatest in women due to obstetric injuries, including structural defects and pudendal neuropathy, while in men, sphincter barrier dysfunction is generally considered to be iatrogenic. However, even in the absence of structural sphincter defects, chronic straining at stool and subsequent pelvic floor denervation may also lead to hypocontractility in both men and women. Constipation and faecal incontinence (FI) are known to coexist in a sizeable proportion of patients with FI.

While the prevalence of male hypotonia was reduced in more recent studies, perhaps due to more sphincter-sparing surgery, the prevalence of anal hypotonia and hypocontractility in women remained consistent over the duration of the included studies (over 30 years). This is likely because the lag between sphincter injury and symptom occurrence in women is usually several decades, meaning that the benefits of any change in obstetric practice, such as the move from posterior to mediolateral episiotomy, have yet to translate to observed changes in physiology. Notably, excluding patients with sphincter defects did not reduce the prevalence of hypocontractility in relation to other studies. Bharucha et al. was the only other study to specifically exclude patients with sphincter defects and report similar findings.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^113Zruc4]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, no previous studies have assessed patients' BMI in relation to perineal descent. Although a high BMI seems a theoretical risk factor for perineal descent, no association could be established. The same held true for age and parity, although others have previously described a relation with perineal descent for these parameters.

We have assessed the agreement between the perineal position during straining and POP-Q points Ba, C, and Bp. No statistically significant correlation has been found (data not shown). The study was performed in a tertiary referral center. One of the reasons for referral to our center is when there is a discrepancy between symptoms and clinical findings, implying that patients where POP-Q findings could not explain symptoms were overrepresented. Therefore, this population is very appropriate for assessing a relation between symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction and less obvious measurements such as perineal descent. Even in this population, where rare conditions are expected to be overrepresented, perineal descent only showed a limited correlation with symptoms. In our opinion, this shows that the clinical value of this measurement is probably limited.

The observational character of this study is a limitation. Only 60% of the women who had dynamic MR imaging investigation of the pelvic floor had returned or completed the questionnaires. Furthermore, MR imaging was performed as part of routine clinical practice in patients with prolapse, especially in the posterior compartment. Consequently, these women had only lit

### Optimizing the utility of anorectal manometry for diagnosis and therapy: A roundtable review and recommendations [^114fWenm]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Anorectal manometry (ARM) is recognized as an accurate test for diagnosing fecal incontinence (FI) with notable intrapatient repeatability. However, there is some day-to-day variability in anorectal pressures, especially during simulated evacuation. Approaches have been proposed to reverse engineer intrapatient data. As the summary variables derived from standard software include only a fraction of the actual data captured during ARM, this reverse-engineering approach provides a way to extract and analyze raw data. This could potentially offer a more useful summary of rectoanal pressure variables, though further study is needed.

Several types of dyssynergia have been identified by ARM and shown to be reproducible. Although the type of dyssynergia does not affect diagnosis or outcomes, it informs both the biofeedback therapist and the patient about which aspects of biofeedback therapy (BT) will help achieve normal bowel function. It also indicates how to tailor the treatment based on pathophysiological dysfunction.

Overcoming these challenges requires the engagement of researchers, academicians, community physicians, and advanced practice providers. Healthcare practitioners need to understand the importance of ARM, the indications or contraindications, and when or where to refer. Likewise, community physicians and institutions should consider incorporating this technology to improve care for patients with anorectal disorders. Data demonstrating the impact of ARM on management decisions and treatment outcomes are needed. These limitations can be addressed through increased knowledge and the perceived value of ARM.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^116aZJTe]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

This observational dynamic MR imaging study examines the relationship between the position and mobility of the perineum and patients' symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction, such as anorectal dysfunction, prolapse, and urinary incontinence, using standardized questionnaires. The study found that only pelvic organ prolapse symptoms at rest were associated with the degree of perineal descent. There was no association between perineal descent and symptoms of anorectal dysfunction or urinary incontinence.

The present results align with earlier studies regarding symptoms of constipation, rectal or pelvic pain, and urinary incontinence. The vast majority of studies produced evidence for the absence of a statistically significant correlation with perineal descent. Previous studies on the relationship between perineal descent and fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation were conflicting. In our study, we did not find a relation with respect to these symptoms.

- **Correlation with prolapse symptoms**: The available studies assessing prolapse symptoms in relation to perineal descent have also reported a statistically significant correlation. In one of these studies, perineal descent was assessed using dynamic MR imaging. In accordance with the present study, the pubococcygeal line and the sphincter ani muscle were used as a reference line and measurement point. In contrast, however, Hoyte et al. reported no significant difference between the measurement of the perineum at rest in patients with and without symptoms of prolapse, but found a statistically significant difference during other conditions.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^111857Yc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Dynamic MR imaging protocol: The dynamic MR imaging was performed with the patient in the supine position, with parallel and slightly flexed legs. Patients were requested not to void for 1–2 hours prior to the examination. The rectum was opacified using 100–150 mL ultrasound gel, while the urethra, bladder, and vagina were not opacified. No premedication was given. MR images were acquired using a 3T MR scanner (TIM TRIO, Siemens Medical, Germany) and an eight-channel body phased-array coil.

MR images were obtained in the midsagittal plane using a half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo sequence (2000 ms/90 ms repetition time/echo time; 150° flip angle), with a temporal resolution of 1 second during 2 minutes. During the MR examination, the patient was asked to relax the pelvic floor muscles, contract the muscles slowly, relax again, and then increase the intra-abdominal pressure and strain to simulate defecation. To ensure compliance with the instructions, all images were viewed online on the MR console. A whirl of urine in the bladder and/or a dent into the cranial portion of the bladder indicated adequate straining.

The images were analyzed at a later stage on a console with zoom facilities and electronic calipers. The observer was blinded to the patients' symptoms and the clinical findings. Maximum strain images were used to assess the prolapse. The perineal position was determined as the perpendicular distance between the pubococcygeal line and the caudal margin of the sphincter ani muscle in centimeters, both at rest and during maximal strain.

### High-resolution anorectal manometry for identifying defecatory disorders and rectal structural abnormalities in women [^114ZZFTx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, the rectoanal gradient during evacuation is negative in many healthy people, undermining the utility of anorectal high-resolution manometry (HRM) for diagnosing defecatory disorders. We aimed to compare HRM and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing rectal evacuation and structural abnormalities.

We performed a retrospective analysis of 118 patients (all female; 51 with constipation, 48 with fecal incontinence, and 19 with rectal prolapse; age, 53 ± 1 years) assessed by HRM, the rectal balloon expulsion test (BET), and MRI at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from February 2011 through March 2013. Thirty healthy asymptomatic women (age, 37 ± 2 years) served as controls. We used principal components analysis of HRM variables to identify rectoanal pressure patterns associated with rectal prolapse and phenotypes of patients with prolapse.

Compared with patients with normal findings from the rectal BET, patients with an abnormal BET had lower median rectal pressure (36 vs. 22 mm Hg, P = 0.002), a more negative median rectoanal gradient (-6 vs. -29 mm Hg, P = 0.006) during evacuation, and a lower proportion of evacuation on the basis of MRI analysis (median of 40% vs. 80%, P < .0001). A score derived from rectal pressure and anorectal descent during evacuation and a patulous anal canal was associated (P = 0.005) with large rectoceles (3 cm or larger). A principal component (PC) logistic model discriminated between patients with and without prolapse with 96% accuracy. Among patients with prolapse, there were distinct phenotypes identified.

### Dynamic anal endosonography and MRI defecography in diagnosis of pelvic floor disorders: Comparison with conventional defecography [^11216DLE]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Pelvic floor disorders are common, particularly in women, which makes it critical for surgeons to have accurate diagnostic tools to inform therapeutic decisions. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of dynamic anorectal endosonography and dynamic MRI defecography with conventional defecography as the criterion standard in diagnosing pelvic floor disorders.

A prospective crossover design was employed, with patients undergoing each procedure in random order within the same month. The investigations took place at a regional referral center in Marseille, France, and included women with dyschezia who were undergoing diagnostic evaluation.

Dynamic anorectal endosonography, dynamic MRI, and conventional defecography were performed on all patients by three blinded operators. The main outcome measure was the accuracy of dynamic anorectal endosonography and dynamic MRI, assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, correlation coefficients, concordance rates, and the Cohen κ statistic, using conventional defecography as the criterion standard.

The study involved 56 women with a mean age of 50.7 years (SD, 12.5). No significant differences were found between dynamic anorectal endosonography and dynamic MRI regarding the number of patients with rectocele (P = 0.49), perineal descent (P = 0.11 when measuring descent of the puborectalis muscle; p = 0.27 for bladder descent).

### Rectal sensorimotor dysfunction in patients with urge faecal incontinence: Evidence from prolonged manometric studies [^111jPuPq]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

Although external anal sphincter dysfunction is the major cause of urge faecal incontinence, approximately 50% of such patients have evidence of rectal hypersensitivity and report exaggerated stool frequency and urgency. The contribution of rectosigmoid contractile activity to the pathophysiology of this condition is unclear, and thus the relations between symptoms, rectal sensation, and rectosigmoid motor function were investigated.

- **Methods**: Fifty-two consecutive patients with urge faecal incontinence, referred to a tertiary surgical centre, and 24 volunteers underwent comprehensive anorectal physiological investigation, including prolonged rectosigmoid manometry. Patients were classified on the basis of balloon distension thresholds into those with rectal hypersensitivity (n = 27) and those with normal rectal sensation (n = 25). Automated quantitative analysis of overall rectosigmoid contractile activities and, specifically, high amplitude contractions and rectal motor complex activity was performed.

- **Results**: External anal sphincter dysfunction was similar in both patient groups. Overall, phasic activity and high amplitude contraction frequency were greater, and rectal motor complex variables significantly altered, in those with rectal hypersensitivity. Symptoms, more prevalent in the rectal hypersensitivity group, were also more often associated with rectosigmoid contractile events. For individuals, reduced compliance and increased rectal motor complex frequency were only observed in patients with rectal hypersensitivity.

### Rectal hyposensitivity is uncommon and unlikely to be the central cause of obstructed defecation in patients with high-grade internal rectal prolapse [^111FHp6r]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

There are several causes of obstructed defecation, one of which is thought to be internal rectal prolapse. Operations directed at internal prolapse, such as laparoscopic ventral rectopexy, may significantly improve symptoms of obstructed defecation. It is not clear whether the obstructed defecation with internal prolapse is a mechanical phenomenon or results from changes in rectal sensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate rectal sensory function in patients with obstructed defecation and high-grade internal rectal prolapse.

- **Methods**: This study represents a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of patients attending a tertiary referral pelvic floor unit. Patients with high-grade (recto-anal) intussusception constituted the basis of this study. Rectal sensory function was determined by intrarectal balloon inflation. Three parameters — sensory threshold, urge to defecate, and maximum tolerated volumes — were recorded. Abnormal sensitivity was defined as partial (one or two parameters abnormal) or total (all three abnormal).

- **Key results**: Four hundred and eight patients with high-grade internal rectal prolapse, with and without obstructed defecation symptoms, were studied. Two hundred and forty-one (59%) had normal sensation. Eighteen (4%) had total hyposensitivity and three (1%) had total hypersensitivity. A further 96 (24%) had partial hyposensitivity, while 50 (12%) had partial hypersensitivity. Neither hypersensitivity nor hyposensitivity differed between patients with and without symptoms of obstructed defecation.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Rectal hyposensitivity does not appear to be a central cause of obstructed defecation in patients with high-grade internal rectal prolapse.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^115FC7jr]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Overall, 700 new patients with urogynecological symptoms were evaluated during the study period. One hundred and twenty women underwent dynamic MR imaging of the pelvic floor. Sixty-nine of these women had completed the questionnaires and were included in the study. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics such as age, pelvic organ prolapse questionnaire (POP-Q), and number of previous gynecological operations in the women who did and did not return the questionnaires.

Women's baseline characteristics, clinical measurements, and dynamic MR imaging measurements are shown in Table 1. All women had at least one vaginal delivery. Ninety percent of the women had a history of one or more gynecological operations, i.e. hysterectomy, POP surgery, or urinary incontinence surgery. There were some negative values of the calculated value of perineal mobility, which were within the range of reproducibility, except for two values which were the result of levator coactivation during straining, and thus perineal elevation.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^112mxPqA]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study was to assess the relation between the position and mobility of the perineum and patients' symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Patients' symptoms were measured with the use of validated questionnaires. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to study the relationship between the questionnaire domain scores and the perineal position on dynamic MR imaging, as well as baseline characteristics such as age, body mass index, and parity.

- **Results**: Sixty-nine women were included in the analysis. Only the domain score for genital prolapse was associated with the perineal position on dynamic MR imaging. This association was strongest at rest.

- **Conclusions**: Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms were associated with the degree of descent of the perineum on dynamic MR imaging. Perineal descent was not related to anorectal and/or urinary incontinence symptoms.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^115KqBiC]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Perineal descent has been assessed in one direction and one plane only. It remains unknown whether the movement direction of the perineum during strain varies and if perineal bulging was adequately assessed. Our study did not evaluate parallel displacement in relation to the pubococcygeal line, focusing solely on perpendicular displacement, which may be a relevant limitation. The presence of a levator ani hernia, whether unilateral or bilateral, has been associated with perineal descent; however, its significance and presence were not assessed in this study. Dynamic MR imaging assessment in the coronal or axial plane could be a valuable addition to evaluating patients presenting with perineal descent. To date, no significant differences in anorectal dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and pelvic pain symptoms in patients with or without a levator ani hernia have been described.

It is conceivable that symptoms associated with perineal descent remain undefined because the appropriate questions were not asked. Significant perineal descent might, for instance, be associated with a heavy feeling in the lower abdomen and pelvic floor, which were not covered in the questionnaires; further research is necessary in this area.

In conclusion, only symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse were associated with the degree of perineal descent, whereas anorectal and urinary symptoms were not.

### Clinical and physiological findings, and possible aetiological factors of rectal hyposensitivity [^114s57YA]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Rectal hyposensitivity (RH) relates to insensitivity of the rectum on anorectal physiological investigation and appears common in functional bowel disorders. The clinical significance of this physiological abnormality is unclear.

- **Method**: RH was defined as one or more sensory threshold volumes raised beyond the normal range (mean plus two standard deviations) on rectal balloon distension. Clinical information and results of other anorectal physiological investigations were evaluated in 261 patients with RH.

- **Results**: Patients with RH most commonly presented with constipation (48 percent), constipation and incontinence in combination (27 percent), or fecal incontinence (20 percent). Thirty-eight percent of patients had a history of previous pelvic surgery, 22 percent a history of anal surgery, and 13 percent a history of spinal trauma. In patients with RH presenting with symptoms of constipation or incontinence, impaired rectal sensation was the only abnormality on physiological investigation in 48 percent and 31 percent, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with RH display marked heterogeneity in terms of presenting symptoms. The exact causes of RH are unknown, but there is evidence to suggest that pelvic nerve injury and spinal trauma are possible aetiological factors. RH appears important in the aetiology of both constipation and fecal incontinence and may be useful as a predictor of surgical outcome.

### Anal acoustic reflectometry: A new reproducible technique providing physiological assessment of anal sphincter function [^117WNi7d]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Anal acoustic reflectometry is a new technique for assessing anal sphincter function. Five new variables reflecting anal canal function are measured: the opening and closing pressure, the opening and closing elastance, and hysteresis.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to compare the reproducibility of this new technique, in terms of test-retest and interrater reliability, with manometry, the standard test of sphincter function.

- **Design**: This is a comparative study of reproducibility between anal acoustic reflectometry and manometry.

- **Settings**: This study was conducted at a university hospital (outpatient clinic and endoscopy unit).

- **Patients**: Twenty-six (21 female) subjects were assessed with both anal acoustic reflectometry and manometry on two separate occasions (test-retest reliability). Additionally, 22 (16 female) subjects were assessed with both methods by two separate investigators (interrater reliability).

- **Main outcome measures**: Reproducibility was assessed according to the Bland-Altman method.

- **Results**: All of the measured novel anal acoustic reflectometry parameters had acceptable mean differences and repeatability coefficients. A comparison of the two methods of sphincter assessment (anal acoustic reflectometry vs manometry) was made for measurements taken at rest and during voluntary contraction. There was no significant difference in terms of test-retest reliability between the manometry maximum resting pressure vs the reflectometry opening pressure (P = 0.57) or manometry maximum squeeze pressure vs the reflectometry squeeze opening pressure (P = 0.68).

The clinical management of patients with anorectal and pelvic floor dysfunction is often challenging. Evacuation proctography has evolved from a method originally used to evaluate the anorectum for functional disorders to its status as a practical approach for assessing anorectal dysfunction and pelvic floor prolapse. It boasts a high observer accuracy and a significant yield in positive diagnoses. Clinicians find it of substantial benefit as it has substantially altered management strategies between surgical and medical approaches in numerous cases.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of anal motor and rectal sensory dysfunction in male and female patients undergoing anorectal manometry for symptoms of faecal incontinence [^114z8cnJ]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Outcome data were selected to reflect the specific aims of the review, namely to determine the pooled prevalence of anal hypotonia/hypocontractility and rectal hypersensitivity/hyposensitivity in male and female FI patients. These data (hereafter denoted primary outcomes) were extracted as the proportion of the patient population studied whose measures of anal motor function or rectal sensory function fell below the lower limit of normal defined in referenced healthy control subjects. In addition, data were collected on publication year, country of origin, study design, study period, mean or median age of study participants, types of FI, definitions of FI, total number of HVs, and cut‐off values and definitions used to determine 'abnormal' for each outcome measure. Type of equipment and method used to perform anorectal manometry and/or rectal sensitivity testing were also recorded.

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Case–Control Studies. Two reviewers independently scored included studies out of a maximum of 12 points, with 1 point gained for each 'yes' answer, indicating that the study met the quality condition being assessed. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and a third reviewer (SMS) was consulted if required for resolution. Parameters assessed were research question, methods of randomization, study population, sample size justification, random selection of study participants, and controls.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^1124QbZU]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The descending perineum syndrome was first described in 1966 by Parks et al. Typically, the syndrome is described as ballooning of the perineum several centimeters below the bony outlet of the pelvis during strain, although descent can also occur at rest.

One of the main causes is thought to be excessive and repetitive straining. This straining forces the anterior rectal wall to protrude into the anal canal and creates a sensation of incomplete defecation and weakness of the pelvic floor musculature. In turn, this causes more straining, and a vicious cycle is established. Other possible causes reported are weakness of the muscles of the pelvic floor caused by either the neuropathic degeneration of muscle that accompanies old age, or trauma to the pelvic floor muscles or their nerve supply during pregnancy and childbirth.

Abnormal perineal descent has been described in relation to a variety of anorectal disorders such as constipation, fecal incontinence, obstructed defecation, and rectal or pelvic pain. A systematic review of these clinical studies, however, did not show an association of perineal descent with constipation and rectal or pelvic pain, and the existing data on the association of perineal descent with fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation were conflicting. Only a few papers have reported on the relation of perineal descent with symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. In these studies, prolapse symptoms seemed to be associated with the degree of perineal descent, whereas an association with stress urinary incontinence was not conclusively established.

### International urogynecology consultation chapter 2 committee 3: The clinical evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse including investigations into associated morbidity/pelvic floor dysfunction [^117DPA7t]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Several studies compared various defecography imaging modalities with each other. Difficulties in evaluating the existing literature included the use of various methods for assessing prolapse on physical examination, such as the Baden–Walker halfway system, the POP-Q system, and several manuscript-specific non-standardized examination techniques. In addition, various methods of performing the imaging and interpreting the results were described. In studies of fluoroscopic defecography, there was variability in which compartments were opacified with contrast; although the rectum was universally opacified, other possible compartments included the bladder, vagina, perineum, peritoneum, and small bowel.

Three studies of fluoroscopic defecography found that this imaging modality detected more enteroceles than physical examination. Two studies found that MRI defecography was able to diagnose enteroceles more readily than physical examination, and one of these found that MRI defecography was also able to diagnose more enteroceles than fluoroscopic defecography. Two studies found that sigmoidoceles were not diagnosed on examination but were identified by fluoroscopic defecography. One study found that the size of the posterior vaginal wall prolapse, as assessed by physical examination, was associated with the finding of enterocele and/or rectal intussusception on fluoroscopic defecography.

Patient symptoms were assessed in two studies, which found that defecatory symptoms were not significantly associated with findings on radiographic imaging or examination.

### Relationship between anal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFLIP®) results and the clinical presentation of faecal incontinence [^114mDk6c]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

We studied the relationship between anal distensibility index (DI) and faecal incontinence (FI) subtype using the EndoFLIP® system. A weak relationship was detected between the anal DI at rest at 50 mL of distension and passive FI. A dysfunction of the internal anal sphincter may lead to poor sealing of the anal canal at rest, causing passive FI. Similarly, dysfunction of the external anal sphincter may result in insufficient closure of the anal canal when stool arrives in the rectum, leading to urge incontinence. Given these two mechanisms, we expected to correlate urge FI with external anal sphincter dysfunction and passive FI with internal anal sphincter dysfunction. However, as previously reported, we did not find any significant difference in the distribution of anal hypocontractility and anal hypotonia recorded by anal manometry between the three FI subtypes.

The frequency of anatomical and/or neuropathic sphincter lesions was not related to a particular FI subtype, as this is more likely to represent the potential cause of the dysfunction rather than the dysfunction itself. Given the superiority of the EndoFLIP® system in quantifying resistance to anal distension, an important variable for anal continence, it should be more accurate in detecting sphincter dysfunctions. In the present study, the resting anal DI at 50 mL of distension differed significantly, with the passive subtype having the highest values and the urge subtype the lowest. However, anal DI during voluntary contraction was not significantly different between the FI subtypes. The DI at squeeze may more reflect the isolated action of the…

### The assessment and management of defecatory dysfunction: A critical appraisal [^1123Wt3E]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

To summarize recent advances in diagnostic modalities and management options for defecatory dysfunction and to highlight areas in need of further research, the following findings have been noted:

- **Recent findings**: The diagnostic utility of high-resolution anorectal manometry (ARM), a promising tool for diagnosing defecatory dysfunction, appears questionable in differentiating between disease and normal physiology. Discrepancies exist between results from various anorectal function tests for diagnosing defecatory dysfunction. New revisions in diagnostic criteria for defecatory dysfunction by the Rome IV consortium may enhance diagnostic yield.

- **Biofeedback as a treatment option**: Biofeedback remains the most effective evidence-based treatment for patients with defecatory dysfunction. However, the anorectal pressure profile cannot predict or mediate the success of biofeedback. It may improve symptoms through central effects.

Despite advances in ARM and defecography techniques, no test has emerged as the 'gold standard' for diagnosing defecatory dysfunction. The mechanism of action of biofeedback in treating defecatory dysfunction remains poorly understood.

### Update of tests of colon and rectal structure and function [^116qXrjz]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

This review addresses the indications, methods, strengths, and limitations of anorectal testing in clinical practice. In cases of chronic constipation, anal manometry and a rectal balloon expulsion test, occasionally supplemented by defecography, are useful for identifying a functional defecatory disorder because symptoms may respond to pelvic floor retraining.

In patients with fecal incontinence, diagnostic testing complements the clinical assessment by evaluating the pathophysiology and guiding management. Manometry measures anal resting and squeeze pressures, which predominantly reflect internal and external anal sphincter function, respectively. Defecation may be indirectly assessed by measuring the recto-anal pressure gradient during straining and by the rectal balloon expulsion test.

- **Endoanal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: These can identify anal sphincter structural pathology, which may be clinically occult and/or amenable to surgical repair. Only MRI can identify external sphincter atrophy, whereas ultrasound is more sensitive for internal sphincter imaging.

- **Barium defecography**: By characterizing rectal evacuation and puborectalis contraction, this technique may demonstrate an evacuation disorder, excessive perineal descent, or a rectocele. Dynamic MRI can provide similar information and also image the bladder and genital organs without radiation exposure.

Because the measurement of pudendal nerve latencies suffers from several limitations, anal sphincter electromyography is recommended when neurogenic sphincter weakness is suspected.

### Distensibility of the anal canal in patients with idiopathic fecal incontinence: A study with the functional lumen imaging probe [^112Zfx7t]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Anatomical structures and their distensibility vary along the length of the anal canal. The anal sphincter muscles possess dynamic properties that are not well-reflected by standard manometry. Abnormal distensibility of the anal canal may be significant in idiopathic fecal incontinence (IFI). The functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) facilitates detailed studies of the distensibility and axial variation of sphincters. We aimed to compare the segmental distensibility of the anal canal in patients with IFI and healthy subjects.

- **Methods**: The FLIP was used to distend the anal canal in 22 patients with IFI (17 female, age 27–82 years) and 21 healthy volunteers (18 female, age 32–73 years). The distensibility was determined from changes in luminal diameter. Closure of the anal canal during voluntary squeeze was computed as the combined length of the closed anal canal and time. The pressure-strain elastic modulus was computed at rest.

- **Key results**: In all subjects, the proximal anal canal was the most distensible segment. During distension at rest and during a squeeze, the middle and distal anal canal became significantly larger in IFI than in healthy individuals (F = 4.5, p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Patients with IFI have increased distensibility of the middle anal canal.

### American gastroenterological association medical position statement on constipation [^112oZv5f]. Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for constipation, specifically in the context of history and physical examination, the AGA 2013 guidelines recommend performing a careful digital rectal examination (DRE). This should include an assessment of pelvic floor motion during simulated evacuation in patients with chronic constipation before referring for anorectal manometry, recognizing that a normal DRE does not exclude defecatory disorders.

### Three-dimensional high-resolution anorectal manometry and diagnosis of excessive perineal descent: A comparative pilot study with defaecography [^1117Fsga]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Three-dimensional high-resolution anorectal manometry (3DHRAM) is a new technique that can simultaneously provide physiological and topographical data on the terminal part of the digestive tract. Our objective was to assess whether 3DHRAM is able to reliably diagnose excessive perineal descent already diagnosed with conventional defaecography, which is considered to be the gold standard.

- **Method**: All patients referred to our centre for anorectal manometry and conventional defaecography were evaluated with a maximum of six months between the two examinations. Anorectal manometry was performed using the 3D High-Resolution Given Imaging® probe. Excessive perineal descent was defined as the downward movement of the anal high-pressure zone during straining. At the end of the straining effort, the high-pressure zone regained its initial position, thereby indicating that the probe had not moved.

- **Results**: Nineteen female patients of median age 53 (21–70) years were included in the study. All cases with excessive perineal descent diagnosed using defaecography were visualized with 3DHRAM. The degree of perineal descent determined by 3D and conventional defaecography was compared (Spearman correlation 0.726, P = 0.01). In contrast, the averages measured were significantly different; the average was 11.68 ± 3.3 mm for 3DHRAM but 34.21 ± 13.3 mm for conventional defaecography (P = 0.002).

- **Conclusion**: The results of the study demonstrate that 3DHRAM can diagnose excessive perineal descent with the same degree of reliability as defaecography. Quantitative measures were not correlated, highlighting a significant difference in the average measurement of perineal descent between the two methods.

### Volumetric rectal perception testing: Is it clinically relevant? Results from a large patient cohort [^113xdZQK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Rectal perception testing is a recommended component of anorectal physiology testing. Recent consensus guidelines from London suggested criteria for categorizing hyporectal and hyper-rectal sensitivity, though these were based on scant evidence. Furthermore, data regarding the diagnostic capabilities and clinical utility of rectal perception testing are lacking. This study aimed to determine the association between rectal perception testing and both clinical and physiological variables to enhance the analysis and interpretation of real-life test results.

- **Methods**: Prospectively documented data from 1,618 patients (92% female) referred for anorectal physiology testing were analyzed for three rectal perception thresholds: first, urge, and maximal tolerated. Normal values derived from healthy female subjects were used to categorize each threshold into hyposensitive and hypersensitive to examine the clinical relevance of this categorization.

- **Results**: There was poor to moderate agreement between the three thresholds. Older age, male sex, and constipation were associated with higher perception thresholds, whereas irritable bowel syndrome, fecal incontinence, connective tissue disease, and pelvic radiation were associated with lower perception thresholds to some thresholds but not all (P < 0.01 on multivariate analysis for all). The clinical utility and limitations of categorizing thresholds into "hypersensitivity" and "hyposensitivity" were determined.

- **Discussion**: Commonly practiced rectal perception testing is correlated with several disease states and thus has clinical relevance.

### Digitation associated with defecation: What does it mean in urogynaecological patients [^1112nT3Z]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructed defecation is a common symptom complex in urogynaecological patients; perineal, vaginal, and/or anal digitation may be required for defecation. Translabial ultrasound can be used to assess anorectal anatomy, similar to defecation proctography. The aim of the present study was to determine the association between different forms of digitation (vaginal, perineal, and anal) and abnormal posterior compartment anatomy.

- **Methods**: A total of 271 patients were analyzed in a retrospective study utilizing archived ultrasound volume datasets. Symptoms of obstructed defecation (straining at stool, incomplete bowel emptying, perineal, vaginal, and anal digitation) were ascertained through interviews. Postprocessing of stored 3D/4D translabial ultrasound datasets obtained on maximal Valsalva was used to diagnose the descent of the rectal ampulla, rectocele, enterocele, and rectal intussusception at a later date, blinded to all clinical data.

- **Results**: Digitation was reported by 39% of our population. The position of the rectal ampulla on Valsalva was associated with perineal (p = 0.02) and vaginal (p = 0.02) digitation. The presence of a true rectocele was significantly associated with perineal (p = 0.04) and anal (p = 0.03) digitation. Rectocele depth was associated with all three forms of digitation (P = 0.005–0.02). The bother of symptoms of obstructed defecation was strongly associated with digitation (all P ≤ 0.001), with no appreciable difference in bother among the three forms.

- **Conclusion**: Digitation is common, and all forms of digitation are associated with obstructed defecation symptoms.

### The added value of conventional defecography and MRI defecography in clinical decision making on treatment for posterior compartment prolapse [^117BLc6F]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

The parameters assessed during radiological evaluation of the dynamic X-ray and MRI defecography scans included the presence and severity of rectocele, enterocele, peritoneocele (only on MRI), sigmoidocele, rectal intussusception, fecal residue, fecal incontinence, and measuring the anorectal angle (ARA, only on MRI).

- **Rectocele**: Radiologically quantified as the abnormal bulge depth in the rectum wall beyond the rectum wall's expected margin on the anterior side.
- **Enterocele, peritoneocele, and sigmoidocele**: Quantified as a herniation of a part of the peritoneum in the space between the rectum and the vagina below the proximal one-third of the vagina. Classified as enterocele when it consisted of the small intestine, peritoneocele when it consisted of fatty tissue, and sigmoidocele when it consisted of the sigmoid colon.
- **Rectal intussusception**: Radiologically quantified as an invagination of the rectal wall into the rectal lumen during defecation.
- **Fecal residue**: Described as a contrast agent in the rectum after defecation.
- **Fecal incontinence**: Described when the patient lost the fecal contrast agent before the defecation phase.
- **Anorectal angle (ARA)**: Measured between the anal canal and the posterior border of the distal part of the rectum. Normal physiological boundaries at rest range between 108° to 127°, with an approximate decrease of 15° to 20° during contraction and an approximate increase of 15° to 20° during Valsalva and defecation.

In cases of discrepancies between the X-ray and MRI defecography findings, the outcome of the conventional defecography was prioritized.

### What is the natural history of internal rectal prolapse [^113STy1z]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

The nature and clinical significance of internal rectal prolapse is controversial, and its natural history is unclear. Longitudinal cohort studies show a rare progression to external prolapse but lack adequate follow-up. We aimed to study the relationship of age to various stages of internal rectal prolapse using the Oxford Rectal Prolapse Grade (ORPG) and evaluate the influence of sex and vaginal delivery on this relationship.

- **Method**: Internal rectal prolapse (IRP) diagnosed at proctography and external rectal prolapse were graded using the ORPG. Age, sex, and obstetric history were documented. The mean age for each prolapse grade (1–5) was analyzed, and regression analysis was performed for age and prolapse. Subgroup analyses were conducted for males and females with (V+) and without (V0) a history of vaginal delivery.

- **Results**: Sixty males (11%) and 471 females (89%) were studied. The difference in the mean ages of each group was statistically significant (grade 1: 38.6; grade 2: 52.1; grade 3: 56.0; grade 4: 60.3; grade 5: 66.5, P < 0.0001). On average, males (8.7 years) and the V0-group (8.0 years) were younger than the V+ group (95% CI difference 4.5–12.9 years, P < 0.0001, and 3.8–12.2 years, P < 0.0001, respectively). Males and the V0-group had a weaker correlation between age and prolapse grade (r = 0.16 and r = 0.17, respectively, vs 0.41) and a faster prolapse progression rate than the V+ group.

- **Conclusion**: These data demonstrate a strong relationship between age and prolapse grade, supporting the view of internal rectal prolapse as a precursor to external prolapse in the spectrum of rectal conditions.

### The international anorectal physiology working group (IAPWG) recommendations: Standardized testing protocol and the London classification for disorders of anorectal function [^116VAtCg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). High credibility.

Symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, characterized by fecal incontinence and/or constipation/evacuation disorders, affect the quality of life of between 1% and 5% of the population. Anorectal manometry (ARM), the rectal sensory test (RST), and the balloon expulsion test (BET) are the best established investigations for objective assessment of anorectal sensorimotor function. Comprehensive assessment involves a series of measurements that describe voluntary and involuntary control of the anal canal, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) rectoanal coordination, evacuatory function, and rectal sensation.

Several studies have demonstrated that variations in hardware and protocol, particularly for ARM, influence results of these investigations and could impact diagnosis and management. Previous position statements and working party reports have already provided guidance on technique for data acquisition, analysis, and reporting. Despite this, a recent study conducted by our group showed ongoing widespread discordance in practice between institutions.

The introduction of high-resolution ARM (HR-ARM) has increased the spatial resolution of data acquisition and provides a continuous visualization of pressure activity from the rectum and the anal canal. This technique is now used in greater than 50% of institutions performing anorectal physiological tests. However, this advancement has added a further element of variability in practice. Unless efforts are made early to reach consensus on test performance, this techn…

### Ventral rectopexy: An international expert panel consensus and review of contemporary literature [^113wncv8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). High credibility.

Examination should involve perianal inspection for any deviation from the midline, and presence or absence of perineal descent; digital rectal examination to assess sphincter integrity, sphincter tone, sphincter squeeze, and coordination; and inspection for the presence of a rectocele and to exclude other pathology. Anoscopy is recommended alongside evaluation of prolapse, whether on the examination table or in the commode. A vaginal examination should be performed to ensure there is no concomitant posterior or anterior vaginal prolapse to the introitus, or patients should be examined by a urogynecologist.

This should all be undertaken in the context of trauma-informed care, in acknowledgment that many patients within this population do have a history of trauma, and that examinations are sensitive. Adopting such a practice can improve engagement, treatment, and outcomes.

- **Statement 5**: Consideration should be given to dynamic defecatory imaging, anorectal function testing, endoscopic evaluation, and a formal multidisciplinary review (91% consensus). Most patients should undergo dynamic defecatory imaging and endoscopic evaluation. In addition, anorectal function testing may be helpful to guide nonoperative management. Furthermore, it is recommended that a multidisciplinary review be undertaken before surgery.

Dynamic imaging, in the form of perineal echodefecography, fluoroscopic defecography, or MRI defecography, is recommended to help assess the biomechanics of the prolapse with the goal of informing operative techniques. Fluoroscopic imaging and MRI are the most frequent.
