## Question

Two month old dry skin patches on arms stomach and back

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 2-month-old infant with dry skin patches on the arms, stomach, and back. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why. Then, I should verify key differentials that can mimic this presentation in early infancy. Next, I will review red flags that would prompt urgent evaluation. After that, I need to outline a safe, evidence-based management plan, including bathing, emollients, and when to consider low-potency steroids. Finally, I should confirm follow-up triggers and what to do if the rash worsens or fails to respond as expected.

> Let me first confirm the most likely diagnosis. In a 2-month-old with dry, scaly patches on extensor surfaces and trunk, atopic dermatitis is the leading consideration, given its typical onset in early infancy and predilection for extensor involvement in this age group, often accompanied by xerosis and pruritus, though pruritus may be inferred from rubbing rather than reported directly in infants [^115uGTFP] [^112hWkJg].

> Wait, let me verify the key differentials so I don't jump to conclusions. Infantile seborrheic dermatitis can look similar but tends to favor the scalp, face, and intertriginous areas and is often less pruritic; psoriasis in infants is uncommon and typically shows thicker, silvery scale; tinea corporis can produce scaly annular plaques but is less likely to be diffuse on trunk and extensors at this age; contact dermatitis would require identifiable exposures and is less likely without a clear culprit; nutritional deficiencies like zinc or selenium would usually show periorificial, acral, or erosive features and systemic clues; and ichthyosis or other genodermatoses would present at birth or shortly thereafter with more generalized scaling or specific phenotypes, which we do not have here [^1136S5Qb] [^111FsqRX] [^115e8o9k] [^1174gRvP] [^1179cLMr].

> Hold on, I should review red flags that would change urgency. I need to check for widespread erosions, bullae, systemic symptoms such as fever or poor feeding, failure to thrive, alopecia, periorificial or acral distribution, or a history of recurrent infections, because these would push me toward alternative diagnoses or urgent evaluation for immunologic, metabolic, or genetic conditions rather than straightforward atopic dermatitis [^116WGLAN] [^1132fjZp] [^115e8o9k].

> Next, I should review the management plan, starting with gentle skin care. Let me think about bathing frequency and duration. Daily or every-other-day brief baths in lukewarm water for less than 10 minutes with a fragrance-free, non-soap cleanser or water alone is reasonable, followed by immediate application of a fragrance-free emollient to damp skin to restore barrier function and reduce transepidermal water loss; I should confirm that the emollient is appropriate for infant skin and avoid fragranced or potentially irritating formulations [^114oUvfv] [^1158rc6d] [^114THXFg].

> I will now examine emollient selection and application. Thick, fragrance-free ointments such as petrolatum-based products are preferred for infant skin because they are less likely to sting and provide superior occlusion; creams can be used if ointments are not tolerated, but lotions are generally too thin and may contain alcohol that can irritate; I should double-check that the product is labeled for infant use and free of fragrances, dyes, and botanicals that can be allergenic in sensitized infants [^114oUvfv] [^1158rc6d].

> But wait, what if the patches are inflamed or not improving with emollients alone. For localized, inflamed flares in infants, short courses of low-potency topical corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone 1% ointment applied thinly twice daily for about 7 to 14 days to involved areas can be used safely with close follow-up; I should avoid continuous use and taper as improvement occurs, and I need to ensure we are not masking infection or undertreating barrier dysfunction [^114oUvfv] [^111JL6TU].

> I should confirm infection risk and when to treat. If there is crusting, pustules, weeping, or rapid worsening, secondary bacterial infection is possible and a short course of an oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic for 7 to 10 days may be indicated; if there is no improvement within 48 hours, I should reconsider the diagnosis and obtain a bacterial culture to guide therapy [^114oUvfv] [^111JL6TU].

> Let me consider environmental and trigger mitigation. Soft cotton clothing, fragrance-free laundry detergent, and avoidance of fabric softeners can reduce irritant exposure; maintaining ambient humidity and avoiding overheating can lessen pruritus and xerosis; I should also ask about new soaps, wipes, or topical products that could act as irritants or allergens in this age group [^111JL6TU] [^1158rc6d].

> I need to ensure follow-up and safety counseling. Re-evaluation in 2 to 4 weeks to assess response is prudent; if the rash spreads, becomes erosive, bullous, or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, or if there is poor weight gain, I should broaden the differential and consider referral to pediatric dermatology for evaluation for alternative diagnoses such as immunodeficiency, metabolic disease, or genodermatoses; I should also counsel on avoiding high-potency steroids and on recognizing signs of topical steroid overuse or withdrawal if steroids are used inappropriately [^116WGLAN] [^113pD5o2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to recommend widespread early emollient use for all infants to prevent atopic dermatitis, but I should double-check that. Large Cochrane analyses suggest that routine emollients in the first year of life probably do not prevent eczema and may increase skin infections, so I should not overpromise prevention; however, in infants who already have dry skin or established early atopic dermatitis, targeted emollient therapy remains appropriate for barrier restoration and symptom control, and a recent RCT in high-risk neonates showed reduced AD incidence with early specialized emollients, so I should individualize advice and avoid blanket prevention claims [^1126NrYW] [^113MA5HR] [^111sxi48].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis is atopic dermatitis in a 2-month-old, with infantile seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, tinea, contact dermatitis, nutritional deficiencies, and ichthyosis as key differentials to keep in mind. Management centers on gentle bathing, frequent fragrance-free emollients, short courses of low-potency topical steroids for flares, infection surveillance, and trigger avoidance, with clear return precautions for red flags or treatment failure [^115uGTFP] [^114oUvfv] [^1136S5Qb].

Dry skin patches on a 2-month-old's arms, stomach, and back are most often due to **immature skin barrier** [^114gcACQ] and environmental factors such as low humidity, harsh soaps, or overwashing [^1158rc6d]. The most common causes are **physiologic desquamation**, atopic dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis [^116WGLAN]; less common considerations include ichthyosis, nutritional deficiencies, or infections [^1136S5Qb]. Management is conservative: use fragrance-free, hypoallergenic emollients at least twice daily [^114oUvfv], limit bathing to brief, lukewarm water with mild cleansers, and avoid irritants. Persistent, severe, or atypical rashes warrant pediatric evaluation to exclude other causes and guide care [^111F9y2z].

---

## Common causes of dry skin patches in infants

Several factors contribute to dry skin patches in infants, including:

- **Immature skin barrier**: Infant skin has a thinner stratum corneum and higher transepidermal water loss, making it prone to dryness and irritation [^114gcACQ].

- **Environmental factors**: Low humidity, cold weather, harsh soaps, and frequent bathing can exacerbate dryness [^notfound].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history of atopic dermatitis or eczema increases the risk of dry skin patches [^1147yfpp].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The following conditions are commonly associated with dry skin patches in infants:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distribution** | **Associated symptoms** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Physiologic desquamation | Fine, flaky scaling | Generalized, especially trunk and extremities | None |
| Atopic dermatitis | Erythematous, scaly patches; pruritic | Extensor surfaces, cheeks, scalp | Pruritus, irritability, sleep disturbance |
| Seborrheic dermatitis | Greasy, yellowish scales | Scalp (cradle cap), eyebrows, trunk | Mild pruritus |
| Ichthyosis | Thick, adherent scales | Generalized | Persistent dryness, possible family history |
| Nutritional deficiencies (e.g. zinc, essential fatty acids) | Dry, scaly skin; erythematous patches | Perioral, acral, generalized | Growth failure, diarrhea, alopecia |
| Infections (e.g. tinea) | Annular, scaly lesions | Localized or generalized | Pruritus, inflammation |

---

## Recommended management strategies

Effective management of dry skin patches in infants involves gentle skin care and avoidance of irritants:

- **Emollients**: Apply fragrance-free, hypoallergenic emollients (e.g. petrolatum-based ointments) at least twice daily, especially after bathing [^114oUvfv].

- **Bathing**: Use lukewarm water, mild cleansers, and limit bathing to 5–10 minutes. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps [^1158rc6d].

- **Environmental control**: Maintain optimal humidity levels (40–60%) and avoid exposure to cold, dry air [^notfound].

- **Clothing**: Dress the infant in soft, breathable fabrics (e.g. cotton) and avoid wool or synthetic materials that may irritate the skin [^111JL6TU].

---

## When to seek medical evaluation

Medical evaluation is recommended if:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Dry skin patches persist beyond two weeks despite conservative management.

- **Severe symptoms**: Presence of erythema, oozing, crusting, or significant pruritus.

- **Systemic symptoms**: Poor feeding, weight loss, fever, or signs of infection.

- **Atypical features**: Unusual distribution, morphology, or associated systemic findings.

---

## Potential complications if untreated

Untreated dry skin patches in infants may lead to:

- **Secondary infections**: Bacterial (e.g. impetigo) or fungal infections due to skin barrier impairment [^111JL6TU].

- **Chronic dermatitis**: Progression to chronic eczema or atopic dermatitis.

- **Discomfort and sleep disturbance**: Significant impact on infant comfort and sleep quality [^1147yfpp].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for infants with dry skin patches is **generally favorable**. With appropriate skin care, most cases resolve spontaneously or with minimal intervention. Persistent or severe cases may require ongoing management and periodic medical evaluation [^116WGLAN].

---

Dry skin patches on a 2-month-old's arms, stomach, and back are common and usually benign, reflecting immature skin and environmental exposures. Conservative care with emollients, gentle cleansing, and avoidance of irritants is first-line; **persistent, severe, or atypical rashes** should be evaluated by a pediatrician to exclude other causes and guide management [^114oUvfv].

### Rivastigmine (Exelon) [^114tDp3W]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4 Important Administration Instructions

EXELON PATCH is for transdermal use on intact skin.

(a) Do not use the patch if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way.

(b) Apply the EXELON PATCH once a day.

Press down firmly for 30 seconds until the edges stick well when applying to clean, dry, hairless, intact healthy skin in a place that will not be rubbed against by tight clothing.
Use the upper or lower back as the site of application because the patch is less likely to be removed by the patient. If sites on the back are not accessible, apply the patch to the upper arm or chest.
Do not apply to a skin area where cream, lotion, or powder has recently been applied.

(c) Do not apply to skin that is red, irritated, or cut.

(d) Replace the EXELON PATCH with a new patch every 24 hours. Instruct patients to only wear 1 patch at a time (remove the previous day's patch before applying a new patch) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Overdosage (10)]. If a patch falls off or if a dose is missed, apply a new patch immediately, and then replace this patch the following day at the usual application time.

(e) Change the site of patch application daily to minimize potential irritation, although a new patch can be applied to the same general anatomic site (e.g., another spot on the upper back) on consecutive days. Do not apply a new patch to the same location for at least 14 days.

(f) May wear the patch during bathing and in hot weather. Avoid long exposure to external heat sources (excessive sunlight, saunas, solariums).

(g) Place used patches in the previously saved pouch and discard in the trash, away from pets or children.

(h) Wash hands with soap and water after removing the patch. In case of contact with eyes or if the eyes become red after handling the patch, rinse immediately with plenty of water, and seek medical advice if symptoms do not resolve.

### Depigmented patches in a child [^113fXKaF]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which variant of this condition does the patient mostly likely have?
A. Type 1
B. Type 2
C. Type 3
D. Type 4
E. Type 5

Answers:
A. Type 1 – Incorrect. Type 1 WS is the most common type of WS and is diagnosed clinically using the Waardenburg Consortium criteria. Type I WS is distinguished from type 2 WS by the presence of dystopia canthorum. The patient did not have lateral displacement of the inner canthi.
B. Type 2 – Correct. Type 2 WS is similar to Type 1 WS, but the inner canthi are normal. This was consistent with the patient's presentation.
C. Type 3 – Incorrect. Type 3 WS, also known as Klein-Waardenburg syndrome, is characterized by musculoskeletal abnormalities. The patient had an otherwise unremarkable physical examination and no skeletal abnormalities.
D. Type 4 – Incorrect. Type 4 WS, also called Shah-Waardenberg syndrome, has features similar to type 2 WS but is also associated with Hirschsprung disease or congenital aganglionic megacolon. The patient had a negative review of systems, with no history of abdominal distention, emesis or constipation, making type 4 WS less likely.
E. Type 5 – Incorrect. Only 4 types of WS have been described.

Case Presentation

We present a 6-yr-old male born at 37 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery with birth weight of 3487 gm. He was breastfed until 2 years of age. At 2 months of age, he presented with a recurrent pruritic rash with dry patches on the antecubital fossa, popliteal fossa, abdomen, and buttocks, which flared up every two weeks. He was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis and treated with topical steroid cream. Sleep was poor. He had intermittent fever of unknown etiology and upper respiratory symptoms. He never had gastroenteritis. Recurrent ear infections started at 3 months of age requiring a first myringotomy at 9 months and a second myringotomy at 12 months. Neurologic development was normal until 6 months of age when he sat up without Support. However, by 10 months of age, he was still not crawling. Weight gain was poor. After a period of developmental stagnation, developmental regression with increasing weakness started at 13 months. Speech and language were relatively spared. By 15 months, he was severely wasted and unable to sit.

### Interventions for infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (including cradle cap) [^115sSeFq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (ISD) is a chronic, inflammatory, scaling skin condition, which causes redness and a greasy scaling rash in infants and young children. It can last from weeks to months, but rarely years. When it occurs on the scalp, it is referred to as 'cradle cap'. While benign and self-limiting, irrelevant of its location on the body, it can distress parents. The effectiveness of commonly promoted treatments is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis in children from birth to 24 months of age.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 22 May 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched trials registers and checked reference lists of included studies for further references to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched for unpublished RCTs and grey literature via web search engines, and wrote to authors and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of interventions for ISD in children from birth up to 24 months who were clinically diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner with ISD or cradle cap. We allowed comparison of any treatment to no treatment or placebo, and the comparison of two or more treatments or a combination of treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were 'Change in severity score from baseline to end of study' and 'Percentage of infants treated who develop adverse effects or intolerance to treatment'. The secondary outcome was 'Improvement in quality of life (QoL) as reported by parents'.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (one with a cross-over design) randomising 310 children and reporting outcomes for 297 children. Most participants were aged under seven months with only two participants aged over one year (seven and 12 years old); where specified, 60% were boys. In two studies, condition severity was mild to moderate; one study included two participants with severe ISD; the other studies did not describe baseline severity or described it as body surface area affected. The study setting was not always clear but likely a paediatric outpatient clinic in the following countries: Thailand, Israel, USA, France, and Australia. Two studies compared oral biotin (a B group vitamin) against placebo, two studies compared proprietary products against placebo cream or a control shampoo, and two studies compared topical corticosteroids against other products. The studies were generally short-term, between 10 and 42 days' duration; only one study followed the participants until resolution of the rash or eight months of age. We assessed the risk of bias as unclear for most aspects due to lack of reporting, but two of the studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias due to the appearance of the intervention, the trial design (open-label), or use of overlabelled tubes. Two trials had a high risk of attrition bias. All the results given below were based on very low-quality evidence. Treatment duration ranged from one week to three weeks. For the two trials comparing biotin versus placebo (n = 35), one did not report a measure of change in severity (only change in duration of rash) while the other did not report raw data (only 'no statistically significant difference'), measured at three weeks. Neither trial reported on adverse events. Two trials compared proprietary products against placebo (n = 160). One trial assessed change in severity via percentage success (96% of participants in non-steroidal cream Promiseb versus 92% in placebo), and reported no adverse events (both assessed at day 14). The other trial assessed change in severity via reduction in lesional score (surface area covered), finding better results for lactamide MEA gel (a moisturising agent) plus shampoo (81.4%) compared with shampoo only (70.2%; P = 0.0092). No adverse events were described, but signs of discomfort were similar in both groups (both assessed at day 21). In the comparison of topical steroids versus another product, change in severity was measured through evaluation of cure and body surface (n = 102). In one trial comparing hydrocortisone 1% lotion with licochalcone 0.025% lotion, there was no significant difference in participants cured (95.8% with hydrocortisone compared to 97.1% with licochalcone). One person in the licochalcone group developed more erythema, but there were no other adverse events (both outcomes assessed at day 14). In the trial comparing flumethasone pivalate 0.02% ointment versus eosin 2% aqueous solution, a reduction in body surface area affected was seen in both groups at day 10 (9% with corticosteroid versus 7% with aqueous solution), with all infants showing less than 10% involvement. There were no adverse events (both outcomes assessed at day 10). No studies measured QoL. We found no trials testing commonly used treatments such as mineral oils, salicylic acid, or antifungals.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review identified only a limited number of studies investigating the effects of interventions for ISD in infants and young children. Unlike the reviews investigating the effects of treatments in adults, our results showed that there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness and safety of studied treatments due to the very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons and outcomes. We assessed most bias domains as at unclear risk, but there was a high risk of bias for (mainly) performance, attrition, and detection bias. Evidence was limited further by imprecision (small studies, low number of events), indirectness (mainly with the outcomes assessed), and poor trial reporting. In most studies, the prognosis for the condition was favourable regardless of intervention but interpretation is limited by the very low-certainty evidence. Further research is needed with large, well-conducted, and well-reported intervention trials, particularly of interventions commonly recommended or used, such as emollients or shampoos and brushing, antifungals, or steroids. All studies should report standardised and validated relevant outcome measures, including adverse events, severity, and QoL, and they should be conducted in primary care settings where the majority of ISD is managed. Future trials should compare against placebo, no treatment, or standard care.

### A case report of flaxseed anaphylaxis in an infant: lessons to be learned [^111r6x2S]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Flaxseed allergy is uncommon but certainly not rare. It is also not new, as it was in fact first reported almost 90 years ago. From a clinical perspective, it may be more common in patients with other seed allergies, and it appears to be increasing in prevalence, although there are no data to document its past or current prevalence. The use of flaxseed in a variety of food products has also increased rapidly in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue and even accelerate. There are only a few cases of reported flaxseed anaphylaxis in the literature, and these have been in adults. Here we report a case of severe anaphylaxis to flaxseed in an 11-month-old infant.

The child was the product of a full-term cesarean section delivery and was breast-fed. The parents noted dry skin when the child was 2 months of age; it was treated with a combination of topical steroids and moisturizers. By the time the child reached the age of 6 months, the family began feeding her solid foods. Because of the child's atopic dermatitis, the family's primary care physician recommended that the mother and child avoid egg and milk. By the time the child reached 8 months of age, her atopic dermatitis had become more severe and she was referred to pediatric dermatology, where use of more potent topical steroids improved her eczema. She was otherwise healthy.

### Pediatric allergic contact dermatitis: lessons for better care [^111ZQnGE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an immune-mediated condition that is likely underrecognized in children. ACD is the result of primary sensitization and secondary elicitation by allergy-provoking haptens. A detailed clinical history and physical examination may yield diagnosis. Patch testing is the criterion standard diagnostic tool for confirming the diagnosis of ACD in both children and adults. Herein, we present an overview of pediatric ACD, an analysis of relevant current literature on the topic, focused management recommendations, and a discussion of existing knowledge gaps that must be addressed by future research.

### The 'MOAHLFA (P) index': an attempt to standardise a widely used array of descriptors of patch-tested patients [^115kmR1c]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Thus, focusing further on AD, two issues arise in the definition:
Should only previous AD be considered, including during childhood, which may have disappeared for a long time, or also a current (additional) diagnosis of AD, in an adult consulting with suspected contact allergy? As the 'A' criterion should capture the physiological (epidermal barrier), immunological (TH2 skewing), and some exposure‐related impact of AD, it is suggested to consider both, current and previous, AD. If feasible and important to the particular research topic of an analysis, current and previous AD could be stratified for.
Which definition of AD should then be used? Regarding the physician's diagnosis of current or previous AD, some cases of AD may be easy to diagnose at first sight — possibly more in a general clinic than in a patch test clinic where the more complex cases may be seen. Trying to support a more standardised diagnosis, Hanifin suggested a set of essential, major and minor criteria, later condensed to the well‐known and widely used major and minor criteria. A slightly different approach of weighting different criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD was followed by Svensson et al. and Diepgen et al. arriving at a score making 'atopy' or 'atopic skin diathesis' a likely, possible, or unlikely diagnosis. Focussed on paediatric assessment, the UK working party elaborated, and validated, a set of widely used criteria for AD. The 'UK working party' criteria are also employed for adults, with; however, hitherto lacking validation of diagnostic properties (e.g. compared with the above‐mentioned criteria). A significant problem among adults is recall bias regarding previous AD. A slightly modified version of the 'UK working party' criteria was used in the Danish 'Health2006' study, namely, an itchy skin condition as a major criterion, plus a minimum of four minor criteria (i) history of involvement of the skin creases, (ii) a history of asthma or hay fever, (iii) a history of generally dry skin and (iv) onset before age 2 years. Moreover, previous AD has been operationally defined as an affirmative answer to the question 'Have you ever had an itchy skin condition that occurred on and off for at least 6 months and sometimes was localised in the skin folds?'. These examples used in (clinical) epidemiology, certainly not exhaustive, illustrate that a great abundance of such definitions exists. Future efforts toward standardisation should arrive at an AD definition that is both feasible and generally accepted in a clinical (patch testing) setting. For the time being, the definition as used locally, or the definitions, possibly varying, in multicentre studies, should be mentioned and referenced, respectively.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^1126NrYW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema and food allergy are common health conditions that usually begin in early childhood and often occur in the same people. They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy.

Objectives

Primary objective To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants. Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy.

Search Methods

We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre-existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow-up was required.

Data Collection and Analysis

This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician-assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen.

Main Results

We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review. We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta-analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta-analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only. Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty-five studies, including all those contributing data to meta-analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta-analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow-up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate-certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low-certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low-certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low-certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to over-reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low-certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low-certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin (FLG) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434, or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy.

### Atopic dermatitis-induced failure to thrive and hypernatremic dehydration managed with dupilumab in a 5-month-old patient [^114X9yWs]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This case highlights the importance of mitigating severe AD's impact on growth and development. Our patient's hypernatremic dehydration and FTT correlated with her compromised skin barrier and resolved upon initiation and sustained dupilumab treatment. This case raises awareness of the severe sequelae of AD, promoting expert dermatologic evaluation, prompt recognition, tailored work-up, and effective treatment. In conclusion, dupilumab can be an effective management tool, but further studies are necessary to evaluate its use in infants under 6 months of age.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a rare autoimmune bullous disorder caused by IgG autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes at the dermoepidermal junction. BP typically occurs in elderly patients but is rarely reported in infants and children. In infants, associations with infection and vaccinations have been proposed. Topical and systemic steroids are considered first-line treatment options. Disease severity and clinical course vary significantly between patients, and steroid-sparing medications may be necessary.

We searched the following databases up to July 2020: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched two trials registers and checked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We contacted field experts to identify planned trials and to seek information about unpublished or incomplete trials.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (0 to 12 months) without pre-existing diagnosis of eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition were included. Comparison was standard care in the locality or no treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema, and probably increase risk of skin infection. Effects of skin care interventions on risk of food allergy are uncertain. Further work is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might promote or prevent eczema and to evaluate effects on food allergy based on robust outcome assessments.

### Patch testing in skin of color: a brief report [^1142MMrz]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

It is critical that dermatology training prepares physicians to recognize cutaneous changes in skin of color populations. Patch testing is the gold standard for identifying triggers of contact dermatitis and can be challenging to interpret in skin of color given the need to see erythema, particularly for a 1 + positive interpretation. Given the paucity of clinical images of skin of color in the literature, we provide images of two pediatric patients presenting with positive patch tests to demonstrate an approach to the clinical interpretation of patch testing in patients with more melanin in the skin.

### Common skin rashes in children… [^112hWkJg]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. Initially, children may develop vesicles or pustules that form a thick, yellow crust. With autoinoculation, the lesions may quickly spread. The face and extremities are most commonly affected. Although impetigo is usually a self-limited disease, antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent complications and spread of the infection.
12. After two to four days, the facial rash fades. In the second stage of the disease process, pink patches and macules may develop in a lacy, reticular pattern, most often on the extremities.

After one to six weeks, the rash resolves but may reappear with sun exposure, heat, or stress. Molluscum Contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum is a skin infection caused by a poxvirus. This highly contagious viral infection most commonly affects children two to 11 years of age. The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is made clinically. The condition is self-limited, but clinicians should advise parents to use gentle skin care products on the patient and that lesions may last for months or up to two to four years. Treatment options, including cryotherapy, imiquimod, and intralesional immunotherapy, are available if physical appearance is a concern. Dermatitis requires treatment to resolve pruritus and limit spread of the molluscum.
14. The distribution of atopic dermatitis lesions can vary based on the age of the child.

Infants and younger children often have lesions on the extensor surfaces of extremities, cheeks, and scalp. Older children and adults often present with patches and plaques on the flexor surfaces. Hands and feet are also commonly affected. Thickened plaques with a lichenified appearance may be seen in more severe cases. Children with atopic dermatitis often have dry, flaky skin and are at risk of secondary cutaneous infections.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^1158rc6d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

European roundtable meeting recommendations on bathing and cleansing of infants were published in 2009; a second meeting was held to update and expand these recommendations in light of new evidence and the continued need to address uncertainty surrounding this aspect of routine care.

Methods

The previous roundtable recommendations concerning infant cleansing, bathing, and use of liquid cleansers were critically reviewed and updated and the quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. New recommendations were developed to provide guidance on diaper care and the use of emollients. A series of recommendations was formulated to characterize the attributes of ideal liquid cleansers, wipes, and emollients.

Results

Newborn bathing can be performed without harming the infant, provided basic safety procedures are followed. Water alone or appropriately designed liquid cleansers can be used during bathing without impairing the skin maturation process. The diaper area should be kept clean and dry; from birth, the diaper area may be gently cleansed with cotton balls/squares and water or by using appropriately designed wipes. Appropriately formulated emollients can be used to maintain and enhance skin barrier function. Appropriately formulated baby oils can be applied for physiologic (transitory) skin dryness and in small quantities to the bath. Baby products that are left on should be formulated to buffer and maintain babies' skin surface at approximately5.5, and the formulations and their constituent ingredients should have undergone an extensive program of safety testing. Formulations should be effectively preserved; products containing harsh surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, should be avoided.

Conclusion

Health care professionals can use these recommendations as the basis of their advice to parents.

4 Discussion

While data is lacking from a third of the reported cases, a pattern of chronic TCS use (100%, 14/14) was noted, with the shortest amount of time of use being 3 months prior to the onset of TSW. The pattern of TCS use was highly variable, ranging from "multiple times daily for short bursts of time", "to multiple times daily for years", "to once daily use", "to two to four times a week use". Thus, it is not possible to know the precise parameters of TCS use that may provoke TSW. In general, and in alignment with best practices, avoiding prolonged, continuous TCS use seems warranted.

While preliminary, based on our limited data and the systematic reviews conducted on TSW in adults, we propose clinicians consider pediatric TSW as a diagnosis of exclusion when any of the following are present:
A history of escalating topical steroid requirement, in potency, frequency, or quantity.
Abrupt onset of erythema, persistent burning, or widespread pain following cessation of topical corticosteroid use, notably of a different character than the underlying disease initially being treated.
Persistent flaking and dry skin, akin to widespread exfoliation (similar to an exfoliative erythroderma) following cessation of topical corticosteroid use that is refractory to moisturization.

Of note, only a third of the cases reviewed had enough data to meet our proposed criteria (33%, (7/21)) as many of the reports were missing key pieces of information. These include a thorough description and assessment of the clinical history of each patient, the frequency, duration, and dosage of TCS used, continuous versus noncontinuous therapy, patch testing results, skin histology, and an overall comprehensive understanding of the clinical course of each patient. Data on follow‐up visits is lacking for most of the reported cases as well. Furthermore, topical, inhaled, and systemic steroids may be prescribed by multiple providers making it difficult to isolate the effects of TCS alone. Use of medications divergent from provider directions, recall bias, and potential polypharmacy may lead to inappropriate use of TCS and represent possible confounding variables that limit the analysis. Nevertheless, we propose that pediatric TSW remains a clinical diagnosis that must be entertained in select cases.

### Clonidine (Catapres) [^115Qe6en]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS

Catapres-TTS®

(clonidine)

Transdermal Therapeutic System

(Read the following instructions carefully before using this medication. If you have any questions, please consult with your doctor.)

General Information

CATAPRES-TTS transdermal therapeutic system is a square, tan adhesive PATCH containing an active blood-pressure-lowering medication. It is designed to deliver the drug into the body through the skin smoothly and consistently for one full week. Normal exposure to water, as in showering, bathing, and swimming, should not affect the PATCH.

The optional white, round ADHESIVE COVER should be applied directly over the PATCH, should the PATCH begin to separate from the skin. The ADHESIVE COVER ensures that the PATCH sticks to the skin. The CATAPRES-TTS PATCH must be replaced with a new one on a fresh skin site if the one in use significantly loosens or falls off.

Skin burns have been reported at the patch site in several patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI). Because the Catapres-TTS® PATCH contains aluminum, it is recommended to remove the system before undergoing an MRI.

How to Apply the CATAPRES-TTS PATCH

Apply the square, tan CATAPRES-TTS PATCH once a week, preferably at a convenient time on the same day of the week (i.e., prior to bedtime on Tuesday of week one; prior to bedtime on Tuesday of week two, etc.).
Select a hairless area such as on the upper, outer arm or upper chest. The area chosen
should be free of cuts, abrasions, irritation, scars or calluses and should not be shaved before applying the Catapres-TTS® (clonidine) PATCH. Do not place the CATAPRES-TTS PATCH on skin folds or under tight undergarments, since premature loosening may occur.
Wash hands with soap and water and thoroughly dry them.
Clean the area chosen with soap and water. Rinse and wipe dry with a clean, dry tissue.
Select the pouch with the red and orange colors labeled CATAPRES-TTS (clonidine) and open it as illustrated in Figure 3. Remove the square, tan PATCH from the pouch.
Remove the clear plastic protective backing from the PATCH by gently peeling off one half of the backing at a time as shown in Figure 4. Avoid touching the sticky side of the Catapres-TTS® (clonidine) PATCH.
Place the CATAPRES-TTS PATCH on the prepared skin site (sticky side down) by applying firm pressure over the PATCH to ensure good contact with the skin, especially around the edges (Figure 5). Discard the clear plastic protective backing and wash your hands with soap and water to remove any drug from your hands.
After one week, remove the old PATCH and discard it. After choosing a different skin site, repeat instructions 2 through 7 for the application of your next CATAPRES-TTS PATCH.

### Disseminated tense bullae on newborn [^112VrynA]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Impetigo bullosa
B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
C. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM)
D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome
E. Erythema multiforme

Answers:
A. Impetigo bullosa – Incorrect. Impetigo bullosa is a skin infection caused mainly by Staphylococcus aureus, with the rare appearance of intact vesicles or bullae. Typically, the lesions are copious, especially in the mouth and nose regions. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained with Gram stain and culture.
B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is one of the main types of bullous epidermolysis, which is represented by fragility of the skin, and due to minor mechanical trauma, nonscarring blisters and erosions are formed. Its diagnosis is established through molecular genetic testing and skin biopsy.
C. DCM – Correct. DCM is characterized by generalized infiltration of mast cells in the skin, with frequent formation of bullae. Bullous lesions are frequently observed, with reports of bullous lesion involvement in 62% to 69% of the patients, and may even be the first presentation of DCM. Bullae appear mainly on the trunk, scalp, and extremities, developing into erosions and thickening of the skin. Clinically, patients have pruritus, generalized erythema, pachydermia, and a darker skin color compared with that of normal-appearing skin. In order to assist the diagnosis, histologic examinations are typically performed. Frequent follow up and proper treatment are essential for significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes and disease control. Treatments include the use of antihistamines, systemic and topical corticosteroids, and mast cell stabilizers.
D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome is a cutaneous infection that can cause bullae and erosions in newborns. The risk of skin infection is greater for premature and immunosuppressed newborns. Antibiotic therapy is administered in cases of suspected staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome, in which thorough hygiene measures should be taken until the results of the tests are available. Its diagnosis is established by culture and sensitivity evaluation.
E. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme is a disease that manifests through blisters, macules, papules, and plaques on the body and that is caused by a reaction to infection or medication. In particular, there are often acral lesions, which can appear first on the limbs, head, and neck and subsequently spread elsewhere. Its diagnosis can be confirmed by clinical findings and histopathologic tests.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^111PbEEX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Skin care is fundamental to healthy infant development, but parents may be confused regarding best practice for this routine aspect of care 2. We hope that health care professionals will use these evidence‐based recommendations to guide parents with respect to the practical facets of cleansing, bathing, moisturizing, and care of the diaper region. Critical updates from the previous recommendations have been derived from clinical studies of liquid cleansers, wipes, and emollients; for example, the equivalence of wipes 41 and the noninferiority of a liquid cleanser 18 to water have been shown (in terms of skin hydration and transepidermal water loss, respectively), and studies have demonstrated that the use of such products does not influence skin barrier maturation 19, 37. Therefore clinical evidence demands a nuanced approach; parents should be reassured in their choice of infant skin care regime, be it the sole use of water or the use of appropriately formulated cleansers, wipes, emollients, and oils.

### Seborrheic dermatitis: an overview [^111FsqRX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis affects the scalp, central face, and anterior chest. In adolescents and adults, it often presents as scalp scaling (dandruff). Seborrheic dermatitis also may cause mild to marked erythema of the nasolabial fold, often with scaling. Stress can cause flare-ups. The scales are greasy, not dry, as commonly thought. An uncommon generalized form in infants may be linked to immunodeficiencies. Topical therapy primarily consists of antifungal agents and low-potency steroids. New topical calcineurin inhibitors (immunomodulators) sometimes are administered.

### Prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis [^114nXbzT]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is one of the most common skin conditions that infants suffer from and their caregivers manage in the first months post-birth. As such, questions of effective prevention and treatment of the condition often arise. Nonmedical skincare practices that support healthy skin barrier function can prevent DD manifestation or alleviate the condition in many cases. The usage of barrier emollients and improved diaper technology contributes to keeping moisture and irritants away from an infant's delicate skin. This paper addresses facts behind commonly asked questions from caregivers regarding DD and discusses effective measures to prevent and treat the condition.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^1136S5Qb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis differential diagnosis and reassessment — AD should be differentiated from other red, scaly skin conditions, and it is often difficult to separate AD from seborrheic dermatitis in infancy, with overlap possible in this age group. AD usually spares the groin and axillary regions, while seborrheic dermatitis affects these areas and tends not to be pruritic. Particularly if not responding to therapy, the diagnosis of AD should be re-reviewed and other disorders considered, including more serious nutritional, metabolic, and immunologic conditions in children and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in adults. The original UK criteria cannot be applied to very young children, although revisions to include infants have since been proposed, and allergic contact dermatitis may be both an alternative diagnosis to AD and/or an exacerbator of AD in some individuals.

### A global review on the risk factors and management of early atopic dermatitis in children ages 0 to 2 years old [^1147yfpp]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing skin disease starting typically in atopic-prone children between 3–6 months of age, with most children having developed AD by the age of 5 years. Intense itching leads to sleep disturbance, especially in younger children and toddlers.
This review explores early intervention in infants and young children with AD by controlling skin barrier function and inflammation at the earliest time point using a moisturizer and a proactive treatment.

Methods: A working group of experienced clinicians managing pediatric populations with AD convened for a meeting. The panel reviewed the literature surrounding early intervention in infants and young children with AD and developed and discussed clinical questions aimed at optimizing clinical outcomes.

Results: Complex gene/immune system/environment interactions are involved in AD development. Epidermal barrier defects play a central role in the condition, with various studies showing impairment of skin barrier function at birth may precede clinical AD. Dynamic changes take place in the amounts of skin lipids during infancy.
Studies confirm that daily use of a moisturizer from birth onwards may offer benefits in improving skin barrier function and possibly prevention of AD, especially in high-risk, atopic prone newborns. Plant-based moisturizers were shown to be safe and effective when applied in pediatric patients with AD and may provide a TCS-sparing effect while improving skin condition.

Conclusion: Dry skin conditions during infancy may predict the subsequent development of AD. Consequently, emollient therapy from birth represents a feasible, safe, and effective approach for AD prevention. Therefore, parental education and the application of moisturizers are recommended as an integral part of AD prevention, treatment, and maintenance.

### Do early skin care practices alter the risk of atopic dermatitis? A case-control study [^111TFh9P]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The rise in atopic dermatitis prevalence observed in industrialized countries is unexplained. We hypothesized that certain skin care practices early in life may increase the risk for developing atopic dermatitis. Our case-control study could not identify any one practice that increased the odds of developing atopic dermatitis, but it revealed that regular lotion use was very common in infants who later develop atopic dermatitis.

### Erythematous scaly plaques with erosions in a 4-month-old [^115e8o9k]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answer:
A. Acrodermatitis enteropathica – Incorrect. While acrodermatitis enteropathica has similar skin findings, it classically presents in infants shortly after weaning due to impaired intestinal zinc absorption in the infant. This exclusively breastfed infant presented with rash while breastfeeding, indicating insufficient zinc levels in maternal milk.
B. Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis – Incorrect. This describes a severe erosive rash in the diaper area that presents as well-circumscribed eroded or ulcerated papules and nodules. This would not account for the perioral and acral involvement.
C. TNZD – Correct. TNZD is a condition caused by a defect in maternal transfer of zinc into breast milk. Typical cutaneous lesions are characterized by sharply demarcated erythematous plaques that can become vesicular or eroded with peripheral scale crust and involve the perioral, acral, and anogenital skin. The perioral distribution often spares the upper lip, giving a U-shaped appearance. Concomitant symptoms often include diarrhea, irritability, and alopecia. TNZD improves rapidly with zinc sulfate supplementation at 3 mg/kg/day until weaning, with no zinc supplementation required following weaning.
D. Infantile psoriasis – Incorrect. While psoriasis of the diaper area is also sharply demarcated, the scale is classically silver and micaceous. While intertriginous psoriasis may lack scale, the erosions as well as perioral, acral, and genital distribution and "peeling paint" scale are more characteristic of a nutritional deficiency.
E. Langerhans cell histiocytosis – Incorrect. Varied skin lesions can be seen in Langerhans cell histiocytosis including red-brown papules in seborrheic distribution, crusted papules on the palms and soles, and vesiculopustular lesions. Discrete eroded papules and petechiae would be expected as opposed to the sharply demarcated broad scaly plaques seen here.

### Successful use of secukinumab in netherton syndrome [^112dSYAa]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 3-month-old male infant was treated in our clinic for extremely dry skin present since birth. He was initially treated with topical steroids and oral cephalexin, without improvement. At 17 months, he was noted to have diffuse erythematous plaques with a double-edged scale involving more than 90% body surface area. He had short, broken hairs, and trichoscopy revealed brittle hair with telescoping of the hair shaft. Complete blood cell count result with differential, lymphocyte enumeration, humoral immunocompetence profile, and total complement was normal. Based on the presence of both ichthyosis linearis circumflexa and trichorrhexis invaginata, the clinical diagnosis of Netherton syndrome was made. He was treated with mild topical steroids, oral antibiotics, frequent emollient application, and oral antihistamines, which provided adequate control of his symptoms, with occasional flares. By the time he was aged 5 years, his disease was well controlled with only twice-daily emollient application and hydrocortisone 1% ointment, and he was lost to follow-up.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^114THXFg]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

European roundtable meeting recommendations on bathing and cleansing of infants were published in 2009; a second meeting was held to update and expand these recommendations in light of new evidence and the continued need to address uncertainty surrounding this aspect of routine care.

Methods

The previous roundtable recommendations concerning infant cleansing, bathing, and use of liquid cleansers were critically reviewed and updated and the quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. New recommendations were developed to provide guidance on diaper care and the use of emollients. A series of recommendations was formulated to characterize the attributes of ideal liquid cleansers, wipes, and emollients.

Results

Newborn bathing can be performed without harming the infant, provided basic safety procedures are followed. Water alone or appropriately designed liquid cleansers can be used during bathing without impairing the skin maturation process. The diaper area should be kept clean and dry; from birth, the diaper area may be gently cleansed with cotton balls/squares and water or by using appropriately designed wipes. Appropriately formulated emollients can be used to maintain and enhance skin barrier function. Appropriately formulated baby oils can be applied for physiologic (transitory) skin dryness and in small quantities to the bath. Baby products that are left on should be formulated to buffer and maintain babies' skin surface at approximately pH 5.5, and the formulations and their constituent ingredients should have undergone an extensive program of safety testing. Formulations should be effectively preserved; products containing harsh surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, should be avoided.

Conclusion

Health care professionals can use these recommendations as the basis of their advice to parents.

### Lactobacillus rhamnosus used in the perinatal period for the prevention of atopic dermatitis in infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^117WgbEW]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This analysis followed the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (see Appendix A — PRISMA checklist in the electronic supplementary material [ESM]). A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the oral administration of L. rhamnosus either alone or in conjunction with other probiotics during pregnancy and post-pregnancy in mothers and infants (with probiotic exposure via breast milk or oral supplementation) in order to determine its effect on AD and on adverse events.

The definition used for atopic eczema/dermatitis was extracted from the Mayo Clinic website and from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI), and includes presence of dry skin, red to brownish patches on the body, small raised bumps which may leak fluid when scratched, thickened cracked scaly skin and raw, swollen skin from scratching (collectively a local inflammation of the skin). As well, AD outcomes were included if they were moderate to severe only (as defined in each included study) by the Nottingham Eczema Severity Score (NESS) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scoring. Studies that included other scoring systems (e.g. SCORAD) were also included where moderate to severe dermatitis was assessed. If any part of these definitions existed in the studies identified, they were included in the meta-analysis. Mild eczema/dermatitis was excluded due to the definition used for EASI (mild being barely perceptible) and the definitions found in each of the papers evaluated (AD — pruritis, chronic relapsing; excluding trivial rash, visible eczema, facial and extensor involvement). All of the definitions found in the studies more clearly mapped to moderate and severe eczema.

How should I use MENOSTAR?

For detailed instructions, see the step-by-step instructions for using MENOSTAR at the end of this Patient Information.

Use MENOSTAR exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.
MENOSTAR is for skin use only.
Change your MENOSTAR patch 1 time each week or every 7 days.
Apply your MENOSTAR patch to a clean, dry area on your lower abdomen or buttocks. This area must be clean, dry, and free of powder, oil or lotion for your patch to stick to your skin.
Apply your MENOSTAR patch to a different area of your abdomen or your buttocks each time. Do not use the same application site 2 times in the same week.
Do not apply MENOSTAR to your breasts.
If you forget to apply a new MENOSTAR patch, apply a new patch as soon as possible.
You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly (every 3 to 6 months) about the dose you are using and whether you still need treatment with MENOSTAR.

How to Change MENOSTAR.

When changing MENOSTAR, peel off the used patch slowly from the skin.
After removal of MENOSTAR if any adhesive residue remains on your skin, allow the area to dry for 15 minutes. Then, gently rub the area with an oil-based cream or lotion to remove the adhesive from your skin.
Applythe new patch to a different area of your abdomen or buttocks. This area must be clean, dry, and free of powder, oil or lotion. Do not use the same site again for at least 1 week after removal of an old patch.

Case report

A 19-day-old Javanese infant girl, born prematurely at 33 weeks with a low birth weight of 1860 grams due to complete placenta previa and antepartum bleeding, exhibited peculiar symptoms. She had extensive peeling skin, a left leg deformity, and vomited brown residue after milk intake. Tragically, her 2 older siblings, who also suffered from peeling skin since birth, passed away shortly after birth. Notably, her parents had no history of similar complaints or consanguinity.

During the physical examination, numerous erosions of varying sizes were observed across her body, along with aplasia cutis on her left lower extremity, patches of alopecia, and oral mucosal erosions. There were no signs of bullae, finger adhesions, nail deformities, milia, excessive granulation tissue, scarring, palmoplantar keratoderma, poikiloderma, or ocular abnormalities (Fig 1). An abdominal X-ray revealed gastric dilatation (single bubble appearance), supporting the diagnosis of pyloric atresia. Furthermore, a renal ultrasound disclosed left hydronephrosis and bladder duplication (Fig 2). Subsequently, she underwent laparotomy and pyloroplasty surgeries by a pediatric surgeon. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to septicemia 4 days after the surgical procedures.

### Autoinflammatory keratinization diseases-the concept, pathophysiology, and clinical implications [^1179cLMr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Deficiency

Clinical Features

EGFR deficiency (OMIM no. 131550) was first described in 2014 as a cause of papulo-pustular rash, loss of scalp hair, and trichomegaly in a premature infant of Polish-Roma origin. The child also suffered from gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms (watery diarrhea, respiratory difficulties, and bronchiolitis) and died of infection and electrolyte imbalance at the age of 2.5 years. The same etiology was demonstrated in two siblings with skin thinning, dryness, ichthyotic lesions, absence of subcutaneous fat, and alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows. The children also showed severe gastrointestinal and respiratory abnormalities and died in early infancy. These reports were followed by a series of 18 EGFR deficiency cases presenting similar clinical features. At the time of publication, only one patient survived until adolescence. Cutaneous symptoms were described as ichthyosiform dermatitis with hyperkeratinization and formation of chronic papules and pustules.

EGFR deficiency should be differentiated with neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease type 1 resulting from homozygous mutations of ADAM17. This condition also presents with neonatal-onset psoriasiform erythroderma, diarrhea, short or broken hair, and wiry or disorganized eyelashes. Clinical similarities between EGFR deficiency and neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease type 1 could be attributed to the fact that ADAM17 converts several molecules, including EGF, TNF, and transforming growth factor α (TGF-α). Therefore, described symptoms should prompt genetic screening for both ADAM17 and EGFR.

Histology

Cutaneous biopsies performed in several confirmed EGFR cases revealed diffuse parakeratosis, mild acanthosis, superficial perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate, dermal atrophy, and wiry-appearing collagen fibers.

Genetic Background

EGFR deficiency has been linked to homozygous (c.1283G > A) or compound heterozygous (c.292C > T and c.1094 T > A) mutations in the EGFR gene. The former has been described in patients of Roman origin, while the latter has been reported only in one case from Japan. All patients with EGFR deficiency presented strikingly similar symptoms, and all but one died in early infancy. It seems that both genotypes lead to the onset of severe cutaneous lesions and alopecia frequently associated with gastrointestinal and renal symptoms.

Treatment

The treatment of EGFR deficiency is symptomatic and involves fluid therapy, electrolyte supplementation, antiseptics, emollients, and photoprotection. The patients usually die in early childhood due to infectious complications, gastrointestinal tract perforation, or respiratory distress.

Abstract

Background

Protecting the skin barrier in early infancy may prevent atopic dermatitis (AD). We investigated if daily emollient use from birth to 2 months reduced AD incidence in high‐risk infants at 12 months.

Methods

This was a single‐center, two‐armed, investigator‐blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial (NCT03871998). Term infants identified as high risk for AD (parental history of AD, asthma or allergic rhinitis) were recruited within 4 days of birth and randomised 1:1 to either twice‐daily emollient application for the first 8 weeks of life (intervention group), using an emollient specifically formulated for very dry, AD‐prone skin, or to standard routine skin care (control group). The primary outcome was cumulative AD incidence at 12 months. AD < 6 months was diagnosed based on clinical presence of AD. The UK Working Party Diagnostic Criteria were applied when diagnosing AD between 6 and 12 months.

Results

Three hundred twenty‐one were randomised (161 intervention and 160 control), with 61 withdrawals (41 intervention, 20 control). The cumulative incidence of AD at 12 months was 32.8% in the intervention group vs. 46.4% in the control group, p = 0.036 [Relative risk (95%CI): 0.707 (0.516, 0.965)]. One infant in the intervention group was withdrawn from the study following development of a rash that had a potential relationship with the emollient. There was no significant difference in the incidence of skin infections between the intervention and control groups during the intervention period (5.0% vs. 5.7%, p > 0.05).

Conclusions

This study has demonstrated that early initiation of daily specialized emollient use until 2 months reduces the incidence of AD in the first year of life in high‐risk infants.

Case presentation

A 3-year-old boy, born out of nonconsanguineous marriage, presented with high grade intermittent fever for about 1.5 months. He was repeatedly treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but continued to have progressive headache without improvement for 8 days.

The patient was then transferred to our hospital with decreased mental status, appetite and physical strength. The patient was noted to have silvery-grey hair of the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes, which had been present since birth (Fig. 1 A). All his limbs showed multiple, well-defined, dot-like hypopigmented patches with a generalized dark, dry and coarse skin (Fig. 1 B). He had no developmental delays, and received vaccinations on time without abnormalities. He has an older half-sister and his mother has no history of abortion. All his parents and half-sister are in good health, and have no family history of genetic diseases.

### Diversity of the human skin microbiome early in life [^112o8qT4]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

We first assessed the overall bacterial richness and diversity of infant skin (Supplementary Table S1 online and Supplementary data online). When the data from three skin sites were combined (arm, buttock, and forehead), the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria was not found to significantly change with age. However, within each age group, differences were detected in the number of OTU across the three skin sites. Although there were no differences in OTU across body sites in the 1- to 3-month-olds, we identified fewer OTU on the arm relative to the buttock and forehead in the 4- to 6-month-olds, and to the buttock in the 7- to 12-month-olds. Although the number of genera in an area does not significantly change over the first year, the relative abundance of the community (evenness) significantly increases with age. An indication of microbiome stabilization in infants may be demonstrated by this increased diversity evenness in the microbial populations on the skin over the first year of age.

Taxonomic composition analysis revealed, in decreasing order, Bacilli, Clostridia, and Actinobacteria as the most abundant classes within all infant skin samples. Differences for the relative amounts were seen as a function of age and body site (Supplementary Table S2 online). In contrast to adult skin where Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes dominate in that order, infants are colonized predominantly by Firmicutes, followed in abundance by Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. The difference in the colonization of adults versus infants is more likely due to the state of development, in terms of structure and composition of infant skin, which may represent a distinct environment for microbial colonization.

The class information was also evaluated through dual hierarchical clustering in which the top 17 classes were assessed without (Figure 1a) and with (Figure 1b) body site groups as clustering parameters. The dendrograms indicate that the buttock site has higher levels of Clostridia (phylum Firmicutes), whereas the arm and forehead samples show heightened levels of the Bacilli class of Firmicutes. Samples taken from the forehead have higher levels of the Actinobacteria class as compared with the other two groups, demonstrating similarity with adult sebaceous sites.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^113MA5HR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema and food allergy are common health conditions that usually begin in early childhood and often occur in the same people. They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy.

Objectives

Primary objective

To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants.

Secondary objective

To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy.

Search methods

We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection criteria

We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre‐existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow‐up was required.

Data collection and analysis

This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta‐analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E‐mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician‐assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen.

Main results

We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review. We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta‐analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta‐analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.

Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty‐five studies, including all those contributing data to meta‐analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta‐analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow‐up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients.

We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data.

Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE‐mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low‐certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low‐certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to over‐reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low‐certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk.

Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin (FLG) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434, or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development.

Authors' conclusions

Based on low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy.

Regarding specific circumstances for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (skin care), BAD 2019 guidelines recommend to consider applying a greasy emollient, such as 50% white soft paraffin with 50% liquid paraffin, over the whole skin including denuded areas every 2–4 hours during the acute phase. Consider using aerosolized formulations of emollient for ease of application and to limit epidermal detachment.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^117FwEtp]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The frequency‐of‐bathing recommendation was reworded to state that infants should be bathed at least two to three times per week, because this is the minimum frequency used in clinical studies 16, 21, 22, 23, 24.

Safety While Bathing

There were few changes to the 2009 recommendations regarding safety while bathing (Table 4). It was agreed that the bath and bath toys should be "kept clean" rather than "disinfected", acknowledging that home bathing does not warrant a disinfectant protocol. The bath and toys should be kept clean since outbreaks of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been linked to contaminated baths and toys 21, 25. In the hospital setting, disinfecting equipment is recommended to avoid nosocomial infection 21. The room air temperature recommendation was revised to include temperatures up to 24°C, based on the assertion that in many parts of the world, such a temperature would be regarded as "comfortable" and would not expose the infant to overheating.

Table 4
Recommendations on Safety While Bathing Infants

After Bathing

Recommendations regarding postbathing care were strengthened slightly (Table 5). It was recommended that infants be covered — not specifically clothed — after bathing. Covering will help prevent the significant temperature drop that can occur 10 minutes after neonatal bathing 12, but unlike clothing, it does not preclude the opportunity for skin‐to‐skin contact with the parent. Two strong recommendations were developed to distinguish between the management of dry skin that results from "normal" maturation processes, such as neonatal physiologic desquamation 22, 26, 27, and conditions that might warrant prescription medication, such as AD. There is clinical evidence to support the efficacy of emollients in improving skin barrier function 23, 24 and preventing diaper dermatitis 28.

### Infant skin-cleansing product versus water: a pilot randomized, assessor-blinded controlled trial [^115EnyGk]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

We conducted our pilot trial based on a superiority hypothesis. However, although the study was not designed to carry out a hypothesis test, examination of the data suggested that the hypothesis was not plausible. There was no convincing trend for superiority for any measurements on any part of the body. Furthermore, there was no clear evidence of any differences in any direction. The size of any of the small differences observed was deemed of little clinical importance by the Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee. Therefore, a trial designed on the principles of non-inferiority appears most appropriate. The trial design therefore should be to generate data concerning the hypothesis that this mild skin cleansing product is not inferior to bathing with water only in its effect on skin barrier function. Moreover, as there was no difference between body parts, it seems reasonable, in future trials, to analyze an average assessment score.

There was no evidence of consistent differences between those babies with and without a family history of atopic eczema. If those with a family history of atopic eczema had shown more evidence of barrier dysfunction, this may have led us to design a trial based on this population only. Such a trial would be attractive because if a trial recruited a group with a propensity to disease and found no difference between treatments it would be unlikely that we would find a difference in a 'healthy' population. Given our results, however, it appears appropriate to include both groups, with stratification for family history. On a practical level this is more feasible, as those with a family history of atopic eczema were particularly difficult to recruit.

The importance of assessing compliance was highlighted in this pilot. Although women in our qualitative study and at recruitment for this pilot study told us that they were happy to conform to protocol, compliance was an issue, making the findings difficult to interpret. This is one possible explanation for not observing a treatment difference. Some women, particularly those having their first baby, may not have been able to anticipate the difficulties of daily routines with a newborn baby. Given that parents introduced products around 3–4 weeks, and it is impossible to enforce or ensure compliance, it is more appropriate to have a primary endpoint prior to this.

Infant development of allergic diseases

Eczema

Mothers are interviewed for the presence of eczema in infants at 3, 6, and 12 months based on five questions of the UK Working Party's Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis with response options "yes" or "no". Eczema in infants is identified by the presence of an itchy skin condition plus two or more of the following; (i) history of involvement of skin creases such as folds of elbows, behind the knees, fronts of ankles, cheeks, or around the neck; (ii) a history of atopic disease in a first-degree relative; (iii) a history of a general dry skin; and (iv) visible flexural eczema.

Food allergy

Food allergy in infants at 3, 6, and 12 months are assessed by asking the mothers: "Has your child ever had a skin rash and sickness within two hours of eating some food?" and "Did these symptoms repeat each time the same food was consumed?". If positive answers are given to both of these questions, the mothers are required to select the type of food their children consumed that resulted in those symptoms. Options to select from include egg, peanut, tree nut, milk, shellfish, fish, wheat, and soy.

Asthma

The Asthma Predictive Index (API) is used to determine the likelihood of infants who may develop asthma at 3, 6, and 12 months. A 'positive' API involves the presence of recurrent episodes of wheezing (more than three episodes per year) and one of two major criteria: (1) Asthma in a parent or (2) Eczema in infant; or two minor criteria: (1) Allergic rhinitis in infant and (2) Wheezing apart from colds in infant.

Rhinitis

Rhinitis in infants at 3, 6, and 12 months is assessed by the ISAAC questionnaire. An infant is labelled to have rhinitis if the mothers report that the infant had a runny nose or sneezing episodes with no evidence of cold or flu.

Use of Oils

Oils are widely used as emollients during bathing and to lubricate the skin during infant massage. Research suggests that infant massage, particularly when a lubricant is used, may offer several positive effects, including improving neonatal jaundice and weight gain 61, 62, 63, but no controlled studies in healthy, full‐term infants have evaluated the effect of the direct application of oils or the addition of oils to bath water on normal skin.

In many parts of the world there is a long history of using locally produced oils on infant skin, but vegetable oils vary greatly in terms of chemical composition. Many cookery and kitchen vegetable oils are sensitive to oxidation or light and are associated with variable levels of biologic activity 64. Therefore the effects of topically applied grocery vegetable oils are unpredictable because vegetable oils are chemically heterogeneous, individual bottles of the same type of oil may differ chemically because of the natural variability in source ingredients, and the characteristics of an individual bottle of oil will likely change over time as oxidative processes take place. Pharmaceutical‐grade oils, including mineral oil, are chemically inert, stable, and generally regarded as safe, exerting a moisturizing effect by hydrating and enhancing the SC 64. As such, appropriately formulated baby oils can be applied in a thin layer to the skin for physiological (transitory) skin dryness, and a small amount of appropriately formulated baby oil can be applied to the bath (as long as appropriate safety measures are in place [see Table 4]; it is particularly important that infants not be left alone with a bottle of oil and that products be used as directed to reduce the risk of infants breathing in or ingesting oils) (Table 8).

Research is ongoing regarding the safety–efficacy profile of specific vegetable and seed oils. The use of vegetable oils in specifically designed products (rather than the direct application of natural oils on the skin) is a separate question beyond the scope of this article.

### Atopic dermatitis-induced failure to thrive and hypernatremic dehydration managed with dupilumab in a 5-month-old patient [^1143HD4S]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by genetics, environmental factors, epidermal barrier disruption, and immune dysregulation. Rarely, severe AD induces skin barrier dysfunction resulting in protein deficiency and electrolyte abnormalities, ultimately causing failure to thrive (FTT). This case features a 5-month-old female who presented with altered consciousness due to electrolyte abnormalities, poor feeding, weight loss, and subsequent FTT. After extensive investigation, she was diagnosed with severe AD and initiated on dupilumab. This case highlights the rare sequelae of severe AD and the use of biologic therapies for infants with severe or refractory cases of AD.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2015. part 2: prevention and treatment [^1158CSEr]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE), providing a succinct guide for clinicians and patients. It provides a summary of key findings from 26 systematic reviews that were published during 2015, and focuses on the treatment and prevention of AE. For systematic reviews on the epidemiology and methodological issues, see Part 1 of this update. Topical corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome, 'steroid addiction', has been evaluated in a high-quality systematic review, which helps better define this entity and the risk factors for it. A Cochrane Review has not demonstrated any association between topical corticosteroid use in pregnancy and adverse outcomes, although very large quantities of potent/very potent topical corticosteroids may be associated with reduced birth weight. House dust mite avoidance strategies do not appear to prevent AE. Exposure to probiotics prenatally and in early infancy may help prevent AE, but there is no evidence that maternal diet or supplementation has a preventative effect.

Postnatal prevention

Hydrolysed protein formula in infants

A high‐quality Cochrane Review concluded that there was no evidence for early, short‐term (3–4 days) feeding of infants with hydrolysed formula compared with exclusive breastfeeding to prevent eczema (n = 90). 6 Additionally, no evidence was found for the use of short‐term (3–4 days, n = 77) or prolonged (in the first months of life) (n = 2896) feeding with hydrolysed formula, compared with cow's milk formula (CMF), for the prevention of AE in infants who were partially breastfed. 6 This was in contrast to a review, which concluded that, compared with CMF, a specific, partially hydrolysed whey infant formula decreased the risk of AE at 12 months of age in partially breastfed infants from the general population (OR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.45–0.80). 7 Many of the studies in this latter review were of low quality and had a high risk of bias.

Hydrolysed protein formula in infants

Skin‐care practices, such as bathing, cleansing, nappy care and the management of dry skin with emollients, used for healthy term babies were investigated in a review that included 26 studies and 16 RCTs. 8 A wide range of interventions (n = 13) were included and although they did not measure eczema directly, primary outcomes evaluated change in stratum corneum hydration, transepidermal water loss and skin surface pH within 6 months of birth. There was no evidence of significant differences between the tested wash products or wipes compared with water. Two RCTs examined the impact of daily application of an emollient in neonates at risk of AE (n = 118 and n = 124). Although both studies suggested that daily emollient application from birth reduced the risk of AE at 6 months, the evidence from one of these was weak, being a pilot trial assessing feasibility of the approach. Follow‐up in studies in this SR was variable and short (days to weeks or a few months, although one study was assessed at 24 months), and many of the studies had a significant risk of bias.

### Treatment of atopic dermatitis-AAP… [^114oUvfv]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment Targets Moisturizing the Skin Moisturizers are the cornerstone of atopic dermatitis treatment. They are the main treatment for mild atopic dermatitis and an important part of treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Apply an emollient as needed to control dry skin. The most effective timing is immediately after bathing. Application often is recommended at least once daily, but this varies with the individual and environmental factors. Treating Inflammation To treat inflammation during a flare of atopic dermatitis, apply a topical corticosteroid twice daily to affected areas until improvement occurs.

Ointments are preferred over creams because they tend to be more effective and better tolerated, although some patients prefer creams because they are less greasy. Choosing a topical corticosteroid depends on the age of the child and the area to be treated. Daily Measures
- Daily bathing is desirable, if the bath lasts less than 10 minutes and warm water is used.
- Apply an emollient as needed to control dry skin. The most effective timing is when applied immediately after bathing. Application often is recommended at least once daily, but this will vary with the individual and environmental factors. If there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection, consider administering an oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic for 7 to 10 days. If no improvement is noted within 48 hours, consider a skin swab for bacterial culture to assess for resistant organisms twice daily as needed; may soften papules and make them less noticeable.
- Good dry skin care is vital.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^11653TRf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Parallel‐group or factorial randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including both individual and cluster‐randomised trials. We excluded quasi‐RCTs and controlled clinical trials. We also excluded cross‐over trials, as the design is inappropriate to the clinical context.

Types of participants

Infants (age 12 months or younger). As this is a primary prevention review, we did not include studies on infants who already had diagnosed eczema or food allergy at the time of randomisation. We excluded study populations defined by a pre‐existing health state in the infant, such as preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or congenital skin conditions, because findings in these populations may not be generalisable.

We attempted to obtain individual participant data (IPD) for all included studies. If IPD were not available, we obtained aggregate data instead. For studies with only aggregate data, we excluded the whole study if some participants were not eligible, unless ineligible participants made up an insignificant proportion of the total group, that is less than 5%. In trials with IPD, we planned to include only data on participants who met our eligibility criteria; however, no exclusions were necessary, as all obtained IPD were eligible.

Types of interventions

All skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation. These include:

moisturisers/emollients;
bathing products (these may include oils or emollients);
advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and
use of water softeners.

Interventions could be simple single interventions, or complex interventions that utilised a combination of measures to protect or promote skin barrier function and hydration or to reduce subclinical inflammation. Comparators were no treatment intervention or advice, or standard care, in the study setting. We excluded multifaceted interventions, whereby the skin care component was only a small part of the study, if the skin care component was likely trivial or irrelevant to the outcome. We also planned to separately assess those interventions that primarily aimed to enhance the skin barrier through direct application of emollient or moisturiser (skin care intervention A) and those that aimed to protect the skin barrier from irritation, that is through the use of water softeners (skin care intervention B). However, we did not find any eligible studies for skin care intervention B.

### Blue scalp discoloration in infants caused by exogenous source [^112863e4]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

A blue patch on the vertex scalp of an infant has a broad differential diagnosis, including vascular malformations, melanocytic lesions, trauma, and exogenous or endogenous pigmentation. We present two cases of infants who developed blue patches on the scalp. Extensive examination including MRI and biopsy was recommended for one of the patients to further characterize the lesion and its possible medical implications. In both, the blue discoloration had been due to repetitive contact with the sticker on a tub of baby wipes that had rubbed off onto the scalp. We present these infants to highlight this exogenous and benign cause of blue pigmentation and help practitioners avoid unnecessary examination.

A 2-month-old former term boy with no known medical conditions presented with a 1-month history of persistent scabbed lesions on his face and scalp and 2 weeks of a worsening rash on his arms, legs, palms, and soles. According to the mother, the scalp lesion was present at birth, and she continues to peel the scab during bathing. There was no scalp probe, vacuum, or forceps used at delivery. The facial lesions were initially ulcerative and then developed scabs but did not heal completely. The rash began on the extremities and spread proximally. He has no other symptoms. His sister was recently diagnosed as having scabies and is currently being treated. Per mom, there has not been any recent travel, hiking or camping, animal exposures, tick bites, or ingestions other than his regular formula. Two weeks before delivery, his mother developed a painful vesicular vaginal lesion without associated regional lymphadenopathy.

### Use of emollients in dry-skin conditions: consensus statement [^116A8WPo]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Emollients can perform an important role in the treatment of a number of dermatological conditions. Currently, the use of emollient therapy in the UK is supported only by limited guidelines and a best-practice statement, although guidelines do exist for specific conditions such as childhood eczema. To address this need, a group of clinical professionals covering acute community-care settings and medicines management met to review current data and practice. Their aim was to support other professionals in their approach to the use of emollient therapies in dry-skin conditions.

### Diaper dermatitis: clinical characteristics and differential diagnosis [^117Jx1mf]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

A diverse group of diseases can cause skin conditions in the diaper area including those which are directly caused by diapers or the diaper environment, some which are not directly due to, but are worsened by, the wearing of diapers, and those which are independent of the presence of the diaper or its resulting environment. Many of these conditions are limited to this area of the skin, but others extend to skin outside this area, and some are signs of systemic disease. We review many of the important causes of eruptions in the diaper area and emphasize key points in the differential diagnosis.

### Atopic dermatitis clinical scenarios-AAP… [^111JL6TU]. AAP (2023). Medium credibility.

You are evaluating an 8-month-old for worsening atopic dermatitis. The patient's mother reports that the infant's skin was clear until about 10 days ago when they experienced a flare involving the face, trunk, and extremities. There has been no improvement despite the application of hydrocortisone ointment 2. 5% twice daily. The infant's mother states that they usually respond rapidly to topical hydrocortisone. The physical examination results are normal except for the skin. There are erythematous patches on the face and extensor elbows and knees and areas of oozing and crusting. How would you manage this patient's condition. Courtesy of Daniel Krowchuk, MD. Discussion The infant presented is experiencing a flare of atopic dermatitis complicated by secondary infection with Staphylococcus aureus.

Accordingly, in addition to continuing topical hydrocortisone and daily skin care measures, it would be appropriate to administer an oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic for 7 to 10 days. Although the child's mother is concerned about vitiligo, that is not the diagnosis. Unlike in vitiligo, the child's lesions are not well defined and not depigmented. The family is not applying a moisturizer and is not using a fragrance-free cleanser. The patient's physical examination is normal aside from the skin. The child has large erythematous patches involving the antecubital and popliteal fossae and smaller patches scattered elsewhere on the arms and legs. How might you manage this patient's condition.
- Daily preventive measures, including applying a fragrance-free emollient, using a fragrance-free non-soap cleanser, using an additive-free detergent and fabric softener, and wearing soft cotton clothing next to the skin when possible.
- Because the use of hydrocortisone cream 2. 5% has been ineffective, you could prescribe a mid-potency topical corticosteroid applied twice daily during flares on the extremities. Several days to 2 weeks of treatment may be needed to control the flare.

### Association of frequent moisturizer use in early infancy with the development of food allergy [^114FjPJf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Food allergy is thought to develop through transcutaneous sensitization, especially in the presence of skin barrier impairment and inflammation. Regular moisturizer application to infant skin could potentially promote transcutaneous sensitization and the development of food allergy.

Objectives

We tested this hypothesis in the Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study population.

Methods

The EAT study was a population-based randomized clinical trial conducted from January 15, 2008, to August 31, 2015, and recruited 1303 exclusively breastfed 3-month-old infants and their families from England and Wales. At enrollment at 3 months, families completed a questionnaire that included questions about frequency and type of moisturizer applied, use of corticosteroid creams, and parental report of dry skin or eczema. Infants were examined for visible eczema at the enrollment visit.

Results

A statistically significant dose-response relationship was observed between parent-reported moisturization frequency at 3 months of age and the subsequent development of food allergy. Each additional moisturization per week was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.13–1.27; P < .0005) for developing food allergy. For infants with no visible eczema at the enrollment visit, the corresponding adjusted odds ratio was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.07–1.30; P = 0.001) and for those with eczema at the enrollment visit, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.11–1.31; P < .0005). Moisturizer frequency showed similar dose-response relationships with the development of both food and aeroallergen sensitization at 36 months.

Conclusions

These findings support the notion that regular application of moisturizers to the skin of young infants may promote the development of food allergy through transcutaneous sensitization.

### Selenium deficiency: report of a case [^1174gRvP]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

We report an 18-month-old Japanese boy with selenium deficiency. He had dry skin with irregularly shaped, erythematous changes on the cheeks, groin, hip, and extremities, erosions on the external urethral and anal orifices, and sparse, short, thin, light-coloured hair. He had received parenteral nutrition for 5 months because of juvenile polyposis. At presentation, his serum selenium level was less than 2.0 microg/dL (normal range, 10.6–17.4 microg/dL). His skin lesions responded well to supplementary treatment with sodium selenite. His skin symptoms were similar to those attributable to a deficiency of zinc which, like selenium, is an essential trace element. According to the literature, selenium deficiency is responsible for cardiomyopathy, which was diagnosed in our patient. The clinical similarity to zinc deficiency and the literature yielded important clues for a diagnosis of selenium deficiency in this patient.
