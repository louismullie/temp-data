## Question

How are multiple hepatic cysts with septation treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how multiple hepatic cysts with septations are treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial imaging characterization and what features on ultrasound mandate cross-sectional imaging. Then, I should establish the differential diagnosis based on septation thickness and other worrisome features. Next, I will assess symptoms and complications to determine whether intervention is needed. After that, I will map specific etiologies to management pathways: simple cysts or PLD, hydatid disease, mucinous cystic neoplasm, and complicated cysts. Finally, I will cover referral, follow-up, and emphasize the key discriminator so I do not miss neoplastic or parasitic disease [^113HAt5N] [^115b6Het] [^1153wxT3] [^115V3ByZ].

> Let me first confirm the imaging approach so I don't miss a complex lesion masquerading as simple disease. Ultrasound is the first-line modality for hepatic cyst detection, but the presence of septations or other atypical features on ultrasound should trigger further characterization with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to assess septal thickness, mural nodules, wall irregularity, calcifications, internal heterogeneity, number of cysts, distribution, and relationships to bile ducts and vasculature, which helps distinguish isolated simple cysts from polycystic liver disease and identifies red flags for neoplasia or parasitic infection [^113HAt5N] [^115b6Het] [^114cT2e8] [^1153wxT3] [^115V3ByZ].

> Hold on, let me verify the morphologic criteria that push me toward specific diagnoses. Thin septations without mural nodules or wall thickening are more compatible with simple cysts or PLD, whereas thick septations and mural nodularity constitute major worrisome features for hepatic mucinous cystic neoplasm; EASL specifically considers a combination of one or more major features (thick septations, nodularity) plus one or more minor features (e.g., upstream biliary dilatation, internal hemorrhage) as concerning for MCN and a potential indication for resection [^111FVvpH] [^117FBC7N]. I was about to check tumor markers such as CEA or CA19–9 to discriminate MCN from benign cysts, but wait, I should not do that — EASL advises against using serum or cyst fluid CEA or CA19–9 for this purpose because they are not reliable discriminators [^113eKMYE].

> Next, I should review parasitic clues so I don't overlook hydatid disease. If the cysts have daughter cysts, a laminated membrane, or the patient is from or exposed in an endemic setting, I need to consider Echinococcus and send appropriate serology, recognizing that immunoblot is often used as a confirmatory test and that ultrasound alone has high diagnostic accuracy; cross-sectional imaging further stages disease and guides intervention selection [^116vNLZN]. I need to ensure staging aligns with WHO CE types, because CE stage and size determine whether medical therapy alone, percutaneous PAIR, surgery, or watch-and-wait is preferred [^115tLFYf].

> I will now examine features of complicated cysts, because infection or hemorrhage sharply alters management. For suspected cyst infection, I should confirm with clinical and imaging clues such as fever, tenderness, elevated inflammatory markers, FDG-avid rims on PET-CT, enhanced wall thickening, perilesional inflammation, and especially gas within a cyst on CT/MRI; persistence of high fever despite antibiotics, severe immunocompromise, large infected cysts, or intracystic gas should prompt drainage in addition to prolonged antibiotics with a fluoroquinolone or a third-generation cephalosporin for 4–6 weeks [^113gvpvU] [^115GLgmE] [^1124C1Ex] [^112pazzV] [^116d5Nxj]. For hemorrhage into a cyst, I should confirm with ultrasound or MRI and temporarily interrupt anticoagulation, typically resuming after 7–15 days if clinically appropriate [^111H1ZJL] [^112k1FMK].

> Wait, let me reconsider my treatment trigger so I don't over-treat. I initially thought size alone would guide intervention, but EASL emphasizes that decisions should be driven by symptoms and complications rather than cyst size; use of validated tools such as the PLD-Q can help quantify symptom burden and guide the choice and timing of therapy, particularly in PLD [^111Asnyv] [^117CA4Bo]. I should confirm complications such as jaundice, cyst infection, hemorrhage, or portal hypertension before committing to invasive therapies [^111Asnyv].

> For multiple simple cysts with thin septations and no worrisome features, I need to ensure a symptom-driven pathway. If asymptomatic, observation is appropriate without routine imaging follow-up after effective therapy; if symptomatic, offer the best locally available volume-reducing therapy such as aspiration sclerotherapy or surgical fenestration, recognizing that aspiration sclerotherapy achieves profound volume reductions and symptom relief in most patients, while laparoscopy provides durable symptom control when expertise is available [^1115GKKV] [^116Qmcpb] [^112WaqNJ] [^113EGK7x] [^116qhUFx]. Hold on, I should verify apparent discrepancies: older ACG guidance favored laparoscopic deroofing over aspiration sclerotherapy when expertise exists, whereas contemporary guidance allows either; reconciling this, I will individualize based on local expertise, lesion anatomy, and patient preference while prioritizing symptom relief as the clinical endpoint rather than imaging shrinkage alone [^112rvYXR] [^115b6Het] [^117CA4Bo].

> I should double-check a frequent procedural question: is hemorrhagic cyst fluid a contraindication to sclerotherapy. It is not a contraindication; however, hemorrhagic content predicts a higher risk of suboptimal technical response, likely due to dilution and impaired sclerosant contact, though clinical response can still be satisfactory, so I should counsel accordingly and adjust expectations [^111o4n9y].

> For polycystic liver disease with symptomatic burden, I need to ensure a staged strategy matched to phenotype and reserve. Treat only symptomatic patients, avoid estrogens that can promote cyst growth, and start with targeted aspiration sclerotherapy for dominant cysts, recognize higher recurrence and complication rates in PLD compared with isolated simple cysts, consider laparoscopic fenestration for superficial clustered cysts, use segmental resection when disease is limited to a few segments with preserved reserve, and refer advanced diffuse disease with severe quality-of-life impairment or complications for transplant evaluation at centers of expertise [^111Asnyv] [^114eDDCD] [^113pyRZq] [^115nDLgw]. I should confirm that recurrence and complication rates are indeed higher in PLD after fenestration, which supports careful patient selection and counseling about reintervention risk [^114eDDCD].

> For hydatid cysts, I need to align treatment with WHO stage and size, and I should verify pre-intervention antiparasitic strategy to minimize spillage-related recurrence. CE1 or CE3a cysts under 5 cm can be treated with albendazole alone, larger uncomplicated CE1 or CE3a lesions over 10 cm are preferentially managed by PAIR plus albendazole, CE2 or CE3b cysts under 5 cm may be considered for albendazole alone, whereas larger CE2 or CE3b lesions or complicated cysts with biliary communication, rupture, or infection generally require surgery with perioperative albendazole and adjunct praziquantel when spillage is suspected; medical therapy alone is typically inadequate if definitive percutaneous or surgical options are feasible [^115tLFYf] [^112B13mC] [^112eKPct] [^116FzPpD] [^1132Y2YB] [^115tpZY8]. But wait, I should confirm biliary communication before PAIR because that is a contraindication to PAIR and would steer me toward surgical management to avoid biliary contamination and cholangitis [^112R6JPW] [^116FzPpD].

> Thickly septated cystic lesions with or without mural nodules raise strong concern for mucinous cystic neoplasm, and I need to ensure an oncologic approach. Surgical resection aiming for complete removal with negative margins is the gold standard because of malignant potential; I should avoid relying on CEA/CA19–9 to discriminate these lesions and instead prioritize high-quality MRI characterization and multidisciplinary surgical planning [^1135n4QN] [^115oewig] [^113QsoFZ] [^113eKMYE].

> For complicated cysts, I should verify thresholds for procedural intervention. In infection, persistent fever despite 48 hours of appropriate antibiotics, gas within a cyst on imaging, severe immunocompromise, or large infected cysts warrant drainage along with 4–6 weeks of a fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin; in hemorrhage, confirm with ultrasound or MRI and temporarily hold anticoagulation with cautious resumption in 7–15 days depending on bleeding control and thrombotic risk [^1124C1Ex] [^112pazzV] [^111H1ZJL] [^112k1FMK]. Let me double-check that symptom-directed sclerotherapy can still proceed after stabilization of hemorrhage, which is acceptable if symptoms persist and anatomy is suitable [^111o4n9y].

> Next, I should review referral and follow-up so care remains coordinated. Symptomatic PLD patients should be referred to experienced centers, and after successful intervention for simple cysts, routine surveillance imaging is not recommended; instead, reassess clinically and re-image only if symptoms recur or new red flags emerge, using PLD-Q in PLD to track symptom trajectories and support shared decision-making [^115nDLgw] [^112v67YV] [^111Asnyv].

> In summary, let me ensure I am using the right discriminator at the outset. Septation thickness is the practical pivot: thin septations without other worrisome features generally indicate benign disease where symptom-driven volume-reducing therapy or observation is appropriate, whereas thick septations with or without nodularity are red flags for MCN and should prompt surgical resection; always consider hydatid disease when daughter cysts or endemic risk are present, and be vigilant for infection or hemorrhage that necessitate tailored urgent management [^111FVvpH] [^115b6Het] [^115tLFYf] [^1124C1Ex] [^112k1FMK].

For multiple hepatic cysts with septations, **ultrasound is first-line** [^113HAt5N], and **MRI is preferred** for complex or septated cysts [^113QsoFZ] [^115b6Het] to characterize septa, nodules, and biliary/vascular relationships [^1153wxT3]. Management is guided by symptoms, cyst features, and etiology [^111Asnyv]: **asymptomatic cysts are observed**; symptomatic non‑parasitic cysts are treated with aspiration–sclerotherapy or laparoscopic fenestration [^1115GKKV] [^116Qmcpb]; hydatid cysts require albendazole plus PAIR or surgery [^114cT2e8] [^112R6JPW] [^116FzPpD]; and mucinous cystic neoplasms require complete surgical resection [^1135n4QN] [^115oewig]. Recurrence is higher in PLD [^114eDDCD], and liver transplantation is reserved for severe, refractory cases [^113pyRZq].

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging modalities

- **Ultrasound (US)**: First-line for hepatic cysts [^113HAt5N] [^113mKu5b]; detects septations, debris, and hemorrhage [^111H1ZJL].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Evaluates complex cysts [^1153wxT3], biliary/vascular involvement, rupture, and infection [^115mY1D1].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Preferred for complex/septated cysts [^113QsoFZ]; characterizes septa, nodules, and biliary/vascular relations [^1153wxT3].

- **Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)**: Assesses vascularity and septal enhancement in complex cysts [^111K8NqZ] [^115mY1D1].

---

### Laboratory tests

Laboratory evaluation includes **serology** to assess anti‑echinococcal antibodies [^116vNLZN] for hydatid disease in endemic settings [^115mY1D1] and **tumor markers**; however, CEA and CA 19‑9 are not recommended for differentiating hepatic cysts from MCNs [^113eKMYE].

---

## Indications for intervention

Intervention is indicated for **symptomatic cysts** presenting with pain, fullness, early satiety, nausea, or dyspnea [^116Qmcpb] [^1115GKKV]; for **complicated cysts** with infection [^112pazzV], hemorrhage [^112k1FMK], rupture, or biliary obstruction; and when **malignancy is suspected** based on thick septations, nodularity, or mural nodules [^111FVvpH].

---

## Treatment options

### Non-surgical interventions

- **Aspiration sclerotherapy**: First-line for symptomatic non-parasitic cysts [^1115GKKV]; effective for large cysts [^113EGK7x].

- **PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection, reaspiration)**: For hydatid cysts with albendazole [^114cT2e8]; avoid if biliary communication [^112R6JPW].

- **Medical therapy**: Albendazole for hydatid cysts [^114cT2e8] [^115tpZY8]; somatostatin analogues for PLD symptom relief [^113dM1Uh].

---

### Surgical interventions

- **Laparoscopic fenestration**: Effective for symptomatic non-parasitic cysts [^112rvYXR]; low recurrence in solitary cysts, higher in PLD [^114eDDCD].

- **Hepatic resection**: For large, complex, or suspicious cysts [^111s4zaR]; higher morbidity than fenestration [^111fxSyg].

- **Liver transplantation**: For severe PLD with refractory symptoms or complications [^113pyRZq] [^115Vv2e5].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Cyst characteristics — size, number [^115V3ByZ], location, septations, and biliary or vascular involvement — guide **treatment selection** [^1153wxT3]. Patient factors, including **age, comorbidities, hepatic reserve, and preferences**, also shape the approach [^114KQMzW]. Etiology — **hydatid disease, PLD, or MCN** — further determines the treatment modality and timing [^114cT2e8] [^1135n4QN].

---

## Outcomes and recurrence rates

Aspiration sclerotherapy achieves high initial success with **recurrence rates of 10–20%**. Laparoscopic fenestration provides **approximately 90% symptomatic relief** [^114eDDCD], with recurrence around **10% overall** and about **34% in PLD**. Hepatic resection yields **low recurrence** at the cost of higher morbidity, and **liver transplantation** is curative for severe PLD but carries significant morbidity and mortality [^113pyRZq] [^115Vv2e5].

---

## Complications and risks

Complications include **infection** with cyst abscess formation [^112pazzV] and **intracystic hemorrhage** [^112k1FMK]. Biliary leakage can occur, particularly when there is **biliary communication**. Recurrence is **more frequent in PLD** and complex cysts [^114eDDCD].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up typically uses ultrasound or MRI at **6–12 months**, then annually if stable. Clinical monitoring should assess **symptoms, liver function, and potential complications**, and patients should be educated to recognize signs of complications.

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **minimally invasive techniques** such as NOTES and endoscopic transgastric deroofing [^1134KuLd] and **targeted therapies** like TGF-β and integrin pathway inhibitors for PLD [^1134QeY1].

---

Multiple hepatic cysts with septations are managed with imaging-based characterization [^1153wxT3] and symptom-driven therapy: **aspiration–sclerotherapy or laparoscopic fenestration** for non‑parasitic cysts [^116Qmcpb], albendazole plus PAIR or surgery for hydatid cysts [^112R6JPW], and complete resection for MCNs [^1135n4QN]. Recurrence is higher in PLD [^114eDDCD], and transplantation is reserved for severe, refractory disease [^113pyRZq].

We performed a subgroup analysis of 15 studies involving polycystic liver disease (PLD) patients, where the outcomes for PLD patients were reported separately and compared to the overall results. Symptomatic recurrence and reintervention rates were significantly higher in the PLD group, with rates of 33.7% (95% CI 18.7–50.4) and 26.4% (95% CI 12.6–43.0), respectively. Post-operative complications were more frequent among PLD patients, with a pooled estimate of 29.3% (95% CI 16.0–44.5). Out of 37 reported complications, all were scored using the Clavien–Dindo classification. Of those scored, 70.3% were minor and 29.7% were major. The overall pooled estimate for major complications post-surgery was 7.2% (95% CI 2.1–14.6). The conversion rate and procedure-related mortality did not significantly differ from the overall results. Data were insufficient to analyze symptomatic relief in the PLD subgroup.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of cystic liver diseases [^113pyRZq]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for polycystic liver disease, specifically with respect to liver transplantation, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend referring patients who meet the following criteria for liver transplantation or combined liver-kidney transplantation. This consideration should take into account the local allocation systems, local waitlist criteria, anticipated waiting times, and risk of deterioration while waiting for a liver graft:

- **Liver transplantation**: Clinically apparent liver disease due to massive polycystic liver causing severe quality of life (QoL) impairment, massive polycystic liver disease (PLD), and complications. These complications include severe malnutrition, hepatic venous outflow obstruction, ascites, portal hypertension, variceal hemorrhage, and recurrent hepatic cyst infections that can only be treated by liver transplantation. Additionally, failure of non-transplant-related interventions and contraindications for non-transplant-related interventions should be evaluated.

- **Combined liver-kidney transplantation**: Considered for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min.

### Case report: Percutaneous treatment of multiple echinococcal cysts presenting as abdominal palpable mass [^113K6a7z]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Low credibility.

We report the case of an adolescent Moroccan girl with abdominal pain and a palpable mass in the upper right side of the abdomen. In the emergency department, an abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly and eight active liver cysts, compatible with cystic echinococcosis. Serology for Echinococcus granulosus confirmed the diagnosis, while other sites of localization were excluded. Treatment involved albendazole combined with puncture, aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration, performed only for the most medial cysts. Periodic follow-up with abdominal ultrasound and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging showed a progressive involution of all cysts. The treatment with albendazole was stopped after 6 months, and monthly ultrasound scans were planned as follow-up.

In cases of hepatic cysts, E. granulosus should be excluded, especially in children from endemic countries. A multidisciplinary approach with pediatric infectious disease specialists, radiologists, and surgeons is fundamental for disease management.

### Foam sclerotherapy for a symptomatic hepatic cyst: a preliminary report [^112WaqNJ]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The mean patient age was 71 years (range 67–75 years). The investigated hepatic cysts included a simple solitary cyst, simple multiple cysts, and PLD-associated cysts. Clinical symptoms included abdominal distention, portal hypertension complicated by rectal varices, and PLD-induced obstructive jaundice with acute cholangitis. The mean initial cyst volume was 1,052 ml. In all cases, cytological examination of the aspirated cyst fluid confirmed the absence of malignancy, and bacteriological examinations did not detect any infection.

- **Characteristics of patients with symptomatic hepatic cysts**: The first two cases required two or three consecutive sessions of polidocanol foam sclerotherapy, but the last case only required a single session. The mean sclerosant dose used was 9.6 mL (range 4–10 ml) per session, which corresponds to 3% polidocanol. The total treatment dose of sclerosant required for sufficient sclerotherapy averaged 16 mL (range 8–30 ml) per patient.

- **Results and complications of polidocanol foam sclerotherapy for symptomatic hepatic cysts**: All patients underwent follow-up CT within 6 months of sclerotherapy. Cyst volumes reduced gradually; the mean reduction rate 6 months after sclerotherapy was 97.9% (97.7–98.3%). Cyst-associated symptoms disappeared in all patients after sclerotherapy without any recurrence.

One patient (Case 2) had a fever of > 38 °C and required an antipyretic after the second sclerotherapy session.

### Symptom relief and not cyst reduction determines treatment success in aspiration sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts [^117CA4Bo]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Hepatic cysts are fluid-filled cavities varying in volume from a few milliliters to liters. Most are found incidentally as isolated cysts, but some patients present with inherited polycystic liver disease (PLD). Large, space-occupying cysts may cause symptoms such as abdominal pain or discomfort. A minimally invasive treatment option for symptomatic large cysts is aspiration sclerotherapy, which involves complete drainage of cyst fluid followed by the injection of a sclerosing agent that will eliminate the fluid-producing cyst epithelium.

Most studies use cyst volume reduction as a rather technical endpoint to define the efficacy of aspiration sclerotherapy. Only a limited number of studies have investigated patient-reported outcome measures such as symptomatic relief, and none of these studies used this as a primary endpoint. Yet, from a patient-centered view, clinical response after the procedure is the most relevant outcome, as it is the patient's independent perception of symptoms, functioning, and well-being that counts most.

Capturing the clinical response can be assessed using generic patient-related outcome measures that encompass a wide range of domains, including physical, mental, and social domains. These generic instruments, such as the SF-36, lack the granularity and specificity that are needed to capture domains that are most disturbed by symptomatic hepatic cysts.

Recently, a validated polycystic liver disease questionnaire (PLD-Q) was developed. This disease-specific tool assesses the frequency and discomfort of 13 disease-specific symptoms in PLD.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: Classification, diagnosis, and management [^113NZuvF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Uncommon and congenital liver cysts represent a unique spectrum of pathological abnormalities caused by an insult to embryonic ductal plate development. Ductal plate malformations, also known as fibropolycystic liver diseases, lead to congenital cystic lesions in intra- or extra-hepatic bile ducts, predisposing individuals to pancreatitis, cholangitis, lithiasis, and malignancy. Depending on the timing of ductal plate insult, various congenital cystic lesions can develop, including biliary hamartomas, autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (with more than 20 hepatic cysts), Caroli disease (type V lesions based on the Todani classification), and choledochal cysts.

These lesions must be considered in the differential diagnosis of complex cystic liver lesions, especially when complications such as hemorrhage, bacterial superinfection, or intracystic neoplastic lesions arise. Management, as discussed previously, includes consideration for open or laparoscopic fenestration of multiple liver cysts, or hepatectomy in appropriate surgical candidates, particularly in polycystic liver disease causing compression on the bile ducts, hepatic veins, inferior vena cava, portal vein (leading to portal hypertension), or adjacent viscera. Orthotopic liver transplantation is reserved for cases with severe hepatic decompensation, ascites, malnutrition, vascular occlusion, or when resection fails or is deemed inappropriate.

Concluding remarks highlight that complex cystic liver lesions are increasingly recognized in asymptomatic individuals or during the workup for non-specific abdominal complaints.

### Should pediatricians be aware of cystic echinococcosis? A literature review [^116vNLZN]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Among parasitic hepatic cystic lesions, the most common disease is cystic echinococcosis (CE), especially in highly endemic countries. The European epidemiology of CE in children is challenging to assess due to under-reporting. However, it is increasing because of high immigration flows from endemic countries and increased awareness. Hydatidosis can localize in every part of the body, with the liver and lungs being the most common locations in both children and adults. Multiorgan involvement is rare in children.

Different tests are available, and the sensitivity of serological screening tests usually varies between 60% and 90%. The immunoblot assay is used as a confirmatory test due to its higher sensitivity and specificity. Radiological tests are the criterion standard for diagnosing CE, with ultrasound accuracy around 90%.

For inactive and uncomplicated cysts, the watch-and-wait approach is recommended. Albendazole, used for 3 to 6 months consecutively, is the most common treatment in children, although experience is limited in treating those under 6 years old. Percutaneous treatment with the puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration (PAIR) technique is a minimally invasive procedure.

- **Surgery considerations**: Surgery is indicated based on cyst characteristics in cases of large cysts with multiple daughter cysts, single superficial cysts at risk of spontaneous or traumatic rupture, cysts related to the biliary tract where percutaneous treatment is contraindicated, and cysts compressing related structures.

### Predictors of treatment response following aspiration sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts: An international pooled analysis of individual patient data [^111o4n9y]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

We observed a median proportional diameter reduction of 71% at six months following aspiration sclerotherapy, corresponding with a volume reduction of 98%. This strong reduction rate is comparable to other studies that evaluated the long-term technical success of aspiration sclerotherapy. These studies achieved a proportional diameter reduction ranging from 54.8–85.7% after 12–48 months. Correspondingly, studies that reported efficacy in terms of proportional volume reduction ranged from 90.8–98.9% following 12–30 months.

Sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts containing haemorrhagic fluid is not contraindicated and leads to a reduction of the cyst. Nonetheless, we found that drainage of haemorrhagic cyst fluid predicted an increased risk of a suboptimal technical treatment response. This may be the result of several factors. Due to increased viscosity, residues of haemorrhagic cyst fluid may remain in the cyst following drainage, leading to a diluted concentration of the sclerosing agent. Alternatively, clots or debris in the cyst may prevent contact with the cyst wall. A spontaneous cyst bleeding is estimated to occur in around 8% of hepatic cysts. Remarkably, 32 (38%) patients in our sample had cyst fluid containing haemorrhagic constituents. This relatively large proportion of haemorrhagic cyst fluid in treated patients may result from the symptomatic course following a cyst bleed, ultimately leading to treatment of the cyst. In this study, haemorrhagic content was not associated with a reduced clinical response. The present results validate the use of aspiration sclerotherapy.

### Genetics, pathobiology and therapeutic opportunities of polycystic liver disease [^115mq2MG]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Polycystic liver diseases (PLDs) are inherited genetic disorders characterized by the progressive development of intrahepatic, fluid-filled biliary cysts (more than ten), which are the main cause of morbidity and markedly affect the quality of life. Liver cysts arise in patients with autosomal dominant PLD (ADPLD) or in conjunction with renal cysts in patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD and ARPKD, respectively).

Hepatic cystogenesis is a heterogeneous process, with several risk factors increasing the odds of developing larger cysts. Depending on the causative gene, PLDs can arise exclusively in the liver or in parallel with renal cysts. Therapeutic strategies, mainly based on surgical procedures and/or chronic administration of somatostatin analogues, show modest benefits, with liver transplantation as the only potentially curative option.

Increasing research has shed light on the genetic landscape of PLDs and consequent cholangiocyte abnormalities, which can pave the way for discovering new targets for therapy and designing novel potential treatments for patients. Herein, we provide a critical and comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the field of PLDs, mainly focusing on genetics, pathobiology, risk factors, and next-generation therapeutic strategies, highlighting future directions in basic, translational, and clinical research.

### Predictors of treatment response following aspiration sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts: An international pooled analysis of individual patient data [^117CoYib]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatic cysts are fluid-filled cavities that arise from congenital malformations of biliary ducts. The estimated prevalence of these benign, non-parasitic lesions is 2–18% in the general population. Hepatic cysts may occur as solitary or multiple lesions in the context of polycystic liver disease (PLD). Aspiration sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive treatment option and serves as the first-choice treatment for symptomatic hepatic cysts. It combines percutaneous drainage of cyst fluid with the subsequent instillation of a sclerosing agent that destroys the inner cyst lining. This treatment is effective and safe. There are two components that are important to the perceived success of aspiration sclerotherapy treatment: clinical response as experienced by the patient, and technical response in terms of the reduction of the treated cyst.

It is not well understood which factors determine clinical success or are important for technical response. Due to the infrequency of large symptomatic hepatic cysts, published studies are relatively small, which poses an obstacle to the identification of predictive factors. In this study, we collected individual patient data from two observational cohort studies with comparable treatment protocols and follow-up measurements. The goal of this study was to identify variables that predict the response of aspiration sclerotherapy for large symptomatic hepatic cysts.

### Clinical response after laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic hepatic cysts: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111toSm7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

All data were extracted using standardized forms by one investigator (LB). Cases of uncertainty about data extraction were resolved through discussions between two investigators. Original data from four studies were requested by email, with one author able to provide the additional data required for inclusion. Data extraction was checked for errors by random sampling of 10% of the included studies by a second investigator (SE), which did not reveal any errors.

Our primary outcomes were symptomatic relief (i.e. full or partial symptomatic relief) directly after surgery and symptomatic recurrence (symptoms with refilling or symptoms without confirmation of refilling on imaging) during long-term follow-up. Secondary outcomes were study characteristics, patient characteristics, reintervention rates, operative time, hospital stay, conversion to laparotomy, and surgical technique. Reported rates of procedure-related complications and mortality were extracted. Reported post-operative complications were scored according to the Clavien–Dindo classification by one investigator (LB), with Grade I and II regarded as minor complications and Grade III, IV, and V as major complications.

We used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale for cohort studies to assess the risk of bias within individual studies. Adaptations were made a priori to make the scale more specific to our research question. Using this scale, studies were scored based on the selection of study groups, the inclusion of a control group, the comparability of groups, and the assessment of outcomes.

### Novel technique for treating simple hepatic cysts: Endoscopic transgastric hepatic cyst deroofing [^1134KuLd]. Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

Simple hepatic cysts are common benign liver lesions that are usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. However, larger lesions may require surgical treatment if patients present with abdominal pain, epigastric fullness, or early satiety. The American Society of Gastroenterology clinical practice guidelines recommend that symptomatic simple hepatic cysts be managed with laparoscopic deroofing rather than aspiration and sclerotherapy.

Natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been developed as a step toward less invasive procedures. With advances in digestive endoscopy, some researchers have utilized endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration or NOTES technology for cystic fluid aspiration. Herein, we report a novel approach for smoothly achieving unroofing of simple hepatic cysts, called endoscopic transgastric hepatic cyst deroofing (ETGHCD).

A 73-year-old man complained of abdominal pain and epigastric fullness, significantly impacting his daily life. Abdominal computed tomography and ultrasonography revealed an 8-cm simple cyst located in the right liver as the underlying disease. To address the issue, we performed ETGHCD on the patient. During the procedure, the anterior wall of the gastric antrum was perforated with a sterile colonoscope. The cyst was found at the lower edge of segment IV of the liver. After endoscopic ultrasonography reconfirmed the cyst, transparent liquid was extracted with a 23-G puncture needle (Boston Scientific) and sent for examination. After all fluid was extracted from the cyst, we opened the cyst wall to achieve complete deroofing.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^115miiV8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Inflammatory (peribiliary) cysts are multiple, bilateral cystic lesions (0.2–2.5 cm) that develop secondary to disturbed periportal blood flow and resultant periportal inflammation in cirrhotic livers, or as a result of genetic changes accompanying hereditary fibrocystic diseases. These lesions are located predominantly around the hepatic confluence, with no communication with the biliary tree. They do not require any treatment. Nevertheless, correct diagnosis is essential, since misdiagnosis of peribiliary cysts as malignant lesions can cause unnecessary denials or delays in patients with end-stage liver disease listed for liver transplantation.

### Treatment of polycystic liver disease: Impact on patient-reported symptom severity and health-related quality of life [^117W6sh9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a genetic disorder in which patients suffer from the progressive development of more than ten hepatic cysts. The genetic origin of PLD can be divided into two etiologies: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), characterized by the presence of multiple cysts in both kidneys and liver, and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), where cysts are confined to the liver. Patients affected by PLD are predominantly female (over 80%) and can be categorized according to the severity of the liver phenotype. Although symptom burden is the main indication for treatment, the liver phenotype can aid in determining treatment choice.

The natural disease course of PLD remains unknown. Although cyst burden may increase, liver function is generally preserved, and most patients remain asymptomatic during the course of the disease. A minority of PLD patients suffer from symptoms caused by hepatomegaly or strategically located cysts; although this group is small, these symptoms can lead to serious limitations in daily life when patients experience a high symptom burden. Commonly reported symptoms include abdominal distention, pain, early satiety, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and restriction in the range of motion. In contrast, specific biliary symptoms such as jaundice (3%) or cholangitis (1%) are rare. Portal hypertension and the occurrence of esophageal varices are extremely rare in PLD and may occur due to strategically located cysts.

### Large cystic lesions of the liver in adults: A 15-year experience in a tertiary center [^111fxSyg]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Cystic lesions of the liver consist of a heterogeneous group of disorders and may present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Large hepatic cysts tend to be symptomatic and can cause complications more often than smaller ones.

- **Study design**: We performed a retrospective review of adults diagnosed with large (≥ 4 cm) hepatic cystic lesions at our center over a period of 15 years. Polycystic disease and abscesses were not included.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight patients were identified. In 57, the lesions were simple cysts, in 8 echinococcal cysts, in 8 hepatobiliary cystadenomas, and in 1 hepatobiliary cystadenocarcinoma. In four patients, the precise diagnosis could not be ascertained. The mean size was 12.1 cm (range, 4 to 30 cm). Most simple cysts were found in women (F:M, 49:8). Bleeding into a cyst (two patients) and infection (one patient) were rare manifestations. Percutaneous aspiration of 28 simple cysts resulted in recurrence in 100% of the cases within 3 weeks to 9 months (mean 4.5 months). Forty-eight patients were treated surgically by wide unroofing or resection (laparoscopically in 18), which resulted in low recurrence rates (11% for laparoscopy and 13% for open unroofing). Four of the eight patients with echinococcal cysts were symptomatic. All were treated by open resection after irrigation of the cavity with hypertonic saline. There was no recurrence during a follow-up period of 2 to 14 years. Hepatobiliary cystadenomas occurred more commonly in women (F:M, 7:1) and in the left hepatic lobe (left:right, 8:0). Seven were multiloculated.

### Clinical response after laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic hepatic cysts: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1171fupd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Efficacy

There were 27 studies that reported the proportion of patients with full or partial symptomatic relief after surgery. Symptomatic relief was based on clinical follow-up data in 25 studies, on a structured telephone interview in one study, and on a specific questionnaire in another study. Pooled symptomatic relief was 90.2% (95% CI 84.3–94.9). Symptomatic recurrence during follow-up was 9.6% (95% CI 6.9–12.8). The rate of reintervention for the same cyst was 7.1% (95% CI 5.0–9.4). Mean time until symptomatic recurrence was 16.1 months in 10 patients. Mean time until reintervention was 22.1 months in 13 patients.

- **Safety**: Conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery during the procedure was necessary in 4.5% (95% CI 3.2–6.0), typically because of intra-operative bleeding, difficult positioning, or extensive adhesions. Median hospital stay was 5.0 days (IQR 3.7–6.0). The post-operative complication rate was 10.8% (95% CI 8.1–13.9), generally consisting of either bile leakage, ascites, pleural effusion, or infections. Out of 136 reported post-operative complications, 115 could be scored according to the Clavien–Dindo classification. Of scored complications, 71.3% were minor and 28.7% were major. Overall, the pooled estimate of having a major complication after surgery was 3.3% (95% CI 2.1–4.7).

### Living donor liver transplantation using grafts with hepatic cysts [^112oBtQj]. Liver Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Cystic lesions in the liver are often found through the evaluation of liver donors. Multiple cysts are worrisome, and donor candidates with multiple cysts may be unacceptable as liver donors, especially when their recipients have fibrocystic disease (FCD), which is an inherited disorder.

This study reviewed 183 cases of living donor liver transplantation. We collected clinical and radiological data associated with donors with cystic lesions and donors without cystic lesions, and we evaluated the outcomes of these donors and their recipients.

As part of the preoperative radiological assessment of grafts, magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) was performed to evaluate the biliary anatomy of donor candidates with multiple cysts. Thirty-four donors (18.6%) had one or more cystic lesions in the liver, and six of these donors had multiple cysts (i.e. more than ten). Donors with multiple cysts were older and heavier, and there was a significant relationship between these donors and recipients whose original disease was FCD.

During the follow-up (median = 3.1 years), all donors with cystic lesions were found to be doing well without any major postoperative complications. Fifteen recipients who received grafts with cystic lesions (twelve left-sided lobes and three right-sided lobes) had no complications related to the cystic lesions.

In conclusion, donors with cystic lesions may be acceptable as liver donors, although our data are limited mostly to left-sided lobe donation with a short follow-up period. MRC should be preoperatively performed to rule out any biliary anomalies, especially in donor candidates.

### Predictors of treatment response following aspiration sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts: An international pooled analysis of individual patient data [^113EGK7x]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Overall clinical and technical response

At six months, 47 patients (54.7%) reported disappearance of symptoms and were defined as complete clinical responders. Thirty patients (34.9%) reported reduction, and nine patients (10.4%) had no change of symptoms following aspiration sclerotherapy, collectively defined as incomplete clinical responders. In total, 89.6% of patients had either disappearance or reduction of symptoms; no patients reported aggravation of symptoms.

The median cyst diameter decreased from 11.0 cm (9.3–15.0 cm) to 8.6 cm (6.0–11.0 cm) one month following aspiration sclerotherapy, corresponding to a median proportional reduction of 29.7% (17.4–39.2%). Cyst diameter regression continued to a median cyst diameter of 3.5 cm (1.0–6.4 cm) six months following aspiration sclerotherapy, corresponding to a proportional reduction of 70.7% (50.0–87.2%). In line, the median proportional cyst volume regressed by 68.0% (40.4–78.4%) to 264 mL (103–605 mL) in the first month. At six months, the median volume regressed to 22 mL (1–101 mL) corresponding with a proportional reduction of 97.8% (87.5–99.8%). Overall, centre 2 reported a higher cyst reduction at six months than centre 1: 99% (94–100) vs 92% (68–98%), respectively.

### Treatment of polycystic liver disease: Impact on patient-reported symptom severity and health-related quality of life [^1137o6JX]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the progressive development of more than ten hepatic cysts. While most patients remain asymptomatic, a minority experience symptoms from hepatomegaly, leading to substantial limitations in daily life. Untreated symptomatic PLD patients show significantly poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores compared to age- and gender-matched populations. Currently, liver transplantation is the only curative treatment for PLD. Other available therapies aim to provide symptomatic relief and improve HRQoL by suppressing disease progression.

This review summarizes the impact of PLD treatment on patient-reported outcome measures, distinguishing between HRQoL and symptom severity. Presently, there is a lack of standardized questionnaires to assess both HRQoL and PLD symptom severity. Thus, we recommend using a validated PLD-specific symptom severity questionnaire combined with a general HRQoL questionnaire to evaluate treatment success as a minimal core set. However, the specific choice of questionnaires should align with the treatment option and/or research question. These tools may serve as biomarkers for treatment response, failure, and adverse events.

### Clinical response after laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic hepatic cysts: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111nkyqK]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic fenestration is one of the treatment options for symptomatic hepatic cysts, either solitary or in the context of polycystic liver disease (PLD), but the indications, efficacy, and surgical techniques are under debate.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search (1950–2017) of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was performed (CRD42017071305). Studies assessing symptomatic relief or symptomatic recurrence after laparoscopic fenestration in patients with symptomatic, non-parasitic hepatic cysts were included. Complications were scored according to Clavien-Dindo. Methodological quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random effects model for meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Out of 5,277 citations, 62 studies with a total of 1,314 patients were included. The median NOS score was 6 out of 9. The median follow-up duration was 30 months. Symptomatic relief after laparoscopic fenestration was 90.2% (95% CI 84.3–94.9). Symptomatic recurrence was 9.6% (95% CI 6.9–12.8) and reintervention rate was 7.1% (95% CI 5.0–9.4). Post-operative complications occurred in 10.8% (95% CI 8.1–13.9) and major complications in 3.3% (95% CI 2.1–4.7) of patients. Procedure-related mortality was 1.0% (95% CI 0.5–1.6). In a subgroup analysis of PLD patients (n = 146), symptomatic recurrence and reintervention rates were significantly higher, with respective rates of 33.7% (95% CI 18.7–50.4) and 26.4% (95% CI 12.6–43.0). Complications were more frequent in PLD patients, with a rate of 29.3% (95% CI 16.0–44.5).

### Repeated percutaneous treatment of massive hepatic cystic echinococcosis in a child [^117DHKZa]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Because of mostly asymptomatic cyst growth and often-neglected nonspecific low-grade symptoms, many cases of cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by *Echinococcus granulosus* in the pediatric population are diagnosed at school age, often in an advanced and even complicated stage. In 2003, after experiencing 5 months of intermittent dull upper-right abdominal pain and nausea, a 13-year-old boy was diagnosed with massive liver CE, presenting ∼20 round-shaped, double-walled medium-sized infective cysts permeating the whole liver. Due to their wide distribution across the liver tissue and the risky superficial position of some cysts, liver transplantation emerged as the optimal therapeutic option. Despite being described as only an exceptionally used method for CE, we subjected our patient on four occasions to a radiofrequency energy thermoablation (RFT) procedure similar to the one used for malignant neoplasms.

A total of nine superficially situated cysts were initially treated with RFT using a 14-gauge outer needle and a temperature of 70°C for 8 minutes per cyst. The remaining cysts were treated with the puncture-aspiration-instillation-reaspiration (PAIR) procedure, along with albendazole (15 mg/kg per day) therapy, for a period of 20 months. After a follow-up of two years, four residual small-sized semisolidified cysts were observed in the liver, and the patient showed no signs of relapse. Although not routinely used, RFT, along with PAIR and prolonged albendazole therapy, has shown good tolerability and long-term efficacy in the treatment of multiple infective CE.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^111K8NqZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Conventional ultrasound (US) represents the initial investigation of choice for complex cystic liver lesions, defining the presence of internal septations better than other imaging modalities. On US, these tumors often appear as ovoid, multicystic intrahepatic masses, with thickened irregular walls and multiple fine septations. Arterial enhancement of the cyst wall, internal septa, mural and septal nodules, and intracystic solid components, followed by progressive washout during the portal and late phases, are characteristic findings of mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).

Noninvasive MCNs on computed tomography (CT) characteristically present as solitary, intrahepatic multicystic masses, with a well-defined, thick or irregular fibrous wall, internal septa, mural nodules, and rarely, capsular calcifications. The CT density of the tumor on unenhanced images is that of water (≤ 30 HU) and may vary among different intracystic loculi because of the presence of serous, mucinous, bile-tinged fluid, cholesterol crystals, and necrotic or purulent material. Contrast enhancement is seen along the cystic wall, internal septa, and mural or septal nodules.

### A TGFβ-ECM-integrin signaling axis drives structural reconfiguration of the bile duct to promote polycystic liver disease [^1134QeY1]. Science Translational Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The formation of multiple cysts in the liver occurs in a number of isolated monogenic diseases or multisystemic syndromes, during which bile ducts develop into fluid-filled biliary cysts. For patients with polycystic liver disease (PCLD), non-surgical treatments are limited. Managing life-long abdominal swelling, pain, and increasing risk of cyst rupture and infection is common. We demonstrate here that the loss of the primary cilium on postnatal biliary epithelial cells (via the deletion of the cilia gene Wdr35) drives ongoing, pathological remodelling of the biliary tree, resulting in progressive cyst formation and growth.

The development of cystic tissue requires the activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling, which promotes the expression of a pro-cystic, fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix and which itself is perceived by a changing profile of Integrin receptors on the cystic epithelium. This signalling axis is conserved in liver cysts from patients with either autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease or autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease, indicating that there are common cellular mechanisms for liver cyst growth regardless of the underlying genetic cause.

Cyst number and size can be reduced by inhibiting TGFβ or Integrin signalling in vivo. We suggest that our findings represent a therapeutic route for patients with polycystic liver disease, the majority of whom would not be amenable to surgery.

### Effective treatment of biliary cystadenoma [^116zyMc3]. Annals of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Evaluate experience over 15 years with treatment of this lesion. Biliary cystadenoma, a benign hepatic tumor arising from Von Meyenberg complexes, usually presents as septated intrahepatic cystic lesions.

Data were collected concurrently and retrospectively on patients identified from hospital medical records reviewed for pertinent International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, and CPT codes, pathology logs, and from operative case logs. Pathology specimens were re-reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of biliary cystadenoma or biliary cystadenocarcinoma by two GI pathologists.

From October 1989 to April 2004 at our institution, 19 (18F:1M) patients had pathologically confirmed biliary cystadenomas, including one with a biliary cystadenocarcinoma. The mean age was 48 ± 15 years at initial evaluation. Complaints included abdominal pain in 74%, abdominal distension in 26%, and nausea/vomiting in 11%. Only one patient presented with an incidental finding. Symptoms had been present for 3 ± 5 years, with one to four different surgeons and many other physicians involved in the diagnosis or treatment prior to definitive ablation. Eight patients had undergone 20 previous treatments, including multiple percutaneous aspirations in four and 11 operative procedures. CT or US was diagnostic in 95%, with internal septations present in the hepatic cysts. Definitive operative intervention consisted of hepatic resection in 12 patients, enucleation in six patients, and fenestration and complete fulguration in one patient.

### The role of laparoscopic ultrasound in the minimally invasive management of symptomatic hepatic cysts [^113jM1JS]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Now that the laparoscopic treatment of symptomatic liver cystic disease has proven feasible and safe, it is gaining wide acceptance. However, due to diagnostic pitfalls and a relatively high recurrence rate, further improvements and refinement of the procedure are still needed. We have evaluated the contribution of laparoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of patients with symptomatic liver cysts.

- **Methods**: Twelve patients with single or multiple cysts of the liver and two patients with polycystic liver disease were managed laparoscopically. Laparoscopic ultrasound served as an integral part of the procedure in all patients.

- **Results**: Patients underwent either complete cyst excision (two cases) or resection of the extrahepatic cystic component (eight cases). Additionally, in two patients, deep cysts not demonstrated by preoperative imaging studies were detected and treated with a combination of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound. In one patient with a cystobiliary fistula, conversion to an open cystjejunostomy was necessary. Patients with polycystic liver disease underwent a combination of excision and unroofing of both superficial and deeper cysts using laparoscopic contact ultrasound throughout the procedure. Laparoscopic ultrasonography was found to have a significant impact on the operative strategy in five patients (36%) with multiple cysts or polycystic disease. The postoperative course was uneventful in all cases. Thirteen patients remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up period of 30 months; one patient with polycystic liver disease continued with unresolved symptoms.

### Clinical response after laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic hepatic cysts: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FB6Gg]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic fenestration is one of the treatment options for symptomatic hepatic cysts, either solitary or in the context of polycystic liver disease (PLD), but indications, efficacy, and surgical techniques are under debate.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search (1950–2017) of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was performed (CRD42017071305). Studies assessing symptomatic relief or symptomatic recurrence after laparoscopic fenestration in patients with symptomatic, non-parasitic, hepatic cysts were included. Complications were scored according to Clavien–Dindo. Methodological quality was assessed by the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random effects model for meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Out of 5277 citations, 62 studies with a total of 1314 patients were included. The median NOS score was 6 out of 9. The median follow-up duration was 30 months. Symptomatic relief after laparoscopic fenestration was 90.2% (95% CI 84.3–94.9). Symptomatic recurrence was 9.6% (95% CI 6.9–12.8), and the reintervention rate was 7.1% (95% CI 5.0–9.4). Post-operative complications occurred in 10.8% (95% CI 8.1–13.9) and major complications in 3.3% (95% CI 2.1–4.7) of patients. Procedure-related mortality was 1.0% (95% CI 0.5–1.6). In a subgroup analysis of PLD patients (n = 146), symptomatic recurrence and reintervention rates were significantly higher, with respective rates of 33.7% (95% CI 18.7–50.4) and 26.4% (95% CI 12.6–43.0). Complications were more frequent in PLD patients, with a rate of 29.3% (95% CI 16.0–44.5).

### Multiple primary hepatic malignant mesotheliomas mimicking cystadenocarcinomas on enhanced CT and FDG PET/CT [^112g5TR5]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old woman presented with upper abdominal pain for two months. Abdominal enhanced CT showed multiple hypodense cystic tumors in the liver with heterogeneously enhanced septations. FDG PET/CT revealed hypermetabolic peripheral regions and internal septations of the tumors, with an SUVmax of 6.3. Multiple hepatic cystadenocarcinomas were suspected. The patient underwent resection of the tumors, and epithelial mesothelioma was confirmed by pathology. This case indicates that primary hepatic mesothelioma should be added to the differential diagnosis of FDG-avid malignant hepatic tumors.

### European ADPKD Forum multidisciplinary position statement on autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease care: European ADPKD Forum and Multispecialist Roundtable participants [^112HJwr1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Liver cysts are the most common extra-renal manifestation of ADPKD, and a recent case series suggested that biliary disease is also a frequent complication in ADPKD. Liver cysts can occur at any disease stage, irrespective of marked progression of CKD, and particularly affect women. They can significantly contribute to pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life impairment. All patients with ADPKD should be assessed for polycystic liver disease. Those with liver cyst complications should be referred to a hepatologist as necessary. Liver symptoms can be assessed using the polycystic liver disease questionnaire (PLD-Q).

Guidelines suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe polycystic liver disease should avoid oestrogens, in view of the evidence that exogenous oestrogen increases liver, but not renal, volume in postmenopausal ADPKD patients.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^1113c2mo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Currently affecting approximately 2.5–18% of the world population, cystic liver lesions are broadly classified into simple and complex cystic lesions. Hepatic simple cysts (HSCs), which make up the majority of these lesions, are benign, rarely symptomatic, tend to remain stable in size, and seldom require treatment. Complex liver cysts, on the other hand, include congenital, premalignant, neoplastic, infectious, and post-traumatic lesions.

Ultrasonography (US) as the first imaging modality, along with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), combined with clinical and laboratory data, provide useful information regarding the diagnosis and characterization of complex cystic liver lesions. Since the majority of complex cysts require surgical management, difficulties in reaching an accurate diagnosis pose problems in their effective management, potentially increasing morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review is to offer up-to-date insight into the diagnosis, classification, and effective management of the most common complex cystic liver lesions.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^114dASN6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Cystic liver disease has been increasingly reported in the literature, with a prevalence as high as 15–18%. Hepatic cysts are usually discovered incidentally, while their characterization and classification rely on improved imaging modalities. Complex cystic liver lesions comprise a wide variety of novel, re-introduced, and re-classified clinical entities. This spectrum of disorders ranges from non-neoplastic conditions to benign and malignant tumors. Their clinicopathological features, prognostic factors, and oncogenic pathways are incompletely understood. Despite representing a heterogeneous group of disorders, they can have similar clinical and imaging characteristics. As a result, the diagnosis and management of complex liver cysts can become quite challenging. Furthermore, inappropriate diagnosis and management can lead to high morbidity and mortality.

In this review, we aim to offer up-to-date insight into the diagnosis, classification, and management of the most common complex cystic liver lesions.

### Treatment of polycystic liver disease: Impact on patient-reported symptom severity and health-related quality of life [^115Vv2e5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a genetic disorder in which patients suffer from the progressive development of multiple (> 10) hepatic cysts. Most patients remain asymptomatic during the course of their disease. However, a minority of PLD patients suffer from symptoms caused by hepatomegaly, leading to serious limitations in daily life. Untreated symptomatic PLD patients score significantly worse on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to age and gender-matched populations.

Currently, liver transplantation is the only curative treatment for PLD. The main goal of other available therapies is to strive for symptomatic relief and improvement of HRQoL by suppressing disease progression. In this review, we summarize the effect of PLD treatment on patient-reported outcome measures with a distinction between HRQoL and symptom severity. At present, there is heterogeneity in the application of questionnaires, and no questionnaire is available that measures both HRQoL and PLD symptom severity. Therefore, we recommend the combination of a validated PLD-specific symptom severity questionnaire and a general HRQoL questionnaire to evaluate treatment success as a minimal core set. However, the specific choice of questionnaires depends on treatment choice and/or research question. These questionnaires may serve as biomarkers of treatment response, failure, and adverse events.

### Treatment of polycystic liver disease: Impact on patient-reported symptom severity and health-related quality of life [^116MzoGa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Cyst fenestration can be performed in patients who experience symptoms from multiple large cysts. This procedure is usually performed with a laparoscopic approach and combines internal aspiration with laparoscopic deroofing of one or more liver cysts. Fenestration is often combined with hepatic resection, and little is described about mere cyst fenestration as a treatment for polycystic liver disease (PLD).

A recent literature review included 1,314 patients who underwent fenestration for symptomatic hepatic cysts. A subgroup analysis showed that postoperative complications, including ascites, arterial or venous bleeding, and biliary leakage, were more frequent in PLD patients (10.8% vs. 29.3%). In this review, no studies were identified which used patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to assess the effect of cyst fenestration on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

However, one study used the gastrointestinal questionnaire to assess symptoms 4 weeks before and after cyst fenestration in 12 PLD patients. Reporting of all symptoms decreased, but only the decrease in abdominal distension (P = 0.01) and postprandial fullness (P = 0.02) was significant. Furthermore, a correlation between liver volume and pain was found.

In conclusion, only one small study shows that cyst fenestration has a total liver volume (TLV) lowering property associated with a decrease in pain and a reduction of gastrointestinal symptoms. Currently, improvement of HRQoL in PLD patients has not been sufficiently studied.

### Diagnosis and management of polycystic liver disease [^113dM1Uh]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is arbitrarily defined as a liver that contains more than 20 cysts. The condition is associated with two genetically distinct diseases: as a primary phenotype in isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD) and as an extrarenal manifestation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Processes involved in hepatic cystogenesis include ductal plate malformation with concomitant abnormal fluid secretion, altered cell-matrix interaction, and cholangiocyte hyperproliferation.

PLD is usually a benign disease, but can cause debilitating abdominal symptoms in some patients. The main risk factors for the growth of liver cysts are female sex, exogenous oestrogen use, and multiple pregnancies. Ultrasonography is very useful for achieving a correct diagnosis of a polycystic liver and to differentiate between ADPKD and PCLD. Radiological and surgical therapies for symptomatic patients include aspiration-sclerotherapy, fenestration, segmental hepatic resection, and liver transplantation.

Medical therapies that interact with regulatory mechanisms controlling the expansion and growth of liver cysts are under investigation. Somatostatin analogues are promising; several clinical trials have shown that these drugs can reduce the volume of polycystic livers. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the diagnosis and management of PLD with a focus on literature published in the past four years.

### A cystic, septated lesion in the liver with unusual diagnosis [^1173qAtT]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old male patient from Iraq presented with symptoms of right upper-quadrant abdominal pain. Imaging showed a 9 cm, lobulated cystic lesion in the right liver lobe with thin septations, suggestive of a hydatid cyst. Although serology for hydatid disease was negative, the cystic lesion was treated by percutaneous drainage. Owing to persisting symptoms, he was re-evaluated, showing the same cystic lesion unchanged. On the presumptive diagnosis of cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, the patient underwent laparotomy. A solitary cystic lesion was found and removed by local excision.

Macroscopical examination revealed a multilocular, septated tumor. Histopathological assessment showed the lining of the cysts with epithelioid cells that exhibited immunohistochemical features consistent with a mesothelial origin. The pathology findings are consistent with an adenomatid tumor. In the differential diagnosis, a benign multicystic mesothelioma was also considered. These are rare cystic lesions in the liver, of which only a few cases have been described in the literature.

It is advised to prefer percutaneous aspiration, injection, and reaspiration (PAIR) technique over standard catheterization or surgery. The use of PAIR should be avoided if biliary communication is present.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: Classification, diagnosis, and management [^115mY1D1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

CT represents the examination of choice for the detection of biliary and/or vascular involvement, cyst wall rupture, and superinfection. Changes in EC architecture, biliary dilation, presence of air, air-fluid level, or fat-fluid level within the cyst are nonspecific signs of intrabiliary rupture. T2-weighted MRI sequences and MRCP are similarly useful in diagnosing intrabiliary EC rupture. A poorly defined cystic lesion, a hyperenhancing rim, patchy heterogeneously enhancing areas in the vicinity of the lesion, and internal gas or air-fluid levels within the cyst combined with the appropriate clinical scenario are CT findings highly suggestive of EC superinfection.

Type I ECs and biliary MCNs share many common radiologic characteristics with HSCs. When managing patients with unilocular cystic liver lesions, one should keep in mind that rapidly growing symptomatic cysts need to be differentiated from both MCNs and ECs. Thus, anti-echinococcal antibodies should always be sent along with the remaining workup, especially in endemic areas or when immigrants from these areas are involved.

The optimal therapeutic approach for the management of hepatic ECs depends on the extent of organ involvement, the number and size of cysts, the presence of communication with the biliary tree, and simultaneous bacterial contamination and/or intracystic hemorrhage. One can choose between three different treatment modalities: a) systemic chemotherapy with mebendazole/albendazole; b) surgical approaches, ranging from deroofing to major hepatectomy; and c) percutaneous US-guided "puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration" (PAIR).
