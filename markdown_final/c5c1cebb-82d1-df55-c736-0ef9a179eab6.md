## Question

initial pharmacologic and non pharmacologic management of VWD, referrals, follow up, patient education

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management of von Willebrand disease, including referrals, follow-up, and patient education. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline severity. Then, I should verify desmopressin responsiveness with a structured trial. Next, I will consider first-line pharmacologic options and when to escalate to VWF concentrates. After that, I need to integrate non-pharmacologic strategies and special populations. Finally, I should confirm referral pathways, follow-up cadence, and a practical patient education checklist, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline severity, because management hinges on accurate typing and bleeding phenotype. I should review personal and family bleeding history, quantify bleeding with a validated tool, and obtain core labs including VWF antigen, VWF activity (e.g. ristocetin cofactor), and FVIII, with attention to VWF:Ag to VWF:Act ratios to distinguish qualitative from quantitative defects, and I should remember that VWF levels can normalize with age or in inflammatory states, so I need to interpret results in clinical context and consider re-evaluating rather than removing a prior diagnosis if levels normalize over time [^115K1zNd] [^114ZUoQL] [^113F1uRY] [^1161SRy9].

> Wait, let me verify the desmopressin trial strategy before committing to therapy. For patients with suspected type 1, 2A, 2M, or 2N VWD, I should perform a desmopressin challenge measuring VWF antigen, VWF activity, and FVIII at baseline, 30–60 minutes, and 4–6 hours to document a clinically meaningful rise and avoid hyponatremia, and I should avoid empiric desmopressin without a trial in those with baseline VWF < 0.30 IU/mL, while remembering desmopressin is contraindicated in type 2B, in patients under 2 years, with active cardiovascular disease or thrombotic risk, in seizure disorders, and in type 1C around surgery due to rapid clearance, and I should counsel on fluid restriction to about 1 liter in the first 24 hours to mitigate hyponatremia risk [^112wxQG2] [^112wxQG2] [^115AGUJJ] [^111ZTp8S] [^112xFiUC] [^1162BZWE].

> Hold on, I should verify first-line pharmacologic choices and when to escalate. For type 1 VWD with a positive desmopressin response, desmopressin is preferred for minor bleeding or procedures, whereas for type 3, most type 2, or desmopressin-nonresponsive cases, VWF-containing concentrates are indicated, with typical dosing of 40–80 VWF:RCo IU/kg IV, noting that VWF-only products may require adjunct FVIII if baseline FVIII is low, and I should consider tranexamic acid as adjunct for mucosal bleeding or when desmopressin is contraindicated or insufficient, while remembering that combined hormonal contraception or a levonorgestrel IUD are first-line for heavy menstrual bleeding in women with VWD [^115PuFdt] [^115exqYn] [^112QcArB] [^116RW6MW] [^111jiNpw].

> I need to ensure I address non-pharmacologic strategies and special populations. For heavy menstrual bleeding, iron replacement and screening for gynecologic pathology are essential, and shared decision-making around hormonal therapies or IUDs is recommended, with multidisciplinary input when needed; in older adults, I should be cautious with desmopressin due to hyponatremia risk and consider concentrates; in pregnancy, VWF rises in the second and third trimesters, but I should coordinate delivery in a center with 24-hour access to factor monitoring and multidisciplinary teams, especially for type 2 or 3 VWD; for patients who require antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, I should individualize risk–benefit decisions, avoid desmopressin in cardiovascular disease, and consider VWF concentrate prophylaxis in those with severe bleeding phenotypes [^116RW6MW] [^1173VE7e] [^113cfZs5] [^111UU1oS] [^114ucnVy].

> Next, I should review referral pathways and follow-up cadence. All patients should be linked to a Hemophilia Treatment Center or hematologist with bleeding disorder expertise for confirmation of diagnosis, subtype classification, and development of a personalized plan, with urgent referral for severe bleeding, suspected type 3 or 2B, pregnancy planning, or need for major surgery; routine follow-up every 6–12 months is reasonable for stable patients, with annual reassessment of bleeding symptoms, iron status, and the need for prophylaxis, and I should periodically reassess desmopressin responsiveness because phenotype can evolve [^114u6KD3] [^115kMNMg] [^1161SRy9].

> Let me think about patient education and safety counseling, and I should double-check that I cover the essentials. Patients should receive written and verbal education on their VWD type, desmopressin use and fluid restriction, recognition of hyponatremia symptoms, when to use tranexamic acid, and a bleeding action plan for injuries, dental procedures, and surgery; women should be counseled on menstrual management and pregnancy planning; all patients should carry emergency information and consider medical identification, and I should coordinate with dentists, surgeons, and obstetricians to ensure procedures are planned with appropriate hemostatic coverage [^112YVjw3] [^116RW6MW] [^115r5RU4].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with acute bleeding or needs urgent surgery before a desmopressin trial can be completed. In that scenario, I should not delay hemostasis; I should treat empirically with VWF concentrate to achieve perioperative targets of VWF and FVIII at or above 0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days after major surgery and individualize duration, and for minor procedures, combining VWF elevation with tranexamic acid reduces bleeding compared with VWF elevation alone, so I should integrate antifibrinolytics when appropriate while arranging for definitive subtype testing once stabilized [^111z9ggA] [^112Yz1pz] [^112QcArB].

> I should confirm that my plan aligns with guideline strength and certainty. Many recommendations here are conditional and based on low to very low certainty evidence, particularly around prophylaxis and antithrombotic therapy in VWD, so shared decision-making that incorporates patient values, access, and feasibility is essential, and I should document the rationale for choosing desmopressin versus concentrate, the timing of procedures, and the monitoring plan to support individualized care and future reassessment [^117SSFC1] [^111xFNF2] [^111UU1oS].

Initial management of von Willebrand disease (VWD) centers on **desmopressin (DDAVP) for type 1 and some type 2 cases** [^112wxQG2], with **VWF/FVIII concentrates for non-responders or type 3 disease** [^112QcArB]. Tranexamic acid is used for mucosal bleeding or as adjuncts [^116RW6MW]. Non-pharmacologic care includes **patient education, bleeding precautions, and dental hygiene** [^115r5RU4]; refer to a hematologist for diagnosis, severe disease, or surgery [^114u6KD3]. Follow-up should monitor bleeding, iron status, and treatment response, with annual reviews and individualized plans [^115kMNMg].

## Initial pharmacologic management

### Desmopressin (DDAVP)

- **Indication**: First-line for type 1 VWD and some type 2 subtypes (2A, 2M, 2N) [^112DYJQT].
- **Mechanism**: Releases endogenous VWF and FVIII from endothelial stores [^113ZLyL1].
- **Administration**: IV or intranasal; trial required to confirm response [^112wxQG2].
- **Contraindications**: Type 2B (risk of thrombocytopenia) [^111ZTp8S], type 3, severe cardiovascular disease, or age < 2 years [^115AGUJJ].
- **Precautions**: Limit fluids to 1 L in 24 hours to reduce hyponatremia risk [^112xFiUC]; monitor sodium in children and elderly [^notfound].

---

### Von Willebrand factor/factor VIII concentrates

- **Indication**: Type 3 VWD, severe type 1/2, or DDAVP non-responders [^112QcArB].
- **Products**: Plasma-derived VWF/FVIII (e.g. Humate-P) or recombinant VWF (VONVENDI) [^115exqYn].
- **Dosing**: 40–80 IU/kg IV; adjust to maintain VWF:RCo and FVIII ≥ 50 IU/mL for 3 days post-surgery [^111z9ggA].
- **Monitoring**: Track VWF:RCo, FVIII, and clinical response [^117XMNsz].

---

### Antifibrinolytic agents

Tranexamic acid is used for **mucosal bleeding** (oral, nasal, uterine) or as adjuncts when DDAVP is insufficient or contraindicated [^116RW6MW]. Typical dosing is 1 g PO/IV every 6–8 hours for 3–5 days.

---

## Initial non-pharmacologic management

### Patient education

Education should cover **VWD type, triggers, and warning signs** of bleeding [^115r5RU4]. Patients should avoid NSAIDs and maintain good dental hygiene; carry emergency information and a medical alert [^notfound].

---

### Bleeding precautions

Precautions include using **soft toothbrushes**, electric razors, and protective gear for sports. For minor injuries, apply local pressure and ice.

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Modifications include maintaining a **healthy weight**, engaging in regular low-impact exercise, and avoiding contact sports in severe VWD.

---

## Indications for referral to hematology

- **Confirm diagnosis and subtype** [^114u6KD3].
- **Severe disease** (type 3 or frequent bleeding).
- **Surgery or invasive procedures** [^113cfZs5].
- **Pregnancy or childbirth** [^113cfZs5].
- **Complications** (alloantibodies, thrombosis, refractory bleeding).

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

- **Frequency**: Every 6–12 months; annually for stable patients.
- **Assessment**: Bleeding history, iron status, and treatment response [^115kMNMg].
- **Labs**: VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, FVIII as indicated.
- **Adjust therapy** based on bleeding phenotype and life changes (pregnancy, surgery) [^117XMNsz].

### Beyond the guidelines: how we approach challenging scenarios in the diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease [^112o3sD9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Although von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, its diagnosis and management are often challenging. Clinical practice guidelines, developed through systematic review of the medical literature and considering the best available evidence, provide guidance for common clinical scenarios. However, in the clinical setting, patients often present with characteristics and nuances that may fall outside the realm of available evidence and guidelines, and hence, shared decision-making will be essential in the evaluation and management of these patients. The challenges in the diagnosis of VWD are mainly attributable to the heterogeneity of the disorder, limitations of laboratory assays, and the significant impact of various physiologic processes on von Willebrand factor. The impact of physiologic normalization of von Willebrand factor, which may occur in various settings such as pregnancy, inflammation, or aging, remains uncertain, as is the optimal management in these scenarios. Multidisciplinary and individualized care, based on evolving evidence supported by clinicians, patients, caregivers, and stakeholders, will be needed to ensure the highest quality care for those who live with VWD.

### Hemophilia and von Willebrand disease: a review of emergency department management [^115iJJEF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemophilia and von Willebrand disease (VWD) are the most common congenital coagulation factor deficiencies. Patients with these disorders who experience bleeding complications are often initially managed in the emergency department (ED).

Objective Of The Review

This review will focus on the emergency department management of patients with these disorders and provide an update on current treatment options.

Discussion

The mainstay of management is initial stabilization, control of bleeding when possible, and administration of specific factors. Early coordination of care with hematology is critical.

Conclusions

Emergency medicine providers must have an understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management strategies in order to optimally care for these complex patients.

ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 — cardiovascular disease and antithrombotic therapy in VWD emphasizes that the disease course is dynamic, the risk of complications increases over time, and the panel highlighted the importance of the cardioprotective effects of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulant therapy, if otherwise indicated, noting that a personalized treatment plan (eg, administration of VWF concentrate for prophylaxis) should be developed along with patient education. Consideration should be given to interventions that would limit the length of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy required (eg, non–drug-eluting stents). It should also be noted that bleeding is more of a risk in type 2 or type 3 VWD and in type 1 VWD with additional conditions such as FXI deficiency or a platelet function defect; prophylaxis with VWF concentrate and/or administration of tranexamic acid may be required in patients with a severe bleeding phenotype to minimize bleeding. The panel identified research priorities including studies on prophylaxis in VWD patients receiving antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy, on the incidence of cardiovascular disease in VWD, and on stent strategy comparisons for coronary artery stent placement.

Unlabelled

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and may affect as many as one in 100 women. The condition results from a deficiency, dysfunction, or absence of von Willebrand factor (VWF). In women, the most common symptom of VWD is menorrhagia. Of women with menorrhagia, 5–20% have been found to have previously undiagnosed VWD. Besides menorrhagia, women with VWD are more likely to experience other conditions that manifest with abnormal reproductive tract bleeding. The patient with a suspected bleeding disorder should be referred to a hemophilia treatment center or hematologist with expertise in bleeding disorders for definitive diagnosis. After diagnosis, the first choice of therapy for the management of menorrhagia in adolescents or adult females who do not desire child bearing is still hormonal contraceptives. Women who fail hormonal contraceptives, yet desire future child bearing, and women who desire pregnancy are candidates for hemostatic therapy, which is generally reserved for patients with VWF levels less than 50 international units/dL. During pregnancy, VWF levels rise, frequently obviating the need for hemostatic therapy at the time of delivery. Minor procedures can be managed with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, antifibrinolytic medication, or both, but major surgery or childbirth requires replacement with VWF and should be conducted in a center with available hematologists, anesthesiologists, pharmacists, and laboratory support experienced in the management of bleeding disorders.

Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in von Willebrand disease — good practice statements, contraindications, and evidence emphasize shared decision making and low-certainty data. Good practice statements: Patients considered for treatment require individualized analyses of the risks and benefits of the specific therapy plan in conjunction with a multidisciplinary team that includes cardiovascular medicine specialists, hematologists, and the patient. Patient education about the risks and benefits of using antiplatelet agents or anticoagulant therapy should be provided to inform a shared decision making. Desmopressin therapy is generally contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular disease (eg, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease) and/or increased risk of thrombosis. Evidence is limited: We found 2 case series reported in 3 sources; in an 8-patient case series, 1 patient died after experiencing intracranial posttraumatic bleeding while on aspirin after 11 years on therapy; across 2 observational studies, none of 6 patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin experienced thromboembolic events; and in the 26 patients with VWD in the series, there was 1 major bleeding event. In the 56 patients who received therapy and in the 9 patients who did not receive therapy even though it was recommended, outcomes such as median mortality, thrombotic events, serious adverse events, hospitalizations, and bleeding were low in both arms. The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit, and there is very low certainty that there is an effect on other outcomes.

1. 1. 1 Primary Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy and safety of VONVENDI, with or without ADVATE, in the treatment and control of nonsurgical bleeding events in pediatric patients diagnosed with severe, hereditary VWD. Study 071102 was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled Phase 3 trial that evaluated the on-demand treatment of nonsurgical bleeding episodes and the perioperative management of bleeding in pediatric patients with severe, hereditary VWD. The study consists of 3 treatment arms: On-demand, elective surgery, and emergency. month treatment period, which was extended to 18 months in certain cases due to delays in initiating the continuation study. Some surgical patients also transitioned to the on-demand arm post-operatively when eligibility criteria were met.

The study population was stratified into three age cohorts, each with at least 8 evaluable patients: Cohort 1, Cohort 2, and Cohort 3.

Treatment for von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, has advanced considerably since its initial description by Erik von Willebrand first described a family in the Åland Islands with severe bleeding. Infusion of von Willebrand factor (VWF) containing concentrates continue to serve as the foundation of management in addition to desmopressin, hormonal therapies, and antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid. Recent advancements in VWD management are underscored by the publication of evidence-based international guidelines addressing critical aspects such as VWF prophylaxis, the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents for cardiovascular disease, and comprehensive management during surgical as well as obstetric and gynecologic scenarios. This review provides an overview of modern treatment strategies, discusses management in special populations, and explores emerging therapies and future directions for improving VWD care.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common bleeding disorder, affecting male and female individuals equally, that often manifests in mucosal bleeding. VWD can be secondary to a quantitative (Type 1 and Type 3) or qualitative (Type 2) defects in Von Willebrand factor (VWF). Initial testing includes VWF antigen, as well as a platelet binding assay to differentiate between qualitative and quantitative defects. Further subtyping requires additional testing and is needed to ensure appropriate treatment. Desmopressin, antifibrinolytics, hormonal treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, and VWF concentrates are commonly used in the treatment of VWD.

### Von Willebrand disease and other bleeding disorders in women: consensus on diagnosis and management from an international expert panel [^112nicKH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Reproductive tract bleeding in women is a naturally occurring event during menstruation and childbirth. In women with menorrhagia, however, congenital bleeding disorders historically have been underdiagnosed. This consensus is intended to allow physicians to better recognize bleeding disorders as a cause of menorrhagia and consequently offer effective disease-specific therapies.

### Diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease: guidelines for primary care [^1143F86Z]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease is an inherited condition characterized by deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which is essential in hemostasis. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has released new evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the disease. There are three major subtypes of von Willebrand disease, classified as partial quantitative deficiency (low levels) of von Willebrand factor (type 1), qualitative deficiency (type 2), or virtually complete deficiency (type 3). Diagnosis is usually made by reviewing the patient's personal and family history of bleeding and by clinical evaluation for more common reasons for bleeding, supplemented with laboratory tests. Assessment may be used to determine bleeding risk before surgery and other invasive procedures, and to diagnose reasons for unexplained hemorrhaging. Von Willebrand factor levels of 30 IU per dL or lower are required for the definite diagnosis of inherited von Willebrand disease. Persons with levels of 30 to 50 IU per dL may not have the disease, but may need agents to increase von Willebrand factor levels during invasive procedures or childbirth. Treatment is tailored to the subtype of the disease: increasing plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor by releasing endogenous stores with desmopressin or replacing nonexistent or ineffective von Willebrand factor by using human plasma-derived, viral-inactivated concentrates; treatment is often combined with hemostatic agents that have mechanisms other than increasing von Willebrand factor. Regular prophylaxis is seldom required, and treatment is initiated before planned invasive procedures or in response to bleeding.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^11565y2F]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Management of severe VWD patients is more demanding than management of mild VWD/ type 1 patients. Severe VWD patients carry a high risk of bleeding in some specific situations, such as during delivery or surgery and after development of alloantibodies to VWF. Patients with severe VWD who lack HMW multimers also have a high risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia. Patients suffering from recurrent bleedings may benefit from prophylaxis, which is only offered to a small number of patients. Future prospective studies are needed to investigate the benefit of newer treatment options, to improve current management and update guidelines in these patients.

### Guideline recommendations and guiding principles… [^113eo5KJ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

These five guiding principles should broadly inform the implementation of the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline recommendations.
- Acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately assessed and treated independent of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen.
- Recommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, person-centered care. Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a specific patient is paramount.
- A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the physical health, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and expected health outcomes. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy. __Recommendation 2__ Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain.

Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. __Recommendation 5__ For patients already receiving opioid therapy, clinicians should carefully weigh benefits and risks and exercise care when changing opioid dosage.
- If benefits outweigh risksof continued opioid therapy, clinicians should work closely with patients to optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy.
- If. __Recommendation 7__ Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1–4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients.

Assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use are addressed by recommendations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. __Recommendation 8__ Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk for opioid-related harms and discuss risk with patients. Clinicians should work with patients to incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone. Additional Strategies to Mitigate Risk. When prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically during opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program data to determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient at high risk for overdose.

### ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the management of von Willebrand disease [^112FR5Vc]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common inherited bleeding disorder. Significant variability exists in management options offered to patients.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), and the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and health care professionals in their decisions about management of VWD.

Methods

ASH, ISTH, NHF, and WFH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel. Three patient representatives were included. The panel was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The University of Kansas Outcomes and Implementation Research Unit and the McMaster Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Centre supported the guideline development process, including performing and updating systematic evidence reviews (through November 2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance to clinicians and patients. The panel used the GRADE approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 12 recommendations and outlined future research priorities.

Conclusions

These guidelines make key recommendations regarding prophylaxis for frequent recurrent bleeding, desmopressin trials to determine therapy, use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulant therapy, target VWF and factor VIII activity levels for major surgery, strategies to reduce bleeding during minor surgery or invasive procedures, management options for heavy menstrual bleeding, management of VWD in the context of neuraxial anesthesia during labor and delivery, and management in the postpartum setting.

Assessment of quality of the evidence

We assessed the quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessments, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The quality of the evidence assessment considered the study design, and risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, presence of large effects, dose-response gradient, and residual confounding. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias toolfor RCTs and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool(ROBINS) for comparative observational studies. Because of the lack of a comparison group in single-arm studies, which we used to make inferences about how treatments compare, their risk of bias was judged as high by default. We assessed inconsistency by comparing the point estimates and CIs across studies, and we used statistical measures (χ² and I²). We assessed indirectness by focusing on characteristics of the population, particularly the proportion of participants who had VWD instead of other bleeding disorders. We assessed imprecision using a non-contextualized approach and the null effect as the threshold of interest, as well as the optimal information size. We planned to assess publication bias using funnel plots if a meta-analysis had ≥ 10 studies.

We constructed Summary of Findings tables using GRADEpro. Whenever possible, we present absolute and relative estimates of effects. We calculated absolute estimates using the results from the studies included. In the tables, we included all outcomes for which there was evidence and outcomes that were considered critical or important for decision-making by the guideline panel but for which there was no information. We planned to conduct subgroup analyses based on the risk of bias of the studies and the populations included. We did not plan any sensitivity analyses.

Von Willebrand disease — heavy menstrual bleeding management remarks and practice statements indicate that "multiple options can be combined" when control is suboptimal, that "Desmopressin is not effective in type 3 and many type 2 VWD patients and is contraindicated in type 2B VWD", and that "Women may require additional treatment directed at bleeding symptoms for the first several menstrual cycles after placement of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system". The panel "encourages the development of multidisciplinary clinics", and decisions on a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system "should be made in the setting of shared decision making with multidisciplinary input". Patients with heavy menstrual bleeding "should be regularly assessed and treated for iron deficiency and/or anemia", and women with bleeding disorders "should undergo a standard gynecologic assessment… to rule out common pelvic pathologies, such as fibroids and polyps", with special consideration for those at higher risk including "women age > 35 years" and those with relevant comorbidities.

1 INTRODUCTION

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is caused by a deficiency or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric glycoprotein with a high molecular weight. 1 VWF plays a crucial role in primary hemostasis, promoting the adhesion of platelets to subendothelium after vascular injury and in blood coagulation as it carries and protects factor VIII (FVIII) from inactivation and rapid catabolism. 2, 3 VWD is a heterogeneous disease ranging from moderate to very severe deficiency in VWF and is classified into three different types: type 1 and type 3 are characterized by a partial or (virtually) complete quantitative deficiency of VWF while type 2 results from qualitative defects. 4 The prevalence of VWD in patients referred for clinically relevant bleeding symptoms is about 0.01% although the most severe form type 3 VWD is very rare (0.5‐5 cases/million). 1, 5, 6

The goal of VWD therapy is the correction of the VWF defect and, consequently, the correction of abnormal platelet adhesion and the abnormal intrinsic coagulation pathway. 1 Several plasma‐derived VWF/FVIII factor concentrates, initially developed for the treatment of hemophilia A and containing also large amounts of VWF, can be used to treat desmopressin‐unresponsive or intolerant patients with VWD. These VWF/FVIII products vary in VWF/FVIII ratio, depending upon the manufacturing process. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 As the FVIII defect in VWD is secondary to that of VWF, the endogenous synthesis of FVIII is normal contrary to hemophilia A. Thus, correction of the VWF defect results also in the correction of FVIII levels, as has been shown in patients with severe VWD. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Repeated administration of dual VWF/FVIII concentrates may induce unnecessary increases in FVIII levels that could promote thrombotic complications when supra‐physiologic in high‐risk patients. 17

Bleeding reduction strategy — desmopressin (DDAVP): Providers can employ techniques to help reduce blood loss in individuals at higher risk for bleeding, and desmopressin (also known as DDAVP) stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor from endothelial cells and has been shown to decrease blood loss from surgical procedures in those with bleeding diatheses such as type 1 von Willebrand disease, mild hemophilia, and some platelet function disorders.

### How I treat von Willebrand disorders in older adults [^1173VE7e]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common bleeding disorder and especially milder type 1 VWD might not be cared for in specialty clinics. VW factor levels rise with age, but the rise of these levels does not necessarily correlate with bleeding risk. A recent bleeding history combined with recent labs are important for hemostatic management decision during surgical interventions. Antifibrinolytics appear safe in the population of older adults, whereas desmopressin (DDAVP) should be used cautiously. Where needed, factor concentrates present a great treatment option. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome is vastly underrecognized, but likely to surface in the aging, especially in the setting of comorbidities, such as plasma-cell dyscrasias. Intravenous immunoglobulin can be an effective treatment in this scenario, but potentially increases thrombotic risk.

### Von Willebrand disease: what does the future hold? [^111J3k6M]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by its heterogeneous clinical manifestation, which complicates its diagnosis and management. The clinical management of VWD has remained essentially unchanged over the last 30 years or so, using von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentrates, desmopressin, and anti-fibrinolytic agents as main tools to control bleeding. This is in contrast to hemophilia A, for which a continuous innovative path has led to novel treatment modalities. Despite current VWD management being considered effective, quality-of-life studies consistently reveal a higher than anticipated burden of VWD on patients, which is particularly true for women. Apparently, despite our perceived notion of current therapeutic efficiency, there is space for innovation with the goal of reaching superior efficacy. Developing innovative treatments for VWD is complex, especially given the heterogeneity of the disease and the multifunctional nature of VWF. In this perspective article, we describe several potential strategies that could provide the basis for future VWD treatments. These include genetic approaches, such as gene therapy using dual-vector adenoassociated virus and transcriptional silencing of mutant alleles. Furthermore, protein-based approaches to increase factor FVIII levels in VWD-type 3 or 2N patients are discussed. Finally, antibody-based options to interfere with VWF degradation (for congenital VWD-type 2A or acquired von Willebrand syndrome-type 2A) or increase endogenous VWF levels (for VWD-type 1) are presented. By highlighting these potential strategies, we hope to initiate an innovative path, which ultimately would allow us to better serve VWD patients and their specific needs.

In conclusion, desmopressin is an essential therapeutic tool in VWD type 1 and non-severe Hem A, because more than 220,000 bleeding episodes can be annually treated safely and economically. This number could almost double if all patients registered are considered, or even increase 6-fold if we allow for one symptomatic patient out of 10,000 people seeking tertiary care referral for VWD. Finally, there is a need to improve VWD and hemophilia diagnosis globally, because it is reasonable to imply that 1 out of 1,000 individuals may suffer from bleeding symptoms, but will not have been diagnosed or received appropriate treatment.

Summary

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Most patients with mild and moderate VWD can be treated effectively with desmopressin. The management of severe VWD patients, mostly affected by type 2 and type 3 disease, can be challenging. In this article we review the current diagnosis and treatment of severe VWD patients. We will also discuss the management of severe VWD patients in specific situations, such as pregnancy, delivery, patients developing alloantibodies against von Willebrand factor and VWD patients with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Moreover, we review emerging treatments that may be applied in future management of patients with severe VWD.

### Guidance on the diagnosis and management of platelet-type von Willebrand disease: a communication from the platelet physiology subcommittee of the ISTH [^116x7Cpx]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (PT-VWD) is a rare autosomal dominant platelet bleeding disorder, with 55 patients reported worldwide so far, probably frequently misdiagnosed. Currently, there are no clear guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PT-VWD and this may contribute to misdiagnosis and thus to inappropriate treatment of these patients. This report provides expert opinion-based consensus recommendations for the standardized diagnostic and management approach to PT-VWD. Tests essential in the diagnostic workup are platelet count and size, ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination with mixing studies, and sequencing of platelet GP1BA gene. Platelet transfusions and von Willebrand factor-rich concentrates (if VWF is low) are the most effective treatments. This consensus may help to avoid misdiagnosis and guide appropriate management of patients with this disease.

### Gynecologic and obstetric management of women with von Willebrand disease: summary of 3 systematic reviews of the literature [^111yYYHe]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

These SRs have several strengths. First, we conducted them according to rigorous methodological standards. Second, we used broad eligibility criteria to include any type of evidence that could be informative. For example, we included evidence from women with bleeding disorders other than VWD, as well as study designs that are not considered optimal for making inferences about treatment effects (such as case series) when these were the only evidence available. Third, we conducted an explicit and transparent assessment of the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach and used this assessment to make conclusions that considered not only the effect estimates, but also the certainty of the evidence.

Our SRs have limitations common to all SRs. Finding the relevant studies depends on the quality of the indexing process of the searched databases, and some of the studies included in the SRs were not indexed under the terms describing women with bleeding disorders used in our initial search strategy. Similarly, including studies depends on the clear reporting in title and abstracts, which was not the case for many of these studies. We overcame these limitations by maintaining close collaboration with the guideline panel members who were familiar with the literature and were able to point out studies that may be relevant but had not been originally found because of the limitations described herein. This way, we were certain to include all relevant evidence.

Introduction

The American Society of Hematology (ASH), International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF; now the National Bleeding Disorders Foundation), and World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) 2021 guidelines on the diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease (VWD) were created to establish evidence-based guidelines to improve the diagnosis and management of VWD, the most common inherited bleeding disorder. The diagnosis guidelines issued 11 recommendations outlining the role of bleeding assessment tools in the assessment of people suspected of having VWD (recommendations 1–3), diagnostic assays and laboratory cutoffs for type 1 and type 2 VWD (recommendations 4, 6–8, 9), how to approach a patient with type 1 VWD with normalized levels over time (recommendation 5), and the role of genetic testing vs phenotypic assays for types 2B and 2N VWD (recommendations 10–11). The management guidelines issued 12 recommendations outlining prophylaxis for frequent recurrent bleeding (recommendation 1), desmopressin trials to determine therapy (recommendations 2A and 2B), use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulant therapy (recommendation 3), target von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII activity levels for major surgery (recommendations 4A and 4B), strategies to reduce bleeding during minor surgery or invasive procedures (recommendations 5A and 5B), management options for heavy menstrual bleeding (recommendations 6A and 6B), management of VWD in the context of neuraxial anesthesia during labor and delivery (recommendation 7), and management in the postpartum setting (recommendation 8). This review of the 2021 guidelines by the clinical co-chairs of the guidelines was requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision.

This article addresses 2 systematic review questions:
1 In patients with VWD who are undergoing major surgery, what are the comparative effects of keeping the factor VIII (FVIII) level ≥ 0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days after the surgery or the VWF level ≥ 0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days after the surgery? (SR1)
2 In patients with VWD who are undergoing minor surgery or minor invasive procedures, what are the comparative effects of increasing the VWF level to ≥ 0.50 IU/mL by using VWF concentrate or desmopressin, increasing the VWF level to ≥ 0.50 IU/mL by using VWF concentrate or desmopressin in conjunction with TXA, or prescribing TXA alone?

### Surgical management of patients with von Willebrand disease: summary of 2 systematic reviews of the literature [^112Yz1pz]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. The management of patients with VWD who are undergoing surgeries is crucial to prevent bleeding complications. We systematically summarized the evidence on the management of patients with VWD who are undergoing major and minor surgeries to support the development of practice guidelines. We searched Medline and EMBASE from inception through October 2019 for randomized clinical trials (RCTs), comparative observational studies, and case series that compared maintaining factor VIII (FVIII) levels or von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels at > 0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days in patients undergoing major surgery, and those with options for perioperative management of patients undergoing minor surgery. Two authors screened and abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted meta-analyses when possible. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. We included 7 case series for major surgeries and 2 RCTs and 12 case series for minor surgeries. Very-low-certainty evidence showed that maintaining FVIII levels or VWF levels of > 0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 consecutive days showed excellent hemostatic efficacy (as labeled by the researchers) after 74% to 100% of major surgeries. Low- to very-low-certainty evidence showed that prescribing tranexamic acid and increasing VWF levels to 0.50 IU/mL resulted in fewer bleeding complications after minor procedures compared with increasing VWF levels to 0.50 IU/mL alone. Given the low-quality evidence for guiding management decisions, a shared-decision model leading to individualized therapy plans will be important in patients with VWD who are undergoing surgical and invasive procedures.

### Understanding the pain management landscape within the US bleeding disorder community: a multi-center survey [^111D4bBM]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CDC Guidelines Alignment

All providers recognized the importance of pain management in PWH. Prior to initiating opioid therapy, a vast majority of prescribers trialed non-opioid medications first. The P-APP-N group was consistent in contacting patients post opioid prescription initiation although the time frame varied from between 1 and 3 days to as long as > 31 days. Prescribers recognized and utilized clinically important findings before prescribing opioids and 96% counseled their patients regarding potential risk factors (see Figure 1).

Both the PT and SW groups reported utilizing non-pharmacologic options most often within their scope of practice when treating pain in PWBD. A pain specialist was the most frequently accessed resource by the SW and P-APP-N groups and PMR providers were the most frequently accessed by the PT group but there remain challenges to referrals as well as access to these specialists. Insurance companies as well as HTC's should be challenged to explore provisions to provide specialist consultations and evidence-based non-pharmacologic options to decrease costs and, most importantly, improve pain management in PWBD. In this era of opioid misuse and/or abuse, non-pharmacological options remain viable multimodal pain management opportunities. Results of this study identify opportunities for greater use of these modalities in PWBD suffering pain. It is important for all HTC providers to become educated within this domain, thus gaining more confidence and comfort with their recommendation and usage.

- On-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes.
- Perioperative management of bleeding. For adult patients only: Routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes Orphan Designated Yes. Study 071301 was a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, international, multicenter, phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of routine prophylaxis with Vonvendi in adult patients with severe VWD. 12 months was planned for each patient. It included 22 patients who received either: Five patients with Types 1 and 2 VWD received prophylaxis.

Study 071301 demonstrated that Vonvendi is safe and effective in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 VWD with 100% decrease in sABR in prior OD patients and Switch patients on prior prophylaxis with pd-VWF maintaining 0 sABR without significant safety concerns. After completion of study 071301, patients could enroll on continuation study SHP677-304. The results were similar showing that Vonvendi prophylaxis is safe and effective in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 VWD with prior OD patients having at least a 25% decrease in sABR and Switch patients on prior prophylaxis with pd-. verify severity of VWD in the patients included in the study. In conclusion, Vonvendi is safe and effective for prophylaxis for adults with all types of VWD. similar with all nonsurgical BE's treated with Vonvendi having treatment success of hemostatic efficacy in the OD arm. All surgeries had excellent outcomes. There were no significant safety concerns.

Bleeding disorders — clinical considerations note that individuals with bleeding disorders may be at greater risk for increased blood loss, hemorrhage, and possible complications during medication abortion and procedural abortion; the most common inherited bleeding disorder is von Willebrand disease (VWD), caused by decreased levels of von Willebrand factor or, more rarely, a dysfunctional protein; the prevalence of symptomatic VWD is estimated to be 0.01%; and increased estrogen during pregnancy leads to progressively higher von Willebrand factor levels over the second and third trimesters, which mitigates to some extent bleeding risk for women with symptomatic VWD.

### Biological therapies for von Willebrand disease [^114H9sxJ]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

von Willebrand factor (VWF)-related disorders are generally distinguished as either acquired (von Willebrand Syndrome; VWS) or congenital (von Willebrand Disease; VWD). VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and is due to deficiencies and/or defects in VWF. VWS arises from a large variety of causes.

Areas Covered

The current report briefly overviews the diagnosis of VWD and VWS, but primarily covers the management of these disorders, as reflected by differential processes applied within different centers worldwide, also focusing on emerging trends in biological therapies. Most developed countries currently use standard therapy to manage bleeding, employing desmopressin wherever possible, factor concentrate in other situations and additional (e.g., antifibrinolytic) therapy when required. With regards to factor concentrates, there are differences in content between those available in relation to levels and composition of VWF and factor VIII, and only selective concentrates are available in different localities.

Expert Opinion

All these aspects reflect important but sometimes overlooked issues when using replacement therapy, or attempting to follow expert guidelines. Recombinant VWF has been developed and is undergoing clinical trials, and this promising therapy may change the VWD management landscape in the near future.

### Emergency department care for patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand disease [^115bZUEt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with bleeding disorders such as hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and von Willebrand disease (VWD) are routinely treated at home, with their care managed in specialized centers. In emergency situations, these patients often present to their local emergency department (ED), where their management can represent a challenge to the emergency physicians and staff who rarely encounter them. Delays in diagnosis and administration of replacement therapy are the factors most commonly identified as predictive of death. Patients and family members are often very well educated in the disease and its management, which can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. Children with bleeding disorders confer different challenges to the emergency physician and staff: they may present with no obvious signs of trauma or they may present with bruises consistent with non-accidental injury. All possible causes of bruising/bleeding should be investigated, although treatment should be administered promptly. The initial presentation of a bleeding disorder in the pediatric population is often made in the ED. Treatment of hemophilia A and B requires rapid replacement of the deficient clotting factor, with the desired factor level and dosage dependent on the product used and the hemorrhagic situation encountered. In patients with VWD, the main treatments are desmopressin or intravenous infusion of plasma-derived concentrates containing factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. The aim of this review is to outline some of the issues facing emergency physicians and the options available for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and VWD.

### ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease [^1157vYLD]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines — von Willebrand disease (VWD) epidemiology and classification state that VWD prevalence estimates range from ~1 in 100 to 1 in 10 000, and at the level of primary care, ~1 in 1000 individuals are affected and require medical attention for bleeding. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) classification recognizes 3 types: type 1 is a partial quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), type 2 is caused by qualitative abnormalities of VWF, and type 3 is a virtual absence of the VWF protein with associated very low FVIII levels, and type 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subtypes with specific features including type 2A characterized by reduced or absent high-molecular-weight VWF, type 2B resulting from a gain of function in VWF that increases its affinity for platelets, type 2M caused by reduced VWF interactions with platelets or collagen, and type 2N resulting from reduced binding of VWF to FVIII. The panel approached the guideline within this framework with the addition of type 1C VWD, which is caused by increased VWF clearance, given that it has management implications for patients. Affected patients experience diagnostic delays, with patients experiencing delays of 15 years or more from the onset of bleeding symptoms to a VWD diagnosis.

When it is possible to keep both trough levels at ≥ 0.50 IU/mL for at least 3 days or as long as clinically indicated after the surgery, this should be the preferred option; the specific target levels should be individualized based on the patient, type of procedure, and bleeding history as well as availability of VWF and FVIII testing, and the duration of the intervention can vary for specific types of surgeries.

### About von Willebrand disease… [^113ZLyL1]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Type 2 With this type of VWD, although the body makes normal amounts of the VWF, the factor does not work the way it should. Type 2 is further broken down into four subtypes―2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N―depending on the specific problem with the person's VWF. Because the treatment is different for each type, it's important that a person know which subtype he or she has. Diagnosis To find out if a person has VWD, the doctor will ask questions about personal and family histories of bleeding. The doctor also will check for unusual bruising or other signs of recent bleeding and order some blood tests to measure how the blood clots. The tests will provide information about the amount of clotting proteins present in the blood and if the clotting proteins are working properly. Because certain medications can cause bleeding, even among people without a bleeding disorder, the doctor will ask about recent or routine medications taken that could cause bleeding or make bleeding symptoms worse.

Treatment and recovery The type of treatment prescribed for VWD depends on the type and severity of the disease. For minor bleeds, treatment might not be needed. The most commonly used types of treatment are: Desmopressin acetate injection This medicine is injected into a vein to treat people with milder forms of VWD. It works by making the body release more VWF into the blood. It also helps increase the level of factor VIII in the blood. Factor replacement therapy Recombinant VWF and medicines rich in VWF and factor VIII are used to treat people with more severe forms of VWD or people with milder forms of VWD who do not respond well to the nasal spray. These medicines are injected into a vein in the arm to replace the missing factor in the blood.

Antifibrinolytic drugs These drugs are either injected or taken orally to help slow or prevent the breakdown of blood clots. Birth control pills Birth control pills can increase the levels of VWF and factor VIII in the blood and reduce menstrual blood loss. A doctor can prescribe these pills for women who have heavy menstrual bleeding.

### ASH ISTH NHF WFH 2021 guidelines on the management of von Willebrand disease [^112qm5ui]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Von Willebrand disease clinical overview — subtypes and symptoms: VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, originally described by Erik von Willebrand in 1926, with deficiencies in VWF arising through quantitative or qualitative defects and three major subtypes. Types 1 and 3 are quantitative defects, with type 1 VWD representing a mild to moderate deficiency in the VWF protein and type 3 VWD representing the more severe form, with near-complete absence of VWF; type 2 VWD includes variants with a qualitative defect in 1 of VWF's main functions, and the mechanism of type 2B VWD is important because it represents a gain-of-function defect with increased platelet binding leading to clearance of both VWF and platelets. The major symptoms include mucocutaneous bleeding such as epistaxis, easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from minor cuts, and heavy menstrual bleeding, as well as surgical bleeding particularly in the setting of dental extractions; patients with type 3 VWD may experience joint bleeds similar to those seen in hemophilia. Heavy menstrual bleeding is of particular concern in women, many of whom experience iron deficiency and anemia, and complications resulting from PPH are also more frequent in women with VWD.
