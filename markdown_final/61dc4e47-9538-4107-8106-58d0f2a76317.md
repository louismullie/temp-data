## Question

How is PIN injury diagnosed following a distal radius fracture ORIF

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) injury after distal radius fracture ORIF with a step-by-step diagnostic approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cardinal clinical signs that distinguish PIN palsy from other radial nerve problems. Then, I should verify the timing of deficit onset to help differentiate intraoperative injury from delayed compression or impingement. Next, I will review how and when to deploy electrodiagnostic studies to characterize severity and localization. After that, I need to check which imaging modality best visualizes the nerve and surrounding hardware or callus. I will then examine radiographs for implant-related causes and correct any assumptions that mislocalize the PIN. I should confirm the differential diagnosis and stratify etiology. Finally, I need to set evidence-based thresholds for surgical exploration and outline serial monitoring to track recovery and guide escalation of care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. The PIN is a pure motor branch of the radial nerve, so new postoperative inability to extend the MCP joints and thumb with preserved dorsal radial hand sensation strongly suggests PIN palsy rather than a complete radial nerve injury, and wrist extension may persist with radial deviation owing to ECU weakness, which I should explicitly look for on exam to anchor localization to the PIN territory [^114pNSPV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality without timing. Immediate postoperative deficits point toward intraoperative traction, compression, ischemia, or direct trauma, whereas delayed onset over days to weeks raises concern for evolving hematoma, edema, fracture callus, or hardware impingement, so I need to document the precise onset and any interval changes to inform subsequent testing and urgency of intervention [^113K3Emi] [^111naA2v].

> Wait, let me verify the role and timing of electrodiagnostics. I should obtain EMG/NCS after sufficient time for Wallerian degeneration to manifest — often around 3 to 4 weeks for denervation changes — using the studies to distinguish neurapraxia from axonotmesis and to localize the lesion to the forearm PIN segment, and if preoperative studies exist, comparing pre- and postoperative tracings will strengthen attribution to iatrogenic injury [^114pNSPV] [^114CbSYy].

> I should double-check what findings I expect on EMG/NCS. A conduction block with preserved amplitudes suggests neurapraxia and a favorable prognosis, while reduced CMAP amplitudes and fibrillation potentials indicate axonotmesis and a longer recovery horizon; reduced recruitment confined to PIN-innervated extensors such as EDC, EI, EDM, ECU, and APL supports PIN-level localization in this postoperative context [^114pNSPV] [^114CbSYy].

> Next, I should review imaging choices, and I need to ensure I pick the modality that directly visualizes the nerve and adjacent implants. High-resolution ultrasonography is my primary soft-tissue modality here because it can show focal enlargement, hypoechogenicity, discontinuity, neuroma-in-continuity, and dynamic impingement by plate or screw, and it also detects callus or hematoma compressing the nerve, which can immediately redirect management toward either observation or exploration [^113XXyRd] [^111naA2v] [^113K3Emi].

> But wait, what if ultrasound is limited by edema or body habitus. In that case, I should escalate to MRI with fluid-sensitive sequences to assess nerve signal and surrounding soft tissues, which the ACR supports as appropriate for soft-tissue evaluation after wrist and hand trauma when radiographs are insufficient, acknowledging that MRI complements, rather than replaces, high-resolution diagnostic ultrasound in this setting [^112DVeLW] [^113XXyRd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, when I think about radiographs for hardware assessment, my first thought is to check for screws or plates extending toward the radial neck because the PIN courses 2.5–6.2 cm distal to the radial head, but hold on, I should verify the anatomic context — this is distal radius ORIF, so dorsal screw prominence from volar plate fixation more commonly irritates the extensor tendons rather than the PIN, whereas the PIN is at risk with proximal radius or radial neck work or aggressive retraction in that zone; therefore, in distal radius ORIF cases I must scrutinize for dorsal screw prominence and malposition that can signal technical error and concomitant tendon injury, while remembering the PIN's proximal course to avoid misattribution of deficits [^115jVjz5] [^112UTckf] [^116ttLoo] [^114Sj92W].

> Let me consider the differential and stratify likely etiologies because treatment hinges on cause. Tourniquet-related neurapraxia typically presents with diffuse forearm symptoms and may show loss of normal fascicular echotexture on ultrasound, hardware impingement is suggested by ultrasound or radiographic contact between screws and the nerve trajectory or by dynamic compression, postoperative hematoma or edema appears as a hypoechoic collection producing mass effect with abrupt symptom onset, direct surgical trauma may be inferred by ultrasound evidence of discontinuity or intraoperative history and later confirmed with absent NAPs, and pre-existing injury needs exclusion via preoperative documentation or early electrodiagnostic comparison to avoid anchoring bias [^113K3Emi] [^113XXyRd] [^114pNSPV].

> I should confirm thresholds for surgical exploration rather than defaulting to immediate reoperation. Imaging evidence of transection, severe entrapment, or clear hardware impingement warrants early exploration and correction, whereas in the absence of such red flags, persistent complete paralysis without EMG signs of reinnervation by about 3 months often triggers consideration of exploration in iatrogenic lesions, though I need to acknowledge that classic guidance for closed injuries favors observation up to 6 months before exploration, and timing should be individualized based on severity, trajectory, and patient factors, with intraoperative NAP mapping guiding neurolysis versus resection and grafting if an in-continuity lesion is nonconductive [^114pNSPV] [^1136GFjX] [^114CbSYy].

> Hold on, I should verify the monitoring cadence to avoid missing recovery while preventing harmful delays. Serial clinical examinations every 4 to 6 weeks to document motor recruitment, repeat EMG at roughly 3 months to detect nascent potentials, and repeat ultrasound if clinical recovery plateaus are reasonable, and I must remember that many neurapraxic postoperative PIN palsies, including tourniquet-related or traction injuries, can recover spontaneously over 3 to 5 months, so my surveillance plan should account for that natural history before committing to reconstruction [^114CbSYy] [^1145ghxD] [^111naA2v].

> Let me think about integrating guideline-level evidence to keep this pathway aligned with standards. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria support ultrasound and MRI for evaluating soft-tissue complications in acute hand and wrist trauma when radiographs are insufficient, while AAOS guidance for distal radius fractures emphasizes early recognition of postoperative complications and meticulous hardware assessment to avoid iatrogenic problems, which reinforces the imaging and technical quality checks embedded in this algorithm [^112DVeLW] [^112A5Hob].

> I will now examine the final diagnostic flow to ensure coherence. In a patient with new postoperative finger and thumb extension loss but preserved dorsal hand sensation, I proceed from focused motor exam and timing analysis, to baseline EMG/NCS at approximately 3 to 4 weeks, to high-resolution ultrasound for morphology and dynamic compression, reserving MRI when ultrasound is limited, while concurrently reviewing radiographs for hardware malposition and correcting my anatomic assumptions about the PIN's proximal course, and I escalate to exploration when imaging shows entrapment or transection or when severe paralysis persists without reinnervation, using intraoperative NAPs to decide between neurolysis and grafting, and I maintain serial monitoring to capture spontaneous recovery before irreversible procedures are undertaken [^114pNSPV] [^113XXyRd] [^112DVeLW].

PIN injury after distal radius fracture ORIF is diagnosed by a combination of **clinical examination** and **electrodiagnostic studies**. The hallmark is **motor weakness of finger and thumb extension** with preserved wrist extension, and no sensory loss [^114pNSPV]. **EMG/NCS** confirm the diagnosis, localize the lesion, and assess severity [^114pNSPV]. Imaging (ultrasound or MRI) is used when entrapment, hardware impingement, or mass effect is suspected [^113K3Emi] [^112DVeLW]. Early recognition and prompt evaluation are essential to guide management and optimize outcomes [^1136GFjX].

---

## Clinical presentation and examination

- **PIN injury** typically presents with the following clinical features:

- **Motor deficits**: Weakness or paralysis of finger and thumb extension, resulting in "finger drop" or "thumb drop". Wrist extension is usually preserved due to the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis muscles being innervated proximal to the PIN [^112nBHMg].

- **Sensory deficits**: The PIN is primarily a motor nerve; thus, sensory loss is uncommon. However, patients may report vague dorsal forearm discomfort or paresthesia [^112nBHMg].

- **Physical examination**: Careful assessment of finger and thumb extension strength, wrist extension, and forearm supination/pronation is essential. Comparison with the contralateral limb is helpful [^1136GFjX].

---

## Electrodiagnostic studies

**Electrodiagnostic studies** are the gold standard for confirming PIN injury, localizing the lesion, and determining severity [^1136GFjX] [^114pNSPV]. **Nerve conduction studies (NCS)** evaluate motor conduction velocity and amplitude in PIN-innervated muscles (e.g. extensor indicis proprius, extensor digitorum communis); reduced amplitude or conduction block indicates axonal injury or demyelination [^1136GFjX]. **Electromyography (EMG)** identifies denervation changes (fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves) in PIN-innervated muscles, confirming axonal injury and helping differentiate PIN injury from more proximal radial nerve lesions [^112nBHMg].

---

## Imaging modalities

**Imaging** is adjunctive, particularly when entrapment, hardware impingement, or mass effect is suspected [^112DVeLW]. **Ultrasound** uses high-resolution imaging to visualize the PIN and can detect swelling, compression, or entrapment by hardware or scar tissue; it is non-invasive, dynamic, and cost-effective [^111naA2v] [^113XXyRd]. **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** provides detailed soft tissue visualization, identifying nerve compression, edema, or entrapment by hardware or scar tissue, and is particularly useful when ultrasound findings are inconclusive or deeper structures are involved [^113K3Emi].

---

## Intraoperative findings

In cases requiring surgical exploration, **intraoperative findings** may include:

- **Direct nerve injury**: Laceration, transection, or contusion of the PIN [^114pNSPV].

- **Entrapment**: Nerve entrapment by hardware, scar tissue, or callus formation [^114pNSPV].

- **Compression**: Nerve compression by hematoma, hardware, or soft tissue structures [^1136GFjX].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Differential diagnosis** includes:

- **Radial nerve injury**: More proximal lesions causing wrist drop and sensory loss [^112nBHMg].

- **Median nerve injury**: Carpal tunnel syndrome or anterior interosseous nerve syndrome.

- **Ulnar nerve injury**: Cubital tunnel syndrome or Guyon's canal syndrome.

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: Chronic pain syndrome following distal radius fracture [^1136GFjX].

---

## Timing of diagnosis

Early recognition and prompt evaluation are **critical**. Initial clinical assessment should occur immediately postoperatively, with electrodiagnostic studies performed within 2–3 weeks if PIN injury is suspected. Delayed diagnosis may result in prolonged recovery and poorer functional outcomes [^1136GFjX].

---

## Management and prognosis

- **Management** depends on severity and etiology. **Conservative management** involves observation, physical therapy, and occupational therapy for mild injuries or neuropraxia [^1136GFjX]. **Surgical intervention** is indicated for severe injuries, entrapment, or hardware impingement; surgical exploration, neurolysis, or nerve repair may be required [^114pNSPV].

Prognosis **varies**; mild injuries often recover spontaneously, while severe injuries may require prolonged rehabilitation or surgical intervention [^1136GFjX].

PIN injury after distal radius fracture ORIF is **diagnosed** through clinical examination, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging. Early recognition and prompt evaluation are essential for optimal outcomes [^112DVeLW].

### Mechanism of injury affects the incidence and time to recovery of nerve injuries associated with humeral shaft fractures [^117Hm1Y9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Literature does not have a consensus regarding the role of nerve exploration with preoperative nerve palsies. Indications for early exploration have included open, vascular injury, radial nerve deficit after attempted reduction, high-velocity gunshot wounds (GSWs), sharp or penetrating injury, high suspicion of nerve laceration with spiral oblique fractures, and severe soft-tissue injury. Late exploration is considered in cases of concern for nerve entrapment, which has been reported in 6% to 25% of cases but may introduce additional scarring. Although low-energy fractures with a nerve palsy should be managed expectantly, others have advocated for exploration with high-energy injuries due to the high rates of neurotmesis and severe contusion.

Interestingly, Bercik et al recommended expectant management of isolated nerve palsies following GSWs of the humerus. In our study, 84% of patients with preoperative nerve palsies underwent early exploration, although nerve exploration was not found to be correlated with nerve recovery. Only two nerves (4%) were found to be transected, requiring nerve allograft. Additional studies have shown that there is no difference in final outcomes when comparing groups managed expectantly and those with early exploration. Our high rate of nerve exploration with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is likely due to our institution's trend toward surgical management of humerus fractures and nerve exploration, specifically the radial nerve as part of the surgical exposure, although this was not performed for patients undergoing intramedullary nailing (IMN).

### Closed fractures complicated by peripheral nerve injury [^1136GFjX]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Closed fractures may be complicated by associated peripheral nerve injury. However, because clinical information is limited, determining the best course of treatment is difficult. Most patients with closed fractures have a local nerve injury without nerve division; their prognosis for recovery is favorable.

In the acute setting, immediate surgery is usually unwarranted because of the difficulty in accurately defining the severity and extent of nerve injury.

- **Observation and treatment**: When débridement of an open fracture or repair is not required, peripheral nerve injuries are best observed, and the extremity treated with splinting and exercise to prevent loss of joint motion.

Patients who fail to demonstrate signs of recovery at 6 months, either clinically or with electrodiagnostic testing, should undergo exploration to maximize the likelihood for return of function.

- **Intraoperative evaluation**: When, during exploration, the nerve is in continuity, intraoperative measurement of nerve action potentials should be done. Measuring nerve action potentials will determine whether nerve grafting, local neurolysis, or excision of the injured segment, accompanied by primary repair, is the most appropriate treatment.

### Hand surgeon reporting of tendon rupture following distal radius volar plating [^116ttLoo]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Volar plate fixation with locked screws has become the preferred treatment for displaced distal radius fractures that cannot be managed nonoperatively. This treatment, however, is not without complications. The purpose of this study was to determine what percentage of hand surgeons, over a 12-month period, have experienced a tendon complication when using volar plates for the treatment of distal radius fractures.

- **Methods**: A total of 3022 hand surgeons were e-mailed a link to an online questionnaire regarding their observation and treatment of tendon injuries associated with volar plating of distal radius fractures. Responses were reported using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Of the 596 (20%) respondents, 199 (33%) surgeons reported encountering at least one flexor tendon injury after distal radius volar plating over the past year of practice. The flexor pollicis longus was the most commonly reported tendon injury (254, 75%). Palmaris longus grafting (118, 37%) and tendon transfer (114, 36%) were the most often reported treatments following this complication. A total of 216 respondents (36%) also encountered 324 cases of extensor tendon rupture after volar plating of distal radius fractures, with tendon transfer (88%) being the preferred treatment option.

Both flexor and extensor tendon ruptures can be seen after volar plating of distal radius fractures. Surgeons should be aware of these complications. Critical assessment of hardware position at the time of the index procedure is recommended to avoid complications. Long-term studies are needed to standardize protocols for managing these complications.

### Management of distal radius fractures: Evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^112HaYJb]. AAOS (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for distal radius fracture, specifically concerning the indications for surgical reduction and fixation, the AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend considering surgery to improve radiographic and patient-reported outcomes in non-geriatric patients. These recommendations apply when there is radial shortening greater than 3 mm, dorsal tilt greater than 10 degrees, or intra-articular displacement or step-off greater than 2 mm.

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: A review [^114CbSYy]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Frequently, patients present with postsurgical nerve dysfunction such as radial nerve palsy after open reduction and internal fixation of humeral fractures, peroneal and/or saphenous nerve palsy after knee ligament reconstruction and/or dislocation, or ulnar nerve complications after medial or collateral ligament reconstruction of the elbow. The literature addressing timing in these contexts is highly variable. Generally, symptom severity and duration are thought to be indicators of potential for spontaneous recovery or need for operative intervention. Although the literature lacks consensus recommendations, close monitoring of nerve symptoms is recommended in the early postoperative period (up to 12 weeks).

### Distal radius fractures [^1127cAZW]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2009). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are a common injury, particularly in the elderly population. The severity of these fractures is directly related to the bone mineral density of the patient, and clinical results are dependent on this parameter as well.

In terms of treatment, several options exist:

- **Nonoperative management**: Closed treatment with casting.
- **Operative treatment options**: Include intrafocal pinning, nonbridging and bridging external fixation, arthroscopic-assisted external fixation, and various methods of open reduction internal fixation.

When operative intervention is indicated, considerations include the characteristics of the fracture and the experience of the surgeon with the treatment modalities.

### Intercarpal ligament injuries associated with distal radius fractures [^1138uXQt]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Low credibility.

Injuries to the scapholunate (SL) and lunotriquetral (LT) interosseous ligaments occur in approximately one-third of distal radius fractures. The diagnosis of these injuries is challenging because plain radiographs are not reliably diagnostic. Wrist arthroscopy may be the most accurate way to examine and diagnose soft-tissue injuries of the carpus adjacent to a distal radius fracture. Treatment options for SL and LT ligament injuries include open repair and/or percutaneous pinning. Because the natural history of these injuries is unclear, the necessity of diagnosing and treating these SL and LT interosseous ligament defects remains speculative.

### Surgical treatment and outcomes in 45 cases of posterior interosseous nerve entrapments and injuries [^114pNSPV]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

The authors report data in 45 surgically treated posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) entrapments or injuries.

- **Methods**: Forty-five PIN entrapments or injuries were managed surgically between 1967 and 2004 at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) or Stanford University Medical Center. Patient charts were reviewed retrospectively. The LSUHSC grading system was used to assess PIN-innervated muscle function. Injuries were caused by nontraumatic (21 PIN entrapments and four tumors) and traumatic (nine lacerations, eight fractures, and three contusions) mechanisms.

- **Presentations**: Included weakness in:
	- Extensor carpi ulnaris muscle, causing compromised wrist extension and radial drift.
	- Extensor digitorum, indicis, and digiti minimi muscles with paretic finger extension.
	- Extensor pollicis brevis and longus muscles with weak thumb extension.
	- Abductor pollicis longus muscle with rare decreased thumb abduction due to substitutions of the median nerve-innervated abductor pollicis brevis muscle and, at 90 degrees, the extensor pollicis brevis and longus muscles.

- **Preoperative evaluations**: Consisted of electromyography and nerve conduction studies, elbow and forearm plain x-ray films, and magnetic resonance imaging for tumor detection.

- **Surgery findings**: At surgery, in continuity lesions were found in 21 entrapments and three fracture-related and three contusion injuries; all transmitted nerve action potentials (NAPs) and were treated with neurolysis. Five fracture-related PIN injuries, one of which was a lacerating injury, were in continuity and transmitted no NAPs; graft…

### Iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury after the surgical treatment of displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus: number needed to harm, a systematic review [^114zgRW9]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2010). Low credibility.

Supracondylar fractures of the humerus are common pediatric elbow injuries. Most displaced or angulated fractures are treated by closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, with either a crossed pin or lateral pin configuration. This study aims to conduct a systematic review to determine if there is an increased risk of iatrogenic nerve injury associated with the crossed pin configuration.

- **Methods**: Relevant articles were identified by searching electronic databases and hand searching related journal and conference proceedings. Within each trial, the risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury was calculated for each pinning technique. For studies comparing crossed versus lateral pinning, the resulting trial-based differences in risk estimates were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. A number needed to harm was determined using the pooled risk difference.

- **Results**: Thirty-two trials consisting of 2639 patients were used in the pooled analysis. The pooled risk difference of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is 0.035 (95% confidence interval, 0.014–0.056), with a higher incidence of injury in the crossed pinning group. The weighted number needed to harm for the crossed pinning is 28 (95% confidence interval, 17–71).

- **Conclusions**: The results of this review suggest that there is an iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury for every 28 patients treated with the crossed pinning compared with the lateral pinning. Further research is necessary to ensure that the optimal pinning technique is chosen to treat these factors.

### Avoiding complications in distal radius fractures [^112A5Hob]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Low credibility.

Managing fractures of the distal radius is a fundamental skill for orthopaedic surgeons. Given the prevalence of these fractures, complications following operative management are well described and frequently encountered. Surgeons should be observant in the acute phase for emergent conditions, such as acute carpal tunnel syndrome. Careful radiographic examination intra-operatively can help prevent delayed complications by identifying surgical errors such as hardware malposition or malreduction. Many problems that arise during the treatment of distal radius fractures result from technical errors and can be anticipated.

### Safety of immediate open reduction and internal fixation of geriatric open fractures of the distal radius [^111v5CuN]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of literature regarding outcomes of open fractures of the distal radius. No study has detailed this injury or treatment strategy in the geriatric population. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of immediate open reduction and internal fixation of geriatric open fractures of the distal radius.

- **Methods**: A total of 21 geriatric patients with open fractures of the distal radius treated with a single definitive procedure were identified from a prospectively collected database. We reviewed patient demographics, injury characteristics, and treatment specifics. Our primary outcome was surgical-site infection, defined by the need for antibiotics or repeat surgery. Our secondary outcome was the need for other re-operation. Patients were contacted, and functional scores were obtained.

- **Results**: Patients were followed up for an average of 26 months. One deep infection and one nonunion occurred, which required repeat surgery. Four minor operative complications occurred, including stiffness requiring manipulation and prominent fixation devices requiring removal. Patients maintained an average wrist flexion-extension arc of 89° and a pronation-supination arc of 137°. The average QuickDASH (shortened disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand questionnaire) score was 17.4, indicating minimal disability of the upper extremity.

- **Conclusions**: Immediate open reduction and internal fixation of geriatric open fractures of the distal radius yield adequate functional results with a low risk of major complications.

### Radial nerve palsy in the setting of humeral shaft fracture [^111VzGP3]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The upper limb has a complex anatomy comprised of many nerve and vascular structures, making humeral shaft fractures extremely important. Injury to the humeral shaft commonly occurs due to trauma and affects younger male or older female patients. The radial nerve travels along the spiral groove of the humerus, placing it at an increased risk of damage in humeral shaft fractures. If injured, there are a variety of classifications of radial nerve injury, different indications for exploration, and treatment methods that orthopedic surgeons have available in treating these injuries. This review aims to discuss the etiology of humeral shaft fracture-associated radial nerve palsy, tools for diagnosis, and treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute hand and wrist trauma [^112DVeLW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for distal radius fractures, especially concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following as the next imaging study in adult patients with suspected wrist tendon or ligament trauma and when radiographs show an acute wrist fracture:

- **Magnetic resonance arthrography**: This technique can provide detailed images of the joint structures.
- **MRI without IV contrast**: This non-invasive imaging option helps visualize soft tissue injuries.
- **CT arthrography**: Offers a complementary perspective on joint and bone detail.
- **Ultrasound**: Useful for assessing soft tissue conditions and guiding clinical decision-making.

### Fingerbreadths rule in determining the safe zone of the radial nerve and posterior interosseous nerve for a lateral elbow approach: An anatomic study [^115jVjz5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Lateral approaches are commonly used for trauma and reconstructive cases around the elbow. The radial nerve (RN) is at particular risk at the distal humerus while placing external fixator pins, intramedullary blocking screws, and in lateral extended approaches. Surgical procedures involving the radial head and neck require special precaution to avoid posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) lesions. Precise anatomic knowledge of the nerve's path is essential to avoid iatrogenic injuries. Injuries may be sustained by direct trauma or indirectly by soft-tissue retraction, impingement of instrumentation, or suture.

The RN pierces the lateral intermuscular septum of the arm and lateral border of the humerus from posterior to anterior at an average range of 10.2 to 12.5 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle. The PIN courses along the anterior aspect of the radial neck; it is located 2.5 to 6.2 cm distal to the radial head depending on the position of forearm rotation according to different reports.

- **Strategies to avoid iatrogenic RN injury**: These include avoiding dissection too far proximally in the area of the nerve or alternatively, definitive identification of the RN and protection. Typically, the authors use the technique described by Gerwin et al. for extensile proximal approaches, in which the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm is identified and traced proximally to its origin from the RN proper.

- **Strategies to avoid iatrogenic PIN injury**: These include limiting the distal extent of the surgical approach and positioning the forearm in pronation, or alternatively, identification, and protection of the PIN.

### ACR appropriateness criteria: Acute hand and wrist trauma [^117Vgwgk]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for distal radius fracture, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a hand MRI without IV contrast or a hand ultrasound as the next imaging study in adult patients with suspected hand tendon or ligament trauma, especially when radiographs show an acute hand fracture.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^114UT2Eu]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). High credibility.

In the treatment of an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius, closed reduction treatment is currently advocated only for the AO type A fracture. AO type B and C fractures are treated with surgical methods such as open reduction or arthroscope-assisted closed/open reduction. Conventional pinning does not provide stable fixation to withstand the deforming forces acting during fracture healing; hence, it is used as an additional procedure to other surgical methods. However, in this new method of pinning, stability is achieved by crossing the six K-wires at six points with at least two K-wires in each interfragmentary fixation, thereby preventing pin migration and pin loosening.

- **Advantages of the surgical procedure**: On analysis, the advantages of this surgical procedure can be summarized as follows. Early return to original employment is possible within 3 to 6 months due to the early return of joint range of motion and restoration of grip strength, which is not achievable with other surgical methods. Intra-articular fractures can be reduced by modifying the existing closed reduction technique by adding a milking technique in the completely distracted position. In conventional open reduction internal fixation treatment of intra-articular fractures, further soft-tissue damage can occur, resulting in permanent joint stiffness, reduced grip strength, and delayed return to original employment. Since there is no skin incision and no implants projecting outside the skin, the movement is pain-free.

### Percutaneous fixation with Kirschner wires versus volar locking plate fixation in adults with dorsally displaced fracture of distal radius: randomised controlled trial [^116yJTuj]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

The study enrolled patients from 18 centers in the United Kingdom, including trauma centers and surgeons who routinely use both Kirschner wires and locking plates for distal radius fractures. The trial encompassed major trauma centers as well as smaller emergency hospitals.

Study participants were 18 years of age or older with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius within 3 cm of the radiocarpal joint. The only inclusion criterion was the surgeon's assessment that surgical fixation of the fracture would benefit the patient.

Patients were excluded if they presented more than two weeks after injury, if the fracture extended more than 3 cm from the radiocarpal joint, if the fracture was open (Gustilo grading > 1), if the articular surface could not be reduced by indirect techniques (as in some cases where the joint surface is severely disrupted, requiring the surgeon to directly visualize and restore the anatomy), if there was a contraindication to anesthesia, or if the patient could not complete questionnaires.

Patients' characteristics and baseline (pre-injury) functional status were self-reported post-consent. The primary outcome measure was the validated patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE), which rates wrist function in two equally weighted sections concerning the patient's experience of pain and disability, providing a score out of 100, with 100 being the worst score.

### Distal radius fractures: Approaches, indications, and techniques [^1133nVmo]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures remain among the most common fractures of the upper extremity. The indications for operative management continue to evolve based on outcomes from the most recent clinical studies. Advancements over the past decade have expanded the variety of fixation options available; however, the clinical superiority of a particular treatment modality remains without consensus. Each approach requires the use of unique surgical techniques, and the choice of a particular implant system should be based on the surgeon's familiarity with the implant design and its limitations.

### Radiographic outcomes and complications of delayed fixation of distal radius fractures [^117VqWgZ]. Hand (2022). Low credibility.

Surgeons are sometimes presented with patients with distal radius fractures who present in a delayed fashion or lose reduction after several weeks of attempted closed management. There are limited studies on delayed surgical treatment of distal radius fractures to assist providers in decision-making.

- **Methods**: We conducted a matched cohort study to compare radiographic outcomes and complications for patients with a distal radius fracture treated with delayed (3–5 weeks) or early (0–2 weeks) surgical fixation. Patients ages 18+ who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fractures by a volar approach at two Level I trauma centers between 2003 and 2015 were eligible. We measured radiographic outcomes and reviewed medical records to determine operative approach and complications.

- **Results**: There were 25 cases and 50 controls matched for age (18–87), sex, and AO fracture type. The delayed group had surgery at a mean of 24.8 days from injury and the early group at 5.6 days. There was no statistically significant difference between the delayed and early cohorts in radiographic parameters on injury x-rays, in improvement in radiographic parameters on first postoperative x-rays, or in maintenance of radiographic parameters at union.

- **Conclusion**: We did not find significant differences in radiographic outcomes or complication rates between patients with delayed versus early surgical treatment for distal radius fracture. Providers treating patients with late presentation or late displacement have the option of surgical fixation beyond the first few weeks.

### Distal radius fractures: Recognizing and treating complex fracture patterns [^115r85tE]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Low credibility.

Volar fixed-angle plate fixation is a commonly used treatment modality for distal radius fractures. However, not all fracture patterns are amenable to this type of fixation strategy. In this article, we review pertinent anatomy and radiographic landmarks that together highlight key differences when considering treatment strategies for complex distal radius fractures.

### A safer pin position for external fixation of distal radial fractures [^115jAPoH]. Injury (2000). Low credibility.

Injury or entrapment of the superficial radial nerve is common in external fixation for fractures of the distal radius. However, by inserting the half pins dorsally, rather than dorso-radially, in the diaphysis of the radius, the nerve should be safe. None of the 40 patients we treated with this safer position of the pins developed symptoms related to the superficial radial nerve.

### Giant cell tumor of distal radius after open reduction internal fixation for distal radius fracture [^111adf7c]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are among the most common injuries treated by orthopaedic surgeons. Volar locked plating is a common approach for managing operative fractures. In the absence of malunion, patients with nonspecific pain following a healed DRF managed with internal fixation are inspected for hardware irritation; device removal is indicated if there is concern for tendon irritation or attrition.

Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of the distal radius are low-grade malignant lesions that are locally aggressive and can metastasize to the lung and bone. The distal radius is the third most common location for a GCT. They are most commonly seen in patients in the third and fourth decades of life at the metaphyseal-epiphyseal junction. Approximately 12% of patients with a GCT present with pathologic fractures at diagnosis. Surgical resection may be needed with periarticular tumors because of extensive cortical destruction, soft-tissue extension, or substantial alteration of local bony architecture.

We present a unique case of a GCT of the distal radius diagnosed 1.5 years after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a DRF treated by volar plating in a 77-year-old woman. At the time of fracture management, there was no radiographic or clinical evidence of disease, suggesting that the tumor may have developed in the patient's eighth decade after ORIF of a DRF. Definitive management consisted of wide en bloc resection and osteoarticular allograft reconstruction of the distal radius, with local control and good clinical outcomes.

### Fingerbreadths rule in determining the safe zone of the radial nerve and posterior interosseous nerve for a lateral elbow approach: an anatomic study [^117SQcS1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Several studies have measured the distances from different landmarks to the radial nerve (RN) or posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) with broad variability across series. Intuitively, it seems unsafe to consider a standardized safe zone distance for every individual as these lengths vary not only across series but also according to the relative size of the arm. Moreover, these distances will vary not only according to forearm position but also according to which segment of the bone the nerve is being measured.

In this study, we determined fixed parameters, such as two and four fingerbreadths, and the diameter of the radial head or capitellum width to serve as guides to determine a safe zone for the PIN and RN. As both the RN and PIN have an oblique trajectory along the lateral humerus and radius, we measured different sites where these nerves might be damaged either directly or indirectly during surgical procedures. We also measured the average distance of the PIN from the lateral epicondyle as it crosses the ulnohumeral joint to prevent injury when deeper dissection to the anterior capsule is needed. We have not found this distance reported before. It might be of interest to surgeons, especially when working on the anterior capsule during soft-tissue releases for stiff elbows.

The four-finger rule may be applied as a safe zone rule for the RN at the intermuscular membrane and mid-lateral portion of the humerus. While using this rule, the RN may be injured along the anterior cortex of the humerus because this distance is shorter.

### Evaluating outcomes following open fractures of the distal radius [^111QyqYv]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A paucity of evidence exists regarding the optimal treatment of open fractures of the distal radius. The purpose of this study was to compare short-term complication rates between various treatment options following open fractures of the distal radius.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of all open fractures of the distal radius at a single Level 1 trauma center over a 10-year period. The primary outcome measure was the number of minor and major complications. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients across treatment and outcome groups were compared, and models were used to describe the relationships between outcome and treatment.

- **Results**: Ninety patients met the inclusion criteria for evaluation. An even distribution between high-energy (n = 45) and low-energy (n = 45) injuries was observed, with 61 fractures classified as Gustilo I (67%), 19 as Gustilo II (22%), and 10 as Gustilo III (11%). The majority of fractures were intra-articular (n = 48 AO type C vs. n = 42 AO type A/B). Fractures were treated with immediate open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in 67 cases (74%), external fixation in 12 (13%), initial external fixation followed by ORIF at a later time in 8 (9%), or closed reduction and percutaneous pinning in 3 (4%). We observed 33 complications (37%), of which 24 were major and 9 were minor. The mechanism of injury and type of treatment were the only variables shown to correlate with an increased rate of complications.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that open fractures of the distal radius treated by immediate ORIF at the time of index debridement can result in satisfactory outcomes, assuming proper management and follow-up are conducted.

### Best practice for management of distal radial fractures (DRFs) [^1158ngUh]. BOA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for distal radius fractures, particularly concerning technical considerations for surgery, BOA/BSSH 2018 guidelines recommend performing K-wire fixation and casting when surgery is required for dorsally displaced DRFs that can be reduced closed.

### Functional outcomes for unstable distal radial fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation or closed reduction and percutaneous fixation. A prospective randomized trial [^111m9Uqt]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the recent trend toward internal fixation of distal radial fractures, few randomized trials have examined whether volar plate fixation is superior to other stabilization techniques. The purpose of the present study was to compare (1) open reduction and internal fixation with the use of a volar plate and early mobilization with (2) percutaneous fixation and casting or external fixation for the treatment of dorsally displaced unstable extra-articular and simple intra-articular fractures of the distal part of the radius, with specific emphasis on early functional recovery.

- **Methods**: A prospective randomized study was performed at two institutions. Forty-five consecutive patients with a displaced, unstable fracture of the distal part of the radius were randomized to closed reduction and pin fixation (n = 22) or open reduction and internal fixation with a volar plate (n = 23). Clinical and radiographic assessments were conducted at six, nine, and twelve weeks after surgery and at one year. Outcome was measured based on range of motion, grip and pinch strength, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores. A questionnaire was used to determine patient satisfaction, and a detailed analysis of complications was performed.

- **Results**: Patients in the open reduction and internal fixation group had superior Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores at six, nine, and twelve weeks. At six weeks, the average Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 27 in the open reduction and internal fixation group compared with 53 in the closed reduction and pin fixation group.

### Open reduction internal fixation versus percutaneous pinning with external fixation of distal radius fractures: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^114LDHRb]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate the functional outcomes of the surgical treatment of distal radius fractures by comparing external fixation and percutaneous pinning with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a plate.

We randomized 53 patients with distal radius fractures that failed closed reduction and casting to ORIF (n = 27) or external fixation (n = 26). For pragmatic reasons, the choice of ORIF was left to the surgeon's discretion: early recruitment, dorsal plates (n = 9); later recruitment, volar locked plates (n = 18). Outcomes were measured before surgery, and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months, including the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE); Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand; range of motion; grip strength; and serial radiographic analysis. Generalized linear modeling using repeated measures was employed to identify differences in outcome scores between fixation types over time. Other continuous variables were analyzed using the Student t-test or one-way analysis of variance for multiple groups.

There were no differences in the demographic characteristics or fracture severity between groups. Based on generalized linear modeling, on average, the ORIF group scored 11 points lower on the PRWE across all time points compared to the external fixation group. The PRWE detected higher pain and disability with external fixation before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 3 months. Using generalized linear modeling, a post hoc subgroup analysis identified significantly better (15-point ad…

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^111KNCtd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

In severely comminuted intra-articular fractures or osteoporotic fractures, there is a risk of pin migration and pin loosening, which can be mitigated by applying a volar plaster of Paris slab in the functional position of the wrist instead of a splint. The chances of malunion are very low due to the prevention of metaphyseal collapse. The occurrence of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is eliminated or minimized by painless early active joint movements of the wrist and fingers. Joint stiffness is reduced with this innovative pinning method. There is no tendon or nerve injury associated with this method because the site of pin penetration is selected to avoid tendons and nerves.

Recent literature indicates that the specific technique used is not as crucial as achieving anatomic reduction. A surgeon's ability to restore anatomy with the least invasive procedure results in the quickest functional recovery.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline on: the treatment of distal radius fractures [^111LB3gd]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2011). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for distal radius fractures, specifically concerning technical considerations for surgery, the AAOS 2011 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against certain practices:

- **Any specific operative method**: There is no strong recommendation for, or against any specific operative method for the fixation of distal radius fractures (DRFs).

- **Locking plates in older patients**: The use of locking plates is not clearly recommended for patients over 55 years of age.

- **Supplemental bone grafts**: The guidelines do not recommend using supplemental bone grafts or substitutes when employing locking plates.

- **Bone grafts for void filling**: There is no evidence to support the use of bone grafts (autograft or allograft) or substitutes for filling bone voids as an adjunct to other operative treatments.

- **Surgical treatment of distal radioulnar joint instability**: The guidelines do not provide a clear recommendation on this issue.

- **Fixation of ulnar styloid fractures**: No specific guidance is given for the fixation of ulnar styloid fractures associated with DRFs.

- **External fixation**: The use of external fixation alone is not recommended if there is a depressed lunate fossa or a 4-part fracture (sagittal split).

### Minimally invasive reduction and osteosynthesis of articular fractures of the distal radius [^114VNM3k]. Injury (2001). Low credibility.

The treatment of displaced fractures of the distal radius has evolved over time. Initially, closed reduction with plaster immobilization was the preferred approach. Over time, the use of pins, plaster, percutaneous pin fixation, and the development of external fixation devices contributed to improved fracture stability. Recently, a new generation of external fixation devices has been introduced, enabling distraction and palmar translation.

Over the past twenty years, the development of advanced internal fixation devices for treating displaced fractures of the distal radius has further progressed. The indications for open reduction and internal fixation have largely been defined through studies supporting the notion that articular malreduction predicts traumatic arthritis and poor functional outcomes. Knirk and Jupiter reported suboptimal results for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius with an articular step-off greater than 2 mm.

More recently, wrist arthroscopy has improved the visualization of articular surfaces and facilitated fracture reduction. Additionally, bone grafting techniques have been increasingly employed to accelerate fracture healing. With these advancements, we can provide patients with better functional results and help them return to their daily activities and vocations more rapidly.

### Ten-year national trends in patient characteristics and 30-day outcomes of distal radius fracture open reduction and internal fixation [^116hmZNe]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are the most common upper extremity fractures and occur with a frequency of 16.2 per 10,000 people. The incidence of distal radius fractures is increasing across all age groups globally, as is the utilization of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for the treatment of this fracture. The increasing rate of distal radius fracture ORIF has been largely propelled by the advent of volar locking plate technology, which enables angular stable control of articular fragments, allowing for early mobilization.

Although the injury and treatment are common, distal radius fractures are associated with notable patient morbidity and mortality. Patients with a distal radius fracture have a 14% higher rate of mortality at 7 years after injury compared with the general population, which likely reflects underlying patient comorbidities and frailty. With surgical treatment of distal radius fractures, the 90-day complication rate is estimated at 4% and the 1-year complication rate is estimated at more than 30%. Distal radius fracture treatment and its associated complications continue to be a source of economic burden on the healthcare system. This is of growing importance as institutions transition toward value-based care initiatives that balance quality and outcomes against costs of care.

Understanding temporal trends in patient comorbidities and risk factors and episode-of-care outcomes can offer insights into the value of treatments rendered to patients, inform patient counseling, and identify areas for future improvement. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term trends in these areas.

### Does simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal ulnar fractures improve outcomes? A retrospective cohort study [^114HnWk2]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Lutsky et al. concluded that routine surgical fixation of concomitant distal ulnar fractures during distal radius surgery using the open reduction internal fixation technique does not appear to be necessary. However, they noted that the limitation of their study was that it included a wide range of patient ages (range: 19–97 years). Sato et al. evaluated all cases except in those younger than 60 years and concluded that the results of treating combined distal radius and ulnar fractures in older people using volar locking plate fixation for the distal radius fracture and leaving the distal ulnar fracture unfixed were encouraging.

The limitations of our study include the following: a high percentage of patients enrolled were older, the study is retrospective in nature, and the interventions and period of immobilization were determined individually by surgeons. Our study may be a comparison of two different treatments chosen by surgeons for similar injuries. Unfortunately, the classification system alone does not take into account the degree of displacement. Moreover, only a small number of patients were included in the study. In AO C3 distal radius fractures or open fracture cases, soft tissue defect and periosteal stripping could affect the functional result and bone healing; therefore, we could not discuss those elements separately. Large-scale prospective studies will be required in the future to corroborate the findings of our study.

### Percutaneous pinning for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^111HJQCZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem. A key method of surgical fixation is percutaneous pinning, which involves the insertion of wires through the skin to stabilize the fracture. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of percutaneous pinning versus cast immobilization alone and of different methods and techniques of percutaneous pinning, modalities or duration of immobilization after pinning, and methods or timing of pin or wire removal for treating fractures of the distal radius in adults. Our primary focus was on dorsally displaced fractures.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registers, conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles up to June 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials involving adults with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared percutaneous pinning with non-surgical treatment or different aspects of percutaneous pinning. Our main outcomes were patient-reported function at the short term (up to three months), medium term (three up to 12 months), and long term (greater than 12 months); the overall number of participants with complications requiring secondary treatment and any complication; grip strength and health-related quality of life at 12 months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection.

### Wrist deformity following falling down [^112ZTFyp]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The initial radiograph showed a left distal radioulnar fracture with physis separation. Failure of closed reduction after several trials is usually suggestive of soft tissue interposition in the physis, which can be visualized in the post-reduction radiograph and is indicated in Figure 3 (arrowhead). This situation usually warrants surgical intervention. The appropriate emergency management would involve immobilization with short arm splinting, followed by open reduction and internal fixation by an orthopedic surgeon. During surgery, periosteum interposition between the fracture fragments was found (online supplemental Figure 1). After carefully extracting the soft tissue without damaging the physis, the patient underwent reduction of the distal radius and ulnar fracture with percutaneous pin fixation.

- **Soft tissue interposition**: Figure 3 shows an arrowhead indicating the soft tissue interposition between the fracture fragments.

Distal radius fractures account for 20%–35% of all pediatric fractures, with many involving the growth plate. Most of these fractures can be successfully treated by closed reduction and immobilization under appropriate analgesia in an emergency department. An irreducible distal radius fracture is a rare condition, but soft-tissue interposition must be considered when encountering difficulty with closed reductions to avoid excessive reduction attempts.

### Does time to operative intervention of distal radius fractures influence outcomes [^112NCEMQ]. Hand (2022). Low credibility.

No investigation has analyzed the time from injury to operative intervention and its effect on complications and functional outcomes in distal radius fractures. This investigation aimed to establish whether the time to surgical intervention from injury was associated with the observed rate of complications in distal radius fractures.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of all orthopedic trauma patients who came to our center was conducted from 2008 through 2014. Patients who sustained closed distal radius fractures were included. A postoperative complication following distal radius fracture was defined as reoperation, superficial or deep infection, complex regional pain syndrome, new-onset carpal tunnel syndrome, tendon irritation, and symptomatic hardware.

- **Results**: In all, 190 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 48 years (SD ± 14.7). According to the AO-Müller/Orthopaedic Trauma Association classification, radiographs revealed 80 A fractures, 15 B fractures, and 95 C fractures. Thirty distal radii were fixed within 0 to 3 days after injury, 91 patients within 4 to 10 days, and 69 patients after 10 days. Overall, 28 complications (14.7%) were identified. There was no statistical difference in the rate of complications between the time interval groups (P = 0.17).

- **Conclusions**: Despite the increased popularity of surgical intervention for distal radius fractures, the optimal parameters to maximize patient outcomes have yet to be clearly defined. Time to intervention did not affect the rate of postoperative complication and range of motion.

### Surgical interventions for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^114Fjb2c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Fractures of the distal radius are a common clinical problem, particularly in older white women with osteoporosis.

- **Objectives**: To determine when, and if so what type of, surgical intervention is the most appropriate treatment for fractures of the distal radius in adults.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (November 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003 Week 8), CINAHL (1982 to February 2003), the National Research Register (Issue 1, 2003), PEDro, conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving skeletally mature patients with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared surgical treatment with conservative treatment, different types of surgical intervention, or the duration of immobilisation after surgery. The main categories of surgical intervention were external fixation, percutaneous pinning, open reduction and internal fixation, and the insertion of bone scaffolding materials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All trials meeting the selection criteria were independently assessed by both reviewers for methodological quality. Data were extracted for anatomical, functional, and clinical outcomes (including complications). The trials were grouped into categories relating to the main comparisons and types of surgical intervention.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^113RtkEP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2020). Low credibility.

During the past two decades, open reduction internal fixation techniques have been developed to address the comminuted intra-articular fracture of the distal radius. In some cases, a combination of more than one surgical method, such as external fixation, percutaneous pinning, and arthroscope-assisted surgeries, is used. However, complications are inevitable in one form or another. Open techniques generally require extensive soft-tissue dissection and have been associated with higher complication rates compared to closed techniques. Wrist arthroscopy plays a significant role in the treatment of intra-articular fractures.

Limited incision approaches and low-profile modular implants have been introduced to reduce complications. Treating severely comminuted and intra-articular fractures of the distal radius remains a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. In 1908, Lambotte described the placement of a single pin into the radial styloid to stabilize a displaced fracture of the distal radius. Later modifications of the technique by Stein and Katz in 1975, followed by Uhl, Lortat-Jacob, and Mortier in 1976 and intra-focal pinning by Kapandji in 1976 and 1986, are only applicable to extra-articular fractures.

The role of percutaneous pinning in intra-articular fractures of the distal radius is only an add-on procedure to other modes of treatment, such as arthroscope-assisted closed reduction and internal fixation, open reduction internal fixation, or external fixation. This is due to the belief that pinning is not a stable method of fixation against the deforming forces.

### Assessment, management, and rehabilitation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries for non-surgeons [^116oWXLM]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

The most common clinical indication for a SETS transfer is to augment recovery in severe ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. In this procedure, the anterior interosseous nerve is divided as it enters the pronator quadratus (PQ) muscle and is transferred to the motor component of the ulnar nerve in the distal forearm. It is conceptualized that by bringing healthy axons closer to the targeted intrinsic muscles of the hand, relative to the axons regenerating from the decompressed nerve at the elbow, improved motor recovery will occur. Several clinical papers have documented improved outcomes relative to historical controls, including one prospective, randomized trial. However, acceptance of SETS transfer surgery is not universal, and some authors doubt the degree of efficacy of the technique.

Although it is generally accepted that, when available, nerve transfers produce better results than nerve grafting, literature on direct comparisons is sparse. Moreover, not all nerve transfers yield the same likelihood of good results for varying reasons. The superiority of nerve transfers becomes even more questionable when subnormal or recovering donors are used in the setting of pan plexus and multi-nerve injuries. Although a comprehensive discussion of which nerve transfers have the best outcomes is beyond the scope of this review, the electrodiagnostic medicine specialist may benefit from conferring with their surgeon colleagues to ascertain which potential transfers might be under consideration. In addition, a further drawback to nerve transfers is that they are not always possible.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^117QKkk6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Fractures of the distal radius are the most common fractures of the upper extremity, with 50% being intra-articular. The widespread use of radiographs, the direction and degree of displacement, and the presence or absence of articular injury have led to the development of various classification systems. These classifications started with Nissen-Lie in 1939 and Gartland and Werley in 1951, followed by various others such as Lindstrom, Older, Frykman, Melone, AO classification, Fernandez, Mayo Clinic classification, fragment-specific classification, and columnar classification.

Unlike the more common, lower-energy, extra-articular fractures, intra-articular fractures of the distal radius represent a complex injury associated with considerable morbidity. Generally, the prognosis is less favorable for displaced, comminuted, intra-articular fractures. Longitudinal traction and manipulative reduction are generally ineffective because articular fragments often lack capsular or ligamentous attachments and thus do not respond to "ligamentotaxis" alone. More aggressive treatment regimens are generally required to anatomically restore the articular surface due to the inherent instability of the fracture and the tendency for articular fragments to settle after stress relaxation of the tensioned soft-tissue envelope. The conventional modes of treatment include closed reduction and casting (either plaster of Paris or synthetic material), external fixation, or open reduction internal fixation.

### A randomized prospective study on the treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures: Open reduction and internal fixation with dorsal plating versus mini open reduction, percutaneous fixation, and external fixation [^1172sVZq]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

To compare two methods of surgical treatment for displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal radius, an analysis was conducted on open reduction and internal fixation with dorsal plating (Pi Plate; Synthes, Paoli, PA) versus mini open reduction with percutaneous K-wire and external fixation.

Patients with AO type C intra-articular distal radius fractures were randomized into two groups: those receiving open reduction and internal fixation with dorsal plating, and those receiving external fixation with K-wires and mini-open reduction. Patients over 70 years of age with any associated soft-tissue or skeletal injury to the same limb, as well as those with pre-existing wrist arthrosis or disability, were excluded from the study.

Objective, subjective, and radiographic outcomes were assessed at intervals of 2 weeks, 4 to 6 weeks, 10 to 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years, with a minimum follow-up period of 6 months and an average follow-up of 18 months. The principal outcome analyzed was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score. Secondary outcomes included grip strength, range of motion, surgical procedure time, complications, and radiographic parameters. The groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, fracture subtype, and number of workers' compensation cases.

The study found no significant difference in the DASH scores, which was the primary outcome. However, the dorsal plate group exhibited a higher complication rate compared to the external fixator group. The plate group also had significantly longer tourniquet times than the external fixator group.

### Prognosis for recovery of posterior interosseous nerve palsy after distal biceps repair [^1145ghxD]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

There is very little information on the incidence of and usual recovery period for posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) palsies after distal biceps repair. This study examined the incidence and the time to resolution of PIN palsies in a large consecutive series of primary distal biceps repairs.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective review was performed of a consecutive series of patients treated by 34 fellowship-trained upper extremity surgeons with primary distal biceps repair through a single anterior incision technique. Patients' records were reviewed to determine how many experienced a postoperative PIN palsy, defined as postoperative digital extension weakness on clinical examination. Demographic information, surgical fixation used, and clinical resolution were collected for these patients. All patients had clinical follow-up until complete resolution of PIN palsy symptoms.

- **Results**: We found 280 patients who were treated with a single-incision technique and one of two methods of biceps tendon fixation. Of these, 9 (3.2%) developed a postoperative PIN palsy after primary distal biceps repair. These 9 patients had complete lack of finger and thumb extension at the first postoperative visit and had complete resolution of symptoms at an average of 86 days (range, 41–145 days).

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of PIN palsy following a single-incision distal biceps repair was 3.2% in our series. These injuries typically resolve within 3 months, and at the latest, 5 months after surgery.

The management of distal radius fractures evidence-based clinical practice guideline is founded on a systematic review of published studies concerning the treatment of distal radius fractures in adults older than 18 years. The scope of this guideline is confined to the treatment of acute distal radius fractures and does not address distal radius malunion. This guideline encompasses seven recommendations aimed at assisting orthopaedic surgeons and qualified physicians in managing patients with acute distal radius fractures, all based on the best available evidence.

It serves as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations.

### Posterior interosseous nerve proximity to cortical button implant for distal biceps repair with single and 2-incision approaches [^115djzRh]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of injury to the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) associated with the use of a cortical button for distal biceps repair. This approach is considered the biomechanically strongest surgical technique, and the two-incision approach may offer a more anatomical repair and improved terminal supination strength.

A distal biceps repair with a cortical button was performed on 10 cadavers, with five utilizing the single-incision approach and five utilizing the two-incision approach. Contrast was injected into the radial nerve, and computed tomography scans were obtained to measure the distance between the drilled cortical perforation and the PIN.

The results of the study showed that the mean distance from the cortical perforation to the PIN was not significantly different between approaches, measuring 9.4 mm and 8.8 mm respectively. PIN entrapment was observed in 0 out of 5 cadavers for the single-incision approach and 1 out of 5 for the two-incision approach.

The study concluded that distal biceps repair with cortical button fixation places the PIN at risk of injury regardless of the approach used. It is especially important to avoid methods of fixation that require bicortical drilling when performing the two-incision approach.

Regarding clinical relevance, it was noted that distal biceps repair utilizing bicortical drilling for fixation through a two-incision approach poses a high risk of injury to the PIN and should be avoided.

### Fingerbreadths rule in determining the safe zone of the radial nerve and posterior interosseous nerve for a lateral elbow approach: An anatomic study [^111Ngv8c]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

When exposing the distal humerus or proximal radius with a posterolateral exposure, careful nerve dissection is essential to avoid iatrogenic injuries. During percutaneous procedures on the distal humerus or limited exposures on the proximal radius, the four-finger rule, two-finger rule, and radial head diameter or capitellum size may help predict a safe zone for the radial nerve (RN) and posterior interosseous nerve (PIN), except for the segment of the nerve where it crosses the anterior cortex of each bone. Special precautions should be taken when placing anterior retractors to prevent traction injuries.

A larger diameter of the radial head and larger capitellum size are associated with larger PIN safe zones but do not guarantee them. Our series, in agreement with previous studies, demonstrates that pronation consistently increases the PIN safe zone area when using a lateral approach to the radial head.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^1177hCEs]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

On analysis of the results, within the first 3 months, 75% of patients experienced either no pain or only mild pain, and 70% of patients regained more than 75% of their range of movement. Within this period, 50% of patients returned to either regular or restricted employment and recovered more than 50% of their contralateral grip strength.

At the end of 6 months, 97% of patients reported either no pain or only mild pain. Within the same period, 97% of cases returned to their original employment, whether in regular or restricted forms. Additionally, by the end of 6 months, 93% of patients regained either full or more than 75% of their grip strength. Within this timeframe, 98% of patients regained either full or more than 75% of the normal range of movement.

- **Pain**: By the end of the first year, only 3% of patients experienced mild pain, with no reports of moderate or severe pain.

- **Grip strength and range of movement**: By the end of 1 year, 88% of patients regained normal grip strength, and 98% regained the normal range of movement.

The analysis of the results revealed that painless wrist activities were achievable from the immediate postoperative period, and 97% of patients returned to their original work within 3 to 6 months.

### Ultrasound diagnosis of bony nerve entrapment: Case series and literature review [^111naA2v]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Nerve entrapment due to osseous callus formation is a rare complication after bone fracture. Electrodiagnostic studies and routine radiographic imaging often fail to demonstrate the pathology. The diagnosis is difficult and is often made incidentally upon surgical exploration. Nerve ultrasonography has not been used routinely to assess such lesions.

- **Methods**: We report 5 cases of nerve entrapment in osseous callus after fractures that occurred in 2011 and 2012. The diagnosis was made by ultrasound (US). We then performed a review of the relevant literature.

- **Conclusions**: US is becoming an invaluable tool for diagnosing peripheral nerve entrapments. The cases suggest that nerve US should be strongly considered as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for nerve palsies developing after trauma.

### Closed reduction methods for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^112AgTY5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem, particularly in older white women with osteoporosis. Displaced fractures are usually reduced using closed reduction methods, which are non-surgical and generally comprise traction and manipulation. The resulting position is stabilized by external means, typically plaster cast immobilization.

- **Objectives**: To examine the evidence for the relative effectiveness of different methods of closed reduction for displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialized register (to July 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to July week 4, 2002), EMBASE (1988 to 2002 week 31), CINAHL (1982 to June week 4, 2002), the UK National Research Register (Issue 2, 2002), and reference lists of articles. We also handsearched the British Volume of the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery supplements (1996 onwards) and abstracts of the American Orthopaedic Trauma Association annual meetings.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials evaluating different methods of closed reduction. We also included trials in which the use (or not) of anaesthesia could be classed as a co-intervention.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All trials judged as fitting the selection criteria by both reviewers were independently assessed by both reviewers for methodological quality. Data were extracted independently by one reviewer and checked by the other. Quantitative data are presented us.

### Distal radius fracture clinical practice guidelines-updates and clinical implications [^112zKjhm]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Society for Surgery of the Hand released updated clinical practice guidelines in 2020 on the evaluation and treatment of acute distal radius fractures. Following a rigorous methodology designed and implemented through the AAOS, seven guidelines based upon the best available evidence were released to assist surgeons and physicians in managing distal radius fractures. These guidelines can serve as a reference for surgeons when managing patients with distal radius fractures. We review the evidence behind each guideline and highlight the practical implications of each guideline on care.

### Prevention and management of complications arising from external fixation pin sites [^113NDwFi]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Use of external fixation devices to assist in the management of lower extremity trauma and reconstruction continues to rise. Despite the distinct advantages of external fixation, complications from external fixators continue to exist. The complicated external fixator-associated pin site may be a potential source of significant morbidity, especially in at-risk patients, which may lead to soft tissue healing problems and infections, as well as osteomyelitis. This article describes both simple as well as more complex techniques that the authors use in the prevention and management of complications arising from external fixator pin sites, and solutions to the difficult task of incorporating external fixator wires into negative-pressure dressings.

### Intraarticular distal radius fracture open reduction internal fixation [^112UTckf]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Intraarticular distal radius fractures are often treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) through a volar approach. This common approach, however, is technically demanding because it requires restoring the articular surface of the radiocarpal joint while respecting soft tissue integrity. The purpose of this video is to demonstrate the surgical technique of volar plate fixation of an intraarticular distal radius fracture.

- **Methods**: A 32-year-old patient who sustained multiple injuries, including an intraarticular distal radius fracture, was treated with ORIF by a volar approach.

- **Results**: Exposure is performed through a standard flexor carpi radialis approach. The intraarticular fracture of the distal radius is reduced, and a volar plate is applied. Careful measurement of screw length is described in detail to minimize postoperative tendon irritation. Closure of the soft tissues is completed, and early postoperative rehabilitation is emphasized.

- **Discussion**: Multiple, varied techniques for fixation of intraarticular distal radius fractures are described in the literature. As demonstrated in this video of ORIF with a volar plate, attention to articular reduction, soft tissue protection, and postoperative rehabilitation are key components used to achieve good clinical outcomes.

### What is the relative effectiveness of the various surgical treatment options for distal radius fractures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1157hu5o]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). High credibility.

Many acceptable treatment options exist for distal radius fractures (DRFs); however, a simultaneous comparison of all methods is difficult using conventional study designs.

- **Questions/Purposes**: We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on DRF treatment to answer the following questions: Compared with nonoperative treatment, (1) which intervention is associated with the best 1-year functional outcome? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of overall complications? (3) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications requiring operation?

- **Methods**: Ten databases were searched from inception to July 25, 2019. Search and analysis reporting adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Included studies were English-language RCTs that assessed at least one surgical treatment arm for adult patients with displaced DRFs, with less than 20% loss to follow-up. We excluded RCTs reporting on patients with open fractures, extensive bone loss, or ipsilateral upper extremity polytrauma. Seventy RCTs (n = 4789 patients) were included. Treatments compared were the volar locking plate, bridging external fixation, nonbridging external fixation, dynamic external fixation, percutaneous pinning, intramedullary fixation, dorsal plating, fragment-specific plating, and nonoperative treatment. Subgroup analyses were conducted for intraarticular fractures, extraarticular fractures, and patients with an average age greater than 60 years. Mean (range) patient age was 59 years.

### Fractures of the distal part of the radius. The evolution of practice over time. Where's the evidence [^115Zbmab]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

During the administration of the oral (Part II) examinations for the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery over the past nine years, it has been observed that orthopaedic surgeons are opting more often for open treatment as opposed to percutaneous fixation of distal radial fractures. Evidence to support this change in treatment is thought to be deficient. The present study was designed to identify changes in practice patterns regarding operative fixation of distal radial fractures between 1999 and 2007 and to assess the results of those treatments over time.

- **Methods**: As a part of the certification process, Part II candidates submit a six-month case list to the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery. In the present study, we searched the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery Part II database to evaluate changes in treatment over time and to identify available outcomes and associated complications of open and percutaneous fixation of distal radial fractures. All distal radial fractures that had been treated surgically over a nine-year period (1999 to 2007) were reviewed. The fractures were categorized according to fixation method with use of surgeon self-reported surgical procedure codes. Comparisons of percentage treatment type by year were made. Utilization was analyzed by geographic region, and open and percutaneous fixation were compared with regard to complications and outcomes as self-reported by candidates during the online application process.

- **Results**: The proportion of fractures that were stabilized with open surgical treatment increased from 42% in 1999

### External fixation versus internal fixation for unstable distal radius fractures: A systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative clinical trials [^1132Ldai]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2012). Low credibility.

In the absence of consensus regarding the surgical management of unstable distal radius fractures, this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to pool data from trials comparing external fixation with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for this injury.

Data sources included electronic databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS, as well as conference proceedings, covering literature in English from 1950 to 2009.

The study selection involved pooling data from 12 trials, incorporating a total of 1011 patients (491 fractures treated with external fixation and 520 with ORIF). All randomized studies comparing external fixation to ORIF for unstable distal radius fractures were considered, with nonrandomized trials included only if they directly compared external fixation with ORIF.

Data extraction was performed independently by two authors, focusing on patient characteristics, sample size, fracture type, length of follow-up, interventions, and outcomes.

For data synthesis, continuous variables were pooled across studies using the method of standard mean differences (SMD) or effect size. ORIF demonstrated significantly better Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores (SMD, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.53; P = 0.03), recovery of forearm supination (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08–0.38; P = 0.003), and restoration of volar tilt (SMD, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.34–0.72; P < 0.00001). In contrast, external fixation resulted in significantly better grip strength (SMD, -10.32; 95% CI, -16.36 to -4.28; P = 0.0008), and subgroup analyses of randomized studies indicated external fixation yielded…

### Ultrasonographic evaluation of the iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries in upper extremity [^113XXyRd]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of our study is to assess the efficiency of ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve injury. This study includes nine patients with peripheral nerve injuries diagnosed by clinical and electrophysiological methods in the last three years. The affected nerves were six radial, one median, and two posterior interosseous (PIO) nerves. Preoperatively, an ultrasonographic examination was performed and correlated with the physical exam and surgical findings.

Five patients diagnosed with peripheral nerve transection by US underwent surgery. The ultrasonographic findings were concordant with the intraoperative findings. Axonal swelling alone was found in the remaining three patients, who were treated conservatively due to preserved nerve continuity without nerve compression display. In one patient, we were unable to visualize the nerve due to obesity and soft tissue edema.

High-resolution US provides morphological information about the exact location, intensity, and extent of the nerve injuries, facilitating preoperative diagnosis. Therefore, US may be a useful method for planning an optimal treatment strategy, especially in iatrogenic nerve injuries.
