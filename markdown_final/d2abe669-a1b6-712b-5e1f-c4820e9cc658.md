## Question

how long to treat enterococcus faecalis bacteremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to treat Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the bacteremia is uncomplicated or complicated by endocarditis or another deep focus. Then, I should verify the pathogen's antimicrobial susceptibilities, especially ampicillin and high-level aminoglycoside resistance. Next, I will consider source control and whether the patient is clinically stable. After that, I should review guideline-based durations for native versus prosthetic valve endocarditis and for uncomplicated bacteremia. Finally, I will integrate emerging evidence on shorter courses and outline a practical decision framework with monitoring and follow-up, including when to extend therapy or escalate care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because duration hinges on whether this is uncomplicated E. faecalis bacteremia or infective endocarditis. I need to check for endocarditis risk using clinical features, the number of positive blood culture sets, and echocardiography, since E. faecalis has a relatively high propensity for endocarditis and that dictates 4–6 weeks of therapy rather than 7–14 days [^4227e39c] [^d56c854a].

> Wait, let me verify the organism and susceptibilities before committing to a regimen. Most E. faecalis remain ampicillin-susceptible, so ampicillin is typically first-line; I should also test for high-level aminoglycoside resistance because it changes whether gentamicin synergy is feasible and whether a double β-lactam regimen is preferred in endocarditis [^26df35a6] [^0d338b44].

> I will now examine source control and clinical stability, since timely removal of infected devices and control of the septic source materially influence outcomes and may allow shorter total therapy when the source is eradicated and the patient is improving. Hold on, I should verify that persistent bacteremia beyond 48–72 hours raises concern for endocarditis or an undrained focus, which would push me toward longer therapy and further imaging [^e6a080f0] [^484ae384].

> For uncomplicated E. faecalis bacteremia without endocarditis, I initially thought 10–14 days was standard, but wait, let me reconsider in light of newer data. Observational and meta-analytic data suggest that 7–10 days can be sufficient in clinically stable patients with adequate source control, with some studies showing no worse outcomes with shorter courses; however, I should confirm that this applies when the patient is afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and cultures have cleared before stopping, and I should acknowledge that high-quality enterococcal-specific RCTs are limited [^c1275f1d] [^a71673f3] [^6adfba45].

> For infective endocarditis due to E. faecalis, I need to ensure I align with guideline durations. Native valve endocarditis generally requires 4–6 weeks, with 4 weeks acceptable if symptoms have been present less than 3 months and 6 weeks if symptoms are longer or if using ampicillin plus ceftriaxone; prosthetic valve endocarditis warrants 6 weeks, and I should double-check that these ranges are consistent with AHA and ESC statements, which they are [^d56c854a] [^74aada1a] [^0d338b44].

> Next, I should review regimen choices and the role of aminoglycosides. Historically, ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin for 4–6 weeks was standard, but hold on, I should verify the current balance of benefit and nephrotoxicity. Contemporary guidance allows ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for 6 weeks as an alternative to avoid aminoglycoside toxicity, and a Danish pilot showed that limiting gentamicin to 2 weeks yielded similar outcomes with less renal injury; a recent meta-analysis also suggests ceftriaxone-based regimens are comparably effective and less toxic than gentamicin, so I should individualize based on HLAR status and renal function [^d56c854a] [^d2e1abce] [^550ca372] [^0d338b44].

> But wait, what if the strain is high-level aminoglycoside resistant or the patient cannot tolerate gentamicin? In that case, I should confirm that ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for 6 weeks is a reasonable strategy, and indeed both AHA and ESC endorse this double β-lactam approach for HLAR or when nephrotoxicity is a concern, with observational data showing high cure rates when the protocol is completed [^95267aef] [^0d338b44] [^24a9c7cb].

> I need to ensure I address vancomycin scenarios. If the isolate is ampicillin-resistant and the patient cannot take a β-lactam, vancomycin-based therapy is appropriate, but I should confirm that vancomycin plus gentamicin for 6 weeks is recommended in that setting and that vancomycin troughs are monitored to mitigate nephrotoxicity risk [^6e4e8d2c] [^4098229d].

> Let me consider special populations and stewardship. In children with uncomplicated E. faecalis bacteremia, adding low-dose gentamicin to ampicillin shortened time to clearance by about 10 hours but doubled the risk of acute kidney injury, so I should avoid routine gentamicin add-on unless there is a compelling indication; in pediatrics with endocarditis, durations mirror adults with 6 weeks for most cases, and I should coordinate with pediatric cardiology and ID [^88b5a745] [^7fc05cff].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this at the bedside. If there is no evidence of endocarditis, the patient is clinically stable, and source control is achieved, a total of 7–10 days of ampicillin is reasonable, with extension to 10–14 days if response is slow or if there are complicating factors; if endocarditis is present or strongly suspected, I should plan 4–6 weeks for native valve disease and 6 weeks for prosthetic valve disease, choosing ampicillin plus ceftriaxone when HLAR is present or when gentamicin is unsafe, and I should arrange follow-up blood cultures to document clearance and surveillance for relapse [^d56c854a] [^0d338b44] [^e6a080f0].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and follow-up. Persistent bacteremia beyond 48–72 hours, new embolic phenomena, or failure to defervesce should prompt repeat blood cultures, reassessment of source control, and repeat echocardiography if not already done; given the nontrivial relapse risk after E. faecalis endocarditis, I should maintain a low threshold to extend therapy or involve cardiology and ID early if the course is atypical or complicated [^484ae384] [^6db3f1fd].

> In summary, I should confirm endocarditis risk first, then tailor duration: uncomplicated E. faecalis bacteremia without endocarditis can often be treated for 7–10 days if the patient is stable and source control is achieved, whereas E. faecalis endocarditis requires 4–6 weeks for native valves and 6 weeks for prosthetic valves, with regimen selection guided by HLAR status and renal function; I need to ensure close follow-up for clearance and complications and adjust the plan if the clinical course deviates from expectations [^d56c854a] [^0d338b44] [^6adfba45].

The duration of Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia treatment depends on whether endocarditis is present: **4–6 weeks for endocarditis** (native valve: 4 weeks if symptoms < 3 months, 6 weeks if ≥ 3 months or prosthetic valve) [^d56c854a] [^74aada1a] and **7–14 days for uncomplicated bacteremia** without endocarditis, provided the patient is clinically stable, afebrile, and cultures are clearing [^c1275f1d] [^a71673f3]. For endocarditis, use ampicillin or penicillin G plus gentamicin for 2 weeks [^0d338b44] [^d2e1abce] or ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for 6 weeks [^d56c854a] [^24a9c7cb]; for uncomplicated bacteremia, ampicillin monotherapy is first-line if susceptible [^e6a080f0]. Always obtain an echocardiogram to exclude endocarditis before deciding on duration [^4227e39c].

---

## Indications for prolonged therapy

Prolonged therapy is indicated when **endocarditis is present or strongly suspected**, because E. faecalis has a high propensity for valvular infection and relapse if undertreated [^4227e39c] [^6db3f1fd]. The duration is **4–6 weeks for native valve endocarditis** (4 weeks if symptoms < 3 months, 6 weeks if ≥ 3 months) and **6 weeks for prosthetic valve endocarditis** [^d56c854a] [^74aada1a].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens and durations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Native valve endocarditis (symptoms < 3 months) | Ampicillin or penicillin G + gentamicin | 4 weeks |
| Native valve endocarditis (symptoms ≥ 3 months) | Ampicillin or penicillin G + gentamicin | 6 weeks |
| Prosthetic valve endocarditis | Ampicillin or penicillin G + gentamicin | 6 weeks |
| High-level aminoglycoside resistance | Ampicillin + ceftriaxone | 6 weeks [^d56c854a] [^24a9c7cb] |
| Uncomplicated bacteremia (no endocarditis) | Ampicillin monotherapy | 7–14 days [^c1275f1d] [^a71673f3] |

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors influence **duration**:

- **Presence of endocarditis**: Mandates 4–6 weeks [^d56c854a].
- **Prosthetic valve involvement**: Requires 6 weeks [^d56c854a].
- **High-level aminoglycoside resistance**: Favors ampicillin + ceftriaxone for 6 weeks [^d56c854a] [^24a9c7cb].
- **Clinical stability**: Allows shorter courses in uncomplicated cases [^c1275f1d] [^a71673f3].
- **Source control**: Essential; persistent sources may require longer therapy [^8993a770].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

Shorter courses (7–14 days) are effective for **uncomplicated bacteremia** without endocarditis, with similar mortality and relapse to longer courses [^c1275f1d] [^a71673f3]. Longer courses (4–6 weeks) are required for **endocarditis** to prevent relapse and complications [^d56c854a] [^6db3f1fd].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized therapy** based on the presence of endocarditis, prosthetic valves, and aminoglycoside resistance [^d56c854a] [^0d338b44]. They also recommend **echocardiography** for all E. faecalis bacteremia to exclude endocarditis before finalizing duration [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Similar principles apply; durations are adjusted for age and weight [^7fc05cff].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require longer therapy and closer monitoring [^notfound].
- **Persistent bacteremia**: Suggests endocarditis or inadequate source control; reassess duration and management [^484ae384].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Endocarditis present**: Treat for 4–6 weeks (native valve) or 6 weeks (prosthetic valve) [^d56c854a] [^74aada1a].
- **Uncomplicated bacteremia**: Treat for 7–14 days if stable and cultures clear [^c1275f1d] [^a71673f3].
- **Always exclude endocarditis** with echocardiography before finalizing duration [^4227e39c].

---

The key is to **tailor duration to the presence of endocarditis**, source control, and clinical response, with longer therapy for endocarditis and shorter courses for stable, uncomplicated bacteremia.

Key messages

- The optimal duration of treatment for bloodstream infections is understudied.

- Available data from bacteremic subgroups of prior randomized controlled trials suggest that shorter-duration therapy (not more than 7 days) may be as effective as longer-duration therapy in achieving clinical cure, microbiologic cure, and survival among most patients with bloodstream infections.

- A large dedicated randomized trial of treatment duration for bacteremia is urgently needed.

### Accelerated treatment of endocarditis-the POET II trial: rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial [^d644a1a8]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic treatment length for infective endocarditis (IE) is uncertain. International guidelines recommend treatment duration of up to 6 weeks for patients with left-sided IE but are primarily based on historical data and expert opinion. Efficacies of modern therapies, fast recovery seen in many patients with IE, and complications to long hospital stays challenge the rationale for fixed treatment durations in all patients.

Objective

The objective was to conduct a noninferiority randomized controlled trial (acronym POET II) investigating the safety of accelerated (shortened) antibiotic therapy as compared to standard duration in patients with left-sided IE.

Methods

The POET II trial is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, noninferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients with definite left-sided IE due to Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis will be eligible for enrolment. Each patient will be randomized to accelerated antibiotic treatment or standard-length treatment (1:1) following clinical stabilization as defined by clinical parameters, laboratory values, and transesophageal echocardiography findings. Accelerated treatment will be between 2 and 4 weeks, whereas standard-length treatment will be between 4 and 6 weeks, depending on microbiologic etiology, complications, need for valve surgery, and prosthetic versus native valve endocarditis. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, relapse of bacteremia, or embolization within 6 months of randomization.

Conclusions

The POET II trial will investigate the safety of accelerated antibiotic therapy for patients with left-sided IE caused by Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis. The results of the POET II trial will improve the evidence base of treatment recommendations, and clinical practice may be altered.

### Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis: a pilot study of the relationship between duration of gentamicin treatment and outcome [^d2e1abce]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Because of the nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycosides, the Danish guidelines on infective endocarditis were changed in January 2007, reducing gentamicin treatment in enterococcal infective endocarditis from 4 to 6 weeks to only 2 weeks. In this pilot study, we compare outcomes in patients with Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis treated in the years before and after endorsement of these new recommendations.

Methods and Results

A total of 84 consecutive patients admitted with definite left-sided E faecalis endocarditis in the period of 2002 to 2011 were enrolled. Forty-one patients were treated before and 43 patients were treated after January 1, 2007. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. At hospitalization, the 2 groups had similar estimated glomerular filtration rates of 66 and 75 mL/min (P = 0.22). Patients treated before January 2007 received gentamicin for a significantly longer period (28 versus 14 days; P < 0.001). The primary outcome, 1-year event-free survival, did not differ: 66% versus 69%, respectively (P = 0.75). At discharge, the patients treated before 2007 had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (45 versus 66 mL/min; P = 0.008) and a significantly greater decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (median, 11 versus 1 mL/min; P = 0.009) compared with those treated after 2007.

Conclusions

Our present pilot study suggests that the recommended 2-week treatment with gentamicin seems adequate and preferable in treating non-high-level aminoglycoside-resistant E faecalis infective endocarditis. The longer duration of gentamicin treatment is associated with worse renal function. Although the certainty of the clinical outcomes is limited by the sample size, outcomes appear to be no worse with the shorter treatment duration. Randomized, controlled studies are warranted to substantiate these results.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^6e4e8d2c]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis — vancomycin-based recommendations: Vancomycin should be administered only if a patient is unable to tolerate penicillin or ampicillin (Class I; Level of Evidence B). It is reasonable that patients with NVE receive 6 weeks of vancomycin-gentamicin therapy and that patients with PVE receive at least 6 weeks of therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Patients with E faecalis IE caused by strains that are intrinsically resistant to penicillin should be treated with a combination of vancomycin plus gentamicin (Class I; Level of Evidence B).

### Short-course versus long-course antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteraemia: a retrospective multicentre cohort study [^996e1ca3]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The optimal treatment duration for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) bacteraemia is still a matter of debate. The aim of the present study was to compare short-course (≤ 9 days) and long-course (≥ 10 days) antibiotic treatments in hospitalized adult patients with uncomplicated VRE bacteraemia.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted in four university hospitals in Germany. Adult patients with a positive blood culture for a VRE were screened from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018. Only patients who received a VRE-active antibiotic for at least 48 hours were included. The exclusion criteria were a survival of < 10 days and a deep-seated source of infection requiring prolonged treatment. To compare the outcome of short-course therapy with that of long-course therapy, 30-day and 90-day overall mortality, relapse within 90 days, duration of hospitalization, and potential antibiotic-related adverse events were analysed by inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score and by additional covariate adjustment.

Results

Of the 363 patients screened, 219 (60.3%) patients were included in the final analysis. Among them, 48 (21.9%) patients had underlying haematological diseases. Seventy-eight (35.6%) patients received short-course treatment (median, 7 days; interquartile range, 5–8 days) and 141 (64.4%) patients received long-course treatment (median, 15 days; interquartile range, 12–23.5 days). Thirty-day mortality was similar in both groups (19.2% vs. 22.0%; adjusted OR, 1.15; p 0.773). Duration of hospitalization (in total and after onset of bacteraemia) was significantly shorter (p < 0.05) in the short-course treatment group, whereas other secondary outcome parameters did not differ between both groups.

Discussion

Our study suggests that short-course treatment might not be associated with a worse outcome in patients with uncomplicated VRE bacteraemia.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^d56c854a]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis — initial β-lactam–based regimens and duration: Therapy that includes either ampicillin or aqueous crystalline penicillin G plus gentamicin or ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is reasonable (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Either 4 or 6 weeks of therapy is reasonable for NVE, depending on the duration of IE symptoms before the initiation of therapy if ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin is used (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Six weeks of therapy is reasonable if ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is selected as the treatment regimen, regardless of symptom duration (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Six weeks of antimicrobial therapy is reasonable for PVE (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B).

### Evaluation of sequential oral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment ofBloodstream infections [^4b870b32]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) antibiotics have historically been considered standard of care for treatment of bloodstream infections (BSIs). Recent literature has shown sequential oral (PO) therapy to be noninferior to IV antibiotics for certain pathogens and disease states. However, a gap exists in the literature for BSI caused by Enterococcus faecalis.

Objective

To compare outcomes of definitive sequential PO therapy to definitive IV therapy in patients with E faecalis BSI.

Methods

Multicenter, retrospective, matched cohort study of adult patients with at least one blood culture positive for E faecalis from January 2017 to November 2022. Patients with polymicrobial BSI, concomitant infections requiring prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, those who did not receive antibiotic therapy, and those who died within 72 hours of index culture were excluded. Subjects were matched based on source of infection in a 2:1 (IV:PO) ratio. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), antibiotic duration, and 30-day readmission rate.

Results

Of the 186 patients who met criteria for inclusion, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary composite outcome for PO compared to IV therapy (14.5% vs 21.8%; OR 0.53 [0.23–1.25]) or 30-day readmission (17.5% vs 29%; OR 0.53 [0.25–1.13]). Hospital LOS was significantly longer in patients receiving IV-only therapy (6 days vs 14 days; P < 0.001).

Conclusion and Relevance

Sequential oral therapy for E faecalis BSI had similar outcomes compared to IV-only treatment and may be considered in eligible patients.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c1275f1d]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although bacteremia caused by intravascular catheters is often cited as the commonest cause of BSI in the critical care setting, we were unable to identify any prospective, randomized investigations examining the duration of antibiotic therapy for CRBSI. Recommendations for length of treatment from the current IDSA guidelines are based only on expert opinion and retrospective case series and call for 5 to 7 days for infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 to 14 days for Enterococci and Gram-negative organisms, and 2 to 6 weeks for S. aureus. Trials are urgently needed, as this may be the syndrome most appropriate for shorter-course therapy given that the focus of infection is removable and thereby leaves no persisting infectious nidus for most patients.

The available trials randomly assigning patients with intra-abdominal infections to shorter versus longer durations of antibiotic therapy were conducted in non-ICU settings and populations and explicitly excluded those with generalized secondary peritonitis or nosocomial infections. Equivalent outcomes for shorter- versus longer-duration therapy for SBP and localized intra-abdominal infection are in keeping with similar findings in a retrospective analysis of 929 patients with intra-abdominal infections, in which less than 7 days of therapy was not associated with higher complications or mortality. We have not uncovered evidence, though, of whether the effectiveness of short-duration therapy extends to patients with severe infections complicated by bacteremia or in those for whom source control cannot readily be achieved.

Several narrative reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs have provided evidence of the efficacy and safety of treating mild to moderate CAP with short-duration antibiotic therapy (5 to 7 days). The 13 studies of pneumonia identified for this review included 5 studies of CAP that provided the prevalence of bacteremia; in total, 80 patients with bacteremia were randomly assigned in equal numbers to short (3 to 7 days) and long (7 to 10 days) durations of therapy. Only three studies provided outcome data for bacteremic subgroups, and clinical cure was reported in 19 out of 21 patients (89.4%) receiving short-duration therapy (5 to 7 days) and in 17 out of 19 patients (90.4%) receiving extended therapy (7 to 10 days). These results provide a modicum of support for the growing consensus that CAP may be safely treated with shorter durations of therapy irrespective of the presence of bacteremia. Although a large VAP trial documented equivalent survival with shorter (8 days) versus longer (15 days) treatment, very few of these patients were bacteremic, and it is unclear whether shorter-duration treatment can be extended to this subgroup.

### Optimizing therapy for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia in children [^768d5a94]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Uncertainties exist regarding the optimal treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) bloodstream infections, particularly in settings in which ampicillin cannot be used.

Recent Findings

Quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin, all approved between 1999 and 2003, represent the mainstays of therapy for VRE bacteremia, although only linezolid has been specifically approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this indication. The main objective of this review is to compare the relative efficacies, dosing strategies, and side-effect profiles of quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin for VRE bacteremia in the pediatric population. A brief description of recently approved broad-spectrum Gram-positive agents that may have a role in the management of VRE bacteremia in upcoming years is also provided.

Summary

Linezolid, despite its bacteriostatic activity against VRE, may be the most versatile of the available drugs. It has activity against both Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, can be administered orally, and resistance appears to be less of a concern with linezolid compared with the other agents. Additionally, the results of two recent meta-analyses demonstrate more favorable outcomes with linezolid compared with daptomycin for the treatment of VRE bacteremia. The clinical pharmacokinetics of linezolid have been well described in children. The most notable concern with linezolid, however, is toxicities associated with prolonged use. Until more prospective data are available, we favor linezolid as first-line therapy for the treatment of VRE bacteremia in children.

### Make modern microbiology matter more in the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of infective endocarditis [^ab206112]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The ESC 2023 diagnostic criteria for IE do not make use of the improvements in species determination of bacteria, in particular, streptococci, that have occurred since the first publication of the Duke criteria in 1994. For example, it has become evident that patients with bacteremia with streptococci of the mutans, bovis, or sanguinis groups often have IE, whereas patients with bacteremia caused by anginosus group streptococci rarely have IE. In addition, several pathogens are not mentioned in the ESC 2023 diagnostic criteria despite having a propensity similar to that of Staphylococcus aureus or "oral streptococci" to cause IE. Such bacterial genera and species include Abiotrophia, Aerococcus, Corynebacterium striatum, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and these should all be regarded as typical pathogens. Some of these pathogens are recognized as typical IE pathogens in the Duke–ISCVID criteria.

An entire section (5.3.1) of the ESC guidelines describes standard blood culture practices, which is of limited interest to the clinician and of no use for laboratory personnel. In particular, the guidelines recommend drawing blood cultures at a 30-minute interval, referring to Lamy et al. This reference states that "a 30–60 min interval between samples has been arbitrarily recommended" and that "Li et al (1994) found no difference in blood culture yield whether samples were collected within a 24-h period, either simultaneously or serially", which does not support the recommendation of continued use of the arbitrary sampling interval. It is very impractical to wait between blood cultures, and such a recommendation necessitates firm evidence, which is lacking. What is not mentioned but would have been useful for the reader of the guidelines is that a short time to blood culture positivity in S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia is associated with increased risk of IE; positive blood cultures drawn at 48–72 hours after the initiation of antibiotic treatment is associated with increased likelihood of IE; and Cutibacterium acnes, a not uncommon cause of prosthesis valve IE, grows slowly; therefore, incubation is longer than the standard 120 hours, increasing the likelihood of finding this pathogen.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^74aada1a]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis IE susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, and aminoglycosides — treatment duration and renal considerations: Patients with < 3 months' duration of symptoms were treated successfully with 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, whereas patients with ≥ 3 months' duration were successfully treated with 6 weeks; in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy is reasonable. Patients with preexisting mild (creatinine clearance, 30–50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance, < 30 mL/min) renal failure may not be able to safely complete a 4- to 6-week course of gentamicin therapy; alternative regimens that should be considered include the use of streptomycin instead of gentamicin and short-course gentamicin therapy (2–3 weeks).

### A review of combination antimicrobial therapy for Enterococcus faecalis bloodstream infections and infective endocarditis [^fd4c9b3f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Enterococci, one of the most common causes of hospital-associated infections, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Enterococcus faecalis, the more common and virulent species, causes serious high-inoculum infections, namely infective endocarditis, that are associated with cardiac surgery and mortality rates that remained unchanged for the last 30 years. The best cures for these infections are observed with combination antibiotic therapy; however, optimal treatment has not been fully elucidated. It is the purpose of this review to highlight treatment options and their limitations, and provide direction for future investigative efforts to aid in the treatment of these severe infections. While ampicillin plus ceftriaxone has emerged as a preferred treatment option, mortality rates continue to be high, and from a safety standpoint, ceftriaxone, unlike other cephalosporins, promotes colonization with vancomycin resistant-enterococci due to high biliary concentrations. More research is needed to improve patient outcomes from this high-mortality disease.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^475c2152]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gram-negative bacteremia is common in both community and health care settings, with a significant increase in incidence described for some Gram-negative bacteria in recent years. Prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy for such common infections may lead to increased resistance emergence; adverse events and secondary infections, including Clostridioides difficile infection; prolonged hospital-stay; and excess cost.

tThough recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the non-inferiority of shorter antibiotic courses for Gram-negative bacteremia, prolonged courses are still commonly used and current guidelines still recommend the range of 7–14 days. In addition, it is unclear whether shorter courses of antibiotics are appropriate for specific sub-groups of patients, such as those with non-urinary source of bacteremia; intensive care patients, elderly, and others.

Observational design is a limited tool for evaluating duration of therapy due to confounding by indication and immortal time bias issues. Thus, RCTs are the preferred design to answer this question. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of RCTs is considered to be the gold standard of systematic review. IPD meta-analysis advantages (among others) are narrowing the confidence intervals, and increasing the power to evaluate treatment effect in specific sub-groups of patients.

We performed an IPD meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. We aimed to explore outcomes in several pre-specified sub-groups of patients. We hypothesized no significant difference between short and long antibiotic course for either of the sub-groups.

### Mortality in enterococcal bloodstream infections increases with inappropriate antimicrobial therapy [^a6e863e8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Enterococcus species are common in nosocomial bloodstream infections and their incidence is rising. Although well recognized in several serious bacterial infections, the influence of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in enterococcal bacteraemia has not been fully settled. The aim of the study was to determine whether administration of inappropriate antibiotics in enterococcal bacteraemia is an independent risk factor for mortality, among other known and suspected risk factors. We conducted a cohort study of E. faecalis/faecium bacteraemia during a 3-year period at a single tertiary care hospital in Denmark. Patients with growth of non-enterococcus co-pathogens apart from the enterococcal bacteraemia were also included, as were patients with repeated enterococcal bacteraemia. Time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was counted from the first episode. Appropriate antibiotic therapy was defined as any therapy with documented clinical effect, in vitro activity and a minimum treatment length of 6 days. Multivariate regression models were built to determine the independent risk factors for mortality. We included 196 patients with enterococcal bacteraemia. Appropriate antibiotics for at least 6 days were administered in 146 of these (74%). Thirty-day mortality was 26%. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality: appropriate antimicrobial therapy for ≥ 6 days (odds ratio for mortality 0.33, 0.14–0.79), ICU admission (4.2, 1.7–10), thrombocytopenia (3.9, 1.6–9.3), chronic liver failure (3.3, 1.1–10) and age ≥ 60 years (2.2, 0.99–5.0). Antibiotics not appropriately covering enterococci are frequently administered empirically in suspected bloodstream infections. Inappropriate antibiotic therapy was an independent risk factor for mortality in enterococcal bacteraemia.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^e8b7f17e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

We aim to compare the effect of short versus long treatment duration in Gram-negative bacteremia on all-cause mortality in pre-specified sub-groups.

Methods

Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short (≤ 7) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia during hospital stay. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify trials conducted up to May 2022. Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmission, local or distant infection complications, adverse events, and resistance emergence.

Outcomes were assessed in pre-specified subgroups: women vs men; non-urinary vs urinary source; presence vs absence of hypotension on initial presentation; immunocompromised patients versus non-immunocompromised patients, and age (above/below 65). Fixed-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All three trials had low risk of bias for allocation generation and concealment.

Findings

Three RCTs (1186 patients) were included; 1121 with enterobacterales bacteremia. No significant difference in mortality was demonstrated between 7- and 14-days treatment (90-day mortality: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73–1.58; 30-day mortality: 1.08, 0.62–1.91). Relapse (1.00, 0.50–1.97); length of hospital stay (P = 0.78); readmission (0.96, 0.80–1.22); and infection complications (local: 1.62 0.76–3.47; distant: 2.00, 0.18–22.08), were without significant difference, and so were adverse events or resistance emergence.

No significant difference in clinical outcomes between 7 and 14 days of antibiotics was demonstrated in the subgroups of gender, age, hemodynamic status, immune status, and source of infection.

Interpretation

For patients hemodynamically stable and afebrile at 48 h prior to discontinuation, seven days of antibiotic therapy for enterobacterales bacteremia result in similar outcomes as 14 days, in terms of mortality, relapse, length of hospital stay, complications of infection, resistance emergence, and adverse events. These results apply for any adult age group, gender, source of infection, immune status, and hemodynamic status on presentation.

Materials and methods

Search strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Medline (1948 to 2010), and Ovid Embase (1947 to 2010) to find relevant RCTs comparing shorter versus longer durations of treatment for bacteremia or the five most common organ system infections causing bacteremia in critically ill patients. Filters for RCTs specified by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network were combined individually with the following keywords: 'bacteremia', 'bacteraemia', 'pneumonia', 'pyelonephritis', 'cellulitis', 'soft tissue infection', 'skin disease, bacterial', 'peritonitis', 'intra-abdominal infection', 'catheter-related infections', and 'catheterization, central venous AND bacteremia OR bacteraemia OR bloodstream infection'. Results were restricted to trials performed on humans. We manually reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies, editorials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses to identify additional relevant trials.

Eligibility criteria

Clinical trials were included if they used random allocation of patients to treatment groups comparing differing durations of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous antimicrobial treatment of bacteremia, CRBSIs, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, SSTI, or intra-abdominal infections. Eligible trials randomly assigned subjects to one of two different durations of treatment with the same antibiotic regimen and evaluated one or more of the following outcomes: clinical cure, microbiologic cure, or survival. We excluded trials that determined duration of treatment on the basis of physician discretion, clinical improvement, or biomarker measurements. Observational studies were not included, because a large volume of studies was anticipated and because the association of treatment duration and patient outcomes would be impossible to interpret in light of survivor bias and bias-by-indication. A sample of 200 citations from each of the six searches (1,200 total citations) was independently reviewed by a second author to assess agreement via calculation of a kappa statistic. Disagreements were resolved through consensus.

Study quality

The quality of included trials was appraised by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which assesses sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, data completeness, and outcome reporting, and, on the basis of these domains, summarizes studies as exhibiting a low, high, or unclear risk of bias.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, enterococci, resistant, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to administer vancomycin 30 mg/kg/day IV in 2 doses for 6 weeks combined with gentamicin 3 mg/kg/day IV or IM in 1 dose for 2 weeks in adult patients with IE caused by β-lactam-resistant Enterococcus species (E. faecium).

### Low-dose gentamicin for uncomplicated Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia may be nephrotoxic in children [^88b5a745]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists regarding the role of synergistic gentamicin for uncomplicated Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia in children.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, observational study comparing clinical outcomes of children with E. faecalis bacteremia without endocarditis receiving ampicillin monotherapy with those receiving ampicillin along with low-dose gentamicin therapy. To account for nonrandom assignment of combination therapy, propensity score weighting was combined with multivariable regression to estimate the effect of combination therapy on duration of bacteremia, bacteremic relapse, and acute kidney injury (AKI).

Results

One hundred sixty-three (52%) patients received ampicillin with low-dose gentamicin, and 150 (48%) patients received ampicillin monotherapy. Incorporating propensity-score weighting with additional adjustment for source control measures, patients receiving combination therapy experienced bacterial clearance 10 hours faster than children receiving ampicillin monotherapy (adjusted mean difference 0.42; confidence interval (CI), .02 to .82; P = 0.04). Bacteremic relapse was similar between the two groups (17% vs 18%); adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) 1.12; 95% CI, .65 to 1.92. Children receiving low-dose gentamicin had approximately twice the risk of developing AKI compared to children not receiving this agent, adjusting for the receipt of additional nephrotoxins (aHR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.48–2.97).

Conclusions

Our study suggests that for children with uncomplicated E. faecalis bacteremia, the addition of low-dose gentamicin may decrease the time to bacterial clearance by 10 hours but without any impact on recurrent bacteremia. However, with this potential benefit comes the increased likelihood of AKI. Low-dose gentamicin for the treatment of uncomplicated enterococcal bacteremia may pose harm to children with limited benefit.

# This regimen is indicated for cUTI due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and for AP due to E. coli.

ÞDrug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis. This indication is based on a surrogate endpoint. Levofloxacin plasma concentrations achieved in humans are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit [see Clinical Studies (14.9)].

ßThe safety of levofloxacin tablets in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations beyond 14 days has not been studied. An increased incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. Prolonged levofloxacin tablets therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk.

àDrug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Yersinia pestis. Higher doses of levofloxacin tablets typically used for treatment of pneumonia can be used for treatment of plague, if clinically indicated.

### Partial oral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment of endocarditis [^9d801a81]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with infective endocarditis on the left side of the heart are typically treated with intravenous antibiotic agents for up to 6 weeks. Whether a shift from intravenous to oral antibiotics once the patient is in stable condition would result in efficacy and safety similar to those with continued intravenous treatment is unknown.

Methods

In a randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial, we assigned 400 adults in stable condition who had endocarditis on the left side of the heart caused by streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci and who were being treated with intravenous antibiotics to continue intravenous treatment (199 patients) or to switch to oral antibiotic treatment (201 patients). In all patients, antibiotic treatment was administered intravenously for at least 10 days. If feasible, patients in the orally treated group were discharged to outpatient treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, embolic events, or relapse of bacteremia with the primary pathogen, from the time of randomization until 6 months after antibiotic treatment was completed.

Results

After randomization, antibiotic treatment was completed after a median of 19 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the intravenously treated group and 17 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the orally treated group (P = 0.48). The primary composite outcome occurred in 24 patients (12.1%) in the intravenously treated group and in 18 (9.0%) in the orally treated group (between-group difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -3.4 to 9.6; P = 0.40), which met noninferiority criteria.

Conclusions

In patients with endocarditis on the left side of the heart who were in stable condition, changing to oral antibiotic treatment was noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotic treatment. (Funded by the Danish Heart Foundation and others; POET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01375257 .).

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^0c05c6c6]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Enterococcus Species

If enterococci (especially Enterococcus faecalis) are sensitive to ampicillin or amoxicillin, this should be the initial agent of choice, with up to a week intravenous therapy followed by oral amoxicillin.

For ampicillin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin and daptomycin are the first choices. Resistance to vancomycin is increasing (vancomycin-resistant enterococci). Apart from daptomycin or oral linezolid, often no other alternative options are available. Pristinamycin may be considered for treatment of E. faecalis, although evidence supporting this is limited for enterococcal implant-related infections.,

IV fosfomycin has extensive tissue penetration in inflamed tissue and bone. In an experimental model of foreign-body infection, the combination of fosfomycin and gentamicin showed good biofilm activity against E. faecalis. Further studies are needed before IV fosfomycin can be recommended as a standard therapy in enterococcal FRI, although it may be considered in selected cases. No safety data exist on long-term oral administration of fosfomycin. This route of administration is therefore not recommended for bone and joint infections.

Enterococcus infective endocarditis (IE) caused by strains resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin — treatment and care team guidance include the following: Linezolid 600 mg IV or orally every 12 h for > 6 weeks is a Class IIb; Level of Evidence C option, and linezolid use may be associated with potentially severe bone marrow suppression, neuropathy, and numerous drug interactions; daptomycin 10–12 mg/kg per dose for > 6 weeks is also Class IIb; Level of Evidence C, and if daptomycin therapy is selected, then doses of 10 to 12 mg·kg−1·24 h−1 may be considered. Patients with IE attributable to Enterococcus species resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin should be managed by specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, if necessary, pediatrics (Class I; Level of Evidence C); patients with IE caused by these strains should be treated by a care team including specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiac surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, in children, pediatrics, and cardiac valve replacement may be necessary for cure. Combination therapy with daptomycin and ampicillin or ceftriaxone may be considered, especially in patients with persistent bacteremia or enterococcal strains with high MICs (ie, 3 μg/mL) to daptomycin within the susceptible range (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Doses recommended are for patients with normal renal and hepatic function.

Background

We aim to compare the effect of short versus long treatment duration in Gram-negative bacteremia on all-cause mortality in pre-specified sub-groups.

Methods

Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short (≤ 7) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia during hospital stay. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify trials conducted up to May 2022. Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmission, local or distant infection complications, adverse events, and resistance emergence. Outcomes were assessed in pre-specified subgroups: women vs men; non-urinary vs urinary source; presence vs absence of hypotension on initial presentation; immunocompromised patients versus non-immunocompromised patients, and age (above/below 65). Fixed-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All three trials had low risk of bias for allocation generation and concealment.

Findings

Three RCTs (1186 patients) were included; 1121 with enterobacterales bacteremia. No significant difference in mortality was demonstrated between 7- and 14-days treatment (90-day mortality: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73–1.58; 30-day mortality: 1.08, 0.62–1.91).

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^fdfbb940]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The study flow chart is presented in Fig. 1. Three trials met our inclusion criteria, all were investigator-initiated, and compared an antibiotic duration of seven versus fourteen days for Gram-negative bacteremia. One of these three trials included a C-reactive protein (CRP)-based duration arm that was excluded from the analysis, leaving overall 1186 randomized patients (1182 evaluable patients; Yahav et al. 604 patients; von Dach et al. 334 patients; and Molina et al. 248 patients). Trials' characteristics are detailed in Table 1. The most common source of bacteremia in the original trials was UTI (411/604, 68%; 213/334, 64%, and 136/248, 55% of patients in the different trials). Accordingly, the vast majority of causative bloodstream isolates were enterobacterales (95%, 1125/1186), with two trials including only patients with enterobacterales bacteremia, and a third trial allowing other Gram-negatives. In the three included trials, choice and route of administration of antibiotics was at the discretion of the treating physician. Risk of bias assessment of the included trials is detailed in Fig. 2. All three trials had low risk of bias for allocation generation and concealment; all three were open-label.

Overall, 592 patients were included for evaluation in the short (7 days) arm and 590 in the long (14 days) arm. The Breslow–Day test showed no heterogeneity of odds ratios between trials. For the outcome of mortality, no significant difference was demonstrated for either 90- or 30-day mortality between arms (90 days mortality 7 days: 60/592 (10.1%), 14 days: 56/590 (9.5%) - OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73–1.58; 30d mortality 7 days: 26/592 (4.4%), 14 days: 24/590 (4.1%) - OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62–1.91 (with OR > 1 favoring 14 days).

### VRE and VSE bacteremia outcomes in the era of effective VRE therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9f39a827]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Enterococcus spp. are typically commensal organisms, common in the human gastrointestinal tract, but in some circumstances can cause serious infections including bacteremia, particularly among hospitalized patients with underlying comorbid conditions. Since its discovery in 1988, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens and are occurring with increasing frequency due to widespread use of antibiotics, prolonged hospitalizations, and increased intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, especially among patients with malignant health conditions. – In Canada, the incidence of VRE infections has risen to 0.5 infections per 1,000 admissions, a 6-fold increase in recent years. Similarly in the United States, hospitalizations with VRE infection reached 0.6 per 1,000 admissions by 2006.

Whether outcomes associated with VRE bacteremia are worse than those associated with vancomycin-sensitive enterococci (VSE) bacteremia remains unclear. Two prior systematic reviews have compared outcomes of VRE bacteremia VSE bacteremia; both found VRE bacteremia to be associated with an increased risk of mortality when compared to VSE bacteremia (relative risk [RR], 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.13–2.66; odds ratio [OR], 2.52; 95% CI, 1.87–3.39). However, both of these systematic reviews included studies conducted prior to the availability of effective VRE therapies. Since late 1999, a number of antibiotic drugs have been licensed as treatment for VRE bacteremia by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, and other national approval agencies. Quinupristin-dalfopristin was approved in 1999, followed by linezolid in 2000. In 2003, daptomycin was formally licensed for complicated skin and soft tissue VRE infections, but it is frequently used as an off-label therapy for VRE bacteremia.

Thus, understanding whether VRE bacteremia-associated outcomes are different from those of VSE bacteremia, since the emergence of effective VRE therapy, is critically important to help inform future VRE infection control recommendations. To this end, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing outcomes of patients with either VRE or VSE bacteremia, when patients with VRE bacteremia were treated with effective VRE therapy.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^13140160]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this individual patient data meta-analysis of three RCTs, evaluating overall 1182 patients, we found no significant difference in 90- or 30-day mortality between 7 and 14 days of antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia. Other patient related outcomes, such as relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmission, and local or distant complications, were also demonstrated to be without significant difference. No difference in emergence of resistance or adverse events was either demonstrated between short and long therapy arms, though the number of events was low and the follow up duration limited to 90 days.

Analyzing this large database for subgroup analysis, we also did not find a significant difference in clinical outcomes between 7 and 14 days of antibiotics in the subgroups of women vs men; non urinary vs urinary source of bacteremia; presence vs absence of hypotension on initial presentation; immunocompromised patients vs non-immunocompromised patients; and age (above/below 65).

Shorter antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia has been demonstrated to have similar outcomes to longer duration in several observational studies, mostly comparing 5–10 days to longer regimens., Mortality, relapse/recurrence, clinical success, and superinfection rates were similar between longer and shorter therapy in most studies, though some demonstrated higher rates of superinfection, or resistance emergencewith longer therapy; while others reported higher rates of re-initiation of antibiotics and C. difficile with shorter regimen.

Concomitantly, three RCTs demonstrated non-inferiority of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy for hemodynamically stable patients with mainly enterobacterales bacteremia. The strength of this individual patient data meta-analysis is by allowing a larger sample size to test the effect of duration of therapy for specific subgroups of patients. In this meta-analysis, short versus long therapy had similar outcomes among 425 patients with non-urinary source of infection, 801 elderly patients (aged ≥ 65) and 359 patients with low systolic blood pressure. Nevertheless, sample size of each sub-group may not be sufficient to draw conclusions. Moreover, findings from subgroup analyses are at risk of bias given loss of randomization when considering only subgroups.

### Daptomycin in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infections and endocarditis: a EUCAST position paper [^aa03a23c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Scope

This position paper describes the view adopted by EUCAST on the role of daptomycin in the treatment of serious infections caused by Enterococcus species.

Background

High-dose daptomycin is considered effective in the treatment of enterococcal bloodstream infection (BSI) and endocarditis, although published clinical experience with the latter condition is limited.

Methods

EUCAST reviewed the available published data on pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD), resistance selection, clinical efficacy and safety for the use of 10–12 mg/kg/day of daptomycin for these conditions, noting that the doses licensed by the European Medicines Agency are only 4–6 mg/kg/day, and only for infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

Findings and Recommendations

The PK-PD evidence shows that, even with doses of 10–12 mg/kg/day, it is not possible to treat infections caused by isolates at the upper end of the wild-type distributions of Enterococcus faecalis (with MICs of 4 mg/L) and E. faecium (with MICs of 4 or 8 mg/L). For this reason, and because there are ongoing issues with the reliability of laboratory testing, EUCAST lists daptomycin breakpoints for Enterococcus species as "IE"-insufficient evidence. EUCAST advises increased vigilance in the use of high-dose of daptomycin to treat enterococcal BSI and endocarditis. Additional PK-PD studies and prospective efficacy and safety studies of serious Enterococcal infections treated with high-dose daptomycin may permit the setting of breakpoints in the future.

Bacteremia management — Early source control and imaging are emphasized, and intravenous (IV) to oral transition is allowed with defined duration. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed; repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection; antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate when bacteremia cleared promptly and there is no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess, and Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a71673f3]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The ICU is the epicenter of bacteremia, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance in most hospitals. Reductions in the length of antibiotic treatment courses could potentially limit antibiotic use, adverse effects, and resistance pressure, but antibiotic stewardship efforts to shorten therapy are hampered by the lack of research regarding minimally acceptable durations of treatment for BSIs. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that both inpatients and outpatients with non- S. aureus bacteremia secondary to mild to moderate intra-abdominal infection, CAP, or pyelonephritis may be successfully treated with shorter (5 to 7 days) courses of therapy. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution, as only very small numbers of patients and subgroup analyses are currently available for interpretation. A large dedicated trial of treatment duration for bacteremia in severely ill patients is urgently needed to determine the optimal duration of therapy.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^9f4b32bc]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated febrile UTI were older and had multiple comorbidities. Especially in this population with the highest disease burden, in whom the longest antibiotic therapy is recommended by current guidelines, our algorithm proved to be effective.

The safety subgroups were small, but no trend for difference in rates of persistent infection was shown at 7 days after end of therapy or at 30 days after enrollment. The slightly higher, but non-significant, rate of bacteriuria and asymptomatic infection in the PCT-pyuria group should not be viewed as an unsuccessful treatment. There is vast evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated. In fact, asymptomatic bacteriuria might be protective against future development of pyelonephritis, as elegantly shown in a prospective Italian study of young women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, who benefited from symptomatic treatment versus antibiotics. There is evidence that in older patients with isolated non-specific signs or non-infectious symptoms, such as delirium, urine testing and subsequent antibiotic therapy should not be ordered.

Furthermore, the follow-up mid-stream urine cultures in the PCT-pyuria group yielded in the majority of cases Enterococcus faecalis (Table 2), which has recently been shown to have a low positive predictive value for uropathogen growth in the bladder.

The antibiotics chosen in our algorithm, derived from international guidelines, should not deter from the necessity to adapt antibiotic choices to local epidemiology and resistance data. In Switzerland, 18.5% of Escherichia coli were resistant to fluoroquinolones in 2013, compared to 22.3% in the European Union in 2012.

A major strength was the innovative study design with antibiotic guidance based on the combination of the systemic and local response against a control group receiving antibiotic therapy according to the low end of currently recommended guidelines.

Potential limitations

Our study has the following limitations. First, the small sample size due to slow recruitment and the heterogeneity of patients within the predefined subgroups limit the power of the analysis, especially regarding safety outcomes. Second, the follow-up mode by telephone interview and by urine samples which were returned by mail harbors potential recall bias and underreporting, which we tried to counteract by contacting the primary care physician and by obtaining discharge letters of subsequent hospitalizations. Third, the analysis of the recurrence rate in the subgroup of patients with bacteremia was limited due to the small numbers. Further studies will have to clarify whether this algorithm needs to be adapted for patients with bacteremia.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^aeac151a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favour of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for IAIs in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative cIAIs; 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of E. faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, E. faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to BSIs. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains teicoplanin should be considered the preferred drug.

What are the optimal daily doses and modality of administration of antibiotics in patients with IAIs?

19. In patients with IAIs and sepsis or septic shock, appropriate dose and administration mode of antibiotics should include: 1) proper loading dose, 2) extended or continuous infusion for beta-lactams and 3) knowledge of the peritoneal/biliary penetration rate (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

20. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit good penetration rate in the peritoneal exudate fluid. In critically ill patients, continuous infusion should be implemented to grant optimal PK/PD target attainment at the infection site (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Administering adequate doses of antibiotics should be based on the intrinsic pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of each antibiotic class, the specific agent, and the specific pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient.

### Infectious diseases consultation improves treatment and decreases mortality by enterococcal bacteremia in children [^387723a5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Enterococci can cause severe infectious diseases (IDs). Delaying appropriate antibiotic therapy for enterococcal bacteremia is associated with increased patient mortality.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis examining the characteristics of children with enterococcal bacteremia at the 2 largest children's hospitals in Japan. We compared outcomes of enterococcal bacteremia patients who received IDs consultation with those who did not. We also evaluated the risk factors for 30-day mortality after onset of enterococcal bacteremia.

Results

One hundred fifty-two episodes of enterococcal bacteremia developed in 142 children. The most common pathogen was Enterococcus faecalis (94 episodes, 62%) followed by E. faecium (46 episodes, 30%). An underlying disease was present in 146 (96%) episodes. The most common type of infection was catheter-related blood stream infection (90, 59%). ID consultation, provided in 100 of 152 episodes of enterococcal bacteremia, was significantly associated with a higher rate of appropriate empiric therapy (84% versus 56%; P < 0.001) and appropriate definitive therapy (98% versus 73%; P < 0.001), treatment duration ≥ 7 days (97% versus 78%; P < 0.001), and the survival rate during 1 year postonset (P = 0.047). Seventeen children died within 30 days of enterococcal bacteremia onset. In multivariate analysis, those who received definitive therapy with penicillin without glycopeptides were at a statistically lower risk for death within 30 days after onset of enterococcal bacteremia (OR: 0.12; 95% confidence interval: 0.02–0.70; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

ID consultation was associated with a higher rate of appropriate therapy and may decrease mortality because of enterococcal bacteremia in children.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^ba49a0f4]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus endocarditis — aminoglycoside use and dosing: Approximately 97% of cases of enterococcal IE are caused by E faecalis, and in older, comorbid patients gentamicin-associated nephrotoxicity may complicate a "standard" 4- to 6-week course; in some situations the potential risk of attempting to complete a 4- to 6-week course of gentamicin therapy may exceed the benefit. Human studies used dosing intervals ranging from once daily to 3 times daily, and the data were insufficient to compare the efficacy of once-daily with divided doses; until more convincing data demonstrate once-daily dosing is as effective, in patients with normal renal function, gentamicin should be administered in daily multiple divided doses (total, ≈3 mg·kg−1·d−1). In patients with normal renal function, it is reasonable to administer gentamicin every 8 hours with the dose adjusted to achieve a 1-hour serum concentration of ≈3 μg/mL and a trough concentration of < 1 μg/mL; increasing the dose did not enhance efficacy but did increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Revisiting the evidence base that informs the use of adjunctive therapy for Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^550ca372]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend adjunctive gentamicin for the treatment of Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) despite a risk of toxicity. We sought to revisit the evidence for adjunctive therapy in EFIE and to synthesize the comparative safety and effectiveness of aminoglycosides versus ceftriaxone by systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

For historical context, we reviewed seminal case series and in vitro studies on the evolution from penicillin monotherapy to modern-day regimens for EFIE. Next, we searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to 16 January 2024 for studies of EFIE that compared adjunctive aminoglycosides versus ceftriaxone or adjunctive versus monotherapy. Where possible, clinical outcomes were compared between regimens using random effects meta-analysis. Otherwise, data were narratively summarized.

Results

The meta-analysis was limited to 10 observational studies at high risk of bias (911 patients). Relative to adjunctive ceftriaxone, gentamicin had similar all-cause mortality (risk difference [RD], -0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.0 to 3.5), relapse (RD, -0.1%; 95% CI, -2.4 to 2.3), and treatment failure (RD, 1.1%; 95% CI, -1.6 to 3.7) but higher discontinuation due to toxicity (RD, 26.3%; 95% CI, 19.8 to 32.7). The 3 studies that compared adjunctive therapy to monotherapy included only 30 monotherapy patients, and heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis.

Conclusions

Adjunctive ceftriaxone appeared to be equally effective and less toxic than gentamicin for the treatment of EFIE. The existing evidence does not clearly establish the superiority of either adjunctive therapy or monotherapy. Pending randomized evidence, if adjunctive therapy is to be used, ceftriaxone appears to be a reasonable option.

### Antimicrobial combination therapy for treatment of Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia (microEFfAECT) [^3156e828]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial Combination Therapy for Treatment of Enterococcus Faecalis Bacteremia ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Enterococcus faecalis is a common commensal of human gastrointestinal tract that can act as opportunistic pathogen causing mild to severe clinical illness. Severe infections due to EF include bacteremia, endocarditis and catheter-related infections. EF is the fourth causative pathogen of bloodstream infection in Europe after E. coli, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. The optimal treatment of EF-BSI uncomplicated with endocarditis is still a matter of debate. Ampicillin is commonly considered the drug of choice, when active in vitro. However, several studies demonstrated the synergistic effect of the combination treatment with an aminoglycosides or ceftriaxone in case of life-threatening infections.

To date the efficacy of the combination treatment in patients with EF-BSI was poorly evaluated in clinical studies and most of the data come from very old uncontrolled clinical observations. One strategy for overcoming this uncertainty is to assess the synergistic interaction of different antimicrobial molecules by in vitro tests and to validate in vitro synergisms with clinical studies. Indeed, in vitro evaluation of the drug combination effect has the potentiality for improving treatment by suggesting the possible synergistic or antagonistic interaction of antimicrobial associations. Although, different studies suggested the potential clinical utility of synergy testing, the real prognostic value of these methods is not defined yet. In this context, synergy testing could be used as strategy for improving antibiotic treatment of EF-BSI by suggesting the optimal antimicrobial combination therapy.

The primary aim of the study is to compare efficacy of appropriate monotherapy vs combination treatment for EF-BSI and validate clinically the in vitro synergistic/antagonistic interaction of antimicrobial combinations by synergy tests. Secondary objectives are:

- Adult
- Monomicrobial EF-BSI
- Receipt of ≥ 5 days of at least one in vitro active drug with or without a synergistic drug, at common suggested dosages for EF-BSI in empirical or definitive therapy.
- **Written informed consent Exclusion Criteria**:
- Short term mortality
- Other concomitant infection.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d42fc431]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Two reviewers (M.L. and Y.G.) used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. For disagreements, the reviewers (M.L. and Y.G.) first discussed to reach consensus. If no agreement could be achieved, a third-party reviewer (J.T.) made the final decision. The assessment considered five domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, directness of evidence, precision of estimates, and potential publication bias. Certainty levels included "high", "moderate", "low", and "very low". To facilitate the interpretation of results, we used relative risk estimates and baseline risk to calculate absolute effects (Risk difference, RD) for dichotomous outcomes. For all outcomes, we used the median in the control group (longer duration group) from eligible trials as the baseline risk. We assessed the imprecision of all results using the minimal important difference (MID) as a threshold. We set the MID for mortality and serious adverse events at 0.5% and 1%, respectively, and the MID for other dichotomous outcomes at 2%. For continuous variables (length of hospital stay), we set the MID at 1 day.

### Influence of minimum inhibitory concentration in clinical outcomes of Enterococcus faecium bacteremia treated with daptomycin: is it time to change the breakpoint? [^f6dab7c5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Daptomycin has become a front-line antibiotic for multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium bloodstream infections (BSIs). We previously showed that E. faecium strains with daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in the higher end of susceptibility frequently harbor mutations associated with daptomycin resistance. We postulate that patients with E. faecium BSIs exhibiting daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL treated with daptomycin are more likely to have worse clinical outcomes than those exhibiting daptomycin MICs ≤ 2 µg/mL.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included adult patients with E. faecium BSI for whom initial isolates, follow-up blood culture data, and daptomycin administration data were available. A central laboratory performed standardized daptomycin MIC testing for all isolates. The primary outcome was microbiologic failure, defined as clearance of bacteremia ≥ 4 days after the index blood culture. The secondary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality.

Results

A total of 62 patients were included. Thirty-one patients were infected with isolates that exhibited daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL. Overall, 34 patients had microbiologic failure and 25 died during hospitalization. In a multivariate logistic regression model, daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL (odds ratio [OR], 4.7 [1.37–16.12]; P = 0.014) and immunosuppression (OR, 5.32 [1.20–23.54]; P = 0.028) were significantly associated with microbiologic failure. Initial daptomycin dose of ≥ 8 mg/kg was not significantly associated with evaluated outcomes.

Conclusions

Daptomycin MICs of 3–4 µg/mL in the initial E. faecium blood isolate predicted microbiological failure of daptomycin therapy, suggesting that modification in the daptomycin breakpoint for enterococci should be considered.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^449c151e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, 1041 patients (88%) were included in the per-protocol analysis. For the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, no significant difference was demonstrated between arms (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.81–1.95).

Other components of the primary outcomes from the trials were without significant difference between arms (Table 2). These included relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmissions at 30 days; and distal complications and local suppurative complications at 90 days (Table 2). Other components of the primary outcomes were reported by individual trials, including restart of targeted antibiotics until 90 days by von Dach et al. without difference between arms (7-days: 9/169, 56% vs 14-days: 9/165, 56%); and absence of clinical cure (i.e. no resolution of signs and symptoms) by Molina et al. with no significant difference between arms (7-days: 8/110, 7.3% vs 14-days: 12/122, 9.8%).

Table 2
The association between study arm and outcomes, stratified by trial (For categorical variables, fixed-effect meta-analysis model, Mantel-Haenszel method. Homogeneity of odds ratios between trials was evaluated with the Breslow–Day test).

Emergence of resistance to study antibiotic was reported from two trials for a follow up of up to 90 days, reporting 36/592 cases (6%) in the short arm and 29/590 cases (5%) in the long arm, without significant difference (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.74–2.04). New clinically or microbiologically documented infection and functional capacity were reported from only one trial. This trial reported no difference in new infections between arms, and significantly shorter time to return to baseline functional capacity in the 7 days arm. As expected, duration of antibiotic therapy for the index bacteremia was significantly shorter in the seven-day arm. Adverse events that were reported from at least two trials included diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, rash and acute kidney injury. All were without significant difference between short and long therapy (Table 2).

### VRE and VSE bacteremia outcomes in the era of effective VRE therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c9f23b5d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

The worse outcomes associated with VRE bacteremia compared to VSE bacteremia may also be linked to differences in the causative species as there may have been proportionately more patients with E. faecium than E. faecalis in the VRE bacteremia group when compared to the VSE bacteremia group.

Our results should be interpreted recognizing the systematic review's limitations. First, studies included within each meta-analysis were non-randomized observational studies, and accordingly, our results reflect association and not causation. Second, as discussed above, only a small number of studies adjusted for potential confounders, and thus confounding may have influenced the investigated associations. Third, our results may be limited by the exclusive review of English language reports published after January 1997, but it is unlikely such language restrictions biased our findings. Fourth, the majority of studies sampled immunocompromised hospital patient populations, which limited our ability to generalize our findings to all healthcare settings. Last, our funnel plot suggests that there may be publication bias. However, the 2 studies that contributed to this asymmetry had high standard error and odds ratios close to 1. Thus, if the asymmetry in the funnel plot is due to publication bias, it would bias the results towards the null hypothesis.

We conclude that using the best available evidence, VRE bacteremia remains associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality when compared with VSE bacteremia in the era of effective VRE therapy. Future research is needed to determine whether these results are related to unadjusted differences in the patient populations, differences in treatment effectiveness, or differences in proportions of patients with E. faecalis and E. faecium comprising the VRE and VSE bacteremias.

### How do I manage a patient with enterococcal bacteraemia? [^e6a080f0]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Enterococcal bacteraemia (EB) is common, particularly in the nosocomial setting, and its management poses a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists.

Objectives

The aim was to summarize the more relevant features of EB and to provide a practical state-of-the-art on the topics that more directly affect its management.

Sources

Pubmed articles from inception to 31 May 2020.

Content

The following topics are covered: epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics and factors associated with prognosis of EB; diagnosis and work-up, including the use of echocardiography to rule out endocarditis; antibiotic management with special focus on antimicrobial resistance and complicated EB; and the role of infectious disease consultation and the use of bundles in EB. In addition, three clinical vignettes are presented to illustrate the practical application of the guidance provided, and major gaps in the current evidence supporting EB management are discussed.

Implications

EB is associated with large burdens of morbidity and mortality, particularly among fragile and immunosuppressed patients presenting complicated bacteraemia due to multidrug-resistant enterococci. Most cases of EB are caused by Enterococcus faecalis, followed by E. faecium. EB often presents as polymicrobial bacteraemia. Rapidly identifying patients at risk of EB is crucial for timely application of diagnostic techniques and empiric therapy. Early alert systems and rapid diagnostic techniques, such as matrix-assisted desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, especially if used together with infectious disease consultation within bundles, appear to improve management and prognosis of EB. Echocardiography is also key in the work-up of EB and should probably be more extensively used, although its exact indications in EB are still debated. Multidisciplinary approaches are warranted due to the complexity and severity of EB.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^14e0b9a2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Design, Settings, and Patients

This observational multicenter retrospective study was conducted in 14 hospitals in western France, serving a population catchment area of around 10 million people. Among these, 7 have a cardiac surgery department and an endocarditis team. All adult patients (≥ 18 years old) who fulfilled the modified Duke criteria, according to ESC guidelines, for definite E. faecalis IE were enrolled. Patients could only be included once. The inclusion period was from January 2015 to December 2019. Patients with possible endocarditis diagnosis, those with pacemaker lead-related endocarditis without valvular involvement, and those without available treatment data were not included.

Depending on the site, patients were identified through (i) screening of E. faecalis bacteremia cases, (ii) pre-existing IE local cohorts, or (iii) cross-reference of E. faecalis bacteremia cases with French hospital discharge database. There was no standardized follow-up; frequency of follow-up visits, and biological monitoring (including systematic drawing of blood cultures) after treatment of EFIE were performed according to local practice.

Data Collection

Data for clinical, microbiological, echocardiographic variables, as well as management of EFIE and follow-up, were collected from the patients' clinical records. The data collected were entered into an anonymous database designed for the present study.

Ethics

The study was approved by an institutional review board, the Ethical Committee of Research in Tropical and Infectious Diseases (CER-MIT 2022–0105). Patients were informed of the study in accordance with French legal standards: written consent was not required, but all subjects included received an information letter.

Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis — aminoglycoside selection and alternatives: Streptomycin should be avoided in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (Class III; Level of Evidence B). If the strain of Enterococcus is susceptible both to gentamicin and streptomycin, it is reasonable to use gentamicin rather than streptomycin for therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). When gentamicin therapy is not an option, then a double-β-lactam regimen (see later section) is reasonable (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B).

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^51ff1b50]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This IPD systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-IPD Statement, and Cochrane instructions for IPD-MA. Considering the priority of the results for decision-making, and taking into account expected new evidence from a large ongoing trial in the topic, we conduct this review as a living systematic review. For the living systematic review we will repeat the search every 12 months. Updates of the meta-analysis will be conducted when new evidence that is likely to influence the results will be identified.

We included RCTs comparing short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia, as defined in individual trials. We included only trials evaluating patients with Gram-negative bacteremia as their target population. Trials evaluating various infection types (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection), and reporting bacteremic patients as a sub-group were not included. We excluded trials addressing source of bacteremia requiring prolonged treatment (endocarditis/endovascular infections; necrotizing fasciitis; osteomyelitis; abdominal abscesses and other unresolved abdominal sources requiring source control (surgery/drainage); central nervous system infections; empyema; any uncontrolled focus of infection (undrained abscess/deep seated intra-abdominal infection, undrained moderate to severe hydronephrosis). We also excluded patients with intracellular pathogens including Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp.

Interventions tested were antibiotics with in vitro activity against the pathogen for ≤ 7 vs > 7 days. Any choice and route of administration of antibiotics (oral or intravenous) were eligible for inclusion. Any source of bacteremia not requiring prolonged treatment (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, etc.) and any place of acquisition (community or hospital) were eligible for inclusion.

Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality; relapse of bacteremia; length of hospital stay; readmissions; local suppurative and distant complications; restarting of Gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy; emergence of resistance to study antibiotics; functional capacity and time to return to baseline capacity; new clinically or microbiologically documented infection; and adverse events: any diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, acute kidney injury, and rash (for secondary outcomes definitions, see Appendix).

### Advances in the therapy of bacterial bloodstream infections [^9ec54122]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Advances in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) have been achieved in the last years, improving clinical outcome. However, mortality associated with some pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp., is still high. In addition, the spread of antibiotic resistance, mainly among Gram-negative bacteria, reduces treatment options in some circumstances. Therefore, interest in new drugs, combination regimens and optimal dosing schedules is rising.

Objectives

Our aim is to summarize the current evidence on available antibiotic regimens for patients with bacterial BSI, focusing on drug choice, combination regimens and optimal dosing schedules. We selected bacteria that are difficult to manage because of virulence factors (i.e. methicillin-susceptible S. aureus), tolerance to antibiotic activity (i.e. Enterococcus faecalis), and/or susceptibility patterns (i.e. methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii).

Sources

MEDLINE search with English language and publication in the last 5 years as limits.

Content and Implications

The literature gaps on the use of new drugs, the uncertainties regarding the use of combination regimens, and the need to optimize dosing schedules in some circumstances (e.g. augmented renal clearance, renal replacement therapy, high inoculum BSI sources, and isolation of bacteria showing high MICs) have been revised.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Comparison of outcomes from daptomycin or linezolid treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bloodstream infection: a retrospective, multicenter, cohort study [^059a5f94]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment for bloodstream infections (BSIs) with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is unknown.

Objective

This study examined outcomes in patients treated with daptomycin or linezolid for VRE BSI.

Methods

A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study was performed via chart review. Hospitalized patients treated for VRE BSI with daptomycin or linezolid from September 1, 2003, to June 30, 2007, were identified via pharmacy and microbiology reports at each institution. Patients aged < 18 years or with polymicrobial bacteremia were excluded from analysis. Linezolid and daptomycin were included because the participating institutions used either of the 2 agents as first-line treatment for VRE BSI. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the effect of drug selection on mortality and duration of BSI. Duration of BSI was defined as the amount of time from the draw date of the first positive blood culture to the draw date of the first finalized negative blood culture. Adverse events were not assessed.

Results

One-hundred one patients from 3 participating US hospitals experiencing VRE BSI were identified. Sixty-seven patients were treated with daptomycin and 34 with linezolid. Baseline characteristics appeared comparable between the daptomycin- and linezolidtreated groups, with the exception of shock (P = 0.049), prior vancomycin treatment (P = 0.002), and prior linezolid treatment (P < 0.001), all of which occurred significantly more often in daptomycin-treated patients. Inpatient mortality occurred in 31 daptomycin- and 10 linezolid-treated patients (46.3% vs 29.4%; P = NS). Linear regression found that shock (P = 0.015), infective endocarditis (P = 0.021), and concurrent rifampin or gentamicin treatment (P = 0.01) were associated with prolonged duration of positive cultures. Logistic regression revealed that shock (odds ratio [OR] = 14.24; P = 0.008), infection with Enterococcus faecium (OR = 53.10; P = 0.024), previous linezolid treatment (OR = 6.63; P = 0.031), concurrent rifampin or gentamicin treatment (OR = 6.48; P = 0.046), and a nonline source of infection (OR = 6.67; P = 0.019) were associated with increased mortality.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort analysis, there were no significant differences in mortality of VRE BSI between patients receiving daptomycin or linezolid. Underlying comorbidities appeared to best predict outcome; however, given the retrospective nature of this study, larger, prospective, randomized, comparative studies are needed to control for potential biases and determine definitive outcome differences between these 2 antimicrobials.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^0b65ff30]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Enterococcus faecium bacteremia… [^4976579d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Therapy recorded for E faecium bacteremia included information on the dosage and duration of all antimicrobial agents used. Documentation was made if single, dual, or no drug therapy was attempted. Data were also collected if other interventions were made in attempt to treat the infection and/or bacteremia. Aminoglycoside use was also associated with the development of VRE bacteremia. There were no significant differences between the enterococcal bacteremia groups observed with the use of third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, or fluoroquinolones. With respect to treatment, patients with VRE bacteremia were just as likely to receive some form of specific antimicrobial agent therapy as their VSE counterparts: 15 vs 24 patients, respectively.

Combination therapy, usually with a β-lactam antibiotic or vancomycin plus an aminoglycoside, was given equally to the patients of both groups. Not surprisingly, use of vancomycin therapy was significantly higher in the VSE group, with 18 patients with VSE receiving this agent compared with 4 patients with VRE. Ampicillin, given at high doses as a continuous infusion, was used more frequently in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by VRE. Unconventional and investigational therapies, such as a combination product of quinupristin and dalfopristin, 25 an experimental streptogramin, were used to treat patients in the VRE group. Central venous catheter removal as an additional therapy was significantly more common in patients with VRE bacteremia. There was no difference in surgical debridement of infected tissue between the 2 groups.

A reasonable alternative to immediate institution of unconventional antimicrobial therapy is to observe these patients, repeat cultures, and perform other conservative measures, such as the removal or replacement of intravenous and urinary catheters. More aggressive therapeutic measures can then be undertaken if additional blood cultures are positive. In addition to the high mortality, we demonstrated substantial additional hospitalization costs associated with VRE bacteremia. In today's health care environment, understanding the financial impact of this multidrug-resistant organism is crucial since controlling infection with VRE becomes both medically necessary and economically important.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0f36364d]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

A recent global point prevalence survey of infections in 1,265 intensive care units (ICUs) documented bloodstream infection (BSI) among 15% of patients, and this rate may be increasing over time because of increased use of immunosuppressive drugs, invasive procedures, and older patients who have concomitant medical conditions and who are admitted to intensive care. These infections are a major contributor to patient morbidity and are associated with a doubling or even tripling of mortality. Mortality rates may be higher if delayed or ineffective initial antimicrobial therapy is prescribed, and so it is difficult to reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use in the initial empiric phase of treatment in this vulnerable patient population. In contrast, it may be more feasible to reduce antibiotic use at the back end of treatment courses. Up to half of the antibiotic use in hospital wards and critical care units is unnecessary or inappropriate, and excessive durations of treatment are the greatest contributor to inappropriate use. A reduction in the length of antibiotic courses is, therefore, a potentially viable strategy to minimize the consequences of antibiotic overuse in critical care, including antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, Clostridium difficile colitis, and costs.

The optimal duration of therapy for primary BSI and BSI secondary to major organ system infections has been poorly defined. A review of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of infections most commonly encountered in the critical care setting - including guidelines for community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), pyelonephritis, and skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) - provides no guidance about the optimal duration of therapy for the subset of patients with bacteremia. In the absence of high-grade evidence, there is wide variability in antibiotic treatment duration recommendations from infectious disease and critical care specialists, and the presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for extended courses of antibiotic therapy regardless of the observed clinical response to treatment. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining duration of therapy in several organ system infections have demonstrated that treatment can be shortened to 1 week or less without worsening patient outcomes, so it is plausible that treatment duration could potentially be shortened for BSIs as well.

### Aminoglycosides for infective endocarditis: time to say goodbye? [^f2e9c585]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Based on experimental studies showing synergism with β-lactams and glycopeptides, aminoglycosides have long been considered essential in the treatment of infective endocarditis (IE). However, their use is associated with a high risk of renal failure, especially in elderly patients.

Aims

The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the evidence to support reducing or even avoiding the use of aminoglycosides for the treatment of IE. We also analysed data supporting the use of aminoglycosides in specific subgroup of IE patients.

Sources

PubMed database was searched up to July 2019 to identify relevant studies.

Contents

Recent European Guidelines reduced the use of aminoglycosides in IE, no longer recommended in Staphylococcus aureus native-valve IE, and shortened to 2 weeks for IE related to Enterococcus faecalis and streptococci with penicillin MIC > 0.125 μg/mL. In addition, an alternative regimen without aminoglycosides (ampicillin or amoxicillin plus ceftriaxone) is proposed for E. faecalis. Observational studies suggested that gentamicin would not be necessary in the case of staphylococcal prosthetic valve IE as long as rifampicin is maintained. Recent clinical studies showed that for streptococcal IE, gentamicin could be restricted to isolates with penicillin MIC > 0.5 μg/mL. For the empirical and definitive treatment of E. faecalis IE, amoxicillin or ampicillin plus ceftriaxone may be considered, irrespective of high-level of aminoglycoside resistance.

Implications

In a scenario of progressive increase in the age and frailty of IE patients, the use of aminoglycosides can be reduced or avoided in ~90% cases. This should result in reduced incidence of renal failure, an important prognostic factor in IE.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^64e14735]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The strength of our study is its multicentric and exhaustive aspect: inclusion of most hospitals, including all referral centers, in a large area; and the pragmatic approach for evaluation of treatment efficacy considering the antibiotic regimen really received by the patient. The limitations of this study are mainly inherent to its retrospective design, leading to missing data, significant proportion of patients lost to follow-up, and impossibility to fully control confounding factors in treatment effects despite multivariate analysis. The low number of relapses and of patients treated with amoxicillin alone leads to a lack of power in the analysis of treatment efficacy. The definition of acute kidney failure did not allow a reliable assessment of this complication. Finally, we did not evaluate the role of serum concentrations of antibiotics, which could be interesting to better understand the mechanisms of relapse.

### Length of hospital stay for endocarditis before and after the partial oral treatment of endocarditis trial [^a336fbed]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The results from the POET (Partial Oral Treatment of left-sided Endocarditis) trial were published in August 2018 and established noninferiority of oral step-down antibiotic treatment in stabilized patients with infective endocarditis (IE). Data on length of hospital stay (LOS) and safety following the POET trial are warranted.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to examine changes in LOS and safety (mortality and relapse of bacteremia) before and after POET publication.

Methods

Using Danish nationwide registries, patients with first-time IE caused by Streptococcus spp. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci from 2012 to 2021 were identified. Median LOS was examined according to publication date (before and after September 2018). Mortality and relapse of bacteremia at 180 days of follow-up were examined.

Results

We identified 3,008 patients before POET publication (median age 72.8 years) and 1,740 after publication (median age 75.2 years) (P < 0.0001). The median LOS decreased by 8 days: 41 days (Q1-Q3: 29–49 days) before POET publication and 33 days (Q1-Q3: 21–44 days) after POET publication (P < 0.0001). Similar reductions in LOS were seen across microbiological etiologies and age groups. Reduction in LOS was most pronounced in nonsurgically treated patients. Mortality from IE admission to a maximum of 180 days' follow-up was 27.5% before POET publication and 28.3% after publication (P = 0.41). The bacteremia relapse rate within 180 days was 3.5% before POET publication and 1.6% after publication (P = 0.0002).

Conclusions

Following the POET trial, we found a reduction in median LOS of 8 days with no change in mortality and an associated lower rate of relapse of bacteremia.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^93fa2f31]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis identified only one RCT examining shorter versus longer duration of antibiotic therapy exclusively for patients with bacteremia and a further 23 trials among patients with the infectious syndromes that are most commonly associated with bacteremia in the ICU. No significant difference in cure or survival was detected for bacteremic patients receiving shorter- versus longer-duration therapy. These data indicate that shorter-duration therapy may be effective for BSIs but also highlight the need for a larger, high-quality trial dedicated to this question.

The only trial randomly assigning exclusively patients with bacteremia, rather than an identified infectious syndrome, was conducted in a severely ill neonatal population. The main finding of this trial was that overall outcomes were not significantly different for neonates receiving shorter- versus longer-duration antibiotics. A high rate of failure was seen among the small number of patients receiving short-duration treatment for S. aureus bacteremia, and this is consistent with the findings of some prior retrospective studies and current treatment guidelines for this pathogen; yet other studies support short-course therapy for catheter-associated S. aureus bacteremia. This review highlights the potential importance of considering S. aureus bacteremia separately from other pathogens in the context of adequately powered trials in the future.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^ca0d435c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In neonates and infants < 2 months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. group B streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical IV ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal UTI by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered with maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancyor maternal ESBL-E cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates, although if unable to access these, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

Antibiotic Duration and Timing of IV to Oral Switch

For most children with cUTI, there is not enough evidence to support varying from current practice and expert opinion recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D).
When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D).
Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal USS is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B).
For frequently relapsing UTI with the same organism, investigations should assess for an ongoing focal source of infection (GRADE D).
Shorter total durations (6–9 days) and a single dose IV component show early promise, but prospective studies are needed with more children with complicated UTI (GRADES C and D).

### Expert consensus recommendations for the provision of infective endocarditis services: updated guidance from the joint British societies [^166910ee]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

IE 'alerts'

A 'multidisciplinary alert for endocarditis' has been described in which comprehensive patient assessment was triggered by physicians appointed to monitor for clinical, microbiological and echocardiographic suspicions of IE. This process was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.71), but the study compared outcomes to historical controls, was at high risk of bias and failed to describe the nature of comprehensive patient assessment. Analysis of a period of ID review of all bacteraemic patients compared with a prior period without consultation was associated with increased diagnosis of IE, although this study was at high risk of bias. In single-centre cohort studies of patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, ID consultation was associated with higher rates of echocardiography in two studiesand lower mortality rates in one. Similarly, in a retrospective cohort study of patients with at least one blood culture positive for Enterococcus spp. patients with an ID consultation were more likely to undergo repeat cultures to ensure clearance (99% vs 74%, p < 0.001), echocardiography (79% vs 45%, p < 0.001), surgical intervention (20% vs 7%, p = 0.01) and receive antibiotics for an appropriate duration (90% vs 46%, p < 0.001).

IE guidelines and protocols

One study evaluated the introduction of a local consensus IE 'protocol' that included recommendations for microbiological investigation, antibiotic treatment and surgical intervention. In multivariable analysis, mortality was reduced in the period using the protocol when compared with a prior control period (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.76). Introduction of a hospital-wide protocol for the management of S. aureus bacteraemia was associated with increased rates of echocardiography and IE diagnosis (with no impact on survival), although this study was at serious risk of bias.

### Pharmacokinetics and safety of ceftobiprole in pediatric patients [^504c3aa4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Ceftobiprole is the active moiety of the prodrug ceftobiprole medocaril and is an advanced-generation intravenous (IV) cephalosporin with broad activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. – It is approved for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, excluding ventilator-associated pneumonia, and community-acquired pneumonia in adults in many European and non-European countries. Ceftobiprole is currently under investigation to support a New Drug Application in adults in the United States for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and S. aureus bacteremia, including infective endocarditis. The spectrum of activity and well-established safety profile of ceftobiprole make it an attractive candidate for the treatment of infections in the pediatric population.

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ceftobiprole have been established in adults in both healthy volunteers and infected patients. – In adults, ceftobiprole exhibits linear PK across a broad range of IV doses and exhibits limited accumulation with repeated dosing because of its short half life (T 1/2) of approximately 3 hours. Ceftobiprole undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism and is rapidly eliminated, primarily unchanged, by glomerular filtration, with 80–90% of the dose recovered in urine. The primary metabolite is the β-lactam ring-opened hydrolysis product (open-ring metabolite), which accounts for 5% of the dose recovered in urine; systemic exposure of the open-ring metabolite accounts for 4% of ceftobiprole exposure following single-dose administration. Although several patient characteristics have been identified as predictive of the interindividual variability in ceftobiprole PK in adults (eg, infected vs healthy, sex, body weight), only renal function is considered clinically relevant such that dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Similar to other β-lactam antibiotics, the duration of time after dose that free-drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an infecting organism (fT > MIC) is the main pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) index.

### Duration of antimicrobial treatment for bacteremia in Canadian critically ill patients [^63709300]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The optimum duration of antimicrobial treatment for patients with bacteremia is unknown. Our objectives were to determine duration of antimicrobial treatment provided to patients who have bacteremia in ICUs, to assess pathogen/patient factors related to treatment duration, and to assess the relationship between treatment duration and survival.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Settings

Fourteen ICUs across Canada.

Patients

Patients with bacteremia and were present in the ICU at the time culture reported positive.

Interventions

Duration of antimicrobial treatment for patients who had bacteremia in ICU.

Measurements and Main Results

Among 1,202 ICU patients with bacteremia, the median duration of treatment was 14 days, but with wide variability (interquartile range, 9–17.5). Most patient characteristics were not associated with treatment duration. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the only pathogens associated with shorter treatment (odds ratio, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.51–5.26). The urinary tract was the only source of infection associated with a trend toward lower likelihood of shorter treatment (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42–1.08); an unknown source of infection was associated with a greater likelihood of shorter treatment (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.17–3.91). The association of treatment duration and survival was unstable when analyzed based on timing of death.

Conclusions

Critically ill patients who have bacteremia typically receive long courses of antimicrobials. Most patient/pathogen characteristics are not associated with treatment duration; survivor bias precludes a valid assessment of the association between treatment duration and survival. A definitive randomized controlled trial is needed to compare shorter versus longer antimicrobial treatment in patients who have bacteremia.

### Bacteraemia with gram-positive bacteria-when and how do I need to look for endocarditis? [^4227e39c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with bacteraemia caused by gram-positive bacteria are at risk for infective endocarditis (IE). Because IE needs long antibiotic treatment and sometimes heart valve surgery, it is very important to identify patients with IE.

Objectives

In this narrative review we present and discuss how to determine which investigations to detect IE that are needed in individual patients with gram-positive bacteraemia.

Sources

Published original studies and previous reviews in English, within the relevant field are used.

Content

First, the different qualities of the bacteraemia in relation to IE risk are discussed. The risk for IE in bacteraemia is related to the species of the bacterium but also to monomicrobial bacteraemia and the number of positive cultures. Second, patient-related factors for IE risk in bacteraemia are presented. Next, the risk stratification systems to determine the risk for IE in gram-positive bacteraemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis are presented and their use is discussed. In the last part of the review, an account for the different modalities of IE-investigations is given. The main focus is on echocardiography, which is the cornerstone of IE-investigations. Furthermore, 18 F-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography and cardiac computed tomography are presented and their use is also discussed. A brief account for investigations used to identify embolic phenomena in IE is also given. Finally, we present a flowchart suggesting which investigations to perform in relation to IE in patients with gram-positive bacteraemia.

Implications

For the individual patient as well as the healthcare system, it is important both to diagnose IE and to decide when to stop looking for IE. This review might be helpful in finding that balance.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^017ddc97]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Relapses after treatment of EFIE are frequent, may be asymptomatic, and can occur more than 1 year after the initial episode. We showed that the choice of ceftriaxone or gentamicin as combined antibiotics does not seem to have an impact on the risk of relapse. Although our results should be interpreted with caution given the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of power arising from the rarity of relapses, our findings suggest that treatment with amoxicillin monotherapy should not be used in this indication. We also showed that surgery associated with antibiotic therapy is the best way to prevent relapse. Thus, non-operated patients with EFIE should particularly undergo careful clinical and biological observation, including systematic drawing of blood cultures, during extended follow-up.

### VRE and VSE bacteremia outcomes in the era of effective VRE therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^72971a7e]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Literature Search

The literature searches identified 4,878 citations; among these, 155 citations were chosen for full-text review, and 20 studies were determined to meet our inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Of these, 1 study did not indicate a study period and 5 studies reported study periods between January 1997 and January 2000 and required confirmation of VRE therapies within each study. Corresponding authors were contacted, but administered VRE therapy information could not be obtained and all 7 studies were excluded from the review. Excluded study details are provided in Supplemental Table 3. Therefore, 13 studies were included in the systematic review.

Figure 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) flowchart of the literature search and study selection.

Description of Studies

The study characteristics of all included studies are outlined in Table 1. All were observational and retrospective studies, 12 of which were conducted between January 2000 and December 2011, following the formal regulatory approval of the first effective VRE therapy. – The study by da Silva et alreported a study period between September 1998 and December 2008. However, these authors confirmed that all patients with VRE bacteremia were diagnosed after January 2000. Billington et alsampled all residents within a Canadian health zone who developed enterococcal bloodstream infections. We contacted these authors to obtain mortality and LOS information for study participants. In addition, 8 studies exclusively sampled adult patients within tertiary care hospital settings, –, and 4 of these studies were limited to immunocompromised patient populations, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients or chemotherapy recipients.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^f72020f7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

### VRE and VSE bacteremia outcomes in the era of effective VRE therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^45445e78]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND

Prior data suggest that vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia is associated with worse outcomes than vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus (VSE) bacteremia. However, many studies evaluating such outcomes were conducted prior to the availability of effective VRE therapies.

OBJECTIVE

To systematically review VRE and VSE bacteremia outcomes among hospital patients in the era of effective VRE therapy.

METHODS

Electronic databases and grey literature published between January 1997 and December 2014 were searched to identify all primary research studies comparing outcomes of VRE and VSE bacteremias among hospital patients, following the availability of effective VRE therapies. The primary outcome was all-cause, in-hospital mortality, while total hospital length of stay (LOS) was a secondary outcome. All meta-analyses were conducted in Review Manager 5.3 using random-effects, inverse variance modeling.

RESULTS

Among all the studies reviewed, 12 cohort studies and 1 case control study met inclusion criteria. Similar study designs were combined in meta-analyses for mortality and LOS. VRE bacteremia was associated with increased mortality compared with VSE bacteremia among cohort studies (odds ratio [OR], 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38–2.35; I² = 0%; n = 11); the case-control study estimate was similar, but not significant (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.97–3.82). LOS was greater for VRE bacteremia patients than for VSE bacteremia patients (mean difference, 5.01 days; 95% CI, 0.58–9.44]; I² = 0%; n = 5).

CONCLUSIONS

Despite the availability of effective VRE therapy, VRE bacteremia remains associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and LOS when compared to VSE bacteremia.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^7fc05cff]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (antibiotic therapy, enterococci), ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to administer the combination of ampicillin or amoxicillin with ceftriaxone for 6 weeks or with gentamicin for 2 weeks using the following doses in pediatric patients with PVE or complicated NVE or > 3 months of symptoms due to non-high-level aminoglycoside-resistant Enterococcus species:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Ampicillin|- 300 mg/kg/day IV in 4–6 equally divided doses|
|Amoxicillin|- 100–200 mg/kg/day IV in 4–6 doses|
|Ceftriaxone|- 100 mg/kg/day IV in 2 doses|
|Gentamicin|- 3 mg/kg/day IV or IM in 3 equally divided doses.|

### Clinical outcomes of daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia [^aed6b111]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

In light of recent evidence suggesting enhancement of daptomycin activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) by ampicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics, we evaluated the safety profile and clinical efficacy of daptomycin with and without concomitant β-lactam antimicrobials in the treatment of VRE (faecium or faecalis) bacteremia from multiple centers across the United States.

Methods

Data were collected retrospectively as part of a larger multicenter registry (The Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience). Efficacy and clinical outcomes in patients with VRE bacteremia who received at least 3 days of daptomycin with or without concomitant β-lactams were analyzed. Although all the cases involved daptomycin-susceptible VRE, additional analysis was performed to examine whether the adjunctive β-lactam would play a more pivotal role in cases where the daptomycin MIC was in the upper limit of the susceptibility range, indicating that daptomycin monotherapy efficacy may be relatively compromised compared with cases with lower daptomycin MICs.

Findings

Two hundred sixty-two patients from 33 hospitals were evaluated. Most patients had at least one significant comorbidity, such as solid-organ or bone marrow transplantation (16%), neutropenia (36%), dialysis dependency (20%), or critical illness (36%) requiring care in an intensive care unit. Overall treatment success was 86% (n = 225/262), and treatment success for patients taking concomitant β-lactams was 86% (n = 105/122). Logistic regression identified treatment failure to be associated with sepsis (odds ratio = 3.42; P = 0.009) and an elevated daptomycin MIC (3–4 µg/mL) (odds ratio = 3.23, P = 0.013). No significant increase in clinical failure was seen among patients with elevated daptomycin MIC who received concomitant β-lactam therapy (clinical success, 88% vs 79% for MIC ≤ 2 vs 3–4 µg/mL, respectively; P = 0.417). Of 262 patients, 33 (13%) experienced ≥ 1 adverse event possibly related to daptomycin (increased creatine kinase in 8 patients).

Implications

Overall, daptomycin was effective and well tolerated for VRE bacteremia, with lower effectiveness noted with daptomycin MIC of 3 to 4 µg/mL. Concomitant β-lactam therapy with daptomycin may improve clinical outcomes in this setting. Further studies are needed to characterize the potential benefit of concomitant β-lactams with daptomycin.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bc9de796]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The eligible trials of treatment duration in pyelonephritis involved diverse patient populations, durations of treatment, and outcome measures, and this explains the heterogeneity of outcomes with shorter durations of therapy. Recently, the results of several RCTs have demonstrated short-course (5 or 7 days) fluoroquinolone therapy to be equally as efficacious as 10 to 14 days of treatment with comparator medications. IDSA guidelines were accordingly amended to recommend therapy for 7 days, but the issue of bacteremia was not explicitly addressed. Our data suggest that patients with bacteremia secondary to uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be successfully treated with shorter-duration therapy.

The sole trial of treatment duration in SSTI demonstrated that, in a carefully selected healthy adult population, a short duration of therapy was associated with a cure rate equal to that of a long duration of therapy. However, the explicit exclusion of patients with more serious infections, argues that it is unlikely that these data can be directly extrapolated to critically ill patients with bacteremic soft tissue infections.

The present review has several important limitations. The prespecified search strategy excluded unpublished data and non-English language trials. Of eligible trials, bias may have been introduced by low rates of blinding and use of placebo controls. Some studies included only patients with early clinical improvement for randomization to short- or long-course therapy; consequently, the effect size and findings may not be generalizable to sicker patient populations. Other trials excluded patients post-randomization or presented only per-protocol analyses and so may have excluded bacteremic patients failing therapy. Treatment outcomes for patients with bacteremia in individual studies were derived from small post hoc subgroup analyses. Finally, within individual infectious syndromes, significant variability was encountered both in study design and in the durations of therapy employed (with 14 days even considered shorter-course therapy in one study). However, the lack of outcome heterogeneity between syndromes suggests that it is valid to pool BSI data from multiple infectious foci into a single meta-analysis or enroll such patients within a single RCT.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fcbde3a2]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. We registered this review protocol in the Open Science Framework.

Eligible studies met the following criteria: (i) population: we included RCTs enrolling patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bloodstream infections via positive blood cultures and concurrent clinical symptoms attributable to the infection; (ii) intervention: eligible RCTs compared shorter-duration antibiotic regimens to longer-duration regimens, with a minimum difference of 3 days between treatment durations; (iii) comparison: the comparison did not require identical antibiotic agents or formulations across the two groups; (iv) outcomes: the outcomes included mortality, treatment failure, relapse, hospital re-admission, clinical cure, length of hospital stay, any adverse events (defined as any event with an onset occurring after the first administration of the investigational products or, if pre-existing, worsening after the first administration of investigational products, and occurring within the period of treatment with the investigational products), and serious adverse events (defined as per US FDA criteria).

We imposed no restrictions on the patient gender, age, or ethnicity, source of infection for bloodstream infections, severity of bloodstream infections, comorbidities, specific implicated organisms, type of antibiotics, dosage, or frequency. We excluded studies involving patients with severe immune suppression, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, or bacteremia that did not require active antibiotic therapy to ensure uniformity.

We developed a comprehensive search strategy in consultation with an experienced medical librarian (appendix text s1). We conducted searches in multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE (via Ovid; 1946–November 25, 2024), Embase (via Ovid; 1946–November 25, 2024), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 1996–November 25, 2024). We used controlled vocabulary (e.g. anti-bacterial agents, bacteremia, sepsis) and relevant keywords, such as "bloodstream infection", "macrolides", "beta-lactams", "quinolones" and "tetracyclines" into the search strategy. We manually screened reference lists of included studies and related reviews to identify additional potentially eligible articles.

### The changing landscape of uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia: a narrative review to guide inpatient management [^9c5f4d1c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Gram-negative bacteremia secondary to focal infection such as skin and soft-tissue infection, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or urinary tract infection is commonly encountered in hospital care. Current practice guidelines lack sufficient detail to inform evidence-based practices. Specifically, antimicrobial duration, criteria to transition from intravenous to oral step-down therapy, choice of oral antimicrobials, and reassessment of follow-up blood cultures are not addressed. The presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy regardless of infection source or clinical response. Antimicrobials are lifesaving but not benign. Prolonged antimicrobial exposure is associated with adverse effects, increased rates of Clostridioides difficile infection, antimicrobial resistance, and longer hospital length of stay. Emerging evidence supports shorter overall duration of antimicrobial treatment and earlier transition to oral agents among patients with uncomplicated Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia who have achieved adequate source control and demonstrated clinical stability and improvement. After appropriate initial treatment with an intravenous antimicrobial, transition to highly bioavailable oral agents should be considered for total treatment duration of 7 days. Routine follow-up blood cultures are not cost-effective and may result in unnecessary healthcare resource utilization and inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Clinicians should incorporate these principles into the management of gram-negative bacteremia in the hospital.

### Treatment of central line-associated bloodstream infections [^20b4146a]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Empirical treatment should be initiated promptly, before confirmation of the diagnosis, after appropriate cultures have been obtained. The choice is based on host characteristics, known or suspected colonization with resistant microorganisms and local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns. In general, reasonable coverage is required for common Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Parenteral vancomycin (or daptomycin in patients with acute renal failure or when organisms have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin) is the cornerstone of an empirical regime in settings with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Otherwise, an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is enough. Antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacilli include β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. Agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa are required in cases of neutropaenia, severity of disease or increased probability or known prior colonization. New anti-Gram negative antibiotics are indicated for infections due to multi-drug resistant Gram-negative organisms.

Empiric coverage for candidaemia should be considered if multiple sites are colonized with Candida or for patients with bone marrow or organ transplants, hematologic malignancy, femoral catheterization or when patients are receiving total parenteral nutrition or prolonged administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Parenteral echinocandins are recommended when resistance to azoles is suspected (prior exposure to azoles in the previous 3 months or high prevalence of common non- albicans Candida such as Candida glabrata or Candida krusei). Otherwise, intravenous fluconazole is enough.

Once antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are available, de-escalation to appropriate therapy with the narrowest spectrum possible is recommended. The duration of treatment depends on the organism involved and the presence of complications or not, and varies between 7 days to 6 weeks.

For uncomplicated infection (i.e. not associated with suppurative thrombosis, endocarditis or metastatic infection) with septic manifestations resolving within 72 h of catheter removal, intravenous antimicrobial therapy is recommended for the following duration based on the organism isolated (Fig. 1):
Staphylococcus aureus: 14 days
Coagulase-negative staphylococci: 7 days
Enterococci and Gram-negative bacilli: 10 to 14 days
Candida: 14 days

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^437f4959]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infection

Three randomized trials examined duration of antibiotic therapy in intra-abdominal infection. The first randomly assigned 90 adult patients with community-acquired localized secondary intra-abdominal infections of mild to moderate severity to 3 or at least 5 days (mean of 5.7 days and range of 5 to 10 days) of postoperative ertapenem. Patients were included if symptoms and leukocytosis had improved by day 3. Clinical cure was achieved in 39 out of 42 patients (92.9%) receiving shorter therapy and in 43 out of 48 (89.6%) receiving longer therapy. Although blood cultures were drawn when 'clinically indicated', the prevalence of bacteremia and outcomes in patients with bacteremia were not reported.

Two unblinded randomized trials compared 5 versus 10 days of cephalosporin therapy in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). All patients underwent blood cultures at enrollment. In one trial, 26 out of 90 (28.9%) were bacteremic, and no significant difference in survival was observed for shorter (43 out of 43) versus longer (45 out of 47) treatment. Infection-related mortality among bacteremic patients treated for 5 days (0%) and 10 days (11.8%) was not significantly different. In the second trial, 14 out of 50 (28%) were bacteremic, and no significant difference in outcome was observed; 83.3% of short-arm and 87.5% of long-arm patients survived their infections. Secondary outcomes of relapse and hospitalization mortality were also similar between treatment arms and for bacteremic subgroups.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^8993a770]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration determinants — best practice statement (BPS): We recommend determining duration by site of infection, microbial etiology, response to treatment, and ability to achieve source control (BPS). The text notes there is no evidence that severity of sepsis determines optimal duration and no data that organ dysfunction or higher initial illness severity necessitates longer therapy for specific infection types. Duration can differ by site due to pathogen burden, penetration, or biofilms; longer courses are typically required for endocarditis, undrained abscesses, and prosthetic joint infection without device removal. Examples include that 7–10 days of therapy is appropriate for uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia in immunocompetent hosts, whereas uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia requires a longer course, and therapy in neutropenic pediatric cancer patients is often continued until resolution of neutropenia.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^a0a0687c]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Although vancomycin is the first-line antibiotic for MRSA bacteremia treatment, it has a relatively slow onset of bactericidal activity and poorly penetrates some tissues. While US guidelines recommend a fixed dose, European guidelines advise dosing vancomycin based on the trough plasma concentration (C min) with the goal to achieve a vancomycin area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio ≥ 400 for as long as possible throughout the 24-h dosing interval. However, recent evidence suggests C min is not an accurate surrogate for 24-h vancomycin exposure, underestimating the area under the curve by up to 25%. In an analysis of MRSA bacteremia cases that received vancomycin, those who achieved a C min of 15 to 20 mg/L within 72 h had a significantly lower rate of vancomycin failure compared with lower C min values, but 40% of patients who had a C min in the recommended range still did not. This may reflect the observed slow increase in the MIC (MIC creep) of vancomycin from the 1990s to the present, whereby higher doses are needed to maintain efficacy. Reports conflict on the correlation between vancomycin MICs > 1.5 mg/L and treatment failure in MRSA bacteremia. Additionally, individual studies may be affected by the method used to determine MIC (Etest or broth microdilution) or by duration of storage of isolates. Another concern of using higher doses of vancomycin is the potential for nephrotoxicity, a risk factor for mortality in SAB. In a recent meta-analysis, continuous infusion of vancomycin was associated with less risk of nephrotoxicity compared to intermittent infusion, but no significant difference was found for mortality. However, Echeverria-Esnal et al. highlight factors that affect vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity not considered in the individual studies, and suggest a multicenter randomized trial is needed to resolve the inconsistencies.

### Brief communication: treatment of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis with ampicillin plus ceftriaxone [^24a9c7cb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) that precludes bactericidal synergism with penicillins or glycopeptides and nephrotoxicity related to aminoglycoside treatment are major problems in treating Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for treating endocarditis due to E. faecalis with and without HLAR.

Design

Observational, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter clinical trial.

Setting

13 centers in Spain.

Patients

21 patients with HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis and 22 patients with non-HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis. All were at risk for nephrotoxicity related to aminoglycoside use.

Intervention

6-week course of intravenous ampicillin, 2 g every 4 hours, plus intravenous ceftriaxone, 2 g every 12 hours.

Measurements

Clinical and microbiological outcomes.

Results

The clinical cure rate at 3 months was 67.4% (29 of 43 patients) among all episodes. During treatment, 28.6% of patients with HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis and 18.2% of patients with non-HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis died of infection-related causes. The rate of clinical and microbiological cure in patients who completed the protocol was 100% in the HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis group. No episodes of breakthrough bacteremia occurred, although there were 2 relapses in the non-HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis group. Treatment was withdrawn in 1 case because of fever and skin rash.

Limitations

The study had a small sample and was observational.

Conclusion

The combination of ampicillin and ceftriaxone is effective and safe for treating HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis and could be a reasonable alternative for patients with non-HLAR E. faecalis endocarditis who are at increased risk for nephrotoxicity.

### Treatment of dialysis catheter-related Enterococcus bacteremia with an antibiotic lock: a quality improvement report [^f0f4c143]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is a frequent complication of tunneled dialysis catheters, and Enterococcus is a common infecting organism. CRB may be treated by instilling an antibiotic lock into the catheter lumen in conjunction with systemic antibiotics. The efficacy of this approach in Enterococcus bacteremia is unknown.

Design

Quality improvement report.

Setting & Participants

64 catheter-dependent hemodialysis outpatients with vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus bacteremia treated with a uniform antibiotic lock protocol. Clinical outcomes were tracked prospectively. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLANS: Patients received intravenous vancomycin for 3 weeks in conjunction with a vancomycin lock instilled into both catheter lumens after each dialysis session.

Measures

Treatment failure was defined as persistent fever 48 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy or recurrent Enterococcus bacteremia within 90 days. A clinical cure was defined as fever resolution without recurrent bacteremia. Major infection-related complications within 6 months were documented.

Results

Treatment failure occurred in 25 patients (39%) because of persistent fever in 10 and recurrent bacteremia in 15. Treatment success occurred in 39 patients (61%). A serious complication of Enterococcus CRB occurred in 4 of 64 patients (6%); endocarditis in 1 and osteomyelitis in 3. The frequency of serious complications was 16% (4 of 25 patients) in those with treatment failure compared with 0% (0 of 39 patients) in those with treatment success (P = 0.01).

Limitations

This was a single-center study. We did not measure serum vancomycin.

Conclusions

An antibiotic lock protocol permits catheter salvage in 61% of hemodialysis patients with Enterococcus CRB. Serious complications occur in 6% of patients and are more common in those with treatment failure.

### Interpreting blood culture results as early guidance for infective endocarditis [^484ae384]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

We found not only that the number of positive blood culture bottles on presentation and days of bacteremia are associated with one's pretest probability for IE, but also that these associations varied by pathogen (ie, MSSA, MRSA, E faecalis, and low-risk and high-risk streptococcal species). Both factors can be used within the first 48 to 72 hours of a patient's hospitalization to help guide further diagnostics, antibiotic duration, and reduce hospital length of stay. All species had significant negative LRs if only 1 of 4 blood culture bottles was positive on admission. This includes S aureus, challenging the current practice that every patient with S aureus community-acquired bacteremia requires a transthoracic echocardiogram for further work-up. All organisms except streptococci had statistically significant negative LRs if blood cultures cleared by day 2. It was also evident that, as we would expect, if bacteremia persisted for 2 or more days, the positive LRs for IE were significant. Of note, for all streptococcal species, owing to the nature of the organism itself, 97% IE cases and 99% control cases cleared within 2 days, and 100% within 3 days.

Limitations

The primary limitation of our study is its retrospective nature, which makes it prone to various forms of bias, such as selection, information, and confounding bias. However, prospective evaluation of such criteria is complex to design and implement. Also, not all control patients underwent echocardiography for IE evaluation, which we believe reflects a pragmatic clinical practice utilization of resources based on clinical suspicion. Moreover, our subanalysis for these patients had results similar to those for all cases. It was also not surprising that the IE cohort had more individuals with prosthetic valves and history of injection drug use, because these are known risk factors for IE and are incorporated in the Duke criteria. Furthermore, the use of data from multiple sites, the relatively large sample size, and the detailed nature of the medical record reviews, including multiple individuals verifying the information, provide reassurance that the findings are valid and generalizable.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^a576c443]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^873bd4c2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy of up to 21 days for VAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was used historically until several prospective studies demonstrated the effectiveness of shorter (7–8 days) therapy with no differences in mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation-free days or organ failure-free days. The 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines and the 2016 IDSA guidelines both recommend 7 days of therapy for HAP/VAP. Ongoing studies are determining if therapy duration could be reduced further.

Bacteremia caused by Enterobacterales has been treated traditionally with 2 weeks of antibiotics. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses investigating shorter (7–8 days) versus longer antibiotic courses (14–15 days) in patients with gram-negative bacteremia (mostly of urinary tract origin) demonstrate non-inferiority. Regarding acute uncomplicated cellulitis, evidence also suggests that prolonged courses may be unnecessary and that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient. IDSA guidelines recommend a 5-day antibiotic therapy duration for uncomplicated cellulitis, but may be extended if the infection has not improved within that time frame.

Generally, in critically ill patients, decisions about antibiotic therapy duration should be individualized, taking into account patient parameters such as severity of illness, the site and type of infection, whether source control has been achieved, whether PK has been optimized, and clinical response. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy in the ICU. PCT-guided treatment can reduce the duration of therapy and length of hospital stay in adult critically ill patients with sepsis. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest using PCT along with a clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antibiotics in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if PCT is available.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6adfba45]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, while our data suggest that longer durations of antibiotics are not necessary for uncomplicated blood stream infections they should not be extrapolated to situations including Staph aureus bacteraemia, prosthetic joint infections, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or unresolved source control where longer duration is the standard of care. Secondly, our pre-specified age-stratified subgroup analysis (neonates versus adults) demonstrated no statistically significant interaction effect, indicating consistent treatment effects across age groups within the analyzed evidence base. This consistency was further supported by our bacterial categorization subgroup analysis (Gram-negative versus Gram-negative/positive), which showed no significant heterogeneity, mitigating concerns about pathogen-related confounding. Notably, the findings of our study regarding Gram-negative bloodstream infections are similar with those of a recent meta-analysis. Therefore, due to population-specific pharmacodynamic considerations and the potential presence of infections caused by uncommon or resistant pathogens, cautious interpretation is required regarding its generalizability to neonates or infections caused by special pathogens. Thirdly, there was limited data available for some pre-specified subgroup analyses. Additionally, there is currently a lack of data on the type of infecting organisms, sources of infection, and whether changes in antibiotic treatment. Especially, the lack of data on bloodstream infections occurring in the context of severe infections limits the generalizability of our findings to such patients, warranting caution in their application. The definitions of outcomes such as treatment failure, relapse, and clinical cure were not always consistent across trials. Reassuringly, these variations did not lead to significant heterogeneity. Given that fewer than 10 studies for a certain outcome, we were unable to assess publication bias. While we made efforts to include all eligible studies, the possibility of publication bias affecting the stability of the results cannot be fully excluded. For mortality and treatment failure with zero-event studies, we applied a continuity correction of 0.5 for trials reporting no events. Nonetheless, our results remained consistent in sensitivity analyses after excluding zero-event studies. Moreover, interpretation of mean length of stay should be made with caution, as potential skewness in the underlying data-especially from studies with small sample sizes-may limit the accuracy of pooled estimates.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^6db3f1fd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) is characterized by a higher frequency of relapses than other infective endocarditis. The role of the treatment on its occurrence remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the antibiotic regimen could impact the risk of relapse in EFIE.

Materials

This was a multicenter retrospective study of patients diagnosed with definite EFIE between 2015 and 2019 in 14 French hospitals. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of relapses within the year following endocarditis diagnosis. As death was a competing risk for relapse, Fine and Gray models were used for studying risk factors and impact of treatment.

Results

Of the 279 patients included, 83 (29.7%) received the amoxicillin-gentamicin (A-G) combination, 114 (40.9%) amoxicillin-ceftriaxone (A-C), 63 (22.6%) A-G and A-C (A-G/A-C) sequentially, 9 (3.2%) amoxicillin (A), and 10 received other treatments. One-year-relapse rate was 9.3% (26 patients). Relapse occurred after a median delay of 107 days from EFIE diagnosis; 6 occurred after 6 months, and 6 were diagnosed by blood cultures in asymptomatic patients. In multivariate analysis, surgery during treatment was a protective factor against one-year relapse and death.

The cumulative incidence of relapse 1 year after endocarditis was 46.2% for patients treated with amoxicillin, 13.4% with A-G, 14.7% with A-C, and 4.3% with A-G/A-C (P ≥ .05 in multivariate analysis).

Conclusions

Relapses after treatment of EFIE are frequent, frequently asymptomatic, and may occur more than 6 months after the initial episode.

### Antimicrobial treatment duration for uncomplicated bloodstream infections in critically ill children: a multicentre observational study [^63898fe9]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Our finding that BSIs in critically ill children are treated for a median of 15 (IQR 11–25) days is comparable to a similar study conducted in critically ill adults who received a median treatment duration of 14 (IQR 9–17.5) days. Since children have different underlying diseases and comorbidities as well as age-related differences in susceptibilities and exposures to different infections compared to adults, we usually expect clinical practices to be different between the management of critically ill children and adults. Nevertheless, our study results, together with those of the adult study, reveal that most BSIs are being treated for at least two weeks in both adult and pediatric critically ill patients.

We also observed considerable variability in overall treatment durations both within and between different PICUs across Canada. The practice variations and the lack of substantial differences seen in treatment duration across most patient, pathogen and infection characteristics suggests that uncertainty exists about the appropriate treatment duration for BSIs. Most studies on antimicrobial treatment duration for BSIs in neonates and children have focused on bacteremia related to specific syndromes or pathogens separately, such as meningitis, S. aureus or Gram negative organisms. The resulting evidence has mostly been graded as only sufficient to provide some or weak support for recommendations requiring care or caution if applied to practice. Observational studies, randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews comparing long- versus short-duration antibiotic therapy for bacteremia suggest that shorter treatment courses in neonates and children have similar clinical outcomes to longer treatments. Yet, there are also exceptions where longer duration therapy appears to be more appropriate, such as bacteremia caused by S. aureus or when indwelling central lines are not removed.
