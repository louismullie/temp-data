## Question

septic arthritis signs symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs and symptoms of septic arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic local and systemic clinical features and how they vary by joint and age. Then, I should verify key diagnostic limitations of clinical examination alone and emphasize synovial fluid analysis. Next, I will review imaging pathways for superficial and deep joints. After that, I should confirm risk factors, atypical presentations, and the spectrum of severity. Finally, I will link these findings to urgent management principles, including arthrocentesis, empiric therapy, and follow-up metrics to detect treatment failure [^117Mq2Fh] [^111g4bQo].

> Let me first confirm the classic local picture. The hallmark remains acute monoarthritis with severe pain worsened by motion, visible or palpable effusion with swelling and warmth, erythema that may be muted in deep joints, and marked limitation of range of motion often with the joint held in a position of comfort, which together constitute the traditional inflammatory pentad and should immediately raise suspicion for septic arthritis [^117Mq2Fh] [^116ZQNFw].

> Wait, let me verify systemic features before overcalling fever as mandatory. Fever and malaise are common but not universal, and absence of fever should not reassure in immunosuppressed hosts, early presentations, less virulent organisms such as Kingella in young children, or prosthetic joint infections, so I need to ensure that lack of fever does not lower my index of suspicion in these settings [^117Mq2Fh] [^111mdCLr].

> Hold on, I should differentiate by population and joint involvement. In adults the knee is most frequently affected with the hip next in line, whereas in children the hip and knee predominate and refusal to bear weight or pseudoparalysis may be the presenting clue, and Kingella kingae in ages 6 to 48 months often produces subtler clinical and laboratory findings than Staphylococcus aureus so I should double-check my threshold for aspiration in that age band [^116RBLPi] [^115hyEHX] [^112cjJba].

> I need to check deep joint nuance because external signs can be minimal in the hip or shoulder. Let me first confirm that point-of-care ultrasound can quickly detect an effusion when the exam is equivocal in deeper joints, with radiographs useful as a baseline but often nondiagnostic, and that subsequent US or MRI or CT or image-guided aspiration is appropriate when initial films are normal yet suspicion remains high [^114pVYfF] [^11742Q7M] [^112LKpyg] [^111YJSv5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on exam alone. Multiple high-quality sources emphasize that clinical parameters by themselves cannot confirm or exclude septic arthritis, and the differential includes crystalline disease, rheumatoid flare, transient synovitis in children, postoperative inflammation, and other mimics, so I should confirm the diagnosis with synovial testing rather than relying on clinical gestalt alone [^117Mq2Fh] [^11381ew7] [^113FcXmw].

> Let me first confirm the central diagnostic step. Arthrocentesis with synovial fluid analysis is the gold standard and should be obtained prior to antibiotics when the patient is hemodynamically stable, including WBC with differential, Gram stain, culture in sterile tubes with any remaining fluid inoculated into blood culture bottles, and crystal analysis, recognizing that synovial WBC counts greater than 50,000 per microliter are suggestive but lower counts do not exclude infection and percent neutrophils lacks a definitive cutoff [^111g4bQo] [^116jwRca] [^1123kkjg] [^115UDJxC] [^113vvdJV].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify how thresholds behave in special populations. In immunosuppressed patients and with less virulent organisms the synovial WBC can be lower than classic teaching, so a value below 50,000 must not be used to rule out infection, and I should maintain a low threshold for aspiration and culture even when serum WBC or inflammatory markers are muted [^11381ew7] [^1168o1Qy].

> Next, I should review atypical postoperative and prosthetic contexts to avoid anchoring bias. Post-arthroscopy or prosthetic joint infections may present with subtle pain and swelling and are frequently misattributed to postoperative inflammation at first evaluation, so I need to ensure timely aspiration and avoid deferring diagnostics when symptoms persist or objective inflammatory markers rise [^116nciem] [^117Mq2Fh].

> Let me think about the severity spectrum and risk factors that heighten pretest probability. Presentations range from fulminant sepsis with rapid joint destruction to indolent low-grade symptoms, and risk factors include advanced age, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, recent joint surgery, skin infection, prosthetic material, and immunosuppressive therapy which should push me toward prompt aspiration and empiric coverage when present [^116ZQNFw] [^111bFfrC].

> I will now examine the imaging pathway to align workup with clinical urgency. Plain radiographs are reasonable early to screen for fracture, osteoarthritis, osteomyelitis, or implants and as a baseline for follow-up, but persistent diagnostic uncertainty should trigger ultrasound, MRI, or CT and image-guided aspiration with MRI favored when adjacent osteomyelitis or deep site involvement is suspected or when pediatric disease requires delineation of extent of infection [^111YJSv5] [^1164cqXm] [^11742Q7M] [^1149eE7k] [^113Z2vwV].

> Let me first confirm immediate procedural and laboratory steps when suspicion is high. Obtain synovial fluid urgently and send blood cultures before antibiotics if the patient is stable, because delays increase the risk of irreversible cartilage damage and mortality, with urgent drainage by serial arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, or open washout indicated to decompress the joint and reduce bacterial load when purulence or large effusions are present [^111g4bQo] [^1146TZsy] [^111SbycT] [^115RUybp].

> I should confirm empiric antimicrobial principles while cultures are pending. Adult empiric therapy should reflect local epidemiology, Gram stain morphology, and MRSA or resistant Gram-negative risk, with first-generation cephalosporin or anti-staphylococcal penicillin plus Gram-negative coverage when indicated, while pediatric empiric regimens must at minimum cover S aureus and in children 6 to 48 months should also cover K kingae until microbiology narrows the spectrum [^1123tr2A] [^11172zU9] [^112cjJba] [^115kYTJi].

> Hold on, I should verify how to track response and define failure. Serial clinical assessments paired with CRP trends are useful to monitor improvement, with red flags for failure including persistent pain and inflammation, lack of CRP decline, rising WBC, and persistently abnormal synovial indices on re-aspiration, which should prompt reconsideration of source control, antibiotic spectrum, and imaging for adjacent osteomyelitis or abscess [^1138oLyG] [^1127kK1e] [^114uL5ew].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic bottom line to ensure the message is clear. Any acute atraumatic monoarthritis with pain and swelling warrants a high index of suspicion for septic arthritis even without fever, clinical signs guide urgency but do not rule in or out disease, and immediate joint aspiration with synovial analysis is mandatory when suspected because delay worsens outcomes [^117Mq2Fh] [^111g4bQo].

Septic arthritis presents with **acute monoarticular pain, swelling, erythema, warmth, and restricted range of motion** [^117Mq2Fh], most often in the knee, hip, or ankle [^111UPYWF]. Systemic features such as fever, chills, and malaise are common but not universal, especially in immunocompromised or elderly patients [^111Daw8m] [^117Mq2Fh] [^111bFfrC]. Synovial fluid is typically purulent with a WBC count > 50,000/mm³ [^1123kkjg] and > 75% neutrophils, but lower counts can occur in early or immunosuppressed cases [^11381ew7] [^117HnvGm]. Prompt recognition [^111bFfrC] and **urgent arthrocentesis** are critical to prevent rapid joint destruction and systemic complications [^111g4bQo] [^111SbycT].

---

## Local joint signs and symptoms

- **Pain**: Severe [^117Mq2Fh], acute, and localized; worsens with movement or palpation [^111bFfrC].

- **Swelling**: Rapid onset of visible joint swelling or effusion [^116ZQNFw] [^111Daw8m].

- **Erythema and warmth**: Redness and increased temperature over the joint [^116VFc68].

- **Restricted range of motion**: Marked limitation due to pain and effusion [^111g4bQo].

- **Tenderness**: Significant tenderness on palpation [^11498V1v].

---

## Systemic signs and symptoms

Systemic manifestations commonly include **fever** [^117Mq2Fh], though it is not universal [^111bFfrC] and may be absent in immunocompromised or elderly patients [^111Daw8m]. Chills and rigors may accompany fever [^116VFc68]. Patients often report malaise and fatigue, reflecting generalized illness [^116ZQNFw]. Anorexia and weight loss can occur in prolonged or severe cases [^111bFfrC].

---

## Laboratory findings

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Purulent fluid with WBC > 50,000/mm³ [^1123kkjg] and > 75% neutrophils; lower counts can occur early or in immunosuppressed patients [^11381ew7] [^117HnvGm].

- **Gram stain and culture**: Essential for pathogen identification and antibiotic selection [^111g4bQo] [^116jwRca].

- **Serum inflammatory markers**: Elevated ESR and CRP; nonspecific but supportive [^1174rGVU] [^11381ew7].

- **Blood cultures**: Positive in ~50% of cases; obtain before antibiotics when possible [^1146TZsy] [^111g4bQo].

---

## Imaging findings

Imaging evaluation begins with plain radiographs [^11742Q7M] to assess for effusion, osteomyelitis, or preexisting joint disease [^111YJSv5]. Ultrasound is sensitive for detecting effusions [^114pVYfF], particularly in deep joints such as the hip and shoulder [^115hyEHX]. MRI is highly sensitive for **early joint inflammation, synovitis, and adjacent osteomyelitis** [^11345ghs] [^113Z2vwV] [^1164cqXm].

## Clinical presentation by joint involvement

| **Joint** | **Frequency** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Knee | Most common | Swelling, erythema, warmth, restricted motion [^111UPYWF] |
| Hip | Common in children | Severe pain, inability to bear weight, systemic symptoms [^112zbtAf] |
| Ankle | Less common | Swelling, erythema, warmth, restricted motion [^111UPYWF] |
| Shoulder | Less common | Pain, restricted motion, systemic symptoms [^116tcd6a] |
| Elbow | Rare | Pain, swelling, restricted motion, systemic symptoms [^111Lcetf] |

---

## Differences in clinical presentation by age group

Adults [^111bFfrC] typically present with **acute monoarticular pain, swelling, erythema, warmth, and restricted motion** [^117Mq2Fh]; systemic symptoms are common but may be absent in immunocompromised or elderly patients [^111Daw8m]. Children present with acute joint pain, swelling, erythema, warmth, and restricted motion, and **systemic symptoms (fever, irritability, refusal to bear weight) are more prominent** [^112zbtAf] [^111J6Vcr].

---

## Complications of delayed diagnosis

- **Joint destruction**: Rapid cartilage and bone destruction, permanent disability [^111SbycT] [^1158xdZw].

- **Osteomyelitis**: Spread to adjacent bone [^111Daw8m] [^1164cqXm].

- **Sepsis**: Systemic infection, multi-organ failure, death [^111bFfrC].

- **Chronic arthritis**: Persistent joint inflammation and dysfunction [^116VFc68] [^111Daw8m].

---

Septic arthritis is a **medical emergency** [^111bFfrC] characterized by **acute monoarticular pain, swelling, erythema, warmth, and restricted motion**, and systemic symptoms may be absent in some patients [^111Daw8m]. Prompt recognition, synovial fluid analysis [^111g4bQo], and early intervention are essential to prevent joint destruction and systemic complications [^1123kkjg] [^111SbycT].

### Laboratory tests in adults with monoarticular arthritis: Can they rule out a septic joint [^11381ew7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

It is difficult to differentiate septic arthritis from other causes of monoarticular arthritis solely with a history and physical examination. The clinician must rely on ancillary tests to make a diagnosis, such as the white blood cell count of peripheral blood (WBC), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the white blood cell count of the joint fluid (jWBC) obtained from arthrocentesis. Although it is known that septic arthritis is associated with abnormalities in these tests, the majority of the data are based on studies in the pediatric population. In addition, although several emergency medicine texts indicate that a jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm³ is "positive", it is known that septic arthritis can occur in patients with low jWBCs.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether specific ancillary tests have sufficiently high sensitivities to rule out septic arthritis in adults.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective consecutive case series of patients from an urban emergency department (ED). Patients at least 18 years old who had septic arthritis confirmed by positive arthrocentesis culture or operative findings were included in the study. WBC greater than 11,000 cells/mm³, ESR greater than 30 mm/hr, and jWBC greater than 50,000 cells/mm³ were considered elevated.

- **Results**: Seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria. The sensitivities of an elevated WBC, ESR, or jWBC in adults who had septic arthritis were 48%, 96%, and 64%, respectively. There were broad ranges of WBC, ESR, or jWBC among the patients. More than one third of adult patients with septic arthritis had…

Regarding diagnostic procedures for septic arthritis, specifically concerning synovial fluid analysis (differential cell count and microscopy), EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend considering a synovial WBC count of > 50,000/mcL as suggestive of septic arthritis in a native joint. Recognize that a low synovial WBC count (< 25,000/mcL) decreases the post-test probability, but does not exclude, septic arthritis in a native joint.

### Ankle arthritis - an important signpost in rheumatologic practice [^111UPYWF]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Septic arthritis**: Bacterial infection can potentially affect any joint, though certain joints are more frequently involved than others, especially the knee, with the ankle also being susceptible. A Dutch study of 186 patients with bacterial septic arthritis found the ankle to be the third most commonly affected joint, reported in 12% of cases, following the knee (48%) and hip (21%). In a prospective UK study of 75 patients with bacterial septic arthritis, the knee (56%) and hip (16%) were the most frequently affected joints, whereas the ankle was involved in only 1% of cases. An example of the X-ray appearances of bacterial septic arthritis of the ankle is shown in Figure 3.

- **Septic arthritis of the ankle due to Staphylococcus aureus infection**: A plain radiograph shows fuzziness of the cortical margins of the distal tibia, fibula, and both malleoli.

A report of 25 cases of polyarticular bacterial septic arthritis and a review of 303 case reports in the literature found the ankle to be affected in 24% of the 25 cases, less frequently than the knee, elbow, shoulder, wrist, and MCP/PIP joints. From the literature review of 303 polyarticular bacterial septic cases, the ankle was affected in 54 cases (18%), also less frequently than the knee, elbow, shoulder, and wrist. In gonococcal disease, an acute oligoarthritic presentation including the ankle is recognized.

### Guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints (SANJO) [^117Mq2Fh]. Journal of Bone and Joint Infection (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of septic arthritis, specifically in native joints, the EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend suspecting septic arthritis in patients who present with a painful and/or inflamed joint characterized by redness, heat, swelling, synovial effusion, and/or purulent drainage, with or without the presence of fever. It is advised not to exclude or confirm septic arthritis based solely on clinical parameters.

### Septic arthritis of native joints [^111SbycT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a rheumatologic emergency that may lead to disability or death. Prompt evacuation of the joint, either by arthrocentesis at the bedside, open or arthroscopic drainage in the operating room, or imaging-guided drainage in the radiology suite, is mandatory. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major cause of septic arthritis in the United States. MRSA joint infection seems to be associated with worse outcomes. Antibiotic courses of 3 to 4 weeks in duration are usually adequate for uncomplicated bacterial arthritis. Treatment duration should be extended to 6 weeks if there is imaging evidence of accompanying osteomyelitis.

### Guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints (SANJO) [^1123tr2A]. Journal of Bone and Joint Infection (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for septic arthritis, specifically in the context of antibiotic therapy, the EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend considering empirical treatment choices based on local epidemiology and resistance patterns. The following factors should also be taken into consideration:

- **Results of Gram staining and morphology**: Identify whether bacteria are Gram-positive or Gram-negative, and whether they are cocci or bacilli.

- **Presence of risk factors**: Consider risk factors for MRSA or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales.

- **Antibiotic administration**: In the absence of risk factors for resistant microorganisms and with a negative Gram stain, administer a combination of semisynthetic penicillin (such as cloxacillin or cefazolin) plus ceftriaxone, or opt for monotherapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

### Post-operative septic arthritis after arthroscopy: Modern diagnostic and therapeutic concepts [^116nciem]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The difficulty in the diagnostic approach lies in distinguishing between real post-operative septic arthritis and post-operative hyperinflammation. Classical signs of infection, such as joint swelling, reddening, overheating, pain, and limited range of motion (tumor, rubor, dolor, calor, and functio laesa), can be seen. However, fever, and possibly chills, are more likely to manifest in cases of septic arthritis. Diagnosis can be challenging, as signs of a joint infection may be masked. Mild symptoms due to infection might be mistaken for normal post-operative hyperinflammation. According to Schollin-Borg et al. in 60% of their cases following ACL reconstruction, the diagnosis of infection was missed during the patients' first visit. This is particularly true for indolent joint infections with non-aggressive or moderately aggressive germs, such as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and, especially, Cutibacterium acnes after shoulder arthroscopy. Gout arthritis should also be excluded by interpreting blood infection parameters and joint fluid sample examinations, including joint fluid microscopy to confirm or exclude crystals.

After an inspection and palpation, painful restricted range of motion can be the leading symptom during clinical examination. It is crucial to differentiate between joint irritation and joint infection, especially following previous surgery.

### Enhancing diagnostics in orthopedic infections [^117RWjh1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical spectrum of orthopedic infection is broad, and enhancing diagnostics is crucial to ensure accurate diagnosis, treatment, and improved outcomes. Prompt recognition of the clinical syndrome with appropriate diagnostic sampling and treatment with antimicrobial therapy are cornerstones of management. Obtaining representative samples can be challenging and often requires invasive sampling. Host factors, such as comorbid inflammatory conditions and immunosuppressive medications, make recognizing and detecting infection more difficult. The central tenets of diagnostics in orthopedic infection revolve around two core principles: detection of the pathogen and detection of the host inflammatory response. In general, accurate diagnosis hinges upon a patient-centric combination of these approaches.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis in adults [^117DJAYZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis is an uncommon infection. The classic clinical picture involves concomitant pulmonary and/or meningeal and joint infections in the presence of predisposing local and systemic factors. Initial laboratory tests are often inconclusive, making joint aspiration necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment options include antibiotic therapy, usually with penicillin, combined with closed or open joint drainage. Increasing reports of infections involving penicillin-resistant strains are a concern. Despite this, the prognosis is usually favorable; however, early recognition and aggressive management are essential to reduce the likelihood of significant joint injury.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of septic arthritis [^11345ghs]. Clinical Imaging (2001). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a disabling and life-threatening disease that requires early diagnosis for optimal outcome. Although traditionally diagnosed through clinical and laboratory methods, some patients may be misdiagnosed and subsequently referred for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Therefore, radiologists need to be aware of the MR imaging findings of septic arthritis, its complications, and diagnostic pitfalls.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® osteomyelitis or septic arthritis-child (excluding axial skeleton) [^1149eE7k]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Imaging plays an integral role in the evaluation of suspected musculoskeletal infections in children, not only in the accurate identification of infections such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, but also in guiding management. Various diagnostic modalities serve different purposes in the assessment of suspected pediatric musculoskeletal infections. This document provides imaging guidance in the most frequently encountered clinical scenarios where osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis are suspected, outside of the axial skeleton.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision involve an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion is considered.

### Guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints (SANJO) [^116btyVN]. Journal of Bone and Joint Infection (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, particularly in patients following ACL reconstruction, the EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend considering 1–2 weeks of IV treatment, followed by oral treatment for another 4–5 weeks. Preferably, bactericidal agents with good oral bioavailability, bone penetration, and biofilm activity should be used, especially if avascular tissue and fixation devices remain in situ. Consider transitioning to oral treatment in the case of a good clinical response and a downward CRP trend.

### Bacterial septic arthritis in adults [^111bFfrC]. Lancet (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms and signs of septic arthritis represent an important medical emergency due to high morbidity and mortality. We review the changing epidemiology of septic arthritis in native joints of adults, highlighting the increasing frequency of the disorder and its evolving antibiotic resistance.

- **Risk factors**: Various risk factors for the development of septic arthritis are discussed, including host factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 1 and 10, as well as bacterial proteins, toxins, and enzymes. These are reported to be important determinants of pathogenesis in mouse models.
- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of the disease is primarily clinical, guided by investigations and the opinion of skilled clinicians. We emphasize the need for timely medical and surgical intervention — most importantly, through diagnostic aspiration of relevant joints, choice of suitable antibiotics, and appropriate supportive measures.
- **Management complexity**: Management is increasingly complex with the advent of novel and antibiotic-resistant causative microorganisms and within the climate of increased immunosuppression. Findings from animal models and patients are providing insights into disease pathogenesis and the potential for novel adjunctive treatments, including systemic corticosteroids, cytokines and anticytokines, and bisphosphonates.

### Guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints (SANJO) [^115RUybp]. Journal of Bone and Joint Infection (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for septic arthritis, particularly concerning indications for surgery, the EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend offering invasive treatment (open surgery, arthroscopy, or arthrocentesis) to wash out toxins and reduce both the bacterial load and intra-articular pressure.

- **Perform surgical debridement**: This is advised for septic arthritis of a native joint, especially in larger joints.

- **Consider arthroscopic debridement**: It is suggested as initial surgical management in patients with Gächter stage I, II, and probably also III septic arthritis (if logistically and surgically feasible).

- **Consider open debridement**: This approach is recommended for patients with Gächter stage III and definitely indicated for stage IV.

### Evaluation for septic arthritis of the native adult knee is aided by multivariable assessment [^114BzK6D]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Evaluation of suspected septic arthritis of the native adult knee is a common diagnostic dilemma. Pre-aspirate criteria predictive of septic arthritis do not exist for the adult knee and investigations of aspiration results (cell count, differential, gram stain, and crystal analysis) have been limited to univariate analyses. Given numerous clinical variables inform the risk of septic arthritis, multivariable analysis that incorporates all clinically available information is critical for allowing accurate decision-making.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified 455 cases of potential septic arthritis of a native adult knee at a tertiary health system from 2012 to 2017, of which 281 underwent aspiration. We recorded demographics, comorbidities, history, exam, laboratory, and radiographic data. Among aspirated cases, we performed univariate analyses of all variables for association with septic arthritis, followed by multivariable logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: Septic arthritis was confirmed in 61 of 281 patients who underwent aspiration. Independent associations of risk for septic arthritis included synovial fluid WBC ≥ 30,000 (Odds Ratio 90.8, 95% Confidence Interval 26.6–310.1, p < 0.001), fever lasting over 2 days (OR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3–20.9, p < 0.001), history of septic arthritis at any joint (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.1–23.4, p = 0.039), and clinical effusion (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.2–20.0, p = 0.030). Independent associations protective against septic arthritis included the presence of syno.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or soft tissue infection (excluding spine and diabetic foot): 2022 update [^112LKpyg]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for septic arthritis, specifically concerning joint imaging, ACR 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound, MRI, or CT, or performing image-guided aspiration as subsequent evaluation for suspected septic arthritis. This is advised following normal radiographs or for findings suggestive of joint effusion or soft tissue swelling.

### The evaluation, classification, and management of septic arthritis of the shoulder: The comprehensive shoulder sepsis system [^116tcd6a]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis of the shoulder is distinctly challenging to diagnose and treat. Guidelines for appropriate workup and management are limited and do not account for the variations in clinical presentation. The purpose of this study was to present a comprehensive and anatomically based classification system and treatment algorithm for septic arthritis of the native shoulder joint.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, retrospective analysis of all patients treated surgically for septic arthritis of the native shoulder joint was performed at two tertiary care academic institutions. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and operative reports were used to classify patients as having one of three infection subtypes: type I, confined to the glenohumeral joint; type II, extra-articular extension; or type III, concomitant osteomyelitis. Based on these clinical groupings of patients, the comorbidities, types of surgical management, and outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: Sixty-five shoulders in 64 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. Of these infected shoulders, 9.2% had type I infections, 47.7% had type II, and 43.1% had type III. Age and the time between symptom onset and diagnosis were the only significant risk factors for the development of a more severe infection. Fifty-seven percent of shoulder aspirates revealed cell counts below the standard surgical cutoff of 50,000 cells/mL. On average, each patient required 2.2 surgical débridements to eradicate the infection. Infections recurred in eight shoulders (12.3%). Body mass index was the only risk factor for recurrence.

### Case studies and literature review of pneumococcal septic arthritis in adults [^113eaxYD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

For most patients, the time to diagnosis was a few days; however, the diagnosis of prosthetic joint septic arthritis (SA), particularly in the hip, was sometimes longer, as seen in previous findings. Clinical signs and conventional laboratory markers, such as elevated white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, cannot differentiate infectious from noninfectious inflammation. These tests should not be used alone to diagnose SA. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels also increase in various forms of inflammation and microbial infections. PCT is less than 0.5 ng/mL in healthy patients but rapidly increases with systemic bacterial infections, such as SA.

Some studies have reported falsely low PCT levels during the early phase of infection or in localized infections, such as SA. In our study, all patients had elevated CRP levels, and 75% had elevated PCT levels. Synovial fluid almost always had an inflammatory appearance and often was purulent, as also described in prior studies. Positive gram staining results were reported in 80% of cases, and positive culture was reported in 93% of cases, similar to the rates from previous studies.

In the literature, pneumococcal bacteremia was complicated by joint infection in 0.3%–0.6% of cases; bacteremia was observed in 55%–100% of adults with pneumococcal SA and appeared to be more frequent when a prosthetic joint was infected. In our study, we observed bacteremia in 69% of cases of native SA and in 80% of cases of prosthetic joint infection. The frequency of documented bacteremia emphasizes the importance of obtaining blood cultures in addition to joint fluid cultures before initiating treatment.

### Septic arthritis of the neonatal hip: Acute management and late reconstruction [^114H9j2Q]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis of the hip in neonates is rare but can have devastating consequences. Presenting signs and symptoms may differ from those encountered in older children, which may result in diagnostic challenges or delays. Many risk factors predispose neonates to septic arthritis, including the presence of transphyseal vessels and invasive procedures. Bacterial infection of the joint occurs via hematogenous invasion, extension from an adjacent site, or direct inoculation.

There is a strong correlation between younger age at presentation and the severity of residual hip deformity. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, laboratory markers, and ultrasound evaluation. Early management includes parenteral antibiotics and surgical drainage. Late-stage management options include femoral and pelvic osteotomies, trochanteric arthroplasty, arthrodesis, pelvic support procedures, and nonsurgical measures. Early diagnosis and management continue to be the most important prognostic factors for a favorable outcome in neonates with septic arthritis.

### Bone and joint infections [^1172jAPC]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

An acute osteoarticular infection in a child is most often hematogenous. The infection manifests as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Medical advice is usually sought within 2 to 6 days from the onset of symptoms.

A child with osteomyelitis in a lower extremity characteristically presents with limping, with or without notable local tenderness, whereas acute septic arthritis is often readily visible because the joint is red, tender, and swollen. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment remain pivotal in avoiding complications in acute bacterial bone and joint infections.

### Septic arthritis [^116VFc68]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis has increased in incidence in the United States over the past two decades and increasingly affects an older population with a greater burden of chronic illness and a higher risk of drug-resistant organisms. Successful management depends on a high diagnostic suspicion, empiric antibiotic treatment, and joint drainage. A bacteriologic diagnosis is more likely with inoculation into blood culture bottles than with plating on solid media. As MRSA increases in prevalence in the community, empiric antibiotic regimens increasingly need to be active against MRSA.

### Bacterial arthritis [^1137bwQr]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The septic arthritis literature of 2000 revisited several topics previously examined in detail. These include septic arthritis in rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic manifestations of bacterial endocarditis, and infectious complications of prosthetic joints. The trend in antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent late infections in total joint replacement is to narrow the targeted hosts to those most at risk, to define the procedures associated with the greatest risk of bacteremia, and to simplify the antibiotic regimen. The diagnoses of septic arthritis of the lumbar facet joint and septic arthritis caused by direct inoculation of bacteria by a foreign object penetrating the joint are facilitated by noninvasive imaging technologies. Septic arthritis caused by uncommon microorganisms and septic arthritis in immunocompromised hosts are other noteworthy topics in this year's literature.

### Case studies and literature review of pneumococcal septic arthritis in adults [^115sX8tz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Radiography, computed tomography, scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging can be useful to assess the presence and extent of bone and joint inflammation and destruction, but cannot distinguish between infections and other causes of acute inflammatory arthritis. Septic inflammation of a joint also can lead to radionuclide uptake in scintigraphy. However, diagnosis of pyogenic sacroiliitis often was made on the basis of patient history, physical examination, and positive skeletal scintigraphy or computed tomography of the sacroiliac joint.

No consensus has been reached concerning the optimal duration of intravenous antimicrobial therapy and the role of switching to oral therapy. The median duration reported in the literature ranged from 17 to 30.1 days for intravenous therapy and 30.6 to 49 days for oral antimicrobial agents. The median duration of intravenous therapy in our study was shorter, 1 to 23 days with a mean of 5.5 days, but the overall duration of antimicrobial therapy was comparable to reports in the literature. In several studies, penicillin was the most commonly used antimicrobial drug, followed by third-generation cephalosporins; gentamicin rarely was used. In contrast, 68.75% of cases in our study received a combination therapy of a β-lactam antimicrobial drug and gentamicin.

Antimicrobial therapy in the absence of drainage can be successful in certain patients. However, arthrotomy in combination with antimicrobial therapy typically is considered the best treatment for septic arthritis. In our cohort, arthrotomy was performed in 46% of cases.

### Machine-learning algorithm that can improve the diagnostic accuracy of septic arthritis of the knee [^117AUJPX]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis of the knee is crucial. Nevertheless, the quality of evidence for the diagnosis of septic arthritis is low. In this study, the authors developed a machine-learning-based diagnostic algorithm for septic arthritis of the native knee using clinical data in an emergency department and validated its diagnostic accuracy.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 326) who underwent synovial fluid analysis at the emergency department for suspected septic arthritis of the knee were enrolled. Septic arthritis was diagnosed in 164 of the patients (50.3%) using modified Newman criteria. Clinical characteristics of septic and inflammatory arthritis were compared. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) statistics was applied to evaluate the efficacy of each variable for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. The dataset was divided into independent training and test sets (comprising 80% and 20%, respectively, of the data). Supervised machine-learning techniques (random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting: XGBoost) were applied to develop a diagnostic model using the training dataset. The test dataset was subsequently used to validate the developed model. The ROC curves of the machine-learning model and each variable were compared.

- **Results**: Synovial white blood cell (WBC) count was significantly higher in septic arthritis than in inflammatory arthritis in the multivariate analysis (P = 0.001). In the ROC comparison analysis, synovial WBC count yielded a significantly higher AUC than all other single variables (P = 0.002).

### Septic arthritis in immunosuppressed patients: Do laboratory values help [^117HnvGm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

There are approximately 20,000 cases of septic arthritis diagnosed annually in the United States. It is a diagnosis that can be associated with notable morbidity, including joint destruction, sepsis, and even increased mortality, made worse by a delay in treatment. Prompt diagnosis, therefore, becomes critical for reducing complications. Accurate diagnosis, however, may be challenging because several pathologies, such as crystalline arthropathies or inflammatory arthropathies, may present with a similar clinical picture.

Septic arthritis has historically been diagnosed by combining clinical examination and laboratory data, with a positive culture remaining the benchmark for diagnosis. Waiting for the culture results, however, may require several days, which can lead to increased morbidity. Clinicians must therefore rely on testing that is obtained more rapidly but may not be specific for septic arthritis. Historically, these tests have included a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid cell count, and percent of synovial fluid neutrophils (% neutrophils).

Previous studies have suggested the use of a synovial fluid cell count of > 50,000 cells/mm³ from a native joint aspiration as the threshold for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. The addition of serum white blood cells (WBC) > 11.0 × 10⁹/L and ESR > 30 mm/hr with this synovial fluid cell count threshold has been reported to have a sensitivity approaching 100%.

Despite the near-dogmatic approach to the 50,000 cell cutoff, the evidence to support this value is limited.

### Infectious arthritis: Clinical features, laboratory findings and treatment [^113q35Sg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

An infection of native joints generally leads to suppurative arthritis, which may involve one joint (monarticular) or several joints (oligoarticular). Bacteria that cause symptoms in multiple joints during bacteraemia, such as *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, may also induce inflammation in neighboring tendon sheaths. Viral infections frequently involve multiple joints and produce inflammation without suppuration. Chronic granulomatous monarticular arthritis may occur due to infection with either mycobacteria or fungi, which must be differentiated from other causes of chronic monarticular arthritis. A sterile arthritis may occur early in infection, as with hepatitis B, or later, as with post-infectious arthritis. Any patient presenting with an inflamed joint should have infection considered as a diagnostic possibility, and appropriate cultures must be performed.

### Septic arthritis of the elbow in children: Clinical presentation and microbiological profile [^111Lcetf]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2016). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis of the elbow in children is a rare but important musculoskeletal infection, and there is little published data to guide treating clinicians. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, associated pathology, and microbiological profile of septic arthritis of the elbow in a pediatric population.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of children who had an elbow arthrocentesis for presumed septic arthritis and whose joint aspirates were positive for microbial growth. Data collected included demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, imaging, and laboratory data, including culture results.

- **Results**: Twelve children underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis of the elbow joint for septic arthritis at an average age of 6 years and 9 months (range, 2 months to 13 years and 7 months). Every child had pain, localized erythema and edema, and restricted range of motion; 10 of 12 were febrile. The mean duration of symptoms prior to joint tap was 4 days (range, 1 to 14 days). Osteomyelitis was found in 7 patients, as confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): 5 at initial presentation and 2 after readmission for persistent symptoms. Causative pathogens were methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in 7 cases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2 cases, Group G Streptococcus in 1 case, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 case, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1 case. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was greater than 40 mm/h in 8 of 11 patients, C-reactive protein (CRP) was greater than 2 mg/dL in all patients, and synovial white blood cell (WBC) count was greater than 50,000 cells/mm³ in 8 of 9 patients. One patient developed fulminant sepsis during hospitalization and 2 children were readmitted within 30 days.

### Post-operative septic arthritis after arthroscopy: modern diagnostic and therapeutic concepts [^115t3X6U]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Several classifications are available for evaluating joint infections according to pathological, anatomical, clinical, or arthroscopic aspects. The most frequently used classification with clinical relevance is the classification according to Gächter.

- **Gächter classification**:
	- Early detected knee joint infection after arthroscopy (Gächter type I) involves clear synovialitis.
	- Shoulder joint infection after arthroscopic irrigation, before debridement (Gächter type II), shows clear synovialitis and petechial bleeding in the anterior joint compartment with fibrin deposits.

If an infection is confirmed or suspected, early arthroscopic joint irrigation and joint debridement should be performed. The patient should be operated on within a few hours if they experience intervention-related fever and/or an increased cell-count analysis after joint puncture.

If a high-grade joint infection is already confirmed at the time of diagnosis (Gächter stage 4), as evidenced by osteolysis using conventional radiography, an open procedure should be considered.

In cases with indwelling implants, it is important to distinguish between acute and chronic infections regarding implant preservation or removal. In chronic cases, removal is mandatory, while in acute cases, it is helpful to identify implants and their position in case of surgery and subsequent removal if the patient is not known to the presenting medical team.

### Current approach to the evaluation and management of septic arthritis [^11498V1v]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is an emergent condition caused by bacterial infection of a joint space. The most common etiology is hematogenous spread from bacteremia, but it can also occur from direct inoculation from bites, injection injuries, cellulitis, abscesses, or local trauma. Septic arthritis occurs most frequently in the lower extremities, with the hips and knees serving as the most common locations. The most sensitive findings include pain with motion of the joint, limited range of motion, tenderness of the joint, new joint swelling, and new effusion. Laboratory testing and imaging can support the diagnosis, but the criterion standard is diagnostic arthrocentesis. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics and joint decompression.

### Advances in the management of septic arthritis [^1158xdZw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis remains a significant and concerning issue in major urban medical centers, known as one of the most rapidly destructive forms of acute arthritis. The annual incidence of bacterial arthritis ranges from 2 to 10 per 100,000 in the general population and increases to 30 to 70 per 100,000 among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and those with joint prostheses. An irreversible loss of joint function may occur in up to 50% of affected patients. Despite advancements in antimicrobial agents and hospital care, the fatality rate of this condition has not significantly improved over the past 30 years. Understanding the risk factors and pathogenesis of nongonococcal bacterial arthritis, along with other forms of infectious arthritis, is crucial. This knowledge is primarily essential in the context of differential diagnosis and treatment, helping to prevent delays in accurate diagnosis and improving patient prognosis.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^1168Ktpj]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria are used to help differentiate septic arthritis from transient synovitis. However, due to the substantial overlap between the two groups, there are no absolute criteria for a definitive diagnosis of either condition. Kocher and colleagues described an evidence-based clinical prediction algorithm to determine the probability of septic arthritis and subsequently validated the algorithm in a prospective study. The four independent multivariate clinical predictors to differentiate between septic arthritis and transient synovitis are: history of fever, non-weight-bearing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of at least 40 millimeters per hour, and serum white blood cell count of more than 12,000 cells per mm³ (12.0 × 10⁹ cells per liter).

The predicted probability of septic arthritis was determined for all sixteen combinations of these four predictors. It is summarized as less than 0.2 percent for zero predictors, 3.0/9.5 percent for one predictor, 40.0/35.0 percent for two predictors, 93.1/72.8 percent for three predictors, and 99.6/93.0 percent for four predictors (original cohort/prospective cohort). In another preliminary retrospective study, Jung and colleagues found the probability of diagnosing acute septic arthritis was 98.8% according to multivariate regression analysis. This was based on the presence of all of the following five features: body temperature > 37°C, ESR > 20 mm/h, CRP > 1 mg/dL, WBC > 11,000/mL, and an increased medial hip joint space of > 2 mm on A/P radiographs.

Clinical prediction rules serve as guidelines but clinical judgment remains essential.

### Pneumococcal septic arthritis among adults, France, 2010–2018 [^114PBmLw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is considered an uncommon cause of arthritis in adults. To determine the clinical and microbiological characteristics of pneumococcal septic arthritis, we retrospectively studied a large series of cases among adult patients during the conjugate vaccine era from 2010 to 2018 in France. We identified 110 patients (56 women, 54 men; mean age 65 years). The cases included 82 native joint infections and 28 prosthetic joint infections. Most commonly affected were the knee (50/110) and hip (25/110).

Concomitant pneumococcal infections were found in 37.2% (38/102) and bacteremia in 57.3% (55/96) of patients. Underlying conditions were noted for 81.4% (83/102). The mortality rate was 9.4% (8/85). The proportion of strains not susceptible to penicillin was 29.1% (32/110). Of the 55 serotyped strains, 31 (56.4%) were covered by standard pneumococcal vaccines. However, several nonvaccine serotypes, mainly 23B, 24F, and 15A, had emerged, for which susceptibility to β-lactams was low.

### Point-of-care ultrasound and the septic prosthetic hip joint [^116VrLkn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Septic joints can have an insidious onset and are difficult to diagnose, especially in the presence of a distant prosthetic joint. Plain films and inflammatory markers are often not specific, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not a timely test in the emergency department. A computed tomography (CT) scan is quick and useful for evaluating bony changes or signs of inflammation, but it lacks the detail of MRI, and the presence of a prosthetic joint may cause significant artifacts.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is frequently used in the pediatric population to evaluate for an effusion when there is concern for a septic native hip joint. It is increasingly finding a role in adult emergency medicine to evaluate for effusion in painful native adult hip joints. However, ultrasound is not currently included in diagnostic algorithms for diagnosing prosthetic hip joint infections (PJIs). Despite this, POCUS is readily available in the emergency department.

We present a case where POCUS aided in identifying periprosthetic synovitis, changing the course of the patient's management from previous physical therapy to further investigation, ultimately leading to the diagnosis of a septic prosthetic hip joint.

### Clinical and biologic characteristics of Kingella kingae-induced septic arthritis of the knee in young children [^111mdCLr]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of the 2000s, a clinician's ability to efficiently detect small quantities of bacterial DNA using nucleic acid amplification assays (NAAAs) has improved. Indeed, the introduction and widespread use of NAAAs have decreased the rates of osteoarticular infections (OAIs) that had previously returned as culture-negative.

Cases of osteoarticular infections attributed to Kingella kingae increased during the same period. More extensive use of NAAAs has provided evidence that K. kingae has become the most common pathogen responsible for OAIs in children below 4 years old. Septic arthritis is the most common form of the osteoarticular disease caused by K. kingae. This infection tends to involve, above all, the lower limbs, with the knee joint being most frequently affected. The clinical and biological aspects of septic arthritis of the knee can, unfortunately, be less obvious when K. kingae is responsible for the infection. In addition, synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) examinations in children with culture-proven arthritis due to K. kingae revealed counts of less than 50,000 WBC/ml in a quarter of cases, and Gram stain testing was usually negative. Thus, an afebrile presentation, mild clinical symptoms, and the absence or slightly altered laboratory data in K. kingae arthritis do not meet the criteria for diagnosing a septic joint.

Many conditions can present a similar clinical picture to pediatric septic arthritis, including inflammatory arthritis, reactive arthritis, transient synovitis, or even Lyme arthritis. Since 1999, some authors have tried to investigate these similarities.

### Pneumococcal septic arthritis among adults, France, 2010–2018 [^1125Qxjo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a serious infectious disease caused by the invasion of microorganisms, most commonly bacteria, into the synovial membranes, resulting in purulent joint effusion. It constitutes a medical emergency and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. In industrialized countries, the annual incidence of proven or probable septic arthritis is approximately 4–10 cases per 100,000 of the general population, but among persons with rheumatoid arthritis or other underlying joint disease, the incidence is significantly higher at 30–70 cases per 100,000 population. The increased prevalence of septic arthritis in recent decades might be associated with population aging, wider use of immunosuppressive drugs, and the growing number of invasive orthopedic and prosthetic procedures.

The pathogen most frequently involved in septic arthritis is Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Streptococcus spp., mainly β-hemolytic streptococci and, more rarely, viridans streptococci. However, 0.6%–5.0% of cases are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, otitis, sinusitis, and invasive diseases. This is especially so among persons 65 years of age and among patients with underlying conditions. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is a major public health problem, with reported annual incidences ranging from 7 to 97 cases per 100,000 adult population.

### Case studies and literature review of pneumococcal septic arthritis in adults [^114pm9CJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

During January 1, 2005–December 31, 2016, we observed 16 (1.5%) cases of pneumococcal septic arthritis (SA) out of 1,062 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) reported. The prevalence of pneumococcal SA increased during the study period, ranging from 0.69% during 2005–2010 to 2.47% during 2011–2016 (p = 0.02).

Of the patients with pneumococcal SA, the mean age was 69.7 (34–93) years, with 62.5% being over 65 years of age; 9 were women and 7 were men. Fourteen (87.5%) patients had monoarticular infection, while the other 2 (12.5%) had polyarticular infection — one case involved the knee and shoulders and the other the sacroiliac joints.

For 14 patients, data on medical history, clinical characteristics, and time to diagnosis were available. We found that 11 (78.57%) patients had 1–2 underlying conditions predisposing them to pneumococcal SA; 5 (35.71%) had one condition, and 6 (42.86%) had more than one condition. Three (21.42%) had no risk factors but were among the oldest patients, and 5 (35.71%) had respiratory tract infections. Most joint infections involved the knee, with 11 out of 16 (68.75%) SA cases. Nine (56.25%) patients had native joint infections, and 5 (31.25%) patients had infections after prosthetic joint surgery, 4 involving a knee and 1 involving a hip.

### Diagnostic accuracy of synovial lactate, polymerase chain reaction, or clinical examination for suspected adult septic arthritis [^113FcXmw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Adult septic arthritis can be challenging to differentiate from other causes of acute joint pain. The diagnostic accuracy of synovial lactate and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains uncertain.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of synovial lactate, PCR, and clinical evaluation for adults with possible septic arthritis in the emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: We report a prospective sampling of ED patients aged ≥ 18 years with knee symptoms concerning for septic arthritis. Clinicians and research assistants independently performed history and physical examination. Serum and synovial laboratory testing was ordered at the discretion of the clinician. We analyzed frozen synovial fluid specimens for L- and D-lactate and PCR. The criterion standard for septic arthritis was bacterial growth on synovial culture and treated by consultants with operative drainage, prolonged antibiotics, or both. Diagnostic accuracy measures included sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, interval likelihood ratios, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve.

- **Results**: Seventy-one patients were included with septic arthritis prevalence of 7%. No finding on history or physical examination accurately ruled in or ruled out septic arthritis. Synovial L- and D-lactate and PCR were inaccurate for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. Synovial white blood cell count and synovial Gram stain most accurately rule in and rule out septic arthritis.

- **Conclusions**: Septic arthritis prevalence in ED adults is lower than reported previously.

### Current concepts in pediatric septic arthritis [^111J6Vcr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to present challenges regarding clinical diagnosis, workup, and definitive management. Urgent management is essential, so treating surgeons must efficiently work through differential diagnoses, identify concomitant infections, and perform timely irrigation and débridement. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is increasing, typically resulting in a more rapid progression of symptoms with a more severe clinical presentation. The diagnostic utility of MRI has resulted in improved detection of concomitant septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, although MRI must not substantially delay definitive management.

Early diagnosis followed by urgent irrigation and débridement and antibiotic therapy are essential for satisfactory long-term outcomes. Antibiotics should not be administered until blood cultures and arthrocentesis fluid are obtained, except in rare cases of a septic or toxic patient. Once cultures are obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should commence and provide coverage for the most likely pathogens, given the patient's age. Laboratory markers, especially C-reactive protein, should be followed until normalization and correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms. Definitive antibiotic selection should be shared with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, who can help guide the duration of treatment.

### Post-operative septic arthritis after arthroscopy: Modern diagnostic and therapeutic concepts [^116qTutk]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

If an acute infection is suspected, cell count, macroscopic assessment, and microscopy after Gram staining help to make a quick diagnosis (within hours) and support a quick decision-making process for further treatment.

- **Priority protocol for suspected joint infections**: Depending on the amount of joint fluid, the user should start with priority 1 and then follow the list. This specific protocol allows for easy handling with information about the amount, the purpose, the tube, and the target institute for analysis.

The interpretation of the joint fluid sample can be done according to Trampuz et al. and Stutz et al, who proposed the following criteria: the main distinctive feature between reactive and septic arthritis is the number of cells. If this is greater than 20,000/µl, there is a high probability of an infectious event. However, there are some limitations to these criteria. The cell count must be interpreted with regard to the individual patient, i.e. a leukocyte count of 15,000/µl can already be considered critical if an intraarticular implant is present (anchor or suture material) and the cut-off value due to the presence of joint replacements is even more strict (physiological < 2800 leukocytes/µl). Additionally, in patients with immunosuppression, the leukocyte count may not be elevated and therefore can mask a joint infection.

This interpretation is also supported by the systematic review of Margaretten et al, who showed that a progressively higher synovial white blood cell (WBC) count increased the likelihood of septic arthritis.

### Hip pain and fever: When it is not a septic joint, what's next [^1141fTTT]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Hip pain and fever in children encompass a broad differential diagnosis. Of most concern is the potential diagnosis of a septic joint, which can lead to significant morbidity. We describe the case of a 13-year-old boy with fever and hip pain, referred to the emergency department with concerns for septic hip. The etiology was later identified as pyomyositis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In regions with a high prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, it is crucial for physicians to recognize this rare, yet potentially complicated condition.

### Machine-learning algorithm that can improve the diagnostic accuracy of septic arthritis of the knee [^117Gu8FF]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis of the knee is crucial. Nevertheless, the quality of evidence for the diagnosis of septic arthritis is low. In this study, the authors developed a machine learning-based diagnostic algorithm for septic arthritis of the native knee using clinical data in an emergency department and validated its diagnostic accuracy.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 326) who underwent synovial fluid analysis at the emergency department for suspected septic arthritis of the knee were enrolled. Septic arthritis was diagnosed in 164 of the patients (50.3%) using modified Newman criteria. Clinical characteristics of septic and inflammatory arthritis were compared. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) statistics was applied to evaluate the efficacy of each variable for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. The dataset was divided into independent training and test sets (comprising 80% and 20%, respectively, of the data). Supervised machine-learning techniques (random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting: XGBoost) were applied to develop a diagnostic model using the training dataset. The test dataset was subsequently used to validate the developed model. The ROC curves of the machine-learning model and each variable were compared.

- **Results**: Synovial white blood cell (WBC) count was significantly higher in septic arthritis than in inflammatory arthritis in the multivariate analysis (P = 0.001). In the ROC comparison analysis, synovial WBC count yielded a significantly higher AUC than all other single variables (P = 0.002).

Regarding diagnostic procedures for septic arthritis, specifically concerning synovial fluid analysis, including differential cell count and microscopy, EBJIS 2023 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support a particular percentage of synovial polymorphonuclear cells to diagnose or rule out septic arthritis of a native joint. However, they recognize that higher percentages increase the probability of diagnosing septic arthritis of a native joint.

### Septic arthritis in immunosuppressed patients: Do laboratory values help [^1168o1Qy]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Diagnosing septic arthritis often relies on clinical acumen and a careful review of laboratory data. Although it is important for the clinician to proceed in an expedited fashion, overly aggressive diagnosis may result in patients undergoing unnecessary procedures; accurate diagnosis, therefore, is paramount. Although the benchmark for diagnosis remains a positive culture from the affected joint, this is often not practical because culture results may take several days, increasing patient morbidity. It is for this reason that previous literature has established a synovial fluid cell count threshold of 50,000 cells/mm³ as suggestive of a diagnosis of septic arthritis in a native joint in lieu of positive culture results, with lower values suggesting a crystalline or inflammatory arthropathy. Not only is the literature to support this cutoff limited, but there is also little data to support this threshold in the immunosuppressed patient population. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to retrospectively review our immunosuppressed patients with culture-positive septic arthritis to determine if 50,000 cells/mm³ is a valid threshold in this population.

Previous studies have used varying definitions for septic arthritis. In 1976, Newman defined septic arthritis based on the following criteria: (1) isolating an organism from the affected joint, (2) isolating an organism from elsewhere in a patient with a clinically swollen, painful joint, (3) histologic or radiologic evidence of infection, or (4) turbid fluid aspirated from the joint. This definition remains popular.

### Septic arthritis: Diagnosis and treatment [^116ZQNFw]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis must be considered and promptly diagnosed in any patient presenting with acute atraumatic joint pain, swelling, and fever. Risk factors for septic arthritis include age older than 80 years, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, recent joint surgery, hip or knee prosthesis, skin infection, and immunosuppressive medication use. A delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent morbidity and mortality.

Physical examination findings and serum markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, are helpful in the diagnosis but are nonspecific. Synovial fluid studies are required to confirm the diagnosis. History and Gram stain aid in determining initial antibiotic selection. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen isolated in septic arthritis; however, other bacteria, viruses, fungi, and mycobacterium can cause the disease.

After synovial fluid has been obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated if there is clinical concern for septic arthritis. Oral antibiotics can be given in most cases because they are not inferior to intravenous therapy. Total duration of therapy ranges from two to six weeks; however, certain infections require longer courses. Consideration for microorganisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Borrelia burgdorferi, and fungal infections should be based on history findings and laboratory results.

### Epidemiology of suspected wrist joint infection versus inflammation [^115HWXyp]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the cumulative prevalence of septic arthritis presenting to the emergency department of an academic medical center and to evaluate the use of clinical data to diagnose infection versus inflammation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a records review of a single institution with 80,000 annual emergency room visits. We included a consecutive series of patients with suspected wrist infection from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2008. Adults complaining of atraumatic wrist pain with either erythema or swelling on physical examination, or a final diagnosis of septic arthritis, gout, pseudogout, cellulitis, wrist hematoma/edema, or wrist arthritic flare were suspected to have an infection. Data were collected using a standardized data abstraction form.

- **Results**: We reviewed 804 patient records. A total of 104 patients met the inclusion criteria for suspected wrist joint infection during the 2-year study period. The mean age was 62.5 years (SD, 20.2 years), and 63 were men. There were 12 patients with a history of gout, 4 with a history of pseudogout, and 19 with a history of diabetes. Wrist arthrocentesis was performed in 31 patients, and 11 underwent surgical treatment. There were 16 patients with a final diagnosis of gout, 11 with pseudogout, 43 with cellulitis, 13 with upper extremity hematoma/edema, and 15 with wrist arthritic flare. The cumulative prevalence of septic arthritis was 5%.

- **Conclusions**: In this series of emergency department patients with suspected wrist joint infection, gout, pseudogout, and cellulitis were the most common etiologies.

### Review for the generalist: Evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^112zbtAf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Children with hip pathology may present with a variety of non-specific symptoms. Transient synovitis and septic arthritis have similar early symptoms, including the spontaneous onset of progressive hip, groin, or thigh pain; limp or inability to bear weight; fever; and irritability. Untreated intra-articular infection can lead to a permanent loss of hip function, making it extremely important to differentiate possible infection from benign cases of transient synovitis. Other causes of hip pathology are often related to skeletal maturity and are fairly specific to the child's age. An awareness of developmental anomalies, as well as variation in skeletal maturation, will aid the physician in evaluation and management. This article reviews common musculoskeletal causes of hip and pelvis pain in the pediatric population.

- **Clinical history**: Children with hip pathology may present with pain, refusal to bear weight, limp, or decreased movement of the lower extremity. If pain is present, it is important to determine its origin, as pelvis and low back pathology may refer pain to the hip region, and hip pathology commonly presents with referred thigh or knee pain. Intra-articular hip pathology is usually localized to the groin. Once the pain is localized to the hip region, there is a limited differential diagnosis based on age and presentation. Diagnostic imaging is then useful to confirm the diagnosis.

The clinical history should include a thorough description of the pain characteristics (location, character, onset, duration, change with activity or rest).
