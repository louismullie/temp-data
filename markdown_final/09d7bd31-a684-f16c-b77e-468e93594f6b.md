## Question

Duloxetine premedication for herpes zoster reactivation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether duloxetine premedication at the time of acute herpes zoster reduces the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia and how to interpret the PROCESS trial and guidelines to apply this in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and standard of care for acute zoster. Then, I should verify the trial design, outcomes, and statistical interpretation of PROCESS. Next, I will appraise the evidence quality and consider confounding and bias. After that, I should compare these findings with existing guidelines and weigh benefits versus risks. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, patient-centered recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline standard of care. Acute herpes zoster in adults 50 years and older should be treated with prompt antiviral therapy within 72 hours of rash onset to reduce acute pain and complications, while established postherpetic neuralgia is managed with agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, topical lidocaine, or duloxetine itself as a treatment for PHN rather than as a preventive in the acute phase [^1144a2e5] [^597c8854] [^bf1b2d6f].

> Now, I need to check the PROCESS trial details carefully. PROCESS was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial in adults aged 50 years and older with HZ presenting within 72 hours of vesicle onset, comparing duloxetine 60 mg daily for 12 weeks versus control, with the primary endpoint of PHN incidence at 12 weeks defined as any VAS pain score greater than 0 mm, and secondary endpoints including VAS greater than 0 and VAS 3 or higher at 12 weeks [^e16466c5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the primary outcome. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, PHN occurred in 22.9% with duloxetine versus 28.8% with control, a 5.9% absolute reduction that did not reach statistical significance at P equals 0.067, so the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint despite a numerically lower PHN rate in the duloxetine arm [^e16466c5].

> Wait, let me verify the secondary outcomes because they might still be clinically meaningful. The trial reported significant reductions in participants with VAS greater than 0 and VAS 3 or higher at 12 weeks, suggesting that duloxetine reduced the proportion with clinically meaningful pain even if it did not significantly reduce the binary PHN incidence, which aligns with duloxetine's mechanism as an SNRI for neuropathic pain modulation [^e16466c5].

> I should double-check the evidence quality and limitations. The trial was open-label, which introduces potential performance and ascertainment bias, and the primary endpoint definition of any VAS greater than 0 is sensitive but nonspecific, potentially capturing trivial pain. Additionally, the absolute risk reduction of about 6% is modest and the confidence interval likely crosses zero, consistent with a nonsignificant P value, so the certainty for PHN prevention remains low to moderate at best [^e16466c5].

> Next, I should review how this fits with existing guidelines. Major guidelines emphasize antivirals within 72 hours for acute zoster and list duloxetine as a treatment option for established PHN, but they do not recommend duloxetine premedication during acute zoster to prevent PHN, reflecting the absence of definitive preventive evidence and the need for replication before routine adoption [^1144a2e5] [^e16466c5] [^bf1b2d6f].

> Let me consider the balance of benefits and risks. Potential benefits include modest reductions in pain burden and a nonsignificant trend toward less PHN, while risks include gastrointestinal adverse effects, sleep disturbance, dizziness, and drug interactions, with particular caution warranted in older adults with polypharmacy and comorbidities; given the lack of a robust PHN prevention signal, routine use for prophylaxis is not justified outside a trial setting [^e16466c5].

> But wait, what if the pain reduction itself is clinically important even without changing PHN incidence. I should confirm that the secondary pain outcomes, while statistically significant, are exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for practice change; thus, duloxetine may be considered for acute zoster pain control on a case-by-case basis, but it should not replace antivirals or be used solely to prevent PHN pending stronger evidence [^e16466c5] [^1144a2e5].

> I will now translate this into a practical approach. Ensure timely antiviral therapy with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir within 72 hours, manage acute pain with acetaminophen or NSAIDs as appropriate, and consider adding gabapentin or pregabalin for moderate to severe pain. Reserve duloxetine for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to first-line options, and if used, discuss the uncertain PHN prevention benefit and monitor closely for adverse effects and interactions [^1144a2e5] [^f27514b4] [^5ccd6c33].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make sure I am not overstating. The PROCESS trial provides preliminary but inconclusive evidence that duloxetine premedication during acute zoster may reduce pain at 12 weeks and shows a nonsignificant trend toward less PHN. It does not establish duloxetine as effective for PHN prevention, so routine prophylactic use is not recommended by current guidelines, and clinicians should prioritize antivirals and established acute pain strategies while individualizing adjuvant choices [^e16466c5] [^1144a2e5] [^f27514b4].

---

Duloxetine premedication during acute herpes zoster **does not significantly reduce** the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) at 12 weeks compared with standard care, although it may modestly reduce acute pain severity [^e16466c5]. Current guidelines **do not recommend** duloxetine for PHN prevention; instead, prioritize early antivirals and established neuropathic pain therapies. Duloxetine is reasonable for acute zoster pain when first-line options are contraindicated or ineffective, but it should not be used solely to prevent PHN.

---

## Clinical evidence from the PROCESS trial

The PROCESS trial was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study that enrolled adults aged ≥ 50 years with herpes zoster within 72 hours of rash onset [^e16466c5]. Participants were randomized to duloxetine 60 mg daily for 12 weeks plus standard care versus standard care alone. The primary outcome was PHN incidence at 12 weeks, defined as any pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) > 0 mm.

- **Primary outcome**: PHN incidence at 12 weeks was 22.9% with duloxetine vs 28.8% with control (P = 0.067), not statistically significant.
- **Secondary outcomes**: Significantly fewer participants had VAS > 0 or VAS ≥ 3 at 12 weeks with duloxetine, indicating reduced pain severity.
- **Conclusion**: Duloxetine did not significantly reduce PHN incidence but reduced pain severity at 12 weeks.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments and guidelines

Standard PHN prevention focuses on **early antiviral therapy** (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) within 72 hours of rash onset to reduce acute pain and complications, though its effect on PHN prevention is modest and inconsistent across studies [^1144a2e5] [^1ec410f1]. For established PHN, **first-line therapies** include gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and topical lidocaine; duloxetine is recommended as a treatment option for PHN but not for prevention [^f27514b4] [^bf1b2d6f].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Duloxetine is generally well tolerated, but **clinicians should consider**:

- **Common adverse effects**: Nausea, dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, constipation, and fatigue.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Risk increases with other serotonergic drugs.
- **Hepatic impairment**: Use caution in patients with liver disease.
- **Drug interactions**: CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase duloxetine levels.

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Based on current evidence, **duloxetine premedication during acute herpes zoster**:

- **Does not significantly reduce PHN incidence** at 12 weeks [^e16466c5].
- **May reduce acute pain severity**, which could improve quality of life during the acute phase.
- **Is not recommended by current guidelines** for PHN prevention; use first-line antivirals and established neuropathic pain therapies [^1144a2e5] [^f27514b4].
- **May be considered for acute pain** when first-line options are contraindicated or ineffective, but not solely to prevent PHN.

---

## Future research directions

Further research is needed to clarify duloxetine's role in acute herpes zoster, including larger trials powered for PHN endpoints, head-to-head comparisons with gabapentinoids or TCAs, and studies in high-risk populations (e.g. elderly, immunocompromised). Additionally, investigations into **optimal dosing, duration, and timing** of duloxetine administration are warranted.

---

Duloxetine premedication during acute herpes zoster **does not significantly reduce PHN incidence** at 12 weeks, though it may reduce acute pain severity. It is not recommended for PHN prevention; prioritize early antivirals and established neuropathic pain therapies. Duloxetine may be considered for acute pain when first-line options are unsuitable, but not for PHN prevention.

### PROCESS trial: effect of duloxetine premedication for postherpetic neuralgia within 72 hours of herpes zoster reactivation – A randomized controlled trial [^e16466c5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common chronic complication of herpes zoster (HZ) and results in severe refractory neuropathic pain. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of premedication with duloxetine in the prevention of PHN.

Methods

The PROCESS trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial used a 1:1 duloxetine:control ratio. Adults 50 years or older with HZ who presented with vesicles within 72 hours were recruited. The primary outcome was the incidence of PHN at 12 weeks. PHN was defined as any pain intensity score other than 0mm on the visual analog scale (VAS) at week 12 after the onset of the rash. The secondary outcomes were the number of participants with VAS > 0 and VAS ≥ 3. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) principle and per-protocol (PP) principle were used for the primary outcome analysis.

Results

A total of 375 participants were randomly assigned to the duloxetine group and 375 were assigned to the control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of PHN in the duloxetine group compared with the control group in the mITT analysis (86 [22.9%] of 375 vs 108 [28.8%] of 375; P = 0.067). PP analysis produced similar results. However, there were significant differences between the 2 groups in the number of participants with VAS > 0 and VAS ≥ 3 (P < .05 for all comparisons).

Conclusions

Although absolute prevention of PHN does not occur, this trial found that premedication with duloxetine can reduce pain associated with HZ, and therefore can have clinically relevant benefits. Clinical Trials Registration. Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04313335. Registered on 18 March 2020.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^597c8854]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster, or shingles, is caused by reactivation of varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. There are an estimated 1 million cases in the Unites States annually, with an individual lifetime risk of 30%. Patients with conditions that decrease cell-mediated immunity are 20 to 100 times more likely to develop herpes zoster. Patients may present with malaise, headache, low-grade fever, and abnormal skin sensations for two to three days before the classic maculopapular rash appears. The rash is usually unilateral, confined to a single dermatome, and typically progresses to clear vesicles that become cloudy and crust over in seven to 10 days. Herpes zoster can be treated with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, ideally within 72 hours of the development of the rash. Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common complication, occurring in about one in five patients. It is defined as pain in a dermatomal distribution sustained for at least 90 days after acute herpes zoster. Treatment is focused on symptom control and includes topical lidocaine or capsaicin and oral gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants. The varicella zoster virus vaccine decreases the incidence of herpes zoster and is approved for adults 50 years and older. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends this vaccine for adults 60 years and older, except for certain immunosuppressed patients.

Introduction

The main risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia is increasing age; it is uncommon in people under 50 years, but develops in 20% of people aged 60–65 years who have had acute herpes zoster, and in more than 30% of those people aged over 80 years. Up to 2% of people with acute herpes zoster may continue to have postherpetic pain for 5 years or more.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions, during an acute attack of herpes zoster, aimed at preventing postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions to relieve established postherpetic neuralgia after the rash has healed? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, dextromethorphan, dressings, gabapentin, oral antiviral agents, oral opioid analgesics, topical anaesthesia (lidocaine), topical antiviral agents (idoxuridine), topical counterirritants (capsaicin), tricyclic antidepressants.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f1446488]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (zoster) (i.e., shingles) and its sequelae, which was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of zoster and its sequelae, describes the zoster vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use among adults aged ≥ 60 years in the United States. Zoster is a localized, generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) decades after initial VZV infection is established. Approximately one in three persons will develop zoster during their lifetime, resulting in an estimated 1 million episodes in the United States annually. A common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last months or even years. The risk for PHN in patients with zoster is 10%-18%. Another complication of zoster is eye involvement, which occurs in 10%-25% of zoster episodes and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring, and loss of vision. Approximately 3% of patients with zoster are hospitalized; many of these episodes involved persons with one or more immunocompromising conditions. Deaths attributable to zoster are uncommon among persons who are not immunocompromised. Prompt treatment with the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir decreases the severity and duration of acute pain from zoster. Additional pain control can be achieved in certain patients by supplementing antiviral agents with corticosteroids and with analgesics. Established PHN can be managed in certain patients with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents. Licensed zoster vaccine is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of VZV, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. In a large clinical trial, zoster vaccine was partially efficacious at preventing zoster. It also was partially efficacious at reducing the severity and duration of pain and at preventing PHN among those developing zoster. Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine should be offered at the patient's first clinical encounter with his or her health-care provider. It is administered as a single 0.65 mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm. A booster dose is not licensed for the vaccine. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing PHN, or to treat ongoing PHN. Before administration of zoster vaccine, patients do not need to be asked about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or to have serologic testing conducted to determine varicella immunity.

### Postherpetic neuralgia [^00cc3800]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there is some variability (depending on the definition of postherpetic neuralgia), about 10% of those with zoster will have persisting pain 1 month after the rash. The main risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia is increasing age; it is uncommon in people aged < 50 years, but develops in 20% of people aged 60 to 65 years who have had acute herpes zoster, and in > 30% of those people aged > 80 years. Up to 2% of people with acute herpes zoster may continue to have postherpetic pain for 5 years or more.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions aimed at preventing herpes zoster and subsequent postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions during an acute attack of herpes zoster aimed at preventing postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions to relieve established postherpetic neuralgia after the rash has healed? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 41 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, capsaicin, dextromethorphan, dressings, gabapentin, herpes zoster vaccine, oral antiviral agents, oral opioid analgesics, lidocaine, topical antiviral agents (idoxuridine), and tricyclic antidepressants.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia now and in the future [^57e3d7af]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) — a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) — can cause significant morbidity. Its major complication is pain, particularly post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We will review the current management strategies available for the treatment of both acute HZ and PHN, including antiviral drugs, analgesic agents, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants and topical therapies. New molecules in development that show improved activity against VZV are also covered, and new drug targets are outlined. The role of translational neuroscience in moving towards a goal of finding disease-modifying treatments will be examined.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^5bf6ce3f]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles. 1

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. 2, 3 The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7‐10 days but may take up to a month to heal; however, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients.

Zoster‐associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset. 4, 5

Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ‐related burden of illness. 6, 7, 8, 9 Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset. 10 Current interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti‐epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. 8 This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning. 11

Although the widespread use of the herpes zoster vaccine has reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN, 12 a large percentage (∼90% in the US) of the at‐risk population does not receive the vaccine. 13 About half of people, 60 years of age or older who have had the shingles vaccine, fail to respond (eg, primary failure meaning they failed to seroconvert after vaccination) and may go on to develop HZ. 12, 14 In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine has been shown to decline over time (eg, secondary vaccine failure). 15, 16

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous fosphenytoin for patients with acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a placebo-controlled randomized trial [^2d8aafec]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common viral disease caused by reactivation of the varicella‐zoster virus, which lies latent in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal and cranial nerves subsequent to primary varicella‐zoster virus infection. The clinical course of HZ consists of acute (up to 1 month), subacute, and chronic phases. The acute phase is characterized by a dermatomal skin rash with vesicles, the duration of which is related to the age of the patient and to the dermatomes involved. Contagion is highest during the phase when the rash is vesicular. Pain in the acute phase is described as pulsating, shooting, burning, or piercing. Early attenuation of acute pain may prevent the initiation of central mechanisms of chronic pain, thus, potentially reducing the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Greater acute pain is a risk factor for PHN.

Acute herpetic pain is predominantly nociceptive, whereas PHN — the chronic pain phase of HZ — is neuropathic. These two categories of pain, the pathogenic mechanisms of which are considered to differ, are difficult to strictly distinguish from each other and may coexist in some clinical settings. In recent years, this series of pain became collectively termed "zoster‐associated pain" (ZAP). Nonopioid analgesics (e.g. nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and acetaminophen) are prescribed as first‐line therapeutic drugs for acute ZAP. However, some patients with severe pain have difficulty achieving pain relief with NSAIDs alone. Therefore, off‐label administration of therapeutic drugs for neuropathic pain, opioid analgesics, and analgesic adjuncts (e.g. antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and antiepileptics) may be attempted.

2.2 Recommended Pretreatment Medications

Administer the following pretreatment medications 1 to 3 hours before each dose of the TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule, which includes step-up dose 1, step-up dose 2, and the first treatment dose (see Table 1), to reduce the risk of CRS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Corticosteroid (oral or intravenous dexamethasone 16 mg)
Histamine-1 (H1) receptor antagonist (oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg or equivalent)
Antipyretics (oral or intravenous acetaminophen 650 mg to 1,000 mg or equivalent)

Administration of pretreatment medications may be required prior to administration of subsequent doses of TECVAYLI in the following patients:

Patients who repeat doses within the TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule following a dose delay [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
Patients who experienced CRS following the prior dose of TECVAYLI [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Prophylaxis for Herpes Zoster Reactivation

Prior to starting treatment with TECVAYLI, consider initiation of antiviral prophylaxis to prevent herpes zoster reactivation per guidelines.

2.3 Restarting TECVAYLI after Dosage Delay

If a dose of TECVAYLI is delayed, restart therapy based on the recommendations in Table 2 and resume the treatment schedule accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Administer pretreatment medications as indicated in Table 2. Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, patients should be hospitalized for 48 hours after administration of all doses within the TECVAYLI step-up dosing schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

### Prevention strategies for herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia [^48e73c27]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Impairment of varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immunity, including impairment due to immunosenescence, is associated with an increased risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ), whereas levels of anti-VZV antibodies do not correlate with HZ risk. This crucial role of VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity suggests that boosting these responses by vaccination will be an effective strategy for reducing the burden of HZ. Other strategies focus on preventing the major complication of HZ — post-herpetic neuralgia. These strategies include pre-emptive treatment with drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants and analgesics.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^60b65146]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment and nonspecific management of zoster and PHN — pain control and patient advice: Approaches used for control of acute zoster pain include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, anticonvulsants, capsaicin, and topical anesthetics, and many of these same modalities are used for control of chronic PHN pain; in more severe instances of pain, referral to a pain specialist, or even hospitalization and administration of epidural analgesics, is often considered. Elderly persons might be unable to tolerate psychotropic and other medications for management of their acute zoster or chronic PHN pain. Patients with uncomplicated zoster should be advised to keep the rash clean and dry, to avoid topical antibiotics, and, if possible, to keep the rash covered, and they should alert their physician if the rash worsens or they have fever, which could indicate bacterial superinfection.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^b876ed7d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol; moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### Adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine decreases herpes zoster-associated pain and the use of pain medication across 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^d40f76b0]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Although antiviral treatment of HZ, if administered early after the onset of an episode, can provide certain relief, most patients will require some form of analgesia to manage HZ-associated pain. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly prescribed for treatment of mild pain; however, to date, their ability to decrease HZ-associated pain remains to be demonstrated. Conversely, opioids and adjuvant analgesics, such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants, were shown to be effective in reducing HZ pain. However, issues of tolerance, as well as potential misuse and abuse raise concerns regarding the use of these medications, particularly in elderly or IC patients who may present the added complexity of pre-existing comorbidity and polypharmacy. In the 3 studies presented here, nonopioid and weak opioid painkillers seem to be the most frequently used type of medication (44.3%-61.2% and 13.0%-21.7%, respectively). Although the corticosteroid prednisone was previously shown to be effective in reducing acute pain (but not PHN) when used in combination with antiviral therapy, this type of medication was used by only 4.5% to 9.1% of study participants having experienced a confirmed HZ episode. As suggested in the present and associated studies, eligible individuals who received RZV may also have a lower need for pain relief during HZ breakthrough, thereby mitigating risks of overmedication.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^0a471881]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The recognizable appearance and the dermatomal distribution of herpes zoster lesions usually enable a clinical diagnosis to be made easily. Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occur mainly in older patients. The role of the varicella vaccine in preventing herpes zoster is uncertain, but is being studied. There is evidence to support using antiviral therapy and possibly low-dose tricyclic antidepressants to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. There is good evidence that treating herpes zoster with antiviral medication is beneficial, particularly in patients older than 50 years with severe outbreaks. The use of steroids has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. In patients who develop postherpetic neuralgia, there is good evidence to support treatment with gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants. More evidence for treatment with capsaicin cream, lidocaine patch, and opioids is needed. Intrathecal methylprednisolone is an option for patients with persistent pain.

2.1 Patients

Patients were ≥ 50 years of age, had a clinical diagnosis of HZ as evidenced by a unilateral dermatomal rash present for ≤ 72 h, and had zoster‐related pain as defined by a ZBPI worst pain score > 0.

Patients were excluded for multidermatomal, disseminated, or ophthalmic HZ; impaired renal function, immunosuppression; gastrointestinal dysfunction that could interfere with absorption; chronic pain requiring narcotic analgesics; the use of tricyclic antidepressants, systemic or cutaneous antivirals within 30 days of enrollment, or CYP3A4‐inhibiting protease inhibitors, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.

2.2 Assessments

At screening (Day 1), a complete medical history, physical exam, lesion assessment, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory specimens (blood for hematology and chemistry, and urine for urinalysis), and a lesion swab for qualitative VZV determination, were obtained. Pain and zoster pain‐related interference in functional categories were evaluated using the ZBPI. When eligibility was confirmed, patients received their first dose of study drug.

Patients completed visits on Days 3, 5, and 7 during the dosing period, and at Days 10, 14, 21, 30, 42, 56, and 90 days post‐dose. Lesion assessments continued until complete healing was demonstrated. Patients continued to complete ZBPIs on Days 42, 56, and 90 unless they achieved two consecutive visits (starting on Day 30 or later) without HZ‐associated pain.

At each visit, the investigators assessed lesions and patients completed the ZBPI. Blood and urine samples for laboratory testing were collected on Days 3, 7, 14, and 30. Vital signs were taken on Days 5 and 7, and ECGs were performed on Days 3, 7, and 30. Adverse events and concomitant medications (including pain medications) were recorded throughout the study. The numbers of capsules and caplets remaining in the study drug wallet on Day 7 were recorded to assess study medication compliance.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common cutaneous entity with protean clinical presentations, management options, complication rates, and prevention strategies, all of which are rife with dogma. During an inpatient consultation for HZ, have you ever been approached by a frantic staff or family member, worried that a pregnant, elderly, or infant contact will be 'infected' if they get too close? Have your patients ever asked you about their risk of having HZ twice, or claimed that they have frequent 'recurrences'? In what timeline should antiviral therapy be employed? Is there evidence for prednisone or gabapentin in acute HZ treatment? Who should be vaccinated against HZ and what are the benefits and risks? In case-based form, these and other complex but common scenarios will be examined using clinical and viral mechanistic clues, along with updated treatment and prevention guidelines, to provide a modern HZ case management compendium, comprehensive of the diverse age and health populations now presenting with this condition.

2.3 Recommended Concomitant Medications

Pre-infusion Medication

Administer the following pre-infusion medications 1 hour to 3 hours before every DARZALEX infusion:

Corticosteroid (long- or intermediate-acting)

Monotherapy:

Administer methylprednisolone 100 mg (or equivalent) intravenously. Following the second infusion, consider reducing the dose to 60 mg (or equivalent) administered either orally or intravenously.

 In Combination:

Administer dexamethasone 20 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously.

When dexamethasone is the background regimen-specific corticosteroid, the dexamethasone dose that is part of the background regimen will serve as pre-medication on DARZALEX infusion days [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Do not administer background regimen-specific corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) on DARZALEX infusion days when patients have received dexamethasone (or equivalent) as a pre-medication.

Acetaminophen 650 mg to 1,000 mg orally
Diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg (or equivalent) orally or intravenously.

Post-infusion Medication

Administer the following post-infusion medications:

Monotherapy:

Administer methylprednisolone 20 mg (or an equivalent dose of an intermediate- or long-acting corticosteroid) orally for 2 days starting the day after the administration of DARZALEX.

 In Combination:

Consider administering oral methylprednisolone at a dose of less than or equal to 20 mg (or an equivalent dose of an intermediate- or long-acting corticosteroid) beginning the day after the administration of a DARZALEX infusion.

If a background regimen-specific corticosteroid (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone) is administered the day after the DARZALEX infusion, additional corticosteroids may not be needed [see Clinical Studies (14)].

For patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, consider prescribing short and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Following the first 4 DARZALEX infusions, consider discontinuing these additional post-infusion medications, if the patient does not experience a major infusion-related reaction.

Prophylaxis for Herpes Zoster Reactivation

Initiate antiviral prophylaxis to prevent herpes zoster reactivation within 1 week after starting DARZALEX and continue for 3 months following the end of treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Price of pain: population-based cohort burden of disease analysis of medication cost of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^9924eed2]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

PHN is a challenging condition to treat, and the effectiveness of pharmacological therapy is limited. The Canadian Pain Society consensus statement on the treatment of neuropathic pain recommends as first-line therapy for PHN one of the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentin, or pregabalin. Opioids and topical lidocaine are listed as second-line alternatives. The European Federation of Neurological Societies 2010 treatment guidelines for neuropathic pain largely echo these recommendations. Opioids, while effective, are not recommended as first-line therapy due to side effects, development of tolerance, and risk of dependency. A variety of other drugs are also discussed in the literature, including those used for other forms of neuropathy, although their efficacy for PHN is disputed. These include valproic acid/divalproex sodium, duloxetine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, tramadol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.–

While treatment of PHN remains difficult, it is possible to reduce the risk of HZ, and with it PHN, with the HZ vaccine (Zostavax II ®, Merck & Co. Inc. Kenilworth, NJ, USA). This vaccine has been shown to reduce the relative risk of HZ by 51% and of PHN by almost 67%. Vaccines may decrease the chance of developing HZ, but HZ and the associated PHN are expected to continue to result in a significant burden to society in the near future.

To determine the incidence of HZ and rates of PHN, a retrospective cohort study was conducted in Manitoba, Canada, over a period of 17 years. The objectives were to determine the burden of disease of zoster-related pain and to understand the major cost drivers in the changing cost of treating HZ.

### Recent topics in the management of herpes zoster [^7e28ab65]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster is a disease caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that has been latently infecting the body and is more common among the elderly. In Japan, the incidence of herpes zoster has been increasing steadily and is expected to increase further in the future. In 2016, the varicella vaccine was expanded to include prevention of herpes zoster, and a new subunit vaccine was also launched in 2020. In recent years, anti-herpesvirus drugs with novel pharmacological effects have also been introduced, and the environment surrounding the treatment of herpes zoster is entering a new era.

### Post-herpetic neuralgia case study: optimizing pain control [^b68761f7]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic pain syndrome associated with the reactivation of a primary infection with varicella zoster virus (chicken pox), which leads to a chronic infection of the dorsal root ganglia. Under various clinical circumstances, including immunosuppressive diseases or treatments and certain cancers, reactivation of the infection can occur in adults as shingles. Other factors such as psychological distress and stressful life events also appear to play a role in the onset of shingles and the development of PHN. The most common risk factor for shingles and its potential sequela, PHN, is advanced age. For a significant number of patients, the pain following healing of shingles can persist for months to years; this pain is classified as PHN if it persists longer than 3 months. PHN often leads to depression, disrupted sleep, decreased functioning and increased healthcare utilization. Prompt use of antiviral therapy appears to reduce the period of pain following an episode of shingles by about half and may possibly reduce the overall incidence of PHN. Damage to a variety of neurologic pathways as a result of herpes zoster reactivation suggests that intervention with multiple agents having divergent mechanisms of action is an appropriate treatment approach. Current treatment options aimed at relieving the symptoms of PHN include antidepressants, opioids, anticonvulsants and topical analgesics. It is important for the clinician to establish a baseline pain intensity and character as well as quality of life measures against which to judge the effectiveness of any treatment. This review article features a case study of a patient with PHN to illustrate current diagnostic and treatment approaches.

### Management of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^a2560f8f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with herpes zoster experience severe pain and potential lasting complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, ophthalmic disease/damage, and, rarely, skin complications (eg, infection of rash area). Treatment for acute zoster aims to accelerate healing, control pain, and, when possible, reduce the risk of complications. Early intervention with antivirals can accelerate rash healing, reduce rash severity, and reduce the risk of some complications. The addition of corticosteroids to antiviral medication may further alleviate short-term zoster pain, but is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse effects, especially among older adults. If a patient does develop postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine patch 5%, and capsaicin may all be considered as palliative treatments. For individuals with treatment-refractory postherpetic neuralgia, nonpharmacologic approaches may be considered and a pain-management specialist should be consulted. There is a need for more effective agents to treat herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.

### Treatment and prevention of postherpetic neuralgia [^db8c508a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

There have been 4 recent major advances in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) that are based on the results of randomized, controlled trials. These advances are the demonstrations that gabapentin, the lidocaine patch 5%, and opioid analgesics are efficacious in patients with PHN, and the report that nortriptyline and amitriptyline provide equivalent analgesic benefits for patients with PHN but that nortriptyline is better tolerated. The results of these clinical trials are briefly reviewed, and their implications for the treatment of patients with PHN are discussed. Despite these treatment advances, many patients remain refractory to current therapy, and the prevention of PHN has therefore become an important focus of current research. Research on administration of the varicella-zoster vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and on treatment of patients who have herpes zoster with combined antiviral and analgesic therapy to prevent PHN is discussed.

### Daratumumab (Darzalex) [^8e2c6d40]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of daratumumab IV (also known as Darzalex):
- **Acute exacerbations of COPD**: use caution in patients with COPD. Consider administering post-infusion short- and long-acting bronchodilators and ICSs.
- **Decreased blood neutrophil count, decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab can increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor CBC.
- **Infusion-related reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab has been associated with an increased risk of severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. Administer corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine 1–3 hours before infusion for premedication, along with post-infusion corticosteroids.
- **Interference with determination of treatment response**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody and can interfere with determination of complete response and disease progression in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
- **Positive indirect Coombs test**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and may results in a false-positive indirect Coombs test.
- **Reactivation of herpes zoster**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab has been reported to cause reactivation of herpes zoster. Initiate antiviral prophylaxis for herpes zoster reactivation within 1 week after starting and continue for 3 months after treatment.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^b1256590]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of vaccination, a communication gap between primary medical providers and patients hinders satisfactory prevention of VZV and HZ. PHN incidence is on the rise, the effective management of PHN remains an ongoing challenge, and no single best therapy has yet been identified. Current guidelines for management of PHN pain recommend gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), opioids, topical agents, and combination therapies with different mechanisms of action (Figure 2).–However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved four oral systemic medications, all of which are gabapentinoids, and two topical analgesics specifically for the management of pain associated with PHN (Figure 2).

A carefully devised, individually based treatment plan is critical to ensure optimal outcomes in the management of PHN. Pain and its interference with daily activities are subjective symptoms and difficult to manage effectively, even more so in older patients, who are predominantly afflicted with PHN, and who are more likely to have multiple chronic health issues and declining function and frailty. A significant number of patients who develop chronic pain associated with PHN do not receive evidence-based, recommended treatment modalities, leaving many patients undertreated and dissatisfied with the treatment. To ensure optimal results, the initial choice of PHN pain therapy should be guided not only by drug efficacy but also by the patient's comorbidities, severity of PHN pain, the drugs' adverse-event and drug-interaction profiles, titration regimen, and patient preference, especially since no single therapy has demonstrated superior effectiveness. Because PHN is a complex condition and should not be simplified to a localized area of pain, the most practical therapeutic approach may involve a systemic medication or combination therapy rather than topical analgesics alone. Finally, clear communication with the patient and frequent monitoring of adverse reactions and patient satisfaction with the treatment should be established.

### Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a review of therapeutic options [^05d8a213]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a disabling consequence of the reactivation of the varicella zoster infection. The observation that patients with PHN experience various types of pain suggests that multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms are involved, which may include the peripheral and central nervous systems. A reasonable initial strategy would involve selecting from among multiple agents that have complementary mechanisms of action and that have been proven effective in controlled clinical trials, such as the lidocaine patch 5%, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and opioids. Based on initial assessment and ongoing reassessment, sequential trials should be undertaken until adequate pain relief is achieved. This may ultimately lead to therapy with more than one medication. Safety and tolerability are important considerations in choosing initial therapy, particularly in older patients. Physicians can either add another agent to the current regimen or switch to a new type of monotherapy if there is inadequate response to initial therapy. Alternative therapies, (i.e., ketamine, intrathecal corticosteroid injections) have not been adequately studied. Well-designed, multicenter, controlled clinical trials are needed to develop a treatment algorithm that provides an evidence-based, rational approach to treating PHN.

### Herpes zoster antivirals and pain management [^fc4449d1]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Topic

Evaluation of evidence-based strategies for managing herpes zoster (HZ) and the pain of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Clinical Relevance

Approximately 20% of the world's population suffers from herpes zoster at least once in a lifetime, with 10% to 20% having ophthalmic involvement. Treatment of the acute disease with oral antivirals may reduce the incidence and severity of complications but does not reliably prevent PHN or postherpetic itch (PHI). The acute pain abates as the acute phase resolves; the long-term pain of PHN or PHI may be severe and difficult to manage. Although many therapeutic agents have efficacy in the management of these complications, relief is frequently partial for months to the remainder of the lifetime.

Methods

Literature review was performed using the resources of the Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Ophthalmic library as well as the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health PubMed service searching by pertinent topics, authors, and journals.

Results

If started within 72 hours of the onset of the acute HZ rash, the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir significantly shorten the periods of acute pain, virus shedding, rash, acute and late-onset anterior segment complications, and, in the case of valacyclovir and famciclovir, the incidence and severity of PHN. However, these medications do not prevent PHN, which remains a common and debilitating complication of HZ in older patients, requiring assiduous pain management. Tricyclic antidepressants, antiseizure drugs, opioids, and topical analgesics all offer some pain relief, and may be combined.

Conclusion

Options are available to manage HZ and reduce the pain of PHN. However, prevention, now possible with the HZ vaccine, is preferable to treatment.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^7bcdbd07]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a neuropathic pain syndrome resulting from damage to nerve fibers, is the most common complication of herpes zoster (HZ; shingles), and the cause of the greatest HZ-related burden of illness.–HZ is a viral disease caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) that had remained latent in sensory ganglia since the primary infection (chicken pox), and is characterized by a painful skin rash, usually limited to the area innervated by a single sensory ganglion (Figure 1).PHN is usually diagnosed in individuals who have recovered from the HZ skin rash but who have continued to experience pain for at least 3 months, although for some patients pain can persist for years.

PHN pain occurs in the same dermatomes as the HZ rash, and is likely the result of damage to the nervous system (which may include deafferentation, peripheral and/or central sensitization, myelin destruction, inflammation, and signaling errors in the brain) that occurred during the proliferation and spread of the virus during the acute HZ infection. The syndrome has consequences permeating multiple aspects of patients' lives, affecting their sleep, concentration, and mood, as well as impacting their physical functionality by interfering with activities of daily living.

As many as 20% of patients with HZ develop PHN. Major risk factors include advanced age and decreased immunity.–Approximately half of all PHN cases occur in persons older than 60 years. Therefore, the incidence of HZ and risk of PHN is likely to increase as the population ages. The declining cell-mediated VZV immunity from immune senescence also contributes to the observed increased prevalence of PHN in the elderly. Finally, the severity of the acute HZ infection and the presence of a notable prodrome have also been associated with increased likelihood of experiencing PHN.–

### Herpes zoster in older adults [^9253c453]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) strikes millions of older adults annually worldwide and disables a substantial number of them via postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Key age-related clinical, epidemiological, and treatment features of zoster and PHN are reviewed. HZ is caused by renewed replication and spread of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in sensory ganglia and afferent peripheral nerves in the setting of age-related, disease-related, and drug-related decline in cellular immunity to VZV. VZV-induced neuronal destruction and inflammation causes the principal problems of pain, interference with activities of daily living, and reduced quality of life in elderly patients. Recently, attempts to reduce or eliminate HZ pain have been bolstered by the findings of clinical trials that antiviral agents and corticosteroids are effective treatment for HZ and that tricyclic antidepressants, topical lidocaine, gabapentin, and opiates are effective treatment for PHN. Although these advances have helped, PHN remains a difficult condition to prevent and treat in many elderly patients.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is primarily a disease of the elderly and often refractory to treatment. Randomized and controlled trials have yielded several significant advances in the treatment and prevention of this disease. Treatment advances include the lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and gabapentin. However, no treatment regimen fully eliminates the pain. Improvements in prevention include prompt recognition and treatment of high-risk herpes zoster (HZ) patients with antiviral and analgesic therapies. Even with these advances, PHN remains a debilitating and painful disease. Vaccines offer the greatest promise of relief. The childhood vaccine against varicella zoster virus offers long-lasting immunity, largely preventing HZ and PHN. But most adults have already had varicella and are at risk for HZ and PHN as they age. Therefore, a more potent vaccine against varicella has been developed for use in adults. This vaccine offers a new and significant advance in the prevention of HZ and its most noteworthy complication, PHN.

### Consequences and management of pain in herpes zoster [^f799b151]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of herpes zoster, particularly in the elderly and in persons with severe symptoms at presentation. Unless varicella vaccination reduces the incidence of herpes zoster and attenuates the risk and/or severity of complications, PHN will continue to result in significant suffering and remain a consumer of health care and related social support resources. Although there have been useful advances in the management of PHN (e.g., the use of the anticonvulsant gabapentin), some cases remain intractable. Prevention remains the preferred strategy, and antiviral drugs are the most well established means of preventing the development of pain. Other interventions require further evaluation (nerve blocks, acute-phase tricyclic antidepressant or anticonvulsant use). Because prevention of PHN requires early recognition and prompt management of patients presenting with herpes zoster, public education and dissemination of information to all health care personnel involved with the disease are essential.

The alpha-herpesviruses varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) share common features including lifelong persistence in sensory ganglia and the risk of recurrences. For both HSV and VZV, standard-of-care (SoC) is based on nucleoside analogs (NAs), which require specific activation in infected cells. These existing drugs exhibit substantial limitations, warranting the development of new and more effective drugs.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1ec410f1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment and nonspecific management of zoster and PHN — antivirals and corticosteroids: Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are approved by the FDA for zoster in immunocompetent patients, and trials indicate that when taken orally they reduce viral shedding and lesion formation, shorten time to rash healing, and decrease acute zoster pain and the risk for progression to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Many experts recommend that treatment should be considered for all eligible patients with zoster and specifically recommend treatment for persons aged ≥ 50 years who have moderate or severe pain, moderate or severe rash, or involvement of noncranial dermatomes. In clinical trials, treatment has been initiated within 72 hours of rash onset and the benefits of later treatment have not been studied; if treatment cannot be initiated within 72 hours, experts recommend that it should be initiated as soon as possible, particularly in the presence of new vesicle formation or of complications. Two clinical trials assessed corticosteroids with acyclovir; a 3-week tapering course diminished acute zoster pain and decreased time to cutaneous healing, cessation of analgesic therapy, and return of uninterrupted sleep and normal daily activities, but no evidence indicated that use of corticosteroids prevented development of PHN; combinations with valacyclovir or famciclovir have not been studied in clinical trials. No evidence indicates that topical antiviral therapy or corticosteroids without systemic antiviral therapy have a role in treatment of zoster.

Herpes zoster epidemiology and vaccine licensure — Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate clinically decades after initial infection to cause zoster, a localized and generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults; approximately 1 million new cases of zoster occur in the United States annually, and approximately one in three persons in the general population will develop zoster during their lifetime; a common complication is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic pain condition that can last months or even years; in May 2006, a live, attenuated vaccine for prevention of zoster (ZOSTAVAX®, manufactured by Merck & Co, Inc.) was licensed in the United States for use in persons aged ≥ 60 years.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^20f02a7c]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

An estimated one million individuals in the US are diagnosed with herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) each year. Approximately 20% of these patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complex HZ complication characterized by neuropathic pain isolated to the dermatome that was affected by the HZ virus. PHN is debilitating, altering physical function and quality of life, and commonly affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. Despite the availability of an immunization for HZ prevention and several approved HZ treatments, the incidence of PHN is increasing. Furthermore, management of the neuropathic pain associated with PHN is often suboptimal, and the use of available therapeutics may be complicated by adverse effects and complex, burdensome treatment regimens, as well as by patients' comorbidities and polypharmacy, which may lead to drug–drug interactions. Informed and comprehensive assessments of currently available pharmacological treatment options to achieve effective pain control in the primary care setting are needed. In this article, we discuss the situation in clinical practice, review currently recommended prevention and treatment options for PHN, and outline practical considerations for the management of this neuropathic pain syndrome, with a focus on optimal, individual-based treatment plans for use in the primary care setting.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^1178db9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, serious, painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties, and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008, and previously updated in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers (June 2022). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors, and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages, with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified potential articles, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and the certainty of the evidence. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors. We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified five trials with a total of 787 participants that met our inclusion criteria. No new studies were identified for this update. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection in preventing postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.99; 2 trials, 114 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)). The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because they did not provide separate information on the number of participants with PHN at six months. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no observed differences in serious (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.29; 5 trials, 755 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)), or non-serious adverse events (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.87; 5 trials, 755 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision)) between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, two were at unclear risk of bias, and the other was at low risk of bias. The review was first published in 2008; no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010, 2013, and 2023.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current available evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection on preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Corticosteroids given orally or intramuscularly may result in little to no difference in the risk of adverse events in people with acute herpes zoster. Some researchers have recommended using corticosteroids to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of the disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life, as well as updated measures of pain.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^b402ed06]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster reactivation prophylaxis in HIV — long-term administration of anti-VZV drugs to prevent episodes of herpes zoster is not routinely recommended (AII). In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in Africa evaluating daily acyclovir prophylaxis, acyclovir 400 mg orally [PO] twice a day given to people with HIV/HSV-2 coinfection not taking antiretroviral therapy reduced the rate of herpes zoster by 62%. Acyclovir did not prevent recurrent zoster episodes in patients with prior history of herpes zoster. People with HIV taking suppressive acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for other indications may receive some additional reduction in risk of herpes zoster, but the relative risk reduction in people receiving ART is unknown.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) after zoster — PHN is a persistent pain after resolution of the rash, with pathologic observations including axonal and cell body degeneration, atrophy of the spinal cord dorsal horn, scarring of the dorsal root ganglion, and loss of epidermal innervation; certain experts believe this neuronal damage might be caused by ongoing viral replication. Consensus is lacking regarding criteria to distinguish zoster pain from PHN, and the duration used to define PHN has ranged from any duration after resolution of the rash to periods from ≥ 30 days to ≥ 6 months after rash onset. Regardless of definition, PHN pain can last for weeks or months and occasionally persists for many years.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of daratumumab / hyaluronidase SC (also known as Darzalex Faspro):
- **Acute exacerbations of COPD**: use caution in patients with COPD. Consider administering post-infusion short- and long-acting bronchodilators and ICSs.
- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as serious cardiac adverse reactions have reported in patients with AL amyloidosis who received daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone. Monitor patients with cardiac involvement of AL amyloidosis more frequently for cardiac adverse reactions.
- **Decreased blood neutrophil count, decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab can increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Monitor CBC.
- **Injection site reactions, drug hypersensitivity reaction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab has been associated with an increased risk of both systemic administration-related reactions, including severe or life-threatening reactions, and local injection site reactions. Administer corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine 1–3 hours before injection for premedication, along with post-injection corticosteroids.
- **Interference with determination of treatment response**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody and can interfere with determination of complete response and disease progression in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein.
- **Positive indirect Coombs test**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab binds to CD38 on RBCs and may results in a false-positive indirect Coombs test.
- **Reactivation of herpes zoster**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as daratumumab has been reported to cause reactivation of herpes zoster. Initiate antiviral prophylaxis for herpes zoster reactivation within 1 week after starting and continue for 3 months after treatment.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^6ec7c794]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Practical considerations for management of PHN

For primary care providers, PHN may not present as a distinct entity but rather an extension of the original HZ infection, and monitoring for a global condition affecting multiple aspects of patients' lives rather than for a localized post-HZ pain is paramount. Thus, practical management of PHN can be divided into prevention and treatment of HZ, and the more challenging task of managing the neuropathic pain syndrome and its consequences once PHN has developed (Figure 2).

To date, no cure for PHN exists, only treatments that are palliative and that may shorten the duration and severity of the pain. Therefore, vaccinations to prevent initial chicken pox and thus VZV from ever gaining a foothold in the body in the first place, or vaccinations to prevent reactivation of VZV already present in the body remain a priority; however, there are uncertainties about the vaccines' duration of protection and/or how frequently booster can be given.–For patients who were exposed to VZV and who contracted acute HZ, the primary care provider may use antivirals, analgesics, or corticosteroids to decrease acute pain and possibly decrease the risk of developing PHN.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia [^afaa06e9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster and its sequela post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) are conditions with significant morbidity. PHN is a chronic, debilitating neuropathic pain that can persist long beyond resolution of visible cutaneous manifestations. This paper provides practical guidelines for management of herpes zoster and PHN. For herpes zoster, antivirals should be started, preferably within 72 h of onset, to reduce the severity and duration of the eruptive phase and to reduce the intensity of acute pain. PHN can be treated with either topical or systemic agents. Topical lidocaine and capsaicin are effective. For patients with more severe pain, the following systemic agents can be considered (in decreasing order of recommendation): the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin, the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine, and, lastly, the opioid analgesics tramadol, morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. For patients at high risk of developing PHN, early initiation of gabapentin or amitriptyline after the onset of herpes zoster is suggested. The new zoster vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of herpes zoster and PHN.

### Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster [^bb0af722]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients with herpes zoster (HZ) that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on quality of life, and costs of treatment. Systematic literature reviews, published randomized clinical trials, existing guidelines, and the authors' clinical and research experience relevant to the management of patients with HZ were reviewed at a consensus meeting. The results of controlled trials and the clinical experience of the authors support the use of acyclovir, brivudin (where available), famciclovir, and valacyclovir as first-line antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with HZ. Specific recommendations for the use of these medications are provided. In addition, suggestions are made for treatments that, when used in combination with antiviral therapy, may further reduce pain and other complications of HZ.

### Fire needling acupuncture for adult patients with acute herpes zoster: protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad20f235]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute HZ is triggered by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivating. Primary infection of VZV causes varicella. Once varicella resolves, the virus remains latent in the dorsal root ganglia. With advancing age or immunosuppression, cell-mediated immunity to VZV declines and the virus reactivates to cause acute HZ, occurring anywhere in the body. The risk factors for acute HZ are elderly cell immune deficiency, genetic susceptibility, mechanical trauma, systemic diseases (such as glucose and urine disease, kidney disease, fever and hypertension), recent mental stress, fatigue and other common causes. The risk of HZ in women is higher than that in men. In the general population, the estimated lifetime risk of HZ is roughly 30%, with the risk increasing dramatically after the age of 50.

The treatments of acute HZ aim to reduce the intensity and duration of acute zoster-associated pain (ZAP) and cutaneous symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. According to the European consensus-based (S2k) Guideline on the Management of HZ, these treatments consist of antiviral medication, pain management, and local therapy. Usually, they are used for seven days, commencing 72 hours after the rash appears. Where HZ presents signs of the visceral or central nervous system, these treatments can be provided for up to 21 days.PHN is often refractory to treatment. It is unclear whether the current acute HZ treatments could prevent the occurrence or shorten the duration of PHN. Treatments with established efficacy for PHN consist of gabapentin, pregabalin, topical lidocaine patch, tricyclic antidepressants, and opioid analgesics. However, for many patients, whether taken alone or in combination, these medications are either partially or completely ineffective. The pain caused by PHN can persist for months or even years. The long-term pain often leads to depression, fatigue, insomnia, altered activities of daily living and decreased socialization. The efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of pain diseases has been confirmed by evidence-based medicine, especially for HZ. Relevant meta-analysis proved that fire acupuncture therapy can be used as an effective method to treat pain diseases.

### Postherpetic neuralgia: what do we know and where are we heading? [^2690af9c]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) remains a difficult pain problem for patients and physicians alike. This review describes the epidemiology and pathophysiology of PHN and discusses proposed mechanisms of pain generation and the various treatments currently available. Evidence is scant for the value of surgical and procedural interventions in general, although there are numerous small studies supporting the use of specific interventions such as nerve blocks, neurosurgical procedures and neuroaugmentation. Medical interventions, particularly the use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants remain the best-documented therapies for treating pain associated with PHN. There is good evidence that amitriptyline and gabapentin reduce pain with PHN. Topical local anesthetics, such a lidocaine, may also be helpful. The decision to use a particular agent or intervention may depend on whether there is spontaneous pain, burning or lancinating pain or numbness. Interventions with low risk, such as TENS are appropriate. Although prevention of postherpetic neuralgia appears to be an appropriate strategy, there is little evidence to support the position that medical or interventional approaches (nerve blocks) will prevent PHN after a patient develops acute herpes zoster (HZ). Although antivirals are appropriate for acute HZ, and the use of neural blockade and sympathetic blockade may be helpful in reducing pain in selected patients with HZ, there is little evidence that these interventions will reduce the likelihood of developing PHN.

Herpes zoster pain burden, predictors of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and quality-of-life impact: Approximately half of patients with zoster or PHN describe their pain as "horrible" or "excruciating", ranging in duration from a few minutes to constant on a daily or almost daily basis. The pain can disrupt sleep, mood, work, and activities of daily living, adversely impacting the quality of life and leading to social withdrawal and depression, and anecdotes of suicide among patients suffering from PHN have been reported. Among persons experiencing zoster, predictors of PHN include the occurrence and severity of pain both before and after onset of the rash, the extent of the rash, trigeminal or ophthalmic distribution, and the occurrence of viremia. Table 1 highlights physical, psychological, social, and functional impacts, including "Interferes with activities of daily living (e.g., dressing, bathing, eating, travel, cooking, and shopping)".

Herpes zoster — postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) risk: Drawing conclusions is difficult because PHN definitions vary, but among zoster patients treated with a placebo in clinical trials of antiviral drugs, approximately one third still had pain after 3 months and approximately one fourth had pain at 6 months. In a phase 3 clinical trial of zoster vaccine, zoster occurred among 642 placebo recipients; the risk for pain persisting at least 30, 60, 90, 120 or 180 days was 30.3%, 17.6%, 12.5%, 8.4%, and 5.1%, respectively. In a community-based study, the risk for PHN in patients with zoster was 18%, 13%, and 10% when defining PHN as pain at least 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively.

### Quantification of risk factors for postherpetic neuralgia in herpes zoster patients: a cohort study [^7928dcb5]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Previous studies have not identified depression as a risk factor for PHN, unlike our study. We acknowledge that our result may be driven by patients requiring tricyclic antidepressants for depression, and being misclassified as PHN cases; when restricting PHN cases to diagnosed PHN only, the association with depression disappeared (adjOR 1.12, 99% CI 0.84–1.49). However, the wide CIs suggest there may have been insufficient power to detect an effect.

The study found no evidence that antivirals protected against PHN. This is unlikely to be attributed to inadequate dosing, as 93% of treated patients received at least the recommended minimum antiviral dose. However, other limitations could explain this null finding. In primary care, patients with severe zoster are recommended to receive antivirals, yet are also more likely to develop PHN. This may introduce confounding by indication and mask a protective effect. Also, trial data has assessed the efficacy of antivirals administered within 72 hours of rash onset. Although 97.5% of patients were prescribed antivirals on the day of zoster diagnosis, zoster treatment initiation may occur > 72 hours after rash onset, when the effect of antivirals is unproven. Although data on time from actual rash onset to presentation at general practitioners are not available in this dataset, 2 previous UK studies suggest 50%–65% of patients present within 72 hours, leaving a number of patients treated after 72 hours from rash onset.

Herpes zoster risk in IBD — epidemiology and medication associations shows elevated incidence and drug-related risks. In the general population, about one in three persons develop zoster during their lifetime, and as many as 10–18% develop post‑herpetic neuralgia. In a cohort study, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease had higher zoster incidence than controls (UC incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05–1.40; CD IRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.35–1.92), and corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.1–2.2) and azathioprine/6‑mercaptopurine (adjusted odds ratio, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.7–5.6) were associated with zoster. In a large administrative database, 590,232 CD, 56,403 UC, and 1,269 unspecified IBD cases were matched to 434,416 non‑IBD individuals, with increased zoster risk in IBD (IRR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.60–1.76) and higher risk after adjustment (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.42–1.57); anti‑TNF (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.48–2.21), corticosteroids (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.51–1.99), and thiopurines (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.61–2.13) were independently associated, with the highest risk for combination anti‑TNF plus thiopurine therapy (OR: 3.29, 95% CI: 2.33–4.65).

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common, serious painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008 and previously updated in 2010.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (16 April 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to April 2012), and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2012). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo but not with other treatments. We did not include quasi-RCTs (trials in which a systematic method of randomisation such as alternation or hospital number was used).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors identified potential articles, extracted data, and independently assessed the risk of bias of each trial. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors.

Main Results

Five trials were included with 787 participants in total. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of two trials (114 participants) and the results gave moderate quality evidence that oral corticosteroids did not prevent postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.99). One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, the other was at low risk of bias overall. The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because the outcomes were reported at less than one month or not in sufficient detail to add to the meta-analysis. These three trials were generally at low risk of bias. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no significant differences in serious or non-serious adverse events between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. There was also no significant difference between the treatment groups and placebo groups in other secondary outcome analyses and subgroup analyses. The review was first published in 2008 and no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010 and 2012.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. In people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration of corticosteroids do not appear to be greater than with placebo, based on moderate quality evidence. Corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.

Regarding medical management for primary myelofibrosis, more specifically with respect to JAK inhibitors (pretreatment evaluation and monitoring), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that ruxolitinib is associated with a potentially increased risk of opportunistic infections. Obtain screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV before initiating ruxolitinib. Assess risk factors for mycobacterial infection and herpes zoster reactivation.
Consider offering prophylactic strategies directed to herpes virus family reactivation on an individual basis.

### Severe perianal shingles during azathioprine and budesonide treatment for Crohn's disease-preventable with zoster vaccine? [^b5869117]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those on immunosuppressive medications, suffer a high incidence of, and worse clinical outcomes relating to, herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation. We report on the presentation and management of a patient with Crohn's disease who developed severe perianal HZ after starting azathioprine and oral budesonide treatment. The zoster vaccine may prevent such zoster reactivation in patients with IBD. The zoster vaccine is effective in decreasing the risk of HZ in older adults but its role in younger adults and those with IBD has not been tested prospectively. A review of the potential risks and benefits of this live vaccine in patients with IBD and an approach to further determining its role in this patient population is discussed.

### Herpes zoster in hospitalized adults: practice gaps, new evidence, and remaining questions [^750f2615]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster can present many uncertainties for consulting dermatologists. We review the current guidelines and recent literature on important issues that arise in the care of hospitalized patients with herpes zoster, including infection control isolation practices, treatment courses for zoster and acute zoster-associated pain, and indications for long-term prophylaxis. We present the findings of an inpatient zoster management practices survey of the membership of the Society of Dermatology Hospitalists, an expert resource group of the American Academy of Dermatology, and discuss directions for future investigation and potential opportunities for management improvements in light of these collective data.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^9fa60474]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of HZ

Although still controversial, early treatment of HZ with antiviral agents may decrease the risk of developing or duration of PHN. Three antiviral agents are approved in the US for the treatment of HZ: acyclovir (Zovirax®; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK), famciclovir (Famvir®; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA), and valacyclovir (Valtrex®; GlaxoSmithKline).–To limit the amount of viral replication and reduce the duration of the HZ rash, antivirals should be administered within 72 hours of rash onset. They may be beneficial as long as new lesions are actively being formed, which is important to note, since in clinical practice the diagnosis of HZ is rarely made within 72 hours. However, the safety and efficacy of antivirals in treating HZ or preventing PHN more than 72 hours after rash onset have not been established.–

Antivirals alone are not sufficient to relieve the acute pain associated with HZ. Mild-to-moderate pain can be controlled with a short-acting opioid with acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and gabapentinoids, followed by a TCA, can be added for more severe acute pain. Furthermore, the combination of gabapentin and valacyclovir administered acutely in patients with HZ may reduce the incidence of PHN. Although not recommended routinely for treatment of HZ and most likely ineffective in preventing PHN, corticosteroids are often considered in clinical practice for HZ patients with limited contraindications.

### Prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia from dream to reality: a ten-step model [^8779a2f4]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a painful, blistering skin eruption in a dermatomal distribution caused by reactivation of a latent varicella zoster virus in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of acute herpes zoster (AHZ). Severe prodrome, greater acute pain and dermatomal injury, and the density of the eruption are the risk factors and predictors for developing PHN. PHN has a substantial effect on the quality of life; many patients develop severe physical, occupational, social, and psychosocial disabilities as a result of the unceasing pain. The long-term suffering and the limited efficacy of the currently available medications can lead to drug dependency, hopelessness, depression, and even suicide. Family and society are also affected regarding cost and lost productivity. The pathophysiology of PHN remains unclear. Viral reactivation in the dorsal root ganglion and its spread through the affected nerve result in severe ganglionitis and neuritis, which induce a profound sympathetic stimulation and vasoconstriction of the endoneural arterioles, which decreases the blood flow in the intraneural capillary bed resulting in nerve ischemia. Our rationale is based on previous studies which have postulated that the early interventions could reduce repetitive painful stimuli and prevent vasospasm of the endoneural arterioles during the acute phase of HZ. Hence, they might attenuate the central sensitization, prevent the ischemic nerve damage, and finally account for PHN prevention. The author introduces a new Ten-step Model for the prevention of PHN. The idea of this newly suggested approach is to increase the awareness of the health care team and the community about the nature of HZ and its complications, especially in the high-risk groups. Besides, it emphasizes the importance of the prompt antiviral therapy and the early sympathetic blockades for preventing PHN. Key words: Acute herpes zoster, prevention, post-herpetic neuralgia, sympathetic blockade, ten-step model.
