## Question

MAOI antidepressants

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about MAOI antidepressants, including mechanism, indications, efficacy, safety, interactions, and switching guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical context and mechanism of action to set the foundation. Then, I should verify the primary clinical indications and how guidelines position MAOIs. Next, I will review comparative efficacy data. After that, I need to examine safety, dietary issues, and key contraindications. Finally, I should confirm drug–drug interaction management, washout rules, and practical implementation details including transdermal options and adherence considerations.

> Let me first confirm the core identity and mechanism of action, because if I misstate this, later safety and interaction points could be flawed; MAOIs were among the first modern antidepressants, discovered after mood-elevating effects with the antitubercular agent isoniazid were linked to monoamine oxidase inhibition, leading to increased synaptic serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine rather than reuptake blockade, which underpins the classic monoamine hypothesis of depression [^111in9dP] [^113ru2BL].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled indications before I overgeneralize; I initially thought to cite an FDA label for "MDD" but realized the reference at hand (amoxapine) is not an MAOI and thus would be a mistake for this class, so I need to correct that assumption and rely on guideline syntheses and comparative data for MAOIs' clinical roles in depression, particularly atypical and treatment-resistant presentations, rather than misusing a non-MAOI FDA citation.

> Next, I should review guideline positioning; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about first-line use, because multiple guidelines consistently place MAOIs as third- to fifth-line options due to safety constraints and dietary restrictions, while noting a niche of high-efficacy use in atypical depression, high anxiety, anergic bipolar depression, and treatment-resistant depression, with transdermal selegiline mitigating some dietary concerns and tolerability issues [^113RciBv] [^111SZgcM] [^116czSdP].

> I will now examine efficacy signals to ensure we are not understating their potential; network meta-analytic and focused meta-analytic data suggest robust efficacy for MAOIs, with phenelzine outperforming several comparators in depressive disorders and MAOIs showing superiority over TCAs in atypical depression while appearing comparable to SSRIs in that subtype, which supports selective deployment when the clinical phenotype fits [^113RciBv] [^1167ovHP].

> I need to check the distinctive safety profile and the rationale for dietary and drug restrictions; hypertensive crises can occur with tyramine-rich foods or sympathomimetics, and serotonin syndrome can emerge with serotonergic co-therapies such as SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tramadol, and dextromethorphan, emphasizing the necessity of education and strict interaction control, with newer delivery systems reducing but not eliminating risks [^1134mcHk] [^114nqA9K].

> Hold on, I should verify specific contraindicated combinations that are easy to miss; coadministration with other MAOIs or potent MAO inhibitors like linezolid or IV methylene blue is contraindicated due to nonselective MAO inhibition and hypertensive crisis risk, and serious reactions including serotonin syndrome have been precipitated with opioids such as meperidine, methadone, propoxyphene, and tramadol, while cyclobenzaprine and related tricyclics have been associated with hyperpyretic crises when combined with MAOIs, all of which necessitate deliberate medication reconciliation [^1133zXTy] [^113LVukT] [^112J794N].

> I should double-check the washout rules because timing errors cause many adverse outcomes; at least 14 days must elapse when switching between MAOIs and SSRIs/SNRIs/TCAs and similar serotonergic antidepressants, with a 5-week washout required specifically after stopping fluoxetine before initiating an MAOI due to fluoxetine's long half-life and active metabolite, and the same bidirectional 14-day minimum applies when starting these agents after MAOIs to mitigate serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crises [^111fvnj4] [^1163Vrac] [^113LVukT] [^1133zXTy].

> Let me consider formulation nuances and whether they alter practice; transdermal selegiline lowers gastrointestinal MAO-A exposure at lower patch strengths, thereby reducing tyramine–diet restriction needs compared with oral nonselective MAOIs, although clinicians must still enforce drug interaction precautions and observe standard washout periods, which can expand MAOI use in carefully selected, treatment-resistant patients [^113RciBv] [^111SZgcM] [^116czSdP] [^114nqA9K].

> I need to ensure practical implementation is addressed; comprehensive medication reconciliation (including OTC and herbal agents like St. John's wort), patient education about tyramine and decongestants, baseline and episodic blood pressure monitoring, and a documented switching plan with explicit washout dates are critical to minimize risk, and for patients with adherence barriers or intolerance to other antidepressants, transdermal delivery may improve adherence and tolerability, though careful follow-up remains essential [^1134mcHk] [^111moguv] [^114CQhNX].

MAOIs are **highly effective for atypical and treatment-resistant depression** [^1167ovHP] [^112A2EQg] but are now reserved for third-line use due to **risk of hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome** from dietary tyramine and drug interactions [^113RciBv] [^113qhsTj]. They work by **irreversibly inhibiting MAO-A and MAO-B**, increasing serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine [^114nqA9K]. Patients must avoid aged cheeses, cured meats, soy products, and certain alcoholic beverages [^1134mcHk], and maintain a 14-day washout when switching to or from other antidepressants [^111fvnj4]. Common side effects include orthostatic hypotension, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and insomnia [^114nqA9K]; transdermal selegiline reduces dietary restrictions and improves tolerability [^111SZgcM] [^113RciBv].

---

## Mechanism of action

MAOIs **irreversibly inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B**, increasing serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, thereby improving mood and reducing depressive symptoms [^114nqA9K] [^113ru2BL].

---

## Clinical indications

MAOIs are **indicated for major depressive disorder** — particularly **atypical depression** [^1167ovHP] — and for **treatment-resistant depression** [^112A2EQg]; they are also used for anxiety disorders, including **social anxiety disorder** [^117Hf2DT]. Selective MAO-B inhibitors, such as selegiline and rasagiline, are indicated in **Parkinson's disease** [^1154JsVA].

---

## Commonly prescribed MAOIs

| **Drug name** | **Type** | **Clinical use** |
|-|-|-|
| Phenelzine | Non-selective, irreversible | Depression, anxiety disorders [^114nqA9K] |
| Tranylcypromine | Non-selective, irreversible | Depression, anxiety disorders [^1134mcHk] |
| Isocarboxazid | Non-selective, irreversible | Depression [^114nqA9K] |
| Selegiline | Selective MAO-B inhibitor | Parkinson's disease, depression (transdermal) [^1154JsVA] [^111SZgcM] |
| Rasagiline | Selective MAO-B inhibitor | Parkinson's disease [^1154JsVA] |

---

## Dietary restrictions

Patients on MAOIs must **avoid tyramine-rich foods** to prevent hypertensive crisis [^114nqA9K]:

- **Aged cheeses**: Cheddar, blue cheese, parmesan.
- **Cured meats**: Salami, pepperoni, sausages.
- **Fermented foods**: Sauerkraut, soy sauce, miso, tofu [^1134mcHk].
- **Alcoholic beverages**: Red wine, draft beer, vermouth.
- **Other foods**: Fava beans, overripe fruits, yeast extracts.

---

## Drug interactions

MAOIs have **significant drug interactions** [^113qhsTj]:

- **Serotonergic drugs**: SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, meperidine, tramadol, dextromethorphan (risk of serotonin syndrome) [^113LVukT] [^1133zXTy].
- **Sympathomimetic drugs**: Pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, amphetamines (risk of hypertensive crisis) [^113qhsTj].
- **Other antidepressants**: Requires 14-day washout period when switching [^1163Vrac] [^111fvnj4].

---

## Side effects and risks

Common **side effects** include [^1134mcHk]:

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Dizziness, fainting.
- **Weight gain**: Metabolic changes.
- **Sexual dysfunction**: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction.
- **Insomnia**: Sleep disturbances.
- **Hypertensive crisis**: Severe headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, seizures [^113qhsTj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines: MAOIs are **third-line treatments** due to safety concerns and dietary restrictions [^113RciBv]. Transdermal selegiline **reduces dietary restrictions and improves tolerability** [^113RciBv] [^111SZgcM].

---

## Patient adherence and quality of life

Adherence: Dietary restrictions and side effects reduce adherence and quality of life; **transdermal selegiline** can improve both by reducing dietary restrictions [^111moguv].

---

## Recent developments

Transdermal selegiline offers **improved safety and tolerability** with fewer dietary restrictions [^113RciBv] [^111SZgcM]. Among **reversible MAO-A inhibitors**, moclobemide has fewer dietary restrictions but is less effective [^111bLRMm] [^117Hf2DT].

---

MAOIs are effective for atypical and treatment-resistant depression but are limited by dietary restrictions and side effects; transdermal selegiline **improves safety and adherence** [^1167ovHP] [^111moguv].

## References

### MAOIs and depression treatment guidelines [^113RciBv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have shown efficacy in treating depression, particularly in patients with atypical depression, high levels of anxiety, anergic bipolar depression, and treatment-resistant depression. However, they are not recommended as first-line treatments due to safety and tolerability concerns, as well as the need for dietary restrictions. Guidelines suggest using MAOIs as third-, fourth-, or fifth-line treatments. Notably, a newer transdermal MAOI formulation reduces the need for dietary restrictions and has fewer sexual and metabolic effects compared to some of the newer antidepressants.

### Paxil CR [^111fvnj4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Switching patients to or from a monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant**: At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of Paxil CR. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping Paxil CR before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Discontinuation of treatment with Paxil CR**: Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of Paxil CR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping Paxil CR abruptly whenever possible.

### Dietary restrictions and drug interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors: an update [^1134mcHk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are effective treatments for depression that has atypical features or that has failed to respond to other antidepressants. However, MAOIs are underused because clinicians are concerned about dietary and drug interactions with this class of medication. Hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome can occur in rare cases due to interactions between MAOIs and foods containing tyramine as well as interactions with serotonergic and sympathomimetic agents. A better understanding of the foods and drugs that can cause adverse reactions, as well as knowledge of newer MAOIs with mechanisms of action and delivery methods that reduce these risks, may help clinicians to consider the use of these medications, when appropriate, in their patients with depression.

### Amoxapine [^1164HYAM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: See Contraindications regarding the usage of tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Paralytic ileus may occur in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants in combination with anticholinergic drugs. Amoxapine may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other central nervous system depressants. Serum levels of several tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to increase significantly when cimetidine is administered concurrently. Although such an interaction has not been reported with amoxapine at the time of writing, specific interaction studies have not been conducted, and the possibility should be considered.

- **Drugs metabolized by P450 2D6**: The biochemical activity of the drug-metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population; about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so-called "poor metabolizers". Reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African, and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of the drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small or quite large, with an eightfold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA.

In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy.

### Treatment of social phobia with antidepressants [^117Hf2DT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

This article reviews evidence for the utility of antidepressant medications in the treatment of social phobia. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were the first antidepressants shown to be effective for social phobia, but dietary restrictions and a relatively high rate of adverse effects often relegate MAOIs to use after other treatments have been found ineffective. Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (RIMAs) hold promise as safer alternatives to MAOIs, but RIMAs may be less effective and are currently unavailable in the United States. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), of which paroxetine has been the best studied in social phobia at the time of writing, have recently emerged as a first-line treatment for the generalized subtype of social phobia. The SSRIs are well tolerated and consistently have been shown to be efficacious in controlled trials.

### Peripheral modulation of antidepressant targets MAO-B and GABAAR by harmol induces mitohormesis and delays aging in preclinical models [^112R8MFB]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Reversible and sub-lethal stresses to the mitochondria elicit a program of compensatory responses that ultimately improve mitochondrial function, a conserved anti-aging mechanism termed mitohormesis. Here, we show that harmol, a member of the beta-carbolines family with antidepressant properties, improves mitochondrial function and metabolic parameters, and extends healthspan. Treatment with harmol induces a transient mitochondrial depolarization, a strong mitophagy response, and the AMPK compensatory pathway both in cultured C2C12 myotubes and in male mouse liver, brown adipose tissue, and muscle, even though harmol crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Mechanistically, simultaneous modulation of the targets of harmol — monoamine-oxidase B and GABA-A receptor — reproduces harmol-induced mitochondrial improvements. Diet-induced pre-diabetic male mice improve their glucose tolerance, liver steatosis, and insulin sensitivity after treatment with harmol. Harmol, or a combination of monoamine oxidase B and GABA-A receptor modulators, extends the lifespan of hermaphrodite Caenorhabditis elegans or female Drosophila melanogaster. Finally, two-year-old male and female mice treated with harmol exhibit delayed frailty onset with improved glycemia, exercise performance, and strength. Our results reveal that peripheral targeting of monoamine oxidase B and GABA-A receptor, common antidepressant targets, extends healthspan through mitohormesis.

### Assessing the comparative effectiveness of antidepressant therapies: A prospective clinical practice study [^111bLRMm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Although efficacy studies suggest equal potency among antidepressant treatments, their effectiveness in clinical practice appears more variable, particularly in that the newer antidepressants may be less effective in either more severe depression or the melancholic subtype of depression. We pursue some factors that may impact the effectiveness of antidepressant treatments in a clinical sample.

- **Method**: A sample of 182 patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder was assessed at baseline and 12 months later to establish treatments provided, identify patients who had recovered from the index episode, and quantify likely treatment determinants. Four systems for distinguishing patients with melancholic and non-melancholic depression were examined to assess for differential effects of the antidepressant strategies across those subtypes.

- **Results**: Multimodal therapy (commonly, psychotherapy combined with an antidepressant drug) and patients' frequent attribution of recovery to spontaneous improvement made for difficulty in disentangling recovery determinants. After excluding a spontaneous improvement component, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) appeared to be the most effective therapies across the sample, while the reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A (RIMA) appeared to be the least effective. The distinct gradient of suggested effectiveness of various strategies appeared to be contributed to principally by the varied effectiveness of alternate treatments across the melancholic subtype.

### 2012 Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome: Executive summary [^111C1oe9]. Pain Research & Management (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for fibromyalgia, particularly focusing on antidepressants, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend considering the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for managing pain and other symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). The choice of antidepressant should be based on available evidence for efficacy, physician knowledge, patient characteristics, and side effect profile.

### Elavil 25 mg [^115S76Ai]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Amitriptyline hydrochloride is an antidepressant with sedative effects. Its mechanism of action in humans is not known. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and does not act primarily by stimulating the central nervous system.

Amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Pharmacologically, this action may potentiate or prolong neuronal activity since the reuptake of these biogenic amines is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity. This interference with the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin is believed by some to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline.

### Antidepressant treatment and emotional processing: Can we dissociate the roles of serotonin and noradrenaline [^112p9kje]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

The ability to match individual patients to tailored treatments has the potential to greatly improve outcomes for individuals suffering from major depression. In particular, while the vast majority of antidepressant treatments affect either serotonin, noradrenaline, or a combination of these two neurotransmitters, it is not known whether there are particular patients or symptom profiles that respond preferentially to the potentiation of serotonin over noradrenaline, or vice versa. Experimental medicine models suggest that the primary mode of action of these treatments may be to remediate negative biases in emotional processing. Such models may provide a useful framework for interrogating the specific actions of antidepressants.

Here, we review evidence from studies examining the effects of drugs that potentiate serotonin, noradrenaline, or a combination of both neurotransmitters on emotional processing. These results suggest that antidepressants targeting serotonin and noradrenaline may have specific actions on emotion and reward processing, which could be used to improve tailoring of treatment or to understand the effects of dual-reuptake inhibition. Specifically, serotonin may be particularly important in alleviating distress symptoms, while noradrenaline may be especially relevant to anhedonia. The data reviewed here also suggest that noradrenergic-based treatments may have earlier effects on emotional memory than those which affect serotonin.

### SIGN 127 management of perinatal mood disorders: A national clinical guideline [^111gqPom]. SIGN (2012). High credibility.

For major depressive disorder, specifically regarding peripartum depression and antidepressants, the SIGN 2012 guidelines recommend considering the offer of SSRIs and TCAs to patients with moderate-to-severe postnatal depression. There are additional considerations regarding the use of antidepressants when breastfeeding.

### Concomitant administration of ozanimod and serotonergic antidepressants in patients with ulcerative colitis or relapsing multiple sclerosis [^117DEzYm]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

- **Key messages**:

	- **What is already known?**: Ozanimod is a weak monoamine oxidase B inhibitor in vitro. Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors used concomitantly can cause serotonin accumulation.

	- **What is new here?**: No increased risk of adverse events associated with potential serotonin accumulation, regardless of concomitant use of ozanimod and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, occurred in patients with ulcerative colitis or relapsing multiple sclerosis.

	- **How can this study help patient care?**: Together with the prescribing information, our findings help clinicians assess the risk-benefit of initiating ozanimod in patients on concomitant serotonergic antidepressants.

### The European insomnia guideline: An update on the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia 2023 [^117TxKnq]. Journal of Sleep Research (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for insomnia, particularly with respect to antidepressants, the EIN/ESRS 2023 guidelines recommend considering offering longer-term treatment with low-dose sedating antidepressants in selected patients with insomnia disorder (without comorbidities). This should follow an individualized discussion on the advantages and disadvantages.

### Drug-drug interactions involving classic psychedelics: A systematic review [^1165Fxrv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors

Results from another antidepressant class, MAOIs, showed a similar outcome to those of SSRIs. In particular, phenelzine, isocarboxazid, nialamide, and iproniazid are all non-selective MAO inhibitors, therefore inhibiting both MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes. The first three listed antidepressants attenuated or blocked the effects of LSD. By contrast, the latter, iproniazid, did not alter the subjective or physical effects of LSD. However, iproniazid was also used in the experiments with DMT, where it was shown to reduce the effects of DMT. This particular finding is interesting as iproniazid is an irreversible MAOI that inhibits the enzyme that rapidly metabolizes DMT.

Moreover, studies in rats have shown that iproniazid pretreatment increases levels of DMT in the brain, as well as in the liver, kidney, and blood. However, the reduced DMT effects could be due to increased serotonin levels after blocking MAO, and it is hypothesized that higher doses of DMT are needed when serotonin levels are elevated. It is suggested that ayahuasca's effect is mediated by MAO inhibition in the digestive system or bloodstream, which protects DMT from metabolism during its transit to the brain, where MAO inhibitors can then attenuate DMT's effects due to elevated brain serotonin. This hypothesis for DMT can also explain the similar, attenuated response, which was observed in the studies where LSD was combined with MAOIs.

In addition to metabolizing DMT, MAOIs are also important in the breakdown of serotonin as they block MAO enzymes involved in its metabolism.

### Canadian clinical practice guidelines for the management of anxiety, posttraumatic stress and obsessive-compulsive disorders [^114G48LB]. BMC Psychiatry (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for obsessive-compulsive disorder, more specifically with respect to other antidepressants, the 2014 guidelines recommend considering duloxetine, intravenous clomipramine, and tramadol as third-line options for OCD.

### Xadago [^1133zXTy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**: XADAGO is contraindicated for use with other drugs in the MAOIs class or other drugs that are potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase, such as linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial, which also has reversible nonselective MAO inhibition activity. Co-administration increases the risk of nonselective MAO inhibition, which may lead to hypertensive crisis [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of XADAGO and initiation of treatment with other MAOIs. Isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity. Monitor for hypertension and reaction to dietary tyramine in patients treated concomitantly with isoniazid and XADAGO.

- **Opioid drugs**: Because serious, sometimes fatal reactions have been precipitated with concomitant use of opioid drugs, such as meperidine and its derivatives, methadone, propoxyphene, or tramadol, and MAOIs, including selective MAO-B inhibitors, concomitant use of these drugs is contraindicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of XADAGO and initiation of treatment with these drugs.

- **Serotonergic drugs**: Concomitant use of XADAGO with SNRIs; triazolopyridine, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants; cyclobenzaprine (a skeletal muscle relaxant that is a tricyclic antidepressant derivative); or St. John's wort is contraindicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of XADAGO and initiation of treatment with these drugs.

### Norepinephrine dose and concentration reporting: The devil is in the details [^1156kCK3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

We are glad that the discussion around the use of norepinephrine is gaining momentum, which will undoubtedly nurture the research agenda and our understanding of this fascinating drug. Hopefully, this will translate into homogenizing our practice throughout the world and providing safer and more efficient patient care.

### Can monoamine-based therapies be improved [^114aHLHi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Monoamine-based therapies that selectively target serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine uptake are effective as antidepressants. However, many depressed patients do not achieve remission with these single-action agents. Treatment strategies that target more than one neurotransmitter, either through augmentation, combination treatment, or the development of single agents with dual or triple reuptake mechanisms, may prove to be even more effective than traditional antidepressants and merit further research.

### Medically serious adverse effects of newer antidepressants [^111adWhg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Although safer than tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the newer antidepressants may be associated with certain medically serious adverse effects, including cardiovascular adverse effects, seizures, abnormal bleeding, hyponatremia, and agranulocytosis. This review discusses these adverse effects in detail. Data regarding the incidence and risk factors are summarized, and strategies for reducing the risk of these adverse effects and managing them are suggested. Identification of risk factors, appropriate antidepressant choice, and, when possible, careful monitoring may substantially reduce the incidence of these adverse effects and the morbidity associated with them.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^117EjrQm]. APA (2010). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to peripartum depression, the APA 2010 guidelines recommend considering offering antidepressants in pregnant patients with moderate-to-severe MDD, as well as in patients in remission from MDD receiving maintenance therapy and deemed at high risk for recurrence if the medication is discontinued.

---

### Protriptyline hydrochloride [^114TuL8p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Protriptyline hydrochloride is an antidepressant agent. The mechanism of its antidepressant action in humans is not known. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and does not act primarily by stimulating the central nervous system.

Protriptyline has been found in some studies to have a more rapid onset of action than imipramine or amitriptyline. The initial clinical effect may occur within one week. It lacks sedative and tranquilizing properties, and the rate of excretion is slow.

### Long-term effectiveness of adjuvant treatment with catechol-O-methyltransferase or monoamine oxidase B inhibitors compared with dopamine agonists among patients with Parkinson disease uncontrolled by levodopa therapy: The PD MED randomized clinical trial [^114bUhGh]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Levodopa is the most commonly used and effective initial treatment for Parkinson disease (PD). However, after prolonged or high-dose use, motor complications, such as abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia) and motor fluctuations (premature decrease in the drug's effects and unpredictable switching between on and off phases), can develop. Another drug class can then be added to reduce motor complications and levodopa dose. The most widely used adjuvant drugs are dopamine agonists and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs), such as catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors and monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors.

Studies comparing brief treatment with these drugs vs. placebo among patients with motor complications have reported that each drug can improve motor function and activities of daily living scores. However, the occurrence of dyskinesia and numerous other adverse events (AEs) increased. Indirect comparisons between placebo-controlled clinical trials have suggested greater efficacy for dopamine agonists vs. DRIs, such as COMT or MAO-B inhibitors, which appear to have comparable efficacy. However, such indirect comparisons can be misleading. Direct head-to-head randomized clinical trials are needed for reliable assessment of the comparative clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of different adjuvant therapies; however, we have not identified any clinical trials comparing modern agents. Hence, it is unclear which class of drug is preferable for use as adjuvant therapy.

The present Parkinson Disease Medication (PD MED) study was a large pragmatic trial designed to evaluate these issues comprehensively.

### Antidepressant use and risk of suicide and attempted suicide or self harm in people aged 20 to 64: Cohort study using a primary care database [^116ZzvhF]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

We used Cox's proportional hazards models to assess the associations between exposure to antidepressant drugs and the two outcomes: suicide and attempted suicide or self-harm. To account for patients starting and stopping treatment during follow-up and changing between treatments, we treated antidepressant exposure as a time-varying exposure. We considered patients to have been exposed to a drug if there were no gaps of more than 90 days between the end of one prescription and the start of the next. In the analysis of attempted suicide or self-harm, we excluded patients who already had the outcome recorded at baseline. The main analyses were based on the first five years of follow-up after the study entry date by censoring any follow-up after this date. We used robust standard errors to account for clustering of patients within practices.

In the analysis, we calculated unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for antidepressant class by comparing treatment using tricyclic and related antidepressants, other antidepressants, and combined antidepressants with treatment using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. We included a category of "no treatment" for periods of time where patients were not treated with antidepressants, which also included follow-up time for patients who were not prescribed any antidepressants during follow-up. The number of patients prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitors was too small for this group to be analyzed, so we excluded from the analyses those patients prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

### Extracorporeal treatment for tricyclic antidepressant poisoning: Recommendations from the EXTRIP Workgroup [^115eBLMk]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

The pharmacology of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) reveals that they have been in clinical use for the treatment of depression since the 1950s. Although largely replaced by newer antidepressants, TCAs continue to be prescribed for conditions such as major depressive disorder, chronic and neuropathic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cyclic vomiting, nocturnal enuresis, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. TCAs share a common three-ring structure and are classified into tertiary amines (amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine) and secondary amines (desipramine and nortriptyline). The antidepressant effects of these drugs are primarily due to the presynaptic reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine. Other pharmacological effects include competitive muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic antagonism, histamine inhibition, and GABA-A antagonism. TCAs also produce cardiac sodium channel blockade, classified as having type IA antiarrhythmic properties.

TCAs are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, their anticholinergic effects in overdose can decrease gastrointestinal motility, prolonging the time to peak drug concentrations. TCAs are extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and lipoproteins. Due to their lipophilicity, free drug rapidly distributes into tissues, resulting in large volumes of distribution and long half-lives of elimination. Drug concentration in the myocardium and the brain has been reported to be 40–200 times greater than in plasma.

### The dual-action hypothesis: Does pharmacology matter [^111nZcBz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

With treatment to remission as the gold standard for depression treatment, there is considerable reassessment of treatment approaches with the view to finding and employing agents capable of rapidly eliminating all symptoms and returning patients to normalcy. The mechanisms of action intrinsic to different classes of antidepressants are at the center of this review. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most commonly prescribed antidepressants, have a single-action mechanism involved in modulating the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin. The selectivity of the SSRIs renders them safer and more tolerable than the earlier multi-acting monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). However, because serotonin is not the only neurotransmitter implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, the selectivity that bestows safety to SSRIs may limit somewhat the antidepressant effect in some patients.

A newer class of dual-action antidepressants acts by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine. These serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have improved side effect profiles compared with the earlier multi-action antidepressants, compare favorably with the SSRIs on safety and tolerability, and reduce depression and its associated symptoms with greater rapidity. This review compares the neurobiology of single- and dual-action mechanisms.

### Treatment of depression with atypical features: A meta-analytic approach [^1167ovHP]. Psychiatry Research (2006). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis addressed the empirical evidence regarding the treatment of major depression with atypical features. The superiority of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) compared with other antidepressants in treating major depression with atypical features has been frequently reported. According to the CONSORT Statement, studies included in our meta-analysis had to meet several criteria, especially a double-blind, controlled condition and an operational diagnosis according to DSM-III or DSM-IV criteria, respectively. A systematic review was conducted using four research-based databases: Medline, Embase, Psyndex, and PsycInfo. Only eight publications met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, resulting in 11 comparisons.

- **Effect sizes and comparisons**: Our results show an effect size of 0.45 (95% confidence interval) for comparing MAOIs vs. placebo. In contrast, the effect size for a comparison of MAOIs vs. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was 0.02 (95% confidence interval: -0.10–0.14). The effect size for MAOIs vs. tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) was 0.27 (95% confidence interval: 0.16–0.42). MAOIs may be more effective for atypical major depressive disorder than TCAs. Most clinical research has been conducted on irreversible MAOIs. Additional studies testing more recently developed antidepressants, including reversible MAOIs, with an improved safety profile would be warranted. The available data are insufficient for a direct comparison between MAOIs and SSRIs.

### Relpax [^111mRNim]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Especially tell your doctor if you take antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if you are not sure. Know the medicines you take and keep a list of them to show your doctor or pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

- **How should I take Relpax**: Take Relpax exactly as your doctor tells you to take it. Your doctor will tell you how much Relpax to take and when to take it. Your doctor may change your dose if needed. Do not change your dose without first talking to your doctor. Take one Relpax tablet as soon as you feel a migraine coming on. If you do not get any relief after your first Relpax tablet, do not take a second tablet without first talking with your doctor. If your headache comes back or you only get some relief from your headache, you can take a second tablet two hours after the first tablet. Do not take more than a total of 80 mg of Relpax tablets in a 24-hour period. If you take too much Relpax, call your doctor or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. You should write down when you have headaches and when you take Relpax so you can talk to your doctor about how well Relpax is working for you.

### The use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in primary care [^116czSdP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Although primary care clinicians have developed considerable expertise in managing patients with major depressive disorder, and a range of treatment strategies is currently available, some patients still fail to reach remission. Two strategies have fallen out of common use: treating patients with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and subgrouping patients by diagnosis when selecting antidepressant treatment. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors became less popular because other treatments were perceived to be safer and easier to use. However, a newer transdermal formulation of an MAOI that limits the need for the dietary restrictions of oral MAOIs may make it worthwhile to consider using this class of medication in patients who have failed several treatment trials. Although adverse events due to patients' diets are less likely with the transdermal MAOI, clinicians should still be alert for drug interactions and observe recommended washout periods. Patients who may benefit from MAOI treatment include those with treatment-resistant depression, atypical depression, anxiety, or anergic bipolar depression, and those who have experienced intolerable metabolic or sexual side effects with other medications.

### Long-term effectiveness of adjuvant treatment with catechol-O-methyltransferase or monoamine oxidase B inhibitors compared with dopamine agonists among patients with Parkinson disease uncontrolled by levodopa therapy: The PD MED randomized clinical trial [^1154JsVA]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

- **Question**: Is adding a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI), either a monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor or a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, to levodopa therapy more effective than adding a dopamine agonist and, if a DRI is more effective, which DRI class (MAO-B or COMT) is preferable for improving patient-rated quality of life among those with motor complications of Parkinson disease (PD) that are uncontrolled by levodopa therapy?

- **Findings**: In this randomized clinical trial involving 500 people with PD, no statistically significant difference was found in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire mobility scores between adjuvant therapy with dopamine agonists vs. DRIs; however, scores were a mean of 4.2 points better with MAO-B inhibitors compared with COMT inhibitors.

- **Meaning**: In this study, patient-rated quality of life was worse with the addition of COMT inhibitors compared with MAO-B inhibitors or dopamine agonists as adjuvant treatment for people with PD uncontrolled by levodopa therapy.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder [^112kvRxS]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Antidepressant use is significant, especially in the Western world, and is on the rise in several countries. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey published in 2017 showed that during 2011–2014, about one in eight people aged 12 and over in the United States reported taking antidepressants during the previous month. Antidepressant use increased nearly 65% over a 15-year timeframe, and more than 60% of people in the United States taking antidepressants have been doing so for more than two years. Antidepressants for major depressive disorder, either alone or in combination with psychotherapy, are recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the American Psychiatric Association, as well as other guidelines. Moreover, psychiatrists and general practitioners worldwide routinely use antidepressants in the treatment of depression.

Several different antidepressants exist. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most widely prescribed class of antidepressants and are often the first-line treatment for depression.

- **Types of antidepressants**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline).
	- Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, and milnacipran).
	- Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline).
	- Atypical antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine, agomelatine, and bupropion).
	- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. isocarboxazid and phenelzine).

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LntxF]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We conducted a search for peer‐reviewed articles across databases such as Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Gray literature searches were carried out using Google Scholar. Searches were conducted with a combination of the following keywords: antidepressant, antidepressive agent, thymoleptic, depression medication, depression therapy, depression treatment, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressant, AD, dementia, demented, cognitive impairment, cognitive loss, and cognitive deficit.

- **Study selection**: The identification of eligible studies began with an examination of titles and abstracts to remove duplicates. Two authors (CN and JM) reviewed the full‐text articles for relevance and agreement, guided by predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodologic quality was assessed by two reviewers (CN and JM) independently using the Quality of Prognosis Studies in Systematic Reviews (QUIPS) tool. There was full agreement between the two reviewers on which studies to include, with high interrater variability (Cohen's kappa 0.88). Disagreements were resolved through consensus-seeking discussion.

An article was included if it met the following inclusion criteria: it was published in the English language, the full text was available, and it had a comparative design with two groups, one being exposed to antidepressant drugs.

### Percocet [^114eJTqE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) interaction**: Inform patients to avoid taking Percocet while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking Percocet tablets [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

- **Important administration instructions**: Instruct patients how to properly take Percocet [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS]. Advise patients not to adjust the medication dose themselves and to consult with their healthcare provider prior to any dosage adjustment. Advise patients who are treated with Percocet for more than a few weeks not to abruptly discontinue the medication. Instead, they should consult with their physician for a gradual discontinuation dose schedule to taper off the medication.

- **Important discontinuation instructions**: To avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue Percocet without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].

- **Maximum daily dose of acetaminophen**: Inform patients not to take more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Advise patients to call their prescriber if they take more than the recommended dose.

- **Driving or operating heavy machinery**: Inform patients that Percocet may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see PRECAUTIONS].

### Fluoxetine [^113LVukT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Contraindications**: Serotonin syndrome and MAOIs: Do not use MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with fluoxetine or within 5 weeks of stopping treatment with fluoxetine. Do not use fluoxetine within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. Additionally, do not start fluoxetine in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.

- **Pimozide**: Do not use. There is a risk of QT prolongation and drug interaction.

- **Thioridazine**: Do not use. There is a risk of QT interval prolongation and elevated thioridazine plasma levels. Do not use thioridazine within 5 weeks of discontinuing fluoxetine.

- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**: The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with fluoxetine or within 5 weeks of stopping treatment with fluoxetine is contraindicated due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of fluoxetine within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

	- Starting fluoxetine in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is contraindicated due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.10) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Other contraindications**: The use of fluoxetine is contraindicated with the following:

	- **Pimozide**
	- **Thioridazine**

### Issues in adherence to treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the rate of treatment failure [^111moguv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

In 2000, the economic burden of depression in the United States was estimated to be $83.1 billion. Although many effective treatments are available and treatment rates have increased, response and remission rates for patients with depression remain low, and multiple treatment trials are often required. Whether patients are adherent to their medication affects response and remission rates, and nonadherence is common among patients with depression. Increasing adherence improves treatment outcomes and lowers treatment costs.

- **Interventions that increase adherence**: Interventions include educational, behavioral, affective, and provider-targeted strategies; transdermal delivery of drugs also may increase adherence by simplifying the patient's medication regimen.

While monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have proven efficacy for depression, particularly for patients with treatment-resistant or atypical depression, they are underprescribed due, in part, to concerns over dietary and drug restrictions that are required to avoid potential serious side effects. However, newer MAOI formulations, including a transdermal delivery system, have improved safety and tolerability profiles and avoid or lessen the need for dietary restrictions, giving clinicians another option for treating patients who may be nonadherent or nonresponsive to their antidepressant.

### Trimipramine maleate [^116nXFWP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Who should not take trimipramine maleate capsules**: Do not take trimipramine maleate capsules if you take a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure if you take an MAOI, including the antibiotic linezolid. Do not take an MAOI within 2 weeks of stopping trimipramine maleate capsules unless directed to do so by your physician. Do not start trimipramine maleate capsules if you stopped taking an MAOI in the last 2 weeks unless directed to do so by your physician.

- **What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines**: Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms. Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants. Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member. Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member takes. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider. Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved for use in children.

### Dietary restrictions and drug interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors: The state of the art [^114nqA9K]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Antidepressant activity of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) was initially noted in the 1950s, and by the early 1960s, they were a mainstay of antidepressant treatment. Reports of adverse events, such as acute hypertensive reactions following the ingestion of certain foods and beverages, tempered clinicians' enthusiasm for MAOIs. The introduction of tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors led to declines in the use of MAOIs. However, MAOIs have been well established as an effective intervention for people with treatment-resistant depression, and transdermal formulations may provide a valuable therapeutic option, eliminating the drug-food interaction.

### Desipramine hydrochloride [^116RNp4Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of the tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is advisable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.

Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when this drug is given concomitantly with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs. Patients should be warned that while taking this drug, their response to alcoholic beverages may be exaggerated.

If desipramine hydrochloride is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine hydrochloride and benzodiazepines (e.g. chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive. Both the sedative and anticholinergic effects of the major tranquilizers are also additive to those of desipramine hydrochloride.

Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and serotonergic drugs may potentially cause life-threatening adverse events (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Strategies for switching antidepressants to achieve maximum efficacy adolescents [^111cWotz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

If a patient with major depressive disorder has not responded after an adequate trial of an antidepressant medication, switching to another antidepressant of the same class or a different class may help. When choosing an alternative antidepressant, clinicians should consider the patient's symptoms, drug preferences, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, as well as drug tolerability, interactions, mechanisms of action, and cost. A wide range of antidepressants is available from a variety of classes, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Evidence suggests that a switch within or between any class is legitimate.

When switching between antidepressants, an appropriate switching strategy should be used. Although a sufficient washout period is essential when switching to or from an MAOI, in switches between other classes of antidepressants, no single strategy has proven benefit over another. The direct approach to switching, the crossover approach, the moderate approach, and the conservative approach are all commonly used in clinical practice. Each switch strategy has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice should be made based on the patient, the patient's illness, the medications involved, and clinical judgment.

### How do antidepressants work? New perspectives for refining future treatment approaches [^113ru2BL]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Most currently available antidepressants target monoamine neurotransmitter function. However, a purely neurotransmitter-based explanation for antidepressant drug action is challenged by the delayed clinical onset of most agents and the need to explain how neurochemical changes reverse the many different symptoms of depression. Novel approaches to understanding antidepressant drug action include a focus on early changes in emotional and social processing and the role of neural plasticity.

In this review, we discuss how these two different theories reflect different or complementary approaches and how they might be integrated to offer novel solutions for people with depression. We consider the predictions made by these mechanistic approaches for the stratification and development of new therapeutics for depression, as well as the next steps needed to facilitate the translation of science to the clinic.

### The role of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in depression treatment guidelines [^111SZgcM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have proven efficacy for treating depression and have been a preferred treatment for patients with atypical depression, high levels of anxiety, anergic bipolar depression, and treatment-resistant depression for decades. However, MAOIs are infrequently used due to safety and tolerability concerns and the need for dietary restrictions. Guidelines recommend MAOIs as third-, fourth-, or fifth-line treatments due to these concerns. A transdermal formulation of selegiline limits the need for dietary restrictions and has fewer side effects than many more widely used antidepressants. The availability of a safer and more tolerable formulation provides clinicians with another option in their armamentarium for treating depression.

### Translating the evidence on atypical depression into clinical practice [^112Fqvh6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Subtypes of depression need to be recognized and diagnosed in order to properly treat patients who have depression but present with different symptoms from one another. Different pharmacotherapeutic strategies may work better for different subtypes. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have been studied for the treatment of atypical depression. At the time of writing, MAOIs have been shown to be the most efficacious agents in treating atypical depression; however, many MAOIs nonselectively and irreversibly inhibit both MAO substrates, require tyramine-restricted diets, and may produce weight gain, cardiovascular side effects, or sexual dysfunction. A newer MAOI, the transdermal formulation of selegiline, may provide all of the efficacy of the older MAOIs in treating atypical depression without causing as many adverse events and with no diet restrictions.

### Antibiotics and mental health: The good, the bad and the ugly [^111in9dP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Antibiotics as antidepressants

It is often forgotten that the first antidepressant discovered was actually an antibiotic. Isoniazid is an antibacterial drug developed in the United States in the 1950s for treating tuberculosis. Unexpected side effects of euphoria, psychostimulation, increased appetite, and improved sleep prompted interest in the medication as a potential treatment for depression. A physician treating patients with tuberculosis originally observed these findings. Subsequent clinical trials confirmed antidepressant efficacy, which was attributed to isoniazid's ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes and, therefore, increase levels of monoamines such as noradrenaline, serotonin, and dopamine in the brain. This observation gave rise to the 'monoamine hypothesis of depression', which is still widely researched and resulted in the development of several classes of antidepressant medications, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), both of which act to increase central monoamine levels. Recent studies indicate that newer antidepressants, for example, the SSRI fluoxetine, have antibiotic activity in certain circumstances.

Kohler‐Forsberg et al. conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs, including the antibiotic minocycline, in depressed patients. They concluded that minocycline as an adjunctive therapy positively impacted depressive symptoms. In a subgroup of patients who had psychotic depression, Miyaoka et al. also found efficacy when the antibiotic was administered.

### Serotonin and brain function: A tale of two receptors [^117SerkM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

The function of brain serotonin is a major unresolved problem in neuropsychopharmacology. This paper proposes that the principal function of brain serotonin is to enhance adaptive responses to adverse conditions via two distinct pathways:

- **Passive coping pathway**: This improves stress tolerability.
- **Active coping pathway**: Associated with heightened plasticity, this pathway, with support, can improve an organism's ability to identify and overcome the source(s) of stress by changing outlook and/or behaviour.

Crucially, we propose that these two functions are mediated by signalling at postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors respectively. Signalling through the 5-HT1A receptor dominates under ordinary conditions, while signalling through the 5-HT2A receptor becomes increasingly operative as the level of adversity reaches a critical point.

### Norpramin [^114RHFy3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Available evidence suggests that many depressions have a biochemical basis in the form of a relative deficiency of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin. Norepinephrine deficiency may be associated with relatively low urinary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol (MHPG) levels, while serotonin deficiencies may be associated with low spinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.

While the precise mechanism of action of the tricyclic antidepressants is unknown, a leading theory suggests that they restore normal levels of neurotransmitters by blocking the re-uptake of these substances from the synapse in the central nervous system. Evidence indicates that the secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants, including Norpramin, may have greater activity in blocking the re-uptake of norepinephrine. Tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, may have a greater effect on serotonin re-uptake.

Norpramin is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and does not act primarily as a central nervous system stimulant. It has been found in some studies to have a more rapid onset of action than imipramine. The earliest therapeutic effects may occasionally be seen in 2 to 5 days, but full treatment benefit usually requires 2 to 3 weeks to obtain.

	- Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or their use within 14 days after their discontinuation is contraindicated. There have been reports of hyperpyretic crisis seizures and deaths when cyclobenzaprine, or structurally similar tricyclic antidepressants, are administered with MAO inhibitor drugs.

	- Usage during the acute recovery phase of myocardial infarction, as well as in patients with arrhythmias, heart block or conduction disturbances, or congestive heart failure, is contraindicated.

	- Patients with hyperthyroidism should also not use Amrix.

### Monoamine depletion studies: Implications for antidepressant discontinuation syndrome [^1177g5F3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The likelihood of a connection between serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation and an acute reduction in synaptic serotonin (5-HT) has ignited interest in the similarities between SRI discontinuation syndrome and the symptoms observed after acute tryptophan depletion, which reduces synaptic 5-HT levels. An open question is whether these two phenomena have shared characteristics because of a similar underlying mechanism. The evidence in support of a similar underlying mechanism includes the observation that comparable proportions of SRI-treated patients experience depressive symptoms following tryptophan depletion and SRI discontinuation. Furthermore, the proportion of people who have emotional changes with rapid antidepressant discontinuation may be parallel to the proportion of people who experience those changes with rapid tryptophan depletion.

### Antidepressant medications in dementia: Evidence and potential mechanisms of treatment-resistance [^113Tjn9h]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Whether involving serotonin, noradrenaline, or dopamine, antidepressant mechanisms of action involve increasing monoamine levels in the synapse by preventing either metabolism or reuptake into the pre-synaptic neuron. However, there is significant degeneration of monoamine neurons in early dementia, leading to a loss of pre-synaptic innervation. Following the death of these neurons, monoamine release is markedly reduced, resulting in a loss of function in these systems, which presumably reduces any impact of antidepressants.

In addition to the loss of innervation, degeneration of pre-synaptic monoamine nuclei would also lead to loss of feedback inhibition. For example, the serotonin-1A (5-HT 1A) autoreceptor controls serotonergic tone through feedback inhibition and has been hypothesized to lead to a reduction in synaptic serotonin levels early on in SSRI treatment. The time taken for 5-HT 1A autoreceptors to desensitize has been theorized as an explanation of the delayed clinical effects of antidepressant treatment, and differences in 5-HT 1A receptor levels have been associated with depression and the response to antidepressants. Though it is widely accepted that 5-HT 1A receptors participate in autoinhibition, their action is far more complex, and the function of feedback is regionally organized and dependent on behavioral states. Changes in 5-HT 1A distribution and binding have been reported in dementia but vary depending on brain regions.

### Peripheral modulation of antidepressant targets MAO-B and GABAAR by harmol induces mitohormesis and delays aging in preclinical models [^1149rScv]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Reversible and sub-lethal stresses to the mitochondria elicit a program of compensatory responses that ultimately improve mitochondrial function, a conserved anti-aging mechanism termed mitohormesis. Here, we show that harmol, a member of the beta-carbolines family with antidepressant properties, improves mitochondrial function and metabolic parameters and extends healthspan. Treatment with harmol induces a transient mitochondrial depolarization, a strong mitophagy response, and the AMPK compensatory pathway both in cultured C2C12 myotubes and in male mouse liver, brown adipose tissue, and muscle, even though harmol crosses poorly the blood-brain barrier.

Mechanistically, simultaneous modulation of the targets of harmol — monoamine-oxidase B and GABA-A receptor — reproduces harmol-induced mitochondrial improvements. Diet-induced pre-diabetic male mice improve their glucose tolerance, liver steatosis, and insulin sensitivity after treatment with harmol. Harmol or a combination of monoamine oxidase B and GABA-A receptor modulators extend the lifespan of hermaphrodite Caenorhabditis elegans or female Drosophila melanogaster. Finally, two-year-old male and female mice treated with harmol exhibit delayed frailty onset with improved glycemia, exercise performance, and strength. Our results reveal that peripheral targeting of monoamine oxidase B and GABA-A receptor, common antidepressant targets, extends healthspan through mitohormesis.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^114y6e2H]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

If an antidepressant agent is warranted and there is no cognitive impairment, SSRIs or TCAs can be considered as first-line therapy. TCAs inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, serotonin. They also possess alpha-adrenergic antagonist, antimuscarinic, and antihistaminic properties. Almost all TCAs — amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, and nortriptyline (with the exception of doxepine) — have been demonstrated to be potent antidepressants in randomized controlled trials involving patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

The secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine and nortriptyline, are preferred due to better tolerability over tertiary TCAs. Desipramine and imipramine were found to improve both the motor symptoms of PD and mood. In a subset of patients, particularly those with hypersalivation or overactive bladder, the antimuscarinic activity of TCAs may offer additional clinical benefits. Sedating TCAs may be helpful for treating depression accompanied by insomnia. However, the anticholinergic properties of TCAs limit their use in PD patients with existing or emerging cognitive dysfunction. Although infrequent, TCAs have the potential to induce cardiac conduction disturbances, and obtaining a baseline electrocardiogram prior to treatment initiation is recommended for best practice.

If the use of a TCA is limited or contraindicated due to cognitive impairment, comorbid medical conditions, or treatment-emergent adverse effects, SSRIs can be considered as first-line treatment. In a 30-day randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, both desipramine and citalopram showed improvement in depression symptoms.

### The association of antidepressant drug usage with cognitive impairment or dementia, including Alzheimer disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yz5is]. Depression and Anxiety (2017). Low credibility.

A decrease in serotonin availability within the synapse — a core feature of the monoamine theory of depression — can be reestablished by inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO, degrades serotonin and other monoamines) or by inhibiting serotonin reuptake/removal from the synapse. Depressed women tend to respond better to MAO inhibitors, while men tend to respond better to reuptake inhibitors. Interestingly, doses of SSRIs lower than the smallest available doses might still provide benefit, while reducing side effects and risk. In contrast, patient noncompliance and an effective "less than daily" dose could actually precipitate dementia and dementia‐related mortality.

It should be noted that AD/dementia is not associated with all classes of reuptake inhibitors. For instance, the older tricyclic antidepressants, some of which function as serotonin uptake inhibitors, may be associated with a reduced risk or no risk of dementia, whereas non‐SSRI antidepressant drugs, including MAO inhibitors and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), have been reported to show an intermediate risk. These tentative findings suggest that the treatment of depression rather than depression itself may have a powerful impact on cognitive phenotypes.

### MAOIs: Issues in treatment adherence and rates of treatment failure [^114CQhNX]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013).

Treatment guidelines recommend initiating newer antidepressants as first-line therapy for patients with depression, but response and remission rates remain low, and multiple treatment trials are often needed. Adherence to medication affects response and remission rates, and nonadherence is common among patients with depression. While MAOIs have proven efficacy for depression, particularly for patients with treatment-resistant or atypical depression, this class of drugs is underprescribed due, in part, to concerns over dietary and drug restrictions required to avoid potential serious side effects. However, a newer MAOI formulation has an improved safety and tolerability profile and avoids or lessens the need for dietary restrictions, providing clinicians another option for treating patients who may be nonadherent or nonresponsive to their antidepressant.

### Relationship of neurotransmitters to the symptoms of major depressive disorder [^112eGJAf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

A relationship appears to exist between the three main monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain (i.e. dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) and specific symptoms of major depressive disorder. Specific symptoms are associated with the increase or decrease of specific neurotransmitters, which suggests that specific symptoms of depression could be assigned to specific neurochemical mechanisms, and subsequently, specific antidepressant drugs could target symptom-specific neurotransmitters. Research on electroconvulsive therapy has supported a correlation between neurotransmitters and depression symptoms.

A two-dimensional model of neurotransmitter functions describes depression as a mixture of two separate components — negative affect and the loss of positive affect — that can be considered in relation to the three amine neurotransmitters. Owing to the different methods of action of available antidepressant agents and the depression symptoms thought to be associated with dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, treatments can be targeted toward patients' specific symptoms.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^114QxRvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Whilst antidepressant medications are primarily used for the treatment of depression and disorders of negative affect, they have also been used to help individuals stop smoking. They offer an alternative to other first-line smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and nicotine agonists, such as varenicline.

The following medications and substances, regarded as having antidepressant properties, have been investigated for their effect on smoking cessation in at least one study:

- **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)**: doxepin, imipramine, and nortriptyline
- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**: moclobemide, selegiline, lazabemide, and EVT302
- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and zimelidine
- **Atypical antidepressants**: bupropion, tryptophan, and venlafaxine
- **Extracts of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum)**
- **Dietary supplement**: S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe)

Of the antidepressant medications indicated for smoking cessation, the most commonly used is bupropion. It has both dopaminergic and adrenergic actions, and appears to be an antagonist at the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor. It has been licensed as a prescription medicine for smoking cessation in many countries. The usual dose for smoking cessation is 150 mg once a day for three days, increasing to 150 mg twice a day continued for seven to twelve weeks. Quit attempts are generally initiated one week after starting pharmacotherapy.

### Dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on depression symptom dimensions in Parkinson disease [^116FfWdd]. Nature. Mental Health (2024). Low credibility.

Other treatments, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-Is), are also clinically used for both their antidepressant and antiparkinsonian effects. Selective type-A monoamine oxidase (MAO-A) inhibitors, such as moclobemide, are primarily used in depression to prevent the metabolism of serotonin and noradrenaline. In contrast, type-B monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) inhibitors, such as rasagiline and selegiline, were developed for treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD) owing to their ability to inhibit dopamine metabolism, thereby increasing striatal dopamine levels. However, MAO-B inhibitors such as selegiline have also been shown to improve depression in PD. At high doses, they are nonselective, additionally affecting serotonergic transmission, which may represent a complementary pathway to improving mood. There remains limited understanding of the effects of MAO-Is on different symptom dimensions of depression in PD, and no study has examined how these effects change over time or their relationship with progression of neurodegeneration within dopaminergic pathways.

In this article, we hypothesized that there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different depressive symptom dimensions. Considering lab-based findings of the behavioral effects of dopamine agonists, we predicted that dopamine agonist treatment would improve motivational symptoms but not other depression symptom dimensions, whereas MAO-B inhibitors may improve mood due to their serotonergic action at higher doses. Our secondary hypothesis was that dopaminergic medications with mechanisms of action…

### Distinguishing roles for norepinephrine and serotonin in the behavioral effects of antidepressant drugs [^1167NGqj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Antidepressant drugs have typically been classified into groups based on actions targeted at serotonin (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), norepinephrine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [NRIs]), or both neurotransmitters (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). This classification is based predominantly on their acute pharmacologic effects, usually determined by in vitro radioligand binding assays. However, the pharmacologic selectivity of antidepressants can be altered after systemic administration due to dose, drug metabolism, physiologic interactions between neurotransmitters, and adaptive effects that emerge after chronic administration.

This review examines whether pharmacologic selectivity is maintained by different types of antidepressants in vivo and whether it matters for the production of their behavioral effects. Antidepressants increase extracellular levels of neurotransmitters by inhibiting presynaptic transporters, though physiologic interactions among neurotransmitters can influence selectivity in certain brain regions. Chronic administration of many antidepressants causes down-regulation of postsynaptic and presynaptic receptors. The pattern of responses of presynaptic markers suggests that pharmacologic selectivity is maintained after chronic administration of many antidepressants. Behavioral tests indicate that depletion of serotonin (5-HT) can prevent the effects produced by SSRIs but not NRIs.

### Alphagan P [^114EGQFC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- Antihypertensives and cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure.
	- Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect.
	- Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine.
	- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension.

- **Antihypertensives/cardiac glycosides**:
	- Because Alphagan P may reduce blood pressure, caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and/or cardiac glycosides with Alphagan P is advised.

- **CNS depressants**:
	- Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with Alphagan P, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, or anesthetics) should be considered.

- **Tricyclic antidepressants**:
	- Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with Alphagan P in humans can lead to interference with the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect. Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines.

- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors**:
	- Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side-effect such as hypotension. Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors, which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines.

### Zoloft [^1163Vrac]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Switching patients to or from a monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant: At least 14 days must elapse between the discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and the initiation of Zoloft. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping Zoloft before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Discontinuation of treatment with Zoloft**: Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of Zoloft [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping Zoloft abruptly whenever possible.

- **Preparation of Zoloft oral solution**: Zoloft oral solution must be diluted before use. Use the supplied calibrated dropper to measure the amount of Zoloft oral solution needed. Note: The supplied calibrated dropper has 25 mg and 50 mg graduation marks only. Mix with 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of water, ginger ale, lemon/lime soda, lemonade, or orange juice ONLY. After mixing, a slight haze may appear, which is normal. Instruct patients or caregivers to immediately take the dose after mixing.

### Nuedexta [^1142VUUY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **MAOIs**: Do not use Nuedexta with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or in patients who have taken MAOIs within the preceding 14 days [see Contraindications (4.3)].

- **Drugs that prolong QT and are metabolized by CYP2D6**: Avoid concurrent use with drugs that both prolong the QT interval and are metabolized by CYP2D6, such as thioridazine or pimozide [see Contraindications (4.4)].

- **Drugs that prolong QT and concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Recommend ECG monitoring in patients taking Nuedexta with drugs that prolong the QT interval and in those taking concomitant moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants**: The use of Nuedexta with SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants increases the risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Revisiting monoamine oxidase inhibitors for the treatment of depressive disorders: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112A2EQg]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were the first class of modern antidepressants; however, they are under-utilized compared to newer antidepressants.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review, network meta-analysis was used to investigate the comparative efficacy and acceptability of MAOIs for depressive disorders. The network meta-analysis included 52 double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 14 antidepressants or placebo. Across studies, the mean arm size was n = 58 participants from a total N = 6462 (5309 active drug; 1153 placebo).

- **Results**: Except for fluvoxamine, all antidepressants demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo, and none showed substantially better or worse all-cause dropout rates. Phenelzine demonstrated superior evidence for efficacy compared to all other treatments, and clomipramine demonstrated superior evidence for acceptability compared to all other treatments.

- **Limitations**: The study is primarily limited by low estimate precision due to a relative paucity of studies for some of the included treatment conditions. Further evidence is required to study the relative efficacy of MAOIs against newer antidepressants.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this analysis largely support the re-evaluation of the use of MAOIs as antidepressant agents in the treatment algorithm of depression.

### Xadago [^113qhsTj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Xadago is contraindicated in patients with:

- **Concomitant use of other drugs in the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) class or other drugs that are potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase**: This includes linezolid, as their combination may result in increased blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Concomitant use of opioid drugs**: Examples include meperidine and its derivatives, methadone, propoxyphene, or tramadol. Additionally, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic, tetracyclic, or triazolopyridine antidepressants; cyclobenzaprine; methylphenidate, amphetamine, and their derivatives; or St John's wort are contraindicated. Such combinations could result in life-threatening serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3, 7.5)].

- **Concomitant use of dextromethorphan**: The combination of MAOIs and dextromethorphan has been reported to cause episodes of psychosis or abnormal behavior [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

- **History of hypersensitivity to safinamide**: Reactions have included swelling of the tongue and oral mucosa and dyspnea.

- **Severe hepatic impairment**: Classified as Child-Pugh C: 10–15 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^115nFXEi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

We found some indication that monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may increase the likelihood of smoking cessation relative to control (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.79; I² = 0%; 6 studies, 827 participants; Analysis 16.1). However, event rates were low (193 participants), resulting in imprecision, and confidence intervals (CIs) encompassed the possibility of harm. There was no effect of removing the one study deemed to be at high risk of bias (George 2003). Our meta-analysis included one trial of moclobemide (Berlin 1995) and five of selegiline (Biberman 2003; George 2003; Kahn 2012; Killen 2010; Weinberger 2010), and we subgrouped these accordingly. We did not identify any evidence of a subgroup difference (I² = 0%), but this should be treated with caution as only a single study contributed to the moclobemide group.

One trial of venlafaxine did not show conclusive evidence of increased smoking cessation compared to placebo (Cinciripini 2005) (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.32; 1 study, 147 participants; Analysis 17.1). Although the effect estimate was in favor of venlafaxine, CIs were wide and encompassed both potential benefit and harm.

Two small trials comparing St John's wort to placebo provided no clear evidence to suggest it was a better smoking cessation treatment than placebo when pooled (Parsons 2009; Sood 2010) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.53; I² = 29%; 2 studies, 261 participants; Analysis 18.1). However, there was substantial imprecision.

The one trial assessing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) compared to placebo provided no evidence of a benefit for smoking cessation (RR 0.70).
