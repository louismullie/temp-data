## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about trauma care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and stabilization using a structured approach. Then, I should verify hemorrhage control and resuscitation strategies, including damage control principles and transfusion protocols. Next, I will examine imaging strategies and the role of whole-body CT versus selective imaging. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pediatrics, geriatrics, and anticoagulated patients. I will then review systems-level quality metrics and implementation science. Finally, I should integrate long-term outcomes, rehabilitation, and mental health considerations, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: a structured primary survey using ABCDE or MARCH is essential to rapidly identify and treat life threats, and I should double-check that this remains the cornerstone across contemporary guidelines and reviews, which it does, including ATLS-based frameworks and recent overviews of structured trauma care [^115tjMwA] [^116b1F8k] [^111ddj5R].

> Wait, let me verify the role of the secondary survey and tertiary survey. The secondary survey ensures a complete head-to-toe examination and definitive diagnosis, while the tertiary survey, typically within 24 hours, reduces missed injuries, which can occur in up to 38% of cases without it; I should confirm that institutional protocols incorporating a tertiary survey improve detection, and yes, multiple studies and reviews support its routine use to catch occult injuries [^114GaQaM] [^112XWYQz].

> I need to check hemorrhage control priorities next. Early source control with minimal time-to-intervention is repeatedly emphasized as a key driver of survival, with European guidelines recommending direct transport to appropriate trauma centers and rapid bleeding control; I should confirm that this is graded as a strong recommendation despite limited RCT data, and indeed it is, reflecting observational and systems-level evidence [^115A6Tsi] [^114Kcxid] [^114oSKt4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about resuscitation fluids. I initially thought to default to crystalloids, but wait, I should verify current guidance favoring a restricted volume strategy with early use of blood products in a balanced ratio, and yes, contemporary guidelines endorse goal-directed transfusion and damage control resuscitation to mitigate the lethal triad of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy, with plasma:platelet:RBC ratios approximating 1:1:1 in massive transfusion contexts [^115A6Tsi] [^116t4Wsn].

> I should confirm the role of tranexamic acid. The recommendation is to administer TXA as early as possible, ideally within 3 hours, with a 1 g load over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over 8 hours; prehospital administration is reasonable when feasible, and I need to ensure I cite the guideline strength, which is Grade 1A for early use and 1B for within 3 hours [^115A6Tsi] [^114u9aKe].

> Next, I should review damage control surgery principles. Indications include persistent shock, coagulopathy, hypothermia, or inaccessible major venous injury; the sequence is abbreviated laparotomy for hemorrhage and contamination control, ICU resuscitation to correct physiology, and delayed definitive repair; I should double-check that this is supported by retrospective and cohort data given the absence of RCTs, which it is [^115em5Eq] [^113FL1uH].

> Let me consider imaging strategy carefully. Whole-body CT can reduce time to diagnosis and may reduce mortality in some studies, but I need to balance this against radiation and the risk of missing unstable patients; high-quality evidence is limited, so guidelines advise using clinical judgment and institutional protocols, with selective imaging guided by mechanism, physiology, and exam, and E-FAST plus targeted radiographs often sufficing before WBCT in stable patients [^116oUyrG] [^117URC8o] [^113VvXPB].

> I should confirm the role of viscoelastic testing. TEG/ROTEM enables rapid, goal-directed transfusion and is increasingly recommended to guide plasma, platelets, fibrinogen, and antifibrinolytics; I need to ensure I note that evidence is growing but not uniformly from high-quality RCTs, so centers should integrate it with clinical judgment and local protocols [^116t4Wsn] [^115A6Tsi].

> Now, pediatrics. Let me think about age-specific physiology and equipment. Children have higher oxygen consumption, lower blood volume, and different airway anatomy, so I should verify that pediatric-specific protocols and team preparedness are emphasized; recent pediatric trauma reviews reinforce a structured primary survey with attention to airway, circulation, and early involvement of pediatric specialists [^115HHLdK] [^114KdicG].

> For geriatrics, I need to ensure frailty assessment and undertriage are addressed. Older adults often have blunted physiologic responses, comorbidities, and anticoagulant use, so I should confirm that early trauma activation and a lower threshold for imaging and admission are recommended; guidelines suggest considering patients ≥ 55–65 years as high risk and incorporating frailty screening into decision-making [^114WuGMz] [^113dXFrV].

> Anticoagulated patients with mild TBI require special caution. I should double-check that even with a normal initial head CT, supratherapeutic INR warrants observation due to delayed intracranial hemorrhage risk, and yes, EAST recommends INR measurement and observation for anticoagulated mTBI patients with elevated INR [^114ZVz1w].

> Next, I should review systems-level quality metrics. Adherence to time-to-intervention benchmarks, TXA administration within 3 hours, early plasma administration, and tertiary survey completion are key performance indicators; I need to ensure I cite that deviation from protocols is associated with increased mortality, underscoring the need for local implementation and feedback loops [^117Fa5Kt] [^114CC2Hn].

> Let me verify implementation tools. Checklists, bundles, and simulation-based training improve adherence and outcomes; the European guideline explicitly supports a checklist approach analogous to Safe Surgery and suggests institutional quality audits to close gaps in care [^117Fa5Kt] [^113xLBV6].

> I will now examine long-term outcomes and rehabilitation. Early rehabilitation consultation, even for ICU-bound patients, reduces functional decline; I should confirm that multidisciplinary rehab teams should be integrated early, and that mental health screening for PTSD and depression is recommended given high prevalence and impact on recovery [^114Btc4T] [^114vDq2j].

> But wait, what about mental health sequelae and their detection? PTSD is common yet underrecognized in primary care and trauma follow-up; I need to ensure routine screening and access to trauma-focused psychotherapy are emphasized, as these improve symptoms and functional outcomes [^114vDq2j].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis aligns with the highest-quality sources. The sixth edition European guideline, contemporary systematic reviews, and high-credibility policies converge on structured assessment, rapid hemorrhage control, balanced resuscitation, judicious imaging, population-specific adaptations, and rigorous quality improvement as the pillars of modern trauma care, which my reasoning reflects [^115A6Tsi] [^115pVBkD] [^115tjMwA].

---

Trauma care centers on **rapid primary survey** (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure) to identify and treat life threats immediately, followed by a **secondary survey** to detect missed injuries [^115tjMwA]. Early hemorrhage control — direct pressure, tourniquets, pelvic binding, and damage-control surgery — is critical, as is **balanced resuscitation** with blood products and early tranexamic acid within 3 hours [^115A6Tsi] [^114u9aKe]. Imaging is tailored: FAST for unstable patients, and selective or whole-body CT for stable patients based on mechanism and clinical judgment [^116oUyrG] [^117Qkfyc]. Multidisciplinary teams, standardized protocols, and quality metrics improve outcomes, and special populations (pediatric, geriatric, anticoagulated) require adjusted pathways [^113xLBV6] [^114WuGMz] [^114ZVz1w].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

### Primary survey

The **primary survey** uses the ABCDE approach to rapidly identify and manage life-threatening injuries [^115tjMwA]:

- **Airway**: Assess patency, protect with C-spine immobilization, and secure if compromised [^111ddj5R].
- **Breathing**: Evaluate for tension pneumothorax, flail chest, hemothorax, and provide oxygen/ventilation as needed [^1155B7eZ].
- **Circulation**: Control bleeding, establish two large-bore IVs, and initiate balanced resuscitation with blood products [^115A6Tsi].
- **Disability**: Assess GCS, pupils, and motor function [^notfound].
- **Exposure**: Completely undress, inspect for injuries, and prevent hypothermia [^notfound].

---

### Secondary survey

The **secondary survey** is a head-to-toe examination to identify missed injuries, including a detailed history, vital sign reassessment, and targeted imaging [^116b1F8k].

---

## Hemorrhage control and resuscitation

### Hemorrhage control

- **Direct pressure**: First-line for external bleeding.
- **Tourniquets**: For extremity hemorrhage when direct pressure fails [^notfound].
- **Pelvic binding**: For unstable pelvic fractures to reduce bleeding [^112shA5x].
- **Damage control surgery**: Abbreviated laparotomy for exsanguinating patients [^115em5Eq].

---

### Resuscitation strategies

- **Balanced transfusion**: Plasma:platelets:RBCs in a 1:1:1 ratio for massive transfusion [^notfound].
- **Tranexamic acid**: 1 g IV within 3 hours of injury, then 1 g over 8 hours [^114u9aKe].
- **Restricted crystalloids**: Avoid excessive fluids to limit dilutional coagulopathy [^111M5cUn].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is **tailored to stability and mechanism**:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** |
|-|-|
| FAST ultrasound | Unstable patients; rapid detection of hemoperitoneum/hemothorax [^113VvXPB] |
| Chest/pelvis X-ray | Initial trauma bay assessment [^116b1F8k] |
| Whole-body CT | Stable patients with high-energy mechanisms or multiple injuries [^116oUyrG] |
| Head CT | Suspected TBI, altered mental status, or anticoagulation [^notfound] |

---

## Multidisciplinary care and quality improvement

- **Trauma team**: Led by a trauma surgeon, with emergency medicine, anesthesia, nursing, radiology, and blood bank [^notfound].
- **Protocols**: Standardized pathways for hemorrhage, TBI, pelvic fractures, and pediatric trauma [^115A6Tsi].
- **Quality metrics**: Time to intervention, transfusion practices, and adherence to guidelines [^113xLBV6].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pediatric**: Adjusted vitals, equipment sizes, and family-centered care [^114KdicG].
- **Geriatric**: High risk of undertriage; early activation and frailty assessment [^114WuGMz] [^113dXFrV].
- **Anticoagulated**: Lower threshold for imaging and observation, especially in TBI [^114ZVz1w].

---

## Long-term outcomes and rehabilitation

Early **rehabilitation** reduces disability and length of stay [^114Btc4T], and **mental health** screening for PTSD, depression, and anxiety is essential [^notfound].

---

Effective trauma care requires **rapid assessment**, hemorrhage control, balanced resuscitation, and coordinated multidisciplinary care, with protocols adapted to special populations and continuous quality improvement.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^115A6Tsi]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe trauma represents a major global public health burden and the management of post-traumatic bleeding continues to challenge healthcare systems around the world. Post-traumatic bleeding and associated traumatic coagulopathy remain leading causes of potentially preventable multiorgan failure and death if not diagnosed and managed in an appropriate and timely manner. This sixth edition of the European guideline on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury aims to advise clinicians who care for the bleeding trauma patient during the initial diagnostic and therapeutic phases of patient management.

Methods

The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma included representatives from six European professional societies and convened to assess and update the previous version of this guideline using a structured, evidence-based consensus approach. Structured literature searches covered the period since the last edition of the guideline, but considered evidence cited previously. The format of this edition has been adjusted to reflect the trend towards concise guideline documents that cite only the highest-quality studies and most relevant literature rather than attempting to provide a comprehensive literature review to accompany each recommendation.

Results

This guideline comprises 39 clinical practice recommendations that follow an approximate temporal path for management of the bleeding trauma patient, with recommendations grouped behind key decision points. While approximately one-third of patients who have experienced severe trauma arrive in hospital in a coagulopathic state, a systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach has been shown to reduce the number of preventable deaths attributable to traumatic injury.

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidelines are pillars of best practice in the management of severely injured trauma patients. Further improvement in outcomes will be achieved by optimising and standardising trauma care in line with the available evidence across Europe and beyond.

### ICU management of trauma patients [^1116T88y]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the current state of the art regarding management of the critically ill trauma patient with an emphasis on initial management in the ICU.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A PubMed literature review was performed for relevant articles in English related to the management of adult humans with severe trauma. Specific topics included airway management, hemorrhagic shock, resuscitation, and specific injuries to the chest, abdomen, brain, and spinal cord.

Data Extraction and Data Synthesis

The basic principles of initial management of the critically ill trauma patients include rapid identification and management of life-threatening injuries with the goal of restoring tissue oxygenation and controlling hemorrhage as rapidly as possible. The initial assessment of the patient is often truncated for procedures to manage life-threatening injuries. Major, open surgical procedures have often been replaced by nonoperative or less-invasive approaches, even for critically ill patients. Consequently, much of the early management has been shifted to the ICU, where the goal is to continue resuscitation to restore homeostasis while completing the initial assessment of the patient and watching closely for failure of nonoperative management, complications of procedures, and missed injuries.

Conclusions

The initial management of critically ill trauma patients is complex. Multiple, sometimes competing, priorities need to be considered. Close collaboration between the intensivist and the surgical teams is critical for optimizing patient outcomes.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder: evaluation and treatment… [^114vDq2j]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder is common, occurring in 6% of individuals. 1 It is often undetected in patients presenting to primary care. 2, 3 PTSD can occur in civilian and veteran populations in response to a broad range of traumatic events. PTSD affects people of all ages, and women are twice as likely to receive a diagnosis compared with men. 4 Symptoms of PTSD typically involve trauma-related intrusive thoughts, avoidant behaviors, negative alterations of cognition or mood, and changes in arousal and reactivity. 5 Two-thirds of patients with PTSD report moderate to severe symptoms. 2 PTSD may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions commonly seen in primary care.
6. 8 The pathophysiology of PTSD appears to involve impairment in traumatic memory consolidation, leading to maladaptive neuropsychological responses.

9 Patients often report reexperiencing their trauma, which triggers physiologic and psychological responses that present as primary symptoms of the disorder. Although trauma is common, affecting one-half of adults, less than 10% of patients with traumatic experiences develop PTSD. Prevention Although intervention after trauma is an opportunity to prevent PTSD, there is no consensus on how to prevent PTSD for patients with traumatic exposures. A single session debriefing is not effective at preventing PTSD development. Indirect exposure by witnessing an event or exposure to details of an event can be sufficiently traumatic. Criteria B, C, D, and E organize the symptoms of PTSD. Persistent psychological impairments include hyperarousal, avoidance, intrusive thinking, and negative cognition or mood related to the past traumatic experience.

Many patients with PTSD have sleep impairment, and symptoms typically present as difficulty falling or staying asleep and sleep disturbances, including nightmares. Treatment of Psychological Symptoms PSYCHOTHERAPY Table 2 presents an overview of PTSD treatment. Psychotherapy is the preferred initial treatment for PTSD and should be offered to all patients. 25–28 Trauma-focused psychotherapies have high-quality empirical support in the literature and show a superior reduction in PTSD symptoms with a large effect size compared with pharmacotherapy or non–trauma-focused therapies. 29–33 Trauma-focused psychotherapy centers around the experience of past traumatic events to aid in psychological processing of the events and changing unhelpful or mal-adaptive beliefs about past trauma.

34 Trauma-focused psychotherapy is a broad category that represents a wide range of manualized therapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, prolonged exposure, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.

### Pitfalls in the evaluation and resuscitation of the trauma patient [^116WMLrc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The management of the trauma patient presents the practitioner with a host of challenges, and the pace, variety of venues, and multidisciplinary nature of the field combine to create a system complexity that is laden with potential pitfalls. This review summarizes some of the general principles of medical errors and examines some of the more common pitfalls encountered in the initial resuscitation and evaluation of the major trauma patient.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^1153tacs]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based recommendations can be made with respect to many aspects of the acute management of the bleeding trauma patient, which when implemented may lead to improved patient outcomes.

Methods

The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the aim of developing guidelines for the management of bleeding following severe injury. Recommendations were formulated using a nominal group process and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) hierarchy of evidence and were based on a systematic review of published literature.

Results

Key recommendations include the following: The time elapsed between injury and operation should be minimised for patients in need of urgent surgical bleeding control, and patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an identified source of bleeding should undergo immediate surgical bleeding control unless initial resuscitation measures are successful. A damage control surgical approach is essential in the severely injured patient. Pelvic ring disruptions should be closed and stabilised, followed by appropriate angiographic embolisation or surgical bleeding control, including packing. Patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an unidentified source of bleeding should undergo immediate further assessment as appropriate using focused sonography, computed tomography, serum lactate, and/or base deficit measurements. This guideline also reviews appropriate physiological targets and suggested use and dosing of blood products, pharmacological agents, and coagulation factor replacement in the bleeding trauma patient.

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary approach to the management of the bleeding trauma patient will help create circumstances in which optimal care can be provided. By their very nature, these guidelines reflect the current state-of-the-art and will need to be updated and revised as important new evidence becomes available.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^111M5cUn]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Severe trauma continues to represent a global public health issue and mortality and morbidity in trauma patients remains substantial. A number of initiatives have aimed to provide guidance on the management of trauma patients. This document focuses on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma and encourages adaptation of the guiding principles to each local situation and implementation within each institution.

Methods

The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was founded in 2004 and included representatives of six relevant European professional societies. The group used a structured, evidence-based consensus approach to address scientific queries that served as the basis for each recommendation and supporting rationale. Expert opinion and current clinical practice were also considered, particularly in areas in which randomised clinical trials have not or cannot be performed. Existing recommendations were reconsidered and revised based on new scientific evidence and observed shifts in clinical practice; new recommendations were formulated to reflect current clinical concerns and areas in which new research data have been generated. This guideline represents the fourth edition of a document first published in 2007 and updated in 2010 and 2013.

Results

The guideline now recommends that patients be transferred directly to an appropriate trauma treatment centre and encourages use of a restricted volume replacement strategy during initial resuscitation. Best-practice use of blood products during further resuscitation continues to evolve and should be guided by a goal-directed strategy. The identification and management of patients pre-treated with anticoagulant agents continues to pose a real challenge, despite accumulating experience and awareness. The present guideline should be viewed as an educational aid to improve and standardise the care of the bleeding trauma patients across Europe and beyond. This document may also serve as a basis for local implementation. Furthermore, local quality and safety management systems need to be established to specifically assess key measures of bleeding control and outcome.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidance are key to improving patient outcomes. The implementation of locally adapted treatment algorithms should strive to achieve measureable improvements in patient outcome.

### Early management of the severely injured major trauma patient [^115dh9da]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

The major trauma team relies on an efficient, communicative team to ensure patients receive the best quality care. This requires a comprehensive handover, rapid systematic review, and early management of life- and limb-threatening injuries. These multiple injured patients often present with complex conditions in a dynamic situation. The importance of team work, communication, senior decision-making, and documentation cannot be underestimated.

---

### Intensive care of the trauma patient [^112tiosU]. Resuscitation (2001). Low credibility.

Intensive care is a process and not a location and should commence as soon as major trauma is recognised. The management of severely injured patients requires all of the skills and resources of modern day intensive care medicine and can be challenging and expensive. Despite prolonged stays in the intensive care units and hospitals, the outcome for these patients is often excellent.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^114UHEVL]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach to management of the traumatically injured patient remains the cornerstone of optimal patient care, and we have made an effort to formulate this guideline in a manner that is widely applicable to a variety of settings in clinical practice. As the volume and level of evidence in this field accumulates, the current state-of-the-art as reflected in this guideline will need to evolve accordingly.

### Issues and challenges for research in major trauma [^111rR33Q]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The starting point for evidence-based guidelines is the systematic review and critical appraisal of the relevant literature. This review highlights the risk of bias identified while critically appraising the evidence to inform the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline on the assessment and initial management of major trauma.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^114jSXHc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — initial management of open wounds and fractures in major extremity trauma emphasizes individualized decisions. There is no algorithm that fits all patients and injuries. In appropriate settings, definitive fixation of fractures and closure of traumatic wounds is appropriate. If wounds are not amenable to immediate closure, temporizing fixation and wound management until such time that definitive management is feasible is a prudent course of action. The authors note their group decided to downgrade from a strong to moderate strength of recommendation because of the large differences among studies, and every factor must be taken into consideration.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^114oSKt4]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding

Minimal elapsed time

Recommendation 1

We recommend that severely injured patients be transported directly to an appropriate trauma facility. (Grade 1B)

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and bleeding control be minimised. (Grade 1A)

Rationale

Because relatively few hospitals provide all of the services required to treat patients with multiple injuries, many healthcare systems have developed trauma networks or processes. The underlying aim of trauma care organisation is to move patients to multi-specialist care as early as possible, yet still provide immediate critical interventions. These aims can come into conflict, and there are a number of different means with which to resolve these issues, resulting in large variations in trauma care systems both between and within countries and a consequent significant heterogeneity in the literature. The evidence is weak, but there is a general consensus that the organisation of a group of hospitals into a "trauma system" leads to about a 15% reduction in trauma death, with about a 50% reduction in "preventable death". Inter-hospital transfer of patients does not seem to change overall mortality, and the evidence neither supports nor refutes direct transport from the accident scene to a major trauma centre. However, there is some evidence that a lower threshold for trauma centre care should be used in patients aged > 65 years. No definitive conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between a hospital's trauma patient volume and outcomes. Despite a lack of evidence, there is a consensus that "systemised" trauma care that matches each patient to the most appropriate treatment facility in a timely manner is advantageous, whereby the definition of "appropriate" will depend on the patient profile, the nature of the injuries and the hospital facilities available.

Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing haemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed time between the traumatic injury and admission to the operating theatre is minimised. More than 50% of all trauma patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 h of injury. Despite a lack of evidence from prospective RCTs, well-designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. In addition, studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between admission and surgical bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Minimisation of time to surgery is an accepted principle of trauma care and is unlikely to ever be tested in a clinical trial due to lack of equipoise.

### Initial management and resuscitation of severe chest trauma [^1155B7eZ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Severe chest trauma, blunt or penetrating, is responsible for up to 25% of traumatic deaths in North America. Respiratory compromise is the most frequent dramatic presentation in blunt trauma, while injuries to the heart and great vessels pose the greatest risk of immediate death following penetrating trauma. More than 80% of patients will be managed with interventions that can be performed in the emergency department. This article reviews the presentation, diagnosis, and management of the most important thoracic injuries. A structured approach to the acutely unstable patient is proposed to guide resuscitation decisions.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^111UfU5n]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Initial assessment

Recommendation 3

We recommend that the physician clinically assess the extent of traumatic haemorrhage using a combination of mechanism of injury, patient physiology, anatomical injury pattern and the patient's response to initial resuscitation (Grade 1C).

Rationale

The mechanism of injury represents an important screening tool to identify patients at risk for significant traumatic haemorrhage. For example, the American College of Surgeons defined a threshold of 6 m (20 ft) as a 'critical falling height' associated with major injuries. Further critical mechanisms include blunt versus penetrating trauma, high-energy deceleration impact, low-velocity versus high-velocity gunshot injuries, etc. The mechanism of injury in conjunction with injury severity, as defined by trauma scoring systems, and the patient's physiological presentation and response to resuscitation should further guide the decision to initiate early surgical bleeding control as outlined in the ATLS protocol. Table 2 summarises estimated blood loss based on intitial presentation. Table 3 characterises the three types of response to initial fluid resuscitation, whereby the transient responders and the non-responders are candidates for immediate surgical bleeding control.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^113CQAYR]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We have made every effort to make these guidelines applicable in daily practice in a variety of clinical settings. We wish to emphasise our conviction that a multidisciplinary approach to the management of the bleeding trauma patient will help create circumstances in which optimal care can be provided. By their very nature, these guidelines reflect the current state-of-the-art and will need to be updated and revised regularly as important new evidence becomes available.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^116dnM93]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach to the management of the traumatically injured patient remains the cornerstone of optimal patient care. Each institution needs to develop, implement and adhere to an evidence-based management protocol that has been adapted to local circumstances. As new evidence becomes available, both these clinical practice guidelines and local protocols will need to evolve accordingly.

### Polytrauma management-a single centre experience [^114bTp4N]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

The management of polytraumatised patients remains challenging in spite of advances and improvements in trauma care in recent decades. Trauma systems require enormous staff resources as well as technical equipment. Internal and external quality management processes are necessary to identify weak points and improve treatment quality. Continuous training of all professionals involved in trauma care is necessary to assure high quality, up-to-date therapy in patients with multiple injuries. Standard operating procedures such as prehospital trauma algorithms and clinical management protocols (ie, ATLS) can help to standardise and compare treatment of patients suffering from major trauma. In this overview, we describe the development and current state of our trauma department. Differences in our cohort of polytraumatised patients compared to other facilities and current strategies for initial treatment of these patients are also discussed.

### New guidelines for the initial management of head injury [^111ZLXnJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with mild head trauma will have no intracranial pathology and can be safely discharged home. It is estimated that 10% to 15% of these patients will have clinically significant findings on computed tomography imaging and up to 1% may require neurosurgical intervention. The revised Scandinavian Head Trauma Guidelines provide an evidence- and consensus-based algorithm to assist physicians in determining which patients presenting with minimal, mild or moderate blunt head injury are at higher risk for intracranial pathology and thus require neuroimaging and hospital admission. Striking a balance between health care costs and risk of morbidity remains an ongoing challenge and we will present our concerns with this useful, but conservative management algorithm.

We recommend that severely injured patients be transported directly to an appropriate trauma facility. (Grade 1B)

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and bleeding control be minimised. (Grade 1A)

Rationale

Because relatively few hospitals provide all of the services required to treat patients with multiple injuries, many healthcare systems have developed trauma networks or systems. The underlying aims of trauma care organisation is to move patients to a multi-specialist care as early as possible, yet still provide immediate critical interventions. These aims can come into conflict, and there are a number of different means with which to resolve these issues, resulting in large variations in trauma care systems both between and within countries and a consequent significant heterogeneity in the literature. The evidence is weak, but there is a general consensus that the organisation of a group of hospitals into a "trauma system" leads to about a 15% reduction in trauma death, with about a 50% reduction in "preventable death". Inter-hospital transfer of patients does not seem to change overall mortality, and the evidence neither supports nor refutes direct transport from the accident scene to a major trauma centre. However, there is some evidence that a lower threshold for trauma centre care should be used in patients aged > 65 years. No definitive conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between a hospital's trauma patient volume and outcomes. Despite a lack of evidence there is a consensus that "systemised" trauma care that matches each patient to the most appropriate treatment facility is advantageous, whereby the definition of "appropriate" will depend on the patient profile, the nature of the injuries and the hospital facilities available.

Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing haemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed time between the traumatic injury and admission to the operating theatre is minimised. More than 50% of all trauma patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 h of injury. Despite a lack of evidence from prospective RCTs, well-designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. In addition, studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between admission and surgical bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Minimisation of time to surgery is an accepted principle of trauma care and is unlikely to ever be tested in a clinical trial due to lack of equipoise.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^111be5i4]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe traumatic injury continues to present challenges to healthcare systems around the world, and post-traumatic bleeding remains a leading cause of potentially preventable death among injured patients. Now in its fifth edition, this document aims to provide guidance on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumatic injury and encourages adaptation of the guiding principles described here to individual institutional circumstances and resources.

Methods

The pan-European, multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was founded in 2004, and the current author group included representatives of six relevant European professional societies. The group applied a structured, evidence-based consensus approach to address scientific queries that served as the basis for each recommendation and supporting rationale. Expert opinion and current clinical practice were also considered, particularly in areas in which randomised clinical trials have not or cannot be performed. Existing recommendations were re-examined and revised based on scientific evidence that has emerged since the previous edition and observed shifts in clinical practice. New recommendations were formulated to reflect current clinical concerns and areas in which new research data have been generated.

Results

Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of post-traumatic coagulopathy have supported improved management strategies, including evidence that early, individualised goal-directed treatment improves the outcome of severely injured patients. The overall organisation of the current guideline has been designed to reflect the clinical decision-making process along the patient pathway in an approximate temporal sequence. Recommendations are grouped behind the rationale for key decision points, which are patient- or problem-oriented rather than related to specific treatment modalities. While these recommendations provide guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of major bleeding and coagulopathy, emerging evidence supports the author group's belief that the greatest outcome improvement can be achieved through education and the establishment of and adherence to local clinical management algorithms.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach and adherence to evidence-based guidance are key to improving patient outcomes. If incorporated into local practice, these clinical practice guidelines have the potential to ensure a uniform standard of care across Europe and beyond and better outcomes for the severely bleeding trauma patient.

### Initial management of patients with burns and combined injuries for acute care surgeons: what you need to know [^111DXLKn]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

There are nearly 700,000 adults and children with burn injuries who seek care in America each year. While most patients with major burn injuries are cared for at American Burn Association-verified burn centers, many of them present to nonburn centers initially or present with combined burns and other injuries. Despite this, burn surgery is no longer mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for general surgery residency and is rarely a meaningful component of surgical critical care fellowships. However, general surgeons are called to participate in and, occasionally, lead the care of adults and children with burn injuries when burn expertise is not available, for patients with combined burns and other injuries, when procedures are required, in intensive care units, and/or during multiple casualty incidents and disasters. Fundamental burn care knowledge and skills deployed during these moments can radically impact patients' chances of survival and future quality of life. This clinical review covers burn-specific aspects of the primary survey and follows the ABCDE approach. Additional details about core burn care principles (e.g., inhalation injury, resuscitation, wound care) and special considerations in combined burns and other injuries are also presented (e.g., burns with concomitant abdominal, thoracic, skeletal, and/or intracranial injury(ies)).

### Major trauma outside a trauma center: prehospital, emergency department, and retrieval considerations [^116rhfkQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Care of the critically injured begins well before the patient arrives at a large academic trauma center. It is important to understand the continuum of care from the point of injury in the prehospital environment, through the local hospital and retrieval, until arrival at a trauma center capable of definitive care. This article highlights the important aspects of trauma assessment and management outside of tertiary or quaternary care hospitals. Key elements of each phase of care are reviewed, including management pearls and institutional strategies to facilitate effective and efficient treatment of trauma patients from the point of injury forward.

Results

I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding

Minimal elapsed time

Recommendation 1

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and operation be minimised for patients in need of urgent surgical bleeding control (Grade 1A).

Rationale

Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing haemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed time between the traumatic injury and admission to the operating theatre is minimised. More than 50% of all trauma patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 hours of injury. Despite a lack of evidence from prospective RCTs, well-designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock.

In addition, studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between admission and surgical bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. At present, the evidence base for the impact of the implementation of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol on patient outcome is very poor, because the available literature focuses primarily on the effectiveness of ATLS as an educational tool. Future studies are needed to define the impact of the ATLS program within trauma systems at the hospital and health system level in terms of controlled before-and-after implementation designed to assess post-injury mortality as the primary outcome parameter.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^1178TRS2]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Traumatically injured patients should be transported quickly and treated by a specialised trauma centre whenever possible.
Measures to monitor and support coagulation should be initiated as early as possible and used to guide a goal-directed treatment strategy.
A damage-control approach to surgical intervention should guide patient management.
Coagulation support and thromboprophylactic strategies should consider trauma patients who have been pre-treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors.
Local adherence to a multidisciplinary, evidence-based treatment protocol should serve as the basis of patient management and undergo regular quality assessment.

### Major abdominal trauma: critical decisions and new frontiers in management [^116qLrL2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

A standardized approach should be used with a patient with abdominal trauma, including primary and secondary surveys, followed by additional diagnostic testing as indicated. Specific factors can make the diagnosis of serious abdominal trauma challenging, particularly in the face of multiple and severe injuries, unknown mechanism of injury, altered mental status, and impending or complete cardiac arrest. Advances in technology in diagnosis and/or treatment with ultrasound, helical computed tomography, and resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) have significantly advanced trauma care, and are still the focus of current and ongoing investigations.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^112RAnAF]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death worldwide among persons between 5 and 44 years of age and accounts for 10% of all deaths. In 2002, 800,000 injury-related deaths in Europe accounted for 8.3% of total deaths. Because trauma affects a disproportionate number of young people, the burden to society in terms of lost productivity, premature death, and disability is considerable. Despite improvements in trauma care, uncontrolled bleeding contributes to 30% to 40% of trauma-related deaths and is the leading cause of potentially preventable early in-hospital deaths.

Resuscitation of the trauma patient with uncontrolled bleeding requires the early identification of potential bleeding sources followed by prompt action to minimise blood loss, to restore tissue perfusion, and to achieve haemodynamic stability. Massive bleeding in trauma patients, defined here as the loss of one blood volume within 24 hours or the loss of 0.5 blood volumes within three hours, is often caused by a combination of vascular injury and coagulopathy. Contributing factors to traumatic haemorrhage include both surgical and non-surgical bleeding, prior medication, comorbidities, and acquired coagulopathy.

Here, we describe early diagnostic measures to identify haemorrhage that should trigger surgical or radiological interventions in most cases. Specific interventions to manage bleeding associated with pelvic ring injuries and hypothermia are discussed, as well as recommendations for the optimal application of fluid, pharmacological, blood product, and coagulation factor therapy in trauma patients.

These guidelines for the management of the bleeding trauma patient were developed by a multidisciplinary group of European experts and designated representatives from relevant professional societies to guide the clinician in the early phases of treatment. The recommendations presented here are based on a critical survey of the published literature and were formulated according to a consensus reached by the author group. Many of the critical issues faced by the treating physician have not been, and for ethical or practical reasons may never be, addressed by prospective randomised clinical studies, and therefore the formulation and grading of the recommendations presented here are weighted to reflect both this reality and the current state-of-the-art.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^117Fa5Kt]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Evidence to support the effectiveness of patient management algorithms in changing clinical care is weak, however local implementation of a multidisciplinary, evidence-based treatment algorithm or clinical management guideline for the bleeding trauma patient is likely to create awareness among all involved medical specialities and to improve mutual understanding. The local treatment algorithm allows, within the framework of the available evidence, flexibility to accommodate local pre-hospital rescue conditions, locally available diagnostic and therapeutic options and improves the consistency of care. However, any guideline is designed for the "average" patient, therefore the clinician must adapt and tailor treatment to best accommodate each individual case.

If key interventions described in a guideline are implemented, outcomes are likely to be improved and death and other complications reduced. Moreover, treatment according to management guidelines may be associated with cost savings. Unfortunately, strict guideline adherence is often challenging in a complex case with poor prognosis, therefore the association between guideline adherence and good outcomes is not necessarily causal.

The implementation of our recommendations might be facilitated by a checklist approach analogous to the Safe Surgery Initiative, which led to fewer postoperative complications. In addition or alternatively, it may be possible to implement our recommendations using bundles as has been successfully achieved during implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Suggested items that should be included in such a checklist are summarised in Table 4. Suggested patient management bundles are listed in Table 5.

Table 4
Treatment pathway checklist

Table 5
Suggested management bundles

Training in trauma care should emphasise the key role of coagulation in determining outcome. Increasing clinician knowledge and understanding in this area should be an integral part of the implementation of the algorithm. All trauma care centres should evaluate their own performance using a routine institutional quality management programme. An audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback and practice change where needed should be included as part of the local implementation of these guidelines. In order to evaluate the quality of care provided to the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest that adherence to the following quality standards be assessed:
Time from injury to the initiation of intervention to stop bleeding (surgery or embolisation) in hypotensive patients who do not respond to initial resuscitation.
Time from hospital arrival to availability of a full set of blood results [full blood count, PT, fibrinogen, calcium, viscoelastic testing (if available)].
Proportion of patients receiving TXA within 3 h after injury.
Time from hospital arrival to CT scan in bleeding patients without an obvious source of haemorrhage.
Damage control surgical techniques used in accordance with Recommendation 19.
Thromboprophylaxis commenced in accordance with Recommendation 37.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^114wKX4W]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Coagulation monitoring and measures to support coagulation should be implemented as early as possible following traumatic injury and used to guide haemostatic therapy.

- A damage control approach to surgical procedures should guide patient management, including closure and stabilisation of pelvic ring disruptions, packing, embolisation and local haemostatic measures.

- This guideline reviews appropriate physiological targets and suggested use and dosing of fluids, blood products and pharmacological agents in the bleeding trauma patient.

- The growing number of older patients requires special attention to appropriately manage the inherent thromboembolic risk profiles and possible pre-treatment with antiplatelet agents and/or oral anticoagulants.

- A multidisciplinary approach to the management of the traumatically injured patient remains the cornerstone of optimal patient care, and each institution needs to develop, implement and adhere to an evidence-based management protocol that has been adapted to local circumstances.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^114Kcxid]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding

Minimal elapsed time

Recommendation 1

We recommend that severely injured patients be transported directly to an appropriate trauma facility (Grade 1B).

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and bleeding control be minimised (Grade 1B).

Rationale

Regionalisation of trauma management, with designated trauma centres that offer different levels of care and that interact with both each other and pre-hospital emergency medical services have improved trauma care in many countries. Several have also implemented trauma quality improvement programmes and continuously evaluate their results using trauma registries. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 52 studies that included 1,106,431 trauma patients, the effectiveness of such trauma care systems was evaluated. The study showed a significant reduction in mortality after implementation of trauma systems and demonstrated that survival improved when systems were further developed. In a retrospective multicentre cohort study of the Quebec trauma registry the impact of trauma centre designation level on outcomes following haemorrhagic shock (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) was studied. Level I trauma centres showed significantly lower standardised mortality rates among bleeding trauma patients compared with level III and IV trauma centres. This study supports the idea that "systemised" trauma care that matches each patient to the most appropriate treatment facility in a timely manner is advantageous, whereby the definition of "appropriate" depends on patient vital status, the nature of the injuries and the hospital facilities available.

Quality management

Recommendation 37

We recommend that each institution include an assessment of adherence to the institutional algorithm in routine quality management. (Grade 1C)

Rationale

The development of a multi-disciplinary evidence-based treatment algorithm for the bleeding trauma patient offers a unique opportunity to create awareness among all involved medical specialities and to improve mutual understanding. The treatment algorithm allows, within the framework of the available evidence, flexibility to accommodate local pre-hospital rescue conditions, locally available diagnostic and therapeutic options and improves the consistency of care. Numerous examples demonstrate the value of a treatment algorithm in improving the care of trauma patients; some also resulted in cost savings. Conversely, deviation from treatment pathways increases morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, with a three-fold increased mortality in the subgroup of major deviations.

The implementation of our recommendations and adherence to a local treatment algorithm is facilitated by a checklist analogous to the Safe Surgery Initiative. Suggested items that should be included in such a checklist are summarised in Table 4. Trauma treatment training should be an integral part of the implementation of the algorithm.

Table 4
Treatment pathway checklist

N/A, not applicable.

In addition, adherence to the institutional treatment algorithm should be included as part of routine institutional quality management. Most institutions have established a quality improvement program to assist clinical teams in evaluating their own performance. An audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback and practice change where needed should be included as part of the local implementation of these guidelines. In order to evaluate the quality of care provided to the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest that the following quality standards be used:

â€¢ Time from injury to the initiation of intervention to stop bleeding (surgery or embolisation) in hypotensive patients who do not respond to initial resuscitation.

â€¢ Time from hospital arrival to availability of a full set of blood results (full blood count, PT, fibrinogen, calcium, viscoelastic testing (if available)).

â€¢ Proportion of patients receiving TXA before leaving the emergency room.

â€¢ Time from hospital arrival to CT scan in bleeding patients without an obvious source of hemorrhage.

â€¢ Damage control surgical techniques are used in accordance with Recommendation 21.

â€¢ Thromboprophylaxis commenced in accordance with Recommendation 34.

Extended post-discharge follow-up times may be required to provide longer-term outcome data, because an increasing percentage of trauma mortality occurs after hospital discharge. Approximately 50% of mortality among trauma patients older than 65 years of age occurs between 30 days and 6 months after injury.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^111Jkg9i]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

This guideline is associated with several limitations. First, only a few of the recommendations are based on high-quality evidence, a fact that highlights the need for future research in this area. Second, in order to support a more general approach to the trauma patient, specific recommendations for special populations such as paediatric patients or patients with TBI have not been included. Third, these guidelines are limited to recommendations for which implementation is likely to be feasible within most European healthcare systems. Nevertheless, we are confident that adherence to these European guidelines for the management of the bleeding trauma patient will result in higher patient survival.

In publishing the sixth edition of this guideline, our aim continues to be improvement of outcomes in severely injured trauma patients by optimising and standardising trauma care in line with the available evidence across Europe and beyond.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^1117abmg]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding is the leading cause of potentially preventable death among trauma patients. About one-third of all trauma patients with bleeding present with a coagulopathy on hospital admission. This subset of patients has a significantly increased incidence of multiple organ failure and death compared to patients with similar injury patterns in the absence of a coagulopathy. Appropriate management of the trauma patient with massive bleeding, defined here as the loss of one blood volume within 24 hours or the loss of 0.5 blood volumes within 3 hours, includes the early identification of potential bleeding sources followed by prompt measures to minimise blood loss, restore tissue perfusion and achieve haemodynamic stability. Confounding factors include co-morbidities, pre-medication and physical parameters that contribute to a coagulopathic state.

The early acute coagulopathy associated with traumatic injury has recently been recognised as a multifactorial primary condition that results from a combination of shock, tissue injury-related thrombin generation and the activation of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways. The condition is influenced by environmental and therapeutic factors that contribute to acidaemia, hypothermia, dilution, hypoperfusion and haemostasis factor consumption. A number of terms have been proposed to describe the condition, which is distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation, including acute traumatic coagulopathy, early coagulopathy of trauma, acute coagulopathy of trauma-shock and trauma-induced coagulopathy. With the evolution of the concept of an early post-traumatic coagulopathic state, it may be appropriate to reassess some data from the past, and with time new research will doubtless lead to a better understanding of the risks and benefits of different therapeutic approaches applied to this group of patients.

### The initial approach to the multisystem pediatric trauma patient [^115HHLdK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Trauma remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and youth 1 to 19 years old in the United States. Providing timely care with a systematic approach is essential for emergently addressing life-threatening injuries and ongoing assessment. The primary survey is focused on identifying and managing life-threatening injuries. The secondary survey is focused on identifying and managing other important injuries. Over the past decade, there have been important advances in the evidence supporting the management of multisystem trauma in the pediatric patient by the emergency medicine clinician. In addition, the emergence of diagnostics, such as point-of-care ultrasound, aids decision making in the evaluation and management of the pediatric trauma patient. The purpose of this article is to review the initial systematic diagnostic approach and the emergent management of multisystem injuries from blunt force trauma in children in the emergency department and provide insight into the aspects of care that are still evolving.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^1173gotz]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Severe trauma is a major global public health issue. Traumatic injury contributes to about one in ten mortalities, resulting in the annual worldwide death of more than 5.8 million people, a number that is predicted to increase to > 8 million by 2020. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic accidents, suicides and homicides are the three leading causes of injury and violence-related deaths. As a consequence, there have been numerous national and international initiatives that aim to prevent violence and traumatic injuries and to provide guidance on the treatment of trauma victims. Uncontrolled post-traumatic bleeding is the leading cause of potentially preventable death among injured patients and the bleeding trauma patient represents a significant financial burden for societies, therefore improvements in the management of the massively bleeding trauma patient via educational measures and state-of-the-art clinical practice guidelines should improve outcomes by assisting in the timely identification of bleeding sources, followed by prompt measures to minimise blood loss, restore tissue perfusion and achieve haemodynamic stability.

Over the past decade the specific pathophysiology associated with bleeding following traumatic injury has been increasingly recognised and management strategies are evolving. Upon hospital admission about one-third of all bleeding trauma patients already show signs of coagulopathy and a significant increase in the occurrence of multiple organ failure and death compared to patients with similar injury patterns in the absence of a coagulopathy. The early acute coagulopathy associated with traumatic injury has recently been recognised as a multifactorial primary condition that results from a combination of bleeding-induced shock, tissue injury-related thrombin-thrombomodulin-complex generation and the activation of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways (Fig. 1). The severity of the coagulation disorder is influenced by environmental and therapeutic factors that result in, or at least contribute to, acidaemia, hypothermia, dilution, hypoperfusion and coagulation factor consumption. Moreover, the coagulopathy is modified by trauma-related factors such as brain injury and individual patient-related factors that include age, genetic background, co-morbidities, inflammation and pre-medication, especially oral anticoagulants, and pre-hospital fluid administration.

### Appropriateness of initial course of action in the management of blunt trauma based on a diagnostic workup including an extended ultrasonography scan [^117Qkfyc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the added value of a diagnostic workup including an extended Focused Assessment With Sonography for Trauma (E-FAST) to support decision-making in the trauma bay?

Findings

In this cohort study from 6 French trauma centers, a workup combining a systematic clinical examination, targeted radiographs, and a systematic E-FAST provided critical information to appropriately guide decisions and immediate course of action. The course of action taken following this workup was considered appropriate by an expert panel in 493 of 510 cases.

Meaning

These findings reinforce the use of bedside diagnostic workup in the trauma bay before whole-body computed tomography scanning.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society and international association of trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) recommendations: paper 1: initial care-pre and intraoperative care until ICU, including non-operative management [^115C7ba3]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols reduce length of stay, complications, and costs for elective surgical procedures. It remains challenging to implement ERAS concepts in the acute trauma patient due to deranged physiological reserve from the penetrating or blunt trauma producing altered physiology. However, systems of care improve access to early intervention and potentially reduce mortality. These consensus guidelines examine optimal pre-hospital, resuscitation-room, intra-, and post-operative treatment, systems of ethical management, and overall care for trauma patients in the post-resuscitation phase of care. The guideline is presented in three parts, this being part 1.

Methods

Experts in aspects of management of trauma surgical patients and intensive care were invited to contribute by the International ERAS Society and IATSIC. PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE database searches on English language publications were performed for ERAS elements using the patient intervention comparator outcome (PICO) consensus questions created by the expert group. Studies were selected with particular attention to randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large cohort studies, reviewed, and summarized recommendations were graded using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system. These recommendations based on current best evidence, with extrapolation from elective patient studies, where appropriate, were followed by a modified two-round Delphi method to validate final recommendations. Several ERAS components are already standard of care within national and society guidelines and are endorsed. The bulk of the text focuses on key areas pertaining specifically to trauma care of major trauma and polytrauma in the ICU-requiring group.

Results

Overall 37 aspects of trauma care were considered with multiple PICO questions and sub-points. Consensus was reached after two rounds of a modified Delphi process involving all authors, with minor adjustments to some phrasing required, but with 87% overall agreement on all statements (100% agreement on 31 of the main statement sets, prior to minor edits to address the points of difference for the rest with 100% total agreement thereafter). None were rejected outright. The recommendations and level of evidence for each aspect of trauma care that may impact on improved recovery and reduced length of hospital stay are presented with grade of recommendation.

Conclusions

The guidelines relating to initial care and decision-making are presented in part 1 of the Guidelines. These guidelines are based on current best evidence for an ERAS approach to patients who have had major injuries and polytrauma. The guidelines are not exhaustive but collate the best available evidence on important components of care for this patient population. As some of the evidence is extrapolated from elective surgery and non-trauma emergency surgery, some of the components need further evaluation in future studies.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^114WuGMz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Definitions

Key Question 1.1

Which trauma patient is defined as "old" at initial evaluation?

Statement 1.1.1

The chronological age does not correspond to the biological age. Aging is correlated with para-physiological changes in organ systems with altered response to trauma, compared with younger injured patients [QoE MODERATE B].

Statement 1.1.2

Patients aged ≥ 55 may require dedicated trauma care, because they may have high mortality rates after trauma [QoE LOW C].

Statement 1.1.3

The age of 65 is most often used referring to "old", "elderly" or "geriatric" patients [QoE HIGH A].

Recommendation 1.1

We suggest early trauma protocol activation in patients aged ≥ 55 years old [Weak recommendation based on a low level of evidence 2C].

We recommend to carefully evaluate injured patients aged ≥ 55-year-old for potential high risk of mortality and to avoid under-triage [Strong recommendation based on a low level of evidence 1C].

Summary of evidence and discussion

There are different ways of defining elderly people. Statistics on ageing generally categorize older people as being above a certain age threshold. Despite that, different cut-off levels of age have been suggested, generally a patient is defined as "geriatric" when aged 65 years old. The United Nations (UN) noted in World Population Ageing 2019 that older people are commonly defined as those aged from 60 or 65 years or more, while the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that older people in developed world economies are commonly defined as those aged 65 years or more. The WHO uses an alternative definition, whereby an older person is defined as someone who has already passed the median life expectancy at birth.

In trauma management, recent data suggest that mortality as adjusted for injury severity scale (ISS) increases at the age of 70 years, making the age of 70 the cutoff at which to consider a patient with trauma elderly or geriatric. This notion is distinct from Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) teaching, which recommends transportation to a trauma center for any patient older than 55 years. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guidelines which defines patients older than 65 years as elderly.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^114Bb5yw]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Recommendation 1

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and operation be minimised for patients in need of urgent surgical bleeding control (grade 1A).

Rationale

Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing haemorrhage demonstrate better survival if the elapsed time between the traumatic injury and admission to the operating theatre is minimised. Although there are no randomised control studies to verify this statement, there are retrospective studies that provide enough evidence for early surgical intervention in these patients. This is particularly true for patients who present in an exsanguinated state or in severe haemorrhagic shock due to penetrating vascular injuries. In accordance with these observations, Blocksom and colleagues concluded that rapid resuscitation and surgical control of haemorrhage is of utmost importance and one of the prognostic determinants in a retrospective study on duodenal injuries. A retrospective study by Ertel and colleagues that included 80 polytrauma patients in extremis or with persistent haemodynamic instability also favoured early surgical intervention to stabilise a pelvic fracture or to surgically control bleeding.

In addition, studies of different trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between initial care and surgery for those with signs of exsanguination or ongoing severe haemorrhage. Hill and colleagues observed a significant decrease in mortality from shock by introducing an educational program on trauma and by establishing a 60-minute emergency department time limit for patients in a state of haemorrhagic shock. Others also stress the importance of a well-functioning system capable of timely control of haemorrhage in the exsanguinating or the severely bleeding patient. In a retrospective review of 537 deaths in the operation room, Hoyt and colleagues drew the conclusion that delayed transfer to the operating room was a cause of death that could be avoided by shortening the time required for diagnosis and resuscitation prior to surgery.

II. Diagnosis and monitoring of bleeding

Upon patient arrival in the emergency room, an initial clinical assessment of the extent of bleeding should be employed to identify patients at risk of coagulopathy.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^113Grj1V]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based recommendations are needed to guide the acute management of the bleeding trauma patient, which when implemented may improve patient outcomes.

Methods

The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the aim of developing a guideline for the management of bleeding following severe injury. This document presents an updated version of the guideline published by the group in 2007. Recommendations were formulated using a nominal group process, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence and based on a systematic review of published literature.

Results

Key changes encompassed in this version of the guideline include new recommendations on coagulation support and monitoring and the appropriate use of local haemostatic measures, tourniquets, calcium and desmopressin in the bleeding trauma patient. The remaining recommendations have been reevaluated and graded based on literature published since the last edition of the guideline. Consideration was also given to changes in clinical practice that have taken place during this time period as a result of both new evidence and changes in the general availability of relevant agents and technologies.

Conclusions

This guideline provides an evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to the management of critically injured bleeding trauma patients.

### Major trauma CT scanning: the experience of a regional trauma centre in the UK [^111K9FhK]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trauma remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity, particularly among young adults. A major trauma (whole-body) CT protocol based upon mechanism of injury was investigated in a busy emergency department.

Methods

Trauma patients presenting in two 3-month periods before and after the introduction of a major trauma CT protocol were identified. The mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score, radiological imaging performed and injuries detected were recorded.

Results

More eligible patients received major trauma CT scanning post-protocol than pre-protocol (87/114 (76%) vs 44/94 (47%)). There were no adverse effects attributable to major trauma CT. Seventeen injuries were detected post-protocol that would not have been detected had imaging been conducted based on clinical suspicion rather than mechanism of injury. In three cases an immediate intervention was required.

Conclusion

Our major trauma CT protocol, based on mechanism of injury, resulted in substantial changes in clinical management in a small number of patients without any increase in adverse events. However, it is not a substitute for clinical acumen in the initial assessment of trauma patients.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^112sF4kP]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based recommendations are needed to guide the acute management of the bleeding trauma patient. When these recommendations are implemented patient outcomes may be improved.

Methods

The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the aim of developing a guideline for the management of bleeding following severe injury. This document represents an updated version of the guideline published by the group in 2007 and updated in 2010. Recommendations were formulated using a nominal group process, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence and based on a systematic review of published literature.

Results

Key changes encompassed in this version of the guideline include new recommendations on the appropriate use of vasopressors and inotropic agents, and reflect an awareness of the growing number of patients in the population at large treated with antiplatelet agents and/or oral anticoagulants. The current guideline also includes recommendations and a discussion of thromboprophylactic strategies for all patients following traumatic injury. The most significant addition is a new section that discusses the need for every institution to develop, implement and adhere to an evidence-based clinical protocol to manage traumatically injured patients. The remaining recommendations have been re-evaluated and graded based on literature published since the last edition of the guideline. Consideration was also given to changes in clinical practice that have taken place during this time period as a result of both new evidence and changes in the general availability of relevant agents and technologies.

Conclusions

A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to trauma care and mechanisms with which to ensure that established protocols are consistently implemented will ensure a uniform and high standard of care across Europe and beyond.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society and international association of trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) recommendations: paper 1: initial care-pre and intraoperative care until ICU, including non-operative management [^114yNBmw]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols reduce length of stay, complications, and costs for elective surgical procedures. It remains challenging to implement ERAS concepts in the acute trauma patient due to deranged physiological reserve from the penetrating or blunt trauma producing altered physiology. However, systems of care improve access to early intervention and potentially reduce mortality. These consensus guidelines examine optimal pre‐hospital, resuscitation‐room, intra‐, and post‐operative treatment, systems of ethical management, and overall care for trauma patients in the post‐resuscitation phase of care. The guideline is presented in three parts, this being part 1.

Methods

Experts in aspects of management of trauma surgical patients and intensive care were invited to contribute by the International ERAS Society and IATSIC. PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE database searches on English language publications were performed for ERAS elements using the patient intervention comparator outcome (PICO) consensus questions created by the expert group. Studies were selected with particular attention to randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta‐analyses, and large cohort studies, reviewed, and summarized recommendations were graded using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system. These recommendations based on current best evidence, with extrapolation from elective patient studies, where appropriate, were followed by a modified two‐round Delphi method to validate final recommendations. Several ERAS components are already standard of care within national and society guidelines and are endorsed. The bulk of the text focuses on key areas pertaining specifically to trauma care of major trauma and polytrauma in the ICU‐requiring group.

Results

Overall 37 aspects of trauma care were considered with multiple PICO questions and sub‐points. Consensus was reached after two rounds of a modified Delphi process involving all authors, with minor adjustments to some phrasing required, but with 87% overall agreement on all statements (100% agreement on 31 of the main statement sets, prior to minor edits to address the points of difference for the rest with 100% total agreement thereafter). None were rejected outright. The recommendations and level of evidence for each aspect of trauma care that may impact on improved recovery and reduced length of hospital stay are presented with grade of recommendation.

Conclusions

The guidelines relating to initial care and decision‐making are presented in part 1 of the Guidelines. These guidelines are based on current best evidence for an ERAS approach to patients who have had major injuries and polytrauma. The guidelines are not exhaustive but collate the best available evidence on important components of care for this patient population. As some of the evidence is extrapolated from elective surgery and non‐trauma emergency surgery, some of the components need further evaluation in future studies.

### Evidence-based guidelines for bleeding in trauma patients: where do we go from here? [^112YQAw1]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The development of evidence-based guidelines has gained popularity as a strategy to reduce variation in practice and to orient clinical care around documentable best practices. Based on available data, the new European guidelines for the management of bleeding in the trauma patient do deliver a number of sound recommendations. However, some issues remain controversial and, like many guidelines, the actual translation of these evidence-based recommendations into routine clinical practice protocols continues to leave opportunity for variation. Nevertheless, this consensus guideline provides an excellent starting point. As evidence continues to accumulate, future iterations should provide greater specificity and move us closer to the definitive best practice.

### Management of major trauma haemorrhage: treatment priorities and controversies [^116t4Wsn]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

### Structured approach with primary and secondary survey for major trauma care: an overview of reviews [^115tjMwA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trauma injuries account for 4.5 million deaths globally and approximately 530 000 deaths in Europe every year. Almost 10% of the global burden of disease is due to trauma, and trauma is the top contributor to the burden of disease in children and adults aged 10–49 years.

Accurate diagnosis is essential for the best therapeutic process. Trauma care is time-sensitive, and early management of life-threatening or limb-threatening conditions is critical. The complexity of the diagnostic process of trauma patients depends not only on its time-dependent nature but it is also due to the numerous settings of care in which diagnosis occurs, the potential existence of multiple injuries in different body areas and the involvement of different specialists within a single diagnostic process. Alongside the diagnostic process, it is also essential to establish adequate management of trauma patients, which represents another critical step that adds complexity to trauma cases. In general, the management of trauma patients can be performed through a structured or a non-structured approach.

The structured approach involves the management of the trauma patient in a systematic manner. For trauma patients, several checklists based on a structured approach have been developed to improve the early management, such as the life support checklist explored in training programmes for trauma assessment and treatment. The first training programmes were introduced by the American College of Surgeons with a worldwide spread in the past 20 years: Prehospital Trauma Care (PTC) and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS ®). Moreover, a branch of the ATLS programme was established also for nurses, the Advanced Trauma Course for Nurses (ATCN ®). In Europe, in 2008 a new European Trauma Course (ETC ®) was organized, with the non-technical skills of the trauma team as the main objective. Within all of these programmes, there is a comprehensive evaluation of the trauma patient, followed by accurate diagnostic imaging.

### Diagnosis and monitoring of hemorrhagic shock during the initial resuscitation of multiple trauma patients: a review [^1141PbVi]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of the multiple trauma victim requires evaluation for potential hemorrhage and ongoing monitoring to assess the efficacy of resuscitation and avoid complications related to hemorrhagic shock. A variety of strategies exist to assess circulatory status, including hemodynamic monitoring, tissue perfusion measurement, and use of serum markers of metabolism. We review available technologies used to assess fluid status and tissue perfusion in patients with blood loss or hemorrhagic shock, discuss how these methods can be used effectively and efficiently during initial trauma resuscitation to guide therapy and disposition, and suggest directions for future research to improve outcomes by providing more appropriate and timely care and avoiding unnecessary complications.

### Missed injury and the tertiary trauma survey [^114GaQaM]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Missed injury in the context of major trauma remains a persistent problem, both from a clinical and medico-legal point-of-view. Estimates of the incidence vary widely, dependent on the precise parameters of the studied population, the definition of missed injury and the extent of follow-up, but may be as high as 38%. The tertiary survey, in which formal repeated examination of the patient is undertaken after initial resuscitation and treatment have taken place, has been suggested as a way of identifying injuries not found at presentation. This paper appraises the concept of the tertiary survey, and also reviews the literature on missed injury in order to identify the risk factors, the types of injury and the reasons for error.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^112T25j3]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain assessment in trauma patients — key points include: "Consider the multidimensional nature of pain when selecting a pain assessment tool"; "During pain assessment, account for the patient's cognition and ability to communicate, which may be affected by injury, extent of illness, age, and other factors"; "Reassess pain systematically, ideally using the same appropriate tool"; and "Reevaluate significant changes in pain promptly to identify missed, new, or developing injuries". The page states that "Pain assessment is a complex process, and pain is difficult to fully quantify with any single assessment tool", that "Unidimensional scales may not accurately reflect the multidimensional nature of the patient's pain experience", and advises "Avoid changing the tool selected for the initial pain assessment unless necessary". It adds that "When assessing pain, health care providers must acknowledge their biases and navigate multiple competing interests to relieve pain, prescribe responsibly, and preserve the patient-provider relationship", and concludes that "The goal of pain management is not "zero pain" but pain that is tolerable and allows the patient to function".

### Appropriateness of initial course of action in the management of blunt trauma based on a diagnostic workup including an extended ultrasonography scan [^113biMsx]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Primary Outcome Criterion

All therapeutic options listed above constituted the possible global course of action, including abstention. The observed course of action was assessed by 2 independent board-certified physicians (specializing in anesthesia and critical care and echography) with more than 10 years of experience in managing patients with major blunt trauma. The experts were recruited from a college of French trauma experts; all participated in trauma guideline development. The primary outcome criterion was the level of appropriateness of the observed course of action as assessed by the expert panel by a simple binary outcome (appropriate or inappropriate). In case of a disagreement between the 2 experts, a masked third expert made the final decision.

The expert clinicians had all available clinical information at their disposal including the complete injury burden from the WBCT performed for their assessment. Deliberately, no preformatted global course of action was imposed on the experts to mimic an adaptive decision-making process comparable with a clinical setting. Experts were not aware of the study hypothesis. A script concordance based on 2 virtual standardized cases tested the agreement between experts before the study (1 case had to be considered as appropriate and the other 1 had to be considered as inappropriate); a Cohen κ quantified the level of agreement.

Hypothesis

The initial diagnostic workup combining systematic clinical examination, E-FAST, and targeted pelvic and chest radiographs generates sufficient information to adopt an appropriate course of action before a WBCT. For each case, the integrity of all decisions and actions (including no action) were considered appropriate if in agreement with the expert panel. The global course of action was considered inappropriate if at least 1 decision or action was not in agreement. Based on the initial work by Peytel et al, the investigators expected a level of agreement above 95% between the observed course of action and assessment by the expert panel.

Secondary Outcome Criterion

To determine the decision-making value of each diagnostic modality, after discharge of the patient from the resuscitation room, the trauma team leader in charge, and who was not aware of study hypothesis, estimated which element of the diagnostic workup affected his or her decision-making about treatment choice before the WBCT given the following choices: clinical context and examination exclusively, clinical examination and E-FAST, clinical examination and radiographs, and the combination of clinical examination, E-FAST, and radiographs. Additionally, the duration of E-FAST was categorized as less than 5 minutes, between 5 and 10 minutes, and more than 10 minutes, and all individual decisions accounted for.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^114Btc4T]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Rehabilitation of the multisystem trauma patient — key messages emphasize that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team can provide optimal care to multiply-injured patients and should be integrated into the acute care hospitalization. Initial evaluation by a rehabilitation team should occur as early as possible following admission, even for critically ill patients unable to actively participate. Early evaluation provides an opportunity for the development of a proactive rehabilitation program and might reduce functional decline during hospitalization.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a guide to the paediatric primary survey [^111kxVPm]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

It's 21:00 and you receive a stand-by call from the local ambulance service. Peter, a 9-year-old boy, was riding an electric scooter and has collided with a car. He has reduced consciousness, signs of shock and is hypoxic. How will you prepare your team? What are the possible injuries? Who will perform the primary survey? Injury is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the paediatric population accounting for approximately half of all attendances to paediatric emergency departments in the UK and Ireland. Major trauma can be distressing for patients, parents and physicians. Managing major trauma is challenging and it is vital to have a clear and organised approach. In this 15-minute guide we describe a structured approach to the primary survey that includes how to prepare before the child's arrival, the suggested roles of team members and the key components of the primary survey. We discuss life-threatening injuries, the life-saving bundle and the principles of resuscitation, and the role of imaging in the initial assessment of the injured child.

### Geriatric trauma management [^112Qzu4Z]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Geriatric trauma management — neurological comorbidities: Preexisting neurological disorders may complicate the initial evaluation of the trauma patient, especially if the patient's medical history is unknown. Older adults are disproportionately affected by neurological disorders such as cerebrovascular disease, dementia, movement disorders, epilepsy, and brain neoplasms, with age-associated immune and vascular changes implicated in major chronic comorbid conditions in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems. Potential neurological comorbidities that may cloud the initial evaluation include malignant or benign tumors, seizure disorders, developmental disorders (Down syndrome), movement disorders (Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis), dementia (Alzheimer's), stroke, neurological infections, and previous trauma to the brain or spinal cord. Psychiatric comorbidities such as mood and anxiety disorders often co-occur with common neurological comorbidities.

### The initial assessment and management of the multiple-trauma patient with an associated spine injury [^111p2o8Q]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review and summary of the relevant literature from multiple disciplines.

Objective

Provide the readership with evidence-based guidelines on the initial assessment and treatment of the multiple-trauma patient with an associated spinal column injury.

Summary Of Background Data

Early operative stabilization of the isolated spinal column injury has decreased hospital and intensive care unit length of stay. Early intervention has not provided consistently improved neurologic outcomes. The timing of spinal column stabilization in the multiple-trauma patient continues to be a source of discussion.

Methods

Review of published English literature from 1990 to present using key words: spinal trauma, multiple-trauma with spinal injury; timing of spinal injury treatment; spinal fracture management; and Advanced Trauma Life Support.

Conclusions

The treatment of the poly-trauma patient with an associated spinal column injury requires strict adherence to Advanced Trauma Life Support principles. Once life and limb-threatening injuries have been identified and addressed, spinal column assessment and neurologic protection must be maintained at the highest priority. Early spinal stabilization can be performed safely in the multiple-trauma patient in medical centers, in which medical and ancillary staff is available on a 24-hour basis and is familiar with these procedures.

### Structured approach with primary and secondary survey for major trauma care: an overview of reviews [^116b1F8k]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conventionally after hospital admission, the trauma team performs a clinical examination, laboratory examinations and emergency room diagnostic imaging, extended focussed assessment sonography for trauma (eFAST) and chest and pelvis X-ray (primary survey). After this initial evaluation and stabilization, the team performs a secondary survey whose goal is to make a definitive and complete diagnosis of all the injuries produced by trauma (secondary survey). Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) can be selectively obtained in patients with evidence or suspicion of some abnormality. Alternatively, thanks to the availability of even faster devices in the proximity of the emergency room, a whole body contrast-enhanced CT scan (WBCT) has been suggested as a non-selective imaging to screen all patients with suspected major trauma, even with borderline vital signs.

Although the structured approach is widely used worldwide, the real advantages over a non-structured approach in terms of clinical safety and cost-effectiveness are still not well established. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the effects of the application of a structured approach and of different diagnostic imaging strategies on critical outcomes during patient trauma resuscitation, in the context of the development of the Italian National Institute of Health guidelines on major trauma-integrated management. We aim to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of structured approach (primary and secondary survey) by guideline checklist compared to non-structured approach (i.e. clinical examination). Moreover, routine WBCT screening was compared to non-routine WBCT in patients with suspected major trauma.

### Proactive surgical management and outcomes of unilateral zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures in major trauma patients: a national level I center experience [^116KWs1f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study is particularly significant as it focuses on a unique subset of trauma patients characterized by severe injuries, a group that is often underrepresented in general trauma statistics. While existing literature predominantly reports on trauma populations with varying degrees of injury severity, the data presented here reflect the clinical outcomes and challenges associated with managing patients with severe facial trauma, as evidenced by high ISSs and accompanying comorbidities. Our findings, including an average ISS of 25.08 and the need for intubation in 25% of cases, emphasize the critical condition of this patient cohort, setting it apart from the broader, more heterogeneous trauma populations often described in prior studies. This distinction not only highlights the specialized care required for these patients but also underscores the value of this study in addressing a gap in the current body of trauma research. By providing insights into the management and outcomes of severe trauma patients, our work contributes valuable and less common data that may inform future clinical protocols and research in the field.

This study highlights the proactive approach of our institution in managing facial trauma, even in patients with severe injuries. Analysis of the time from initial injury to surgical intervention reveals that surgery was not delayed for major trauma patients (ISS > 15). This reflects a well-coordinated system that supports timely intervention for facial trauma patients regardless of injury severity. As a result, even those with high ISS scores received prompt and effective surgical care, emphasizing our institution's unbiased commitment to treating severe trauma cases. Despite the challenges posed by severe trauma, such as swelling or poor patient conditions, there was no significant difference in surgical timing or procedures, including fixation and orbital reconstruction, between the groups. This demonstrates that major trauma patients were not deprioritized but received surgical management comparable to less severe cases. Our findings contrast with traditional practices where facial injuries in major trauma patients are often conservatively managed, showcasing a system that prioritizes comprehensive care even in the most critical situations.

### Systematic review of the benefits and harms of whole-body computed tomography in the early management of multitrauma patients: are we getting the whole picture? [^117URC8o]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable interest in whether routine whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) imaging produces different patient outcomes in blunt trauma patients when compared with selective imaging. This article aimed to systematically review the literature for all outcomes measured in comparing WBCT with selective imaging in trauma patients and to evaluate the comprehensiveness of relevant dimensions for this comparison.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of studies comparing WBCT and selective imaging approaches during the initial assessment of multitrauma patients. Peer-reviewed studies including cohort studies, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were identified through large database searches and filtered through methodologic inclusion criteria. Data on study characteristics, hypotheses and conclusions made, outcomes assessed, and references to potential benefits and harms were extracted.

Results

Eight retrospective cohort studies and two systematic reviews were identified. Six primary studies evaluated mortality as an outcome, and four studies found a significant difference in results favoring WBCT imaging over selective imaging. All five articles assessing various time intervals in hospital following imaging after injury found significantly reduced times with WBCT. Radiation exposure was found to be increased after WBCT imaging compared with selective imaging in the only study in which it was evaluated. The two systematic reviews analyzed the same three articles with regard to mortality but concluded differently about overall benefits.

Conclusion

WBCT imaging seems to be associated with reduced times to events in hospital following traumatic injury and seems to be associated with decreased mortality. Whether this is a true effect mediated through an as yet unsubstantiated change in management or the result of hospital- or individual-level confounders is unclear. When evaluating these outcomes, it seems that the authors of both primary studies and systematic reviews have often been selective in their choice of short-term outcomes, painting an incomplete picture of the issue.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^115em5Eq]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

The severely injured patient arriving at the hospital with continuing bleeding or deep haemorrhagic shock generally has a poor chance of survival without early control of bleeding, proper resuscitation and blood transfusion. This is particularly true for patients who present with uncontrolled bleeding due to multiple penetrating injuries or patients with major abdominal injury and unstable pelvic fractures with bleeding from fracture sites and retroperitoneal vessels. The final common pathway in these patients is the exhaustion of physiological reserves with resulting profound acidosis, hypothermia and coagulopathy, also known as the "bloody vicious cycle" or "lethal triad".

In 1983, Stone et al. described the techniques of abbreviated laparotomy, packing to control haemorrhage and of deferred definitive surgical repair until coagulation has been established. Several articles have since described the beneficial results of this approach, now referred to as "damage control". This approach should be considered in patients with major abdominal injury and a need for adjunctive use of angioembolisation, major abdominal injury and a need to evaluate as early possible other injuries, major abdominal injury and traumatic amputation of a limb. Factors that should trigger a damage control approach in the operating theatre are temperature ≤ 34 °C, pH ≤ 7.2, an inaccessible major venous injury, a need for time-consuming procedures in a patient with suboptimal response to resuscitation or inability to achieve haemostasis due to recalcitrant coagulopathy.

Damage control surgery of the abdomen consists of three components: the first component is an abbreviated resuscitative laparotomy for control of bleeding, the restitution of blood flow where necessary and the control of contamination. This should be achieved as rapidly as possible without spending unnecessary time on traditional organ repairs that can be deferred to a later phase. The abdomen is packed and temporary abdominal closure is performed. Packing aims to compress liver ruptures or exert direct pressure on the sources of bleeding and abdominal packing may permit further attempts to achieve total haemostasis through angiography and/or correction of the "lethal triad". The removal of packs should preferably be deferred for at least 48 h to lower the risk of re-bleeding.

The second component of damage control surgery is intensive care treatment, focused on core re-warming, correction of the acid-base imbalance and coagulopathy as well as optimising the ventilation and the haemodynamic status. If complementary angiography and/or further injury investigation is needed, it should be performed during this phase.

### Structured approach with primary and secondary survey for major trauma care: an overview of reviews [^112wUVac]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

This is an overview of reviews conducted following the Cochrane Guidelines to support the major trauma-integrated management guideline panel of the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) in formulating recommendations. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)-ADOLOPMENT methodology and the standards defined by the Sistema Nazionale Linee Guida (SNLG).

We followed the reporting guideline for an overview of reviews of healthcare interventions PRIOR. The protocol of the present overview of reviews is stored at the following link:

Eligibility criteria

According to Cochrane's definition, a systematic review (SR) is a review of the literature in which one "attempts to identify, appraise and synthesize all the empirical evidence that meets pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a specific research question by using explicit, systematic methods that are selected with a view aimed at minimizing bias, to produce more reliable findings to inform decision-making". We included SRs if they met the following criteria: (1) population: children, young people and adults experiencing major trauma; (2) interventions: structured approach (primary and secondary survey) following guidelines such as Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) or European Trauma Course (ETC) or sequence Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure (ABCDE) compared to non-structured approach (e.g. clinical examination without a predefined sequence and diagnostic examinations as needed); moreover routine WBCT screening was compared to non-routine WBCT. Patients in non-routine WBCT may receive after initial evaluation and standards radiological examinations, CT scans of the selected district (e.g. C-spine) or WBCT as needed; (3) setting: in-hospital, emergency department (ED) and emergency room (ER) resuscitation phase. Studies including patients with trauma resulting from burns were excluded.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^112shA5x]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Packing, embolisation and surgery

Recommendation 20

We recommend that patients with ongoing haemodynamic instability, despite adequate pelvic ring stabilisation, receive early surgical bleeding control and/or pre-peritoneal packing and/or angiographic embolisation. (Grade 1B)

We suggest that the use of aortic balloon occlusion be considered only under extreme circumstances in patients with pelvic fracture in order to gain time until appropriate bleeding control measures can be implemented. (Grade 2C)

Rationale

The mortality rate for patients with severe pelvic ring disruptions and haemodynamic instability remains high. There is no consensus as to the optimal treatment paradigm for patients presenting with haemorrhage from severe pelvic fractures. Angioembolisation and an external fixator are the most common approaches. REBOA is considered by some practitioners to be an important adjunct in the treatment of patients with severe pelvic fracture and in shock. However, this method is still in the early stages of development and is not currently used widely across trauma centres. Pelvic ring injuries are associated with a high mortality rate within the first 24 h, due mainly to exsanguinations. Injured patients are managed using a multidisciplinary damage-control strategy. Unstable patients should undergo surgical haemostasis control immediately. Arterial embolisation is an effective means of achieving this and justifies the permanent availability of this approach in level-1 trauma centres. Following CT assessment of injuries, stable patients can undergo arterial embolisation if active arterial bleeding or vascular damage is present. The selective or nonselective embolisation methods and agents used depend on the patient's haemodynamic status and an assessment of the injury whenever possible. The early detection of these injuries and initial efforts to reduce disruption and stabilise the pelvis as well as containing bleeding is therefore crucial.

Severe pelvic trauma is a particularly challenging condition, requiring a multidisciplinary trauma team, including a general surgeon, orthopaedic surgeon, endovascular surgeon/interventional radiologist. The pelvis can harbour a multifocal haemorrhage that is not easily compressible or managed using traditional surgical methods such as tying off a blood vessel or removing an organ. Treatment often requires a triage of multiple investigations that can lead to the re-approximation of bony structures, including DCR, assessment of associated injuries and multimodal haemorrhage control via external fixation, pre-peritoneal packing, angioembolisation and/or REBOA, for example. Markers of pelvic haemorrhage include anterior-posterior and vertical shear deformations on standard roentgenograms, CT "blush" (active arterial extravasation), bladder compression pressure, pelvic haematoma evident using CT and ongoing haemodynamic instability, despite adequate fracture stabilisation.

### Conservative management in traumatic pneumothoraces: an observational study [^117ExqNQ]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic pneumothoraces are a common consequence of major trauma. Despite this, there is a paucity of literature regarding their optimal management, including the role of conservative treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the treatment, complications, and outcomes of traumatic pneumothoraces in patients presenting to a major trauma center.

Methods

The prospectively collected Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) database was used to identify all patients presenting with traumatic pneumothoraces to a UK major trauma center from April 2012 to December 2016. Demographics, mechanism of injury, injury severity score (ISS), management, and outcomes were analyzed.

Results

Six hundred two patients were included during the study period. Mean age was 48 years (SD, 22 years), and 73% were men. Mean ISS was 26 and inpatient mortality was 9%. Of the 602 traumatic pneumothoraces, 277 of 602 (46%) were initially treated conservatively. Two hundred fifty-two of 277 patients in this cohort (90%) did not require subsequent chest tube insertion, including the majority of patients (56 of 62 [90%]) who were receiving positive pressure ventilation (PPV) on admission. The hazard ratio (HR) for failure of conservative management showed no difference between the ventilated and nonventilated patients (HR, 1.1; P = 0.84). Only the presence of a large hemothorax was associated with an increased likelihood of failure of conservative management.

Conclusions

In the largest observational study of traumatic pneumothoraces published to date, > 90% of patients whose pneumothorax was managed conservatively never required subsequent tube drainage. Importantly, this also applies to patients requiring PPV, with no significant increased risk of failure of expectant management. These data support a role for conservative management in traumatic pneumothoraces.

### General overview of the facial trauma evaluation [^117UUKo8]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The initial evaluation of maxillofacial trauma in athletes should first focus on the management of life-threatening injuries that require emergent care. Airway, breathing, and circulation are the 3 areas to be addressed first and foremost, as set forth by Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines. Following the stabilization of the patient, a thorough physical examination and systematic review of any relevant imaging studies are imperative to ensure that injuries are not missed. Ultimately, management by the facial plastic surgeon should balance the goals of facial trauma restoration with the overall needs of the patient.

### Timing of major fracture care in polytrauma patients-an update on principles, parameters and strategies for 2020 [^1143dxtT]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Sustained changes in resuscitation and transfusion management have been observed since the turn of the millennium, along with an ongoing discussion of surgical management strategies. The aims of this study are threefold: a) to evaluate the objective changes in resuscitation and mass transfusion protocols undertaken in major level I trauma centers; b) to summarize the improvements in diagnostic options for early risk profiling in multiply injured patients and c) to assess the improvements in surgical treatment for acute major fractures in the multiply injured patient.

Methods

I. A systematic review of the literature (comprehensive search of the MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases) and a concomitant data base (from a single Level I center) analysis were performed. Two authors independently extracted data using a pre-designed form. A pooled analysis was performed to determine the changes in the management of polytraumatized patients after the change of the millennium. II. A data base from a level I trauma center was utilized to test any effects of treatment changes on outcome.

Inclusion Criteria

adult patients, ISS > 16, admission < less than 24h post trauma. Exclusion: Oncological diseases, genetic disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system. Parameters evaluated were mortality, ICU stay, ICU complications (Sepsis, Pneumonia, Multiple organ failure).

Results

I. From the electronic databases, 5141 articles were deemed to be relevant. 169 articles met the inclusion criteria and a manual review of reference lists of key articles identified an additional 22 articles. II. Out of 3668 patients, 2694 (73.4%) were male, the mean ISS was 28.2 (SD 15.1), mean NISS was 37.2 points (SD 17.4 points) and the average length of stay was 17.0 days (SD 18.7 days) with a mean length of ICU stay of 8.2 days (SD 10.5 days), and a mean ventilation time of 5.1 days (SD 8.1 days). Both surgical management and nonsurgical strategies have changed over time. Damage control resuscitation, dynamic analyses of coagulopathy and lactate clearance proved to sharpen the view of the worsening trauma patient and facilitated the prevention of further complications. The subsequent surgical care has become safer and more balanced, avoiding overzealous initial surgeries, while performing early fixation, when patients are physiologically stable or rapidly improving. Severe chest trauma and soft tissue injuries require further evaluation.

Conclusions

Multiple changes in management (resuscitation, transfusion protocols and balanced surgical care) have taken place. Moreover, improvement in mortality rates and complications associated with several factors were also observed. These findings support the view that the management of polytrauma patients has been substantially improved over the past 3 decades.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^113FL1uH]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

The severely injured patient arriving to the hospital with continuous bleeding or deep haemorrhagic shock generally has a poor chance of survival unless early control of bleeding, proper resuscitation and blood transfusion are achieved. This is particularly true for patients who present with uncontrolled bleeding due to multiple penetrating injuries or patients with multiple injuries and unstable pelvic fractures with ongoing bleeding from fracture sites and retroperitoneal vessels. The common denominator in these patients is the exhaustion of physiological reserves with resulting profound acidosis, hypothermia and coagulopathy, also known as the 'bloody vicious cycle'. In 1983, Stone and colleagues described the techniques of abbreviated laparotomy, packing to control haemorrhage and of deferred definitive surgical repair until coagulation has been established. Since then, a number of authors have described the beneficial results of this concept, now called 'damage control'. Damage control surgery of the abdomen consists of three components: the first component is an abbreviated resuscitative laparotomy for control of bleeding, the restitution of blood flow where necessary and the control of contamination. This should be achieved as rapidly as possible without spending unnecessary time on traditional organ repairs that can be deferred to a later phase. The abdomen is packed and temporary abdominal closure is performed. The second component is intensive care treatment, focused on core re-warming, correction of the acid-base imbalance and coagulopathy as well as optimising the ventilation and the haemodynamic status. The third component is the definitive surgical repair that is performed only when target parameters have been achieved. Although the concept of 'damage control' intuitively makes sense, no RCTs exist to support it. Retrospective studies support the concept showing reduced morbidity and mortality rates in selective populations.

The same 'damage control' principles have been applied to orthopaedic injuries in severely injured patients. Scalea was the first to coin the term 'damage control orthopaedics'. Relevant fractures are primarily stabilised with external fixators rather than primary definitive osteosynthesis. The less traumatic and shorter duration of the surgical procedure aims to reduce the secondary trauma load. Definitive osteosynthesis surgery can be performed after 4 to 14 days when the patient has recovered sufficiently. Retrospective clinical studies and prospective cohort studies seem to support the concept of damage control. The only available randomised study shows an advantage for this strategy in 'borderline' patients.

### Urologic trauma guidelines: a 21st century update [^116iMs1N]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Trauma is the leading cause of death between the ages of 1 and 44 years in the USA. While stabilization of life-threatening injuries is the primary goal in the evaluation of all trauma patients, subsequent diagnosis and treatment of secondary injuries are requirements for good trauma care. The genitourinary system is involved in 10% of trauma cases, and these injuries can be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, physicians involved in the initial evaluation and subsequent management of trauma patients should be aware of the diagnosis and treatment of injuries that can occur in the genitourinary system. In 2009, the European Association of Urology provided specific recommendations for the evaluation, diagnosis and management of genitourinary trauma. Here, we review and discuss these recommendations in order to provide a concise summary for clinicians involved in the evaluation and management of trauma patients and their associated genitourinary injuries.

### The acute management of trauma hemorrhage: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^116yUmaU]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trauma is one of the world's leading causes of death and disability. Around 40% of deaths are due to bleeding or its consequences, establishing hemorrhage as the most common cause of preventable death in this clinical group. The relationship between trauma hemorrhage and poor outcomes has been well recognized for over 30 years, and applies globally, in both civilian and military settings. However, outcomes from severe hemorrhage remain poor, with mortality rates approaching 50% for patients who require massive blood transfusion or who develop a significant coagulopathy. Management of trauma hemorrhage depends on a multifactorial approach of timely surgical intervention, fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion therapy.

Advances have taken place in our understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma induced coagulopathy, in the availability of rapid diagnostic modalities, and the introduction of hemostatic resuscitation strategies. Conversely, evidence reviews have shown that some accepted therapies such as blood or plasma transfusion may be ineffective or associated with worse outcomes.

Existing reviews have focused on individual interventions, such as transfusion ratios, blood substitutes, or pharmaceutical agents. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the wider trial literature for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to the early management of trauma patients with bleeding. We specifically aimed to appraise the methodology of the trials and to assess a broad range of outcomes focusing on bleeding and transfusion requirements, correction of coagulopathy and mortality.

Translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels — Level A recommendations are generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of scientific certainty (eg, based on evidence from one or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies that demonstrate consistent effects or estimates). Level B recommendations are recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate scientific certainty (eg, based on evidence from one or more Class of Evidence II studies or multiple Class of Evidence III studies that demonstrate consistent effects or estimates). Level C recommendations are recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of adequate published literature, based on expert consensus, and when consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation. Recommendations stemming from a body of evidence may be downgraded due to consistency of results, the uncertainty of effect magnitude, and publication bias, and clinically oriented statistics (eg, likelihood ratios, number needed to treat) are presented to help apply results to individual patients and to patients with extremes of risk.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^113xLBV6]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Training in trauma care should emphasise the key role of coagulation in determining outcome. Increasing clinician knowledge and understanding in this area should be an integral part of the implementation of the algorithm. All trauma care centres should evaluate their own performance using a routine institutional quality management programme. An audit of adherence to best practice, including feedback and practice change where needed, should be included as part of the local implementation of these guidelines. To evaluate the quality of care provided to the patient who is bleeding after major trauma, we suggest that adherence to the following quality standards be assessed (Table 4).

### The acute management of trauma hemorrhage: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113CRJA8]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The acute management of trauma hemorrhage has been evaluated in a large number of trials but these have not in the main produced results that have changed management or improved outcomes. This systematic review set out to examine RCTs, as the most robust form of study design and in so doing observational data have not been identified and appraised. However, it demonstrates that the difficulties associated with recruitment, design and conduct of trauma trials can be overcome to produce better quality RCTs. As our understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma hemorrhage grows, a coordinated strategy is required for this globally important condition.

### Factors influencing lengths of stay in the intensive care unit for surviving trauma patients: a retrospective analysis of 30, 157 cases [^111oWXeg]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic injuries account for approximately 10% of mortality worldwide and the in-hospital mortality rate of trauma patients in Europe ranges between 15% and 17%. Interventions, such as airway management, blood transfusions and primary surgical care, may be life saving for a trauma patient and can reduce mortality in this patient population. Taking this into account, much focus has been placed on the initial management of the trauma patient. However, even after the initial care in the resuscitation bay or operating theater, patients with severe trauma have a great need for close monitoring and treatment as they are severely injured due to the trauma. Afterwards, those patients are at risk of secondary disorders because of the ongoing pathophysiological reactions that occur after trauma. These necessitate care in the intensive care unit (ICU) to continue resuscitation and manage early post-resuscitation complications. The length of time that intensive care treatment is necessary for those patients who survive multiple trauma might depend on several factors. Conceivable influencing factors are the patient's pre-trauma status, such as past medical history, present illnesses, age and gender, and the trauma itself, circumstances of the accident, injury severity, pattern of injuries and so on. For example, pre-injury polypharmacy was recently shown to be a predictor of trauma outcome and was related to an extended ICU length of stay (LOS). However, pre-trauma status, as well as trauma itself, cannot be influenced by the medical staff's efforts.

Furthermore, treatment regimens, conservative as well as surgical, transfusion strategies and so on might be factors that influence LOS. At the very least, trauma, as well as intensive care treatment, can influence the occurrence of secondary effects, such as sepsis or multi-organ failure, leading to an increased duration of ICU stay. Moreover, patients with major trauma are at highest risk for venous thromboembolism resulting in an increased LOS. The latter, treatment regimens and secondary effects, can be influenced by the ICU staff.

Mean LOS in the ICU after severe trauma was found to be approximately 8 days in Germany (survivors and non-survivors included). Clinicians may feel that there are several factors that can prolong ICU LOS in multiple-trauma patients. However, the extent to which the respective factors influence ICU LOS in patients who survive multiple trauma has rarely been studied and the impact on clinical practice has yet to be determined. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide detailed data, defined by a specified number of days, on factors that prolong or reduce ICU LOS in a large cohort of surviving trauma patients.

### Initial radiographic evaluation of the spine after trauma: when, what, where, and how to image the acutely traumatized spine [^114yRHzc]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Radiographic evaluation of the spine after an acute traumatic event is an integral part of the initial assessment of the patient. Despite this, an imaging protocol that includes detailed recommendations of the views, modalities, and techniques of radiographic work-up is lacking in the peer-reviewed literature.

Study Purpose

The goal of the current review was to suggest a uniform protocol for initial imaging in the traumatized patient and provide a rationale and guidelines to assist in deciding which studies are indicated and at what time they are best obtained.

Methods

The authors' reviewed the available modern, published, English literature, including both peer-reviewed articles and commonly used textbooks, for recommendations concerning which imaging studies are most effective and cost-efficient in detecting spinal injuries in the acute trauma setting. A list of radiologic studies was compiled. A panel of spine surgeon members of the Spine Trauma Study Group, all of whom were highly experienced in trauma management, evaluated the utility and necessity of these imaging studies.

Conclusions

Surgeons agreed that the mainstay of initial radiographic evaluation of the spine after acute trauma remains plain radiographs. CT scanning remains the best mode of delineating the bony details of a spinal injury and should be used to characterize all bony injuries identified on plain radiographs. As CT technology continues to improve, it is likely to play an even greater role as an initial screening tool. The role for MRI continues to expand, particularly in detecting the soft tissue components of injuries.

### Prehospital tranexamic acid: what is the current evidence? [^114u9aKe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Pre-hospital TXA guidance

TXA was added to the military Joint Trauma System Damage Control Resuscitation Clinical Practice Guideline (approved 10/2011) which currently recommends "The early use of TXA (ie, as soon as possible after injury but ideally not later than 3 hours postinjury) should be strongly considered for any patient requiring blood products in the treatment of combat-related hemorrhage and is most strongly advocated in patients judged likely to require massive transfusion (eg, significant injury and risk factors for massive transfusion)".

The European guidelines for management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma (box 1) recommend early TXA administration in bleeding trauma patients, and "suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of TXA en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)". A review of TXA as part of damage control resuscitation in the prehospital setting concluded that "High-level evidence supports its use in trauma and strongly suggests that its implementation in the prehospital setting offers a survival advantage to many patients, particularly when evacuation to surgical care may be delayed".

Box 1
Prehospital TXA recommendations from European guidelines (from Rossaint et al)

Antifibrinolytic agents (Recommendation 25)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered as early as possible to the trauma patient who is bleeding or at risk of significant hemorrhage at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 min, followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 g over 8 hours. (Grade 1A)

We recommend that tranexamic acid be administered to the bleeding trauma patient within 3 hours after injury. (Grade 1B)

We suggest that protocols for the management of bleeding patients consider administration of the first dose of tranexamic acid en route to the hospital. (Grade 2C)

International Trauma Life Support (ITLS) recommends the following: "ITLS believes that there is sufficient evidence to support the use of TXA in the management of traumatic hemorrhage, pursuant to system medical control approval. Following initial resuscitation including control of external bleeding and stabilization of airway, consideration should be given to administration of TXA during early stages of transport. TXA should be considered in those patients who show signs of hemorrhagic shock, including tachycardia (> 110 bpm) and hypotension (SBP < 100) and are less than 3 hours from injury".

### Compliance to advanced trauma life support protocols in adult trauma patients in the acute setting [^111AysW3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trauma is the most common cause of death in Canada for the age group of 44 years or less. In 2004, intentional and unintentional injuries led to 13,677 deaths, and 211,000 hospitalizations. The economic burden from injuries is estimated at $10.7 billion in health care costs, and $19.8 billion in total economic costs.

Trauma resuscitations often involve complex decision-making and management of critical injuries in a short span of time. Errors are common; an Australian study on trauma management found 6.09 errors per fatal case in the emergency department (ED) with 3.47 errors contributing to patient death. Since 1977, the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) treatment paradigm was established to improve the management of trauma patients during the initial resuscitation phase. ATLS protocols provide a common framework and organized approach during these situations, and have been shown to improve outcomes. Unfortunately, attrition rate of ATLS knowledge and low compliance rate are issues even in major trauma centers. Deviations from ATLS protocols are common, ranging from 23% to 53%. Compliance rate can affect patient outcome, and can serve as a surrogate marker for quality assessment of a trauma system.

Adherence to ATLS protocols is only investigated by a few studies; specifically, whether the presence or absence of a Trauma Team Leader (TTL) affects adherence. The primary objective of this study was to determine the compliance rate with ATLS protocols in the ED in a Canadian Level I trauma centre, as well as to assess the impact on ATLS compliance with TTL involvement. Secondary objectives included assessing patient outcomes and times to diagnostic imaging.

### Penetrating gluteal injuries in north west london: a retrospective cohort study and initial management guideline [^111BhocR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

St Mary's Major Trauma Centre is the tertiary trauma referral hospital for the North West London Major Trauma Network and receives approximately 3000 trauma patients per year. All patients presenting to St Mary's Major Trauma Centre with penetrating injury to the gluteal region during a 3-year period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019 were identified from the local electronic trauma database. The electronic health records of these patients were then reviewed in detail to collect data on patient demographics, anatomic distribution of the wound, associated rectal, vascular, or nerve injury, initial investigations, and surgical or radiological interventions. Patients presenting with wounds secondary to gunshot wound (GSW) were excluded as this is a very different pattern of injury and has been well studied elsewhere. The anatomic limits of the gluteal region were defined as the gluteal fold inferiorly, the posterior superior iliac spine superiorly, and the greater trochanter laterally. All injuries included in this data set were posterior to the trochanters, and due to the gluteal injury rather than any other associated injury in the case of a patient with multiple injuries. This was due to the recognized increase in this injury pattern locally. Vascular injury was defined as either presence of active bleeding or injury to a vessel seen on CT imaging. Data was collected and analyzed using Microsoft Excel V.16.16 (Microsoft, Seattle, USA), and further statistical analysis was performed using R V.4.0.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). The study is reported in concordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Categorical data is presented as a percentage followed by number and was analyzed for statistical significance using Fisher's exact test. Continuous data is presented as a median followed by IQR. The denominator for all percentages was the total injuries unless explicitly stated. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

CT scan type was recorded as being either a 'combi' scan (single-phase CT) or a dual-phase/triple-phase CT. Combi scans use a biphasic intravenous contrast protocol with a single acquisition, whereas a dual-phase or triple-phase CT scan uses intravenous contrast with either two or three acquisitions, respectively.

Conduct a thorough tertiary survey (8)

An essential part of modern ICU management of major trauma is to seek occult injuries missed in the abbreviated assessment performed prior to the life-saving interventions immediately prior to ICU admission. Numerous institutional checklists are available (e.g.) to facilitate thorough assessment, usually accompanied by CT or MRI. A systematic review found nine studies that reported rates of missed injuries later identified in tertiary survey, with a hospital-weighted rate of 4.3% but with rates at individual hospitals ranging from 1.26% to 65%. The average reported rate in included studies was 15.7%. Training interventions reported in three studies showed significant improvements (from 3% identified to 7% identified).

Outcome measures

Primary outcomes selected for the analyses were: overall mortality, mortality at 24 h, intensive care unit (ICU) admission/ICU length of stay (LOS), complications (e.g. multiple organ failure [MOF], multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [MODS], missed injuries), adherence and disability. Secondary outcomes were: hospital admission/ hospital LOS, time spent in Emergency Department (ED), time spent in Emergency Room (ER) and radiation dose. Outcomes were prioritized by the panel of the Italian National Institute of Health within the major trauma-integrated management guideline, Additional file 1: Appendix A. In addition, as an important domain of the GRADE approach, costs were included.

Search strategy

We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (Elsevier, EMBASE.com) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to 3 May 2022 with language restricted to English, Italian, Spanish, French and German. We checked the reference lists of all studies included. The search strategy is outlined in Additional file 1: Appendix B.

Study selection and data extraction

Two independent authors screened titles and abstracts according to the eligibility criteria. Following the first phase, they independently assessed the full text of potentially relevant studies for inclusion. Any disagreement was solved by a discussion with one of the authors. A standardized data collection form was used to extract the following information: (i) SR characteristics, (ii) Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome (PICO) questions, and (iii) outcome data. The authors of the selected studies were contacted if the study data were not reported in detail or were incomplete.
