## Question

evidence for mechanical CPR in OOHCA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for mechanical CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, including what high-quality trials show, how meta-analyses align, what guidelines recommend, and where mechanical CPR might still be reasonable despite routine use not improving outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized trials and their primary outcomes. Then, I should verify how meta-analyses pool those data and whether heterogeneity changes interpretation. Next, I will review guideline positions and cost-effectiveness. After that, I need to check real-world utilization trends and potential harms. Finally, I will consider legitimate niche scenarios where mechanical CPR may be appropriate and outline practical implementation cautions if used at all.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal randomized trials. The PARAMEDIC cluster RCT in the UK with 4,471 patients found no improvement in 30-day survival with LUCAS-2 compared with manual CPR, with adjusted odds ratio 0.86 and overlapping confidence intervals, indicating no statistically significant benefit, and the authors concluded that widespread adoption for routine use was not supported by their data [^112n4m9e]. The LINC multicenter RCT of 2,589 patients likewise showed no difference in 4-hour survival and no clinically meaningful differences in survival or neurologic outcomes through 6 months when mechanical CPR with simultaneous defibrillation was compared with guideline-concordant manual CPR, reinforcing the absence of benefit signal in routine prehospital deployment [^114EoN43]. The CIRC trial, designed for equivalence, terminated early and fell within a pre-specified equivalence margin but numerically favored manual CPR for survival to discharge, again failing to demonstrate superiority of mechanical CPR and raising concern for potential harm in some contexts [^113yQRBW].

> Wait, let me verify how meta-analyses synthesize these findings. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses converge on the same conclusion: routine mechanical CPR does not improve survival or neurologic outcomes compared with manual CPR in OHCA. The Cochrane review concluded that mechanical CPR is not superior to manual CPR and highlighted potential harm in some analyses, advising that devices be reserved for situations where high-quality manual compressions are not feasible [^116EJXWe]. An Annals meta-analysis pooling randomized trials found no benefit for survival to admission, discharge, or favorable neurologic outcome, while observational data suggested a spurious benefit likely due to confounding, which should not override RCT evidence [^112NxJ23]. Contemporary meta-analyses similarly show no significant differences in ROSC, survival to admission, survival to discharge, or good neurologic function, with pooled estimates crossing the null and substantial heterogeneity limiting firm conclusions [^1177uVzr] [^117AgSKv] [^114uLaCw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without aligning with guidelines. I should confirm what major societies say. The European Resuscitation Council and ILCOR-aligned guidance emphasize that current evidence does not support routine use of mechanical CPR for OHCA and recommend focusing resources on high-quality manual CPR, early defibrillation, and post-arrest care rather than routine device deployment [^115sCNVm]. The American Heart Association has long cautioned that trials have failed to show consistent benefit and that device application can reduce chest compression fraction early in resuscitation, reinforcing a selective-use approach rather than routine adoption [^111QZ7Lk].

> I need to check economic and implementation data to ensure we are not missing a systems-level signal. A cost-effectiveness analysis using PARAMEDIC data found that LUCAS-2 was not cost-effective, with worse quality-adjusted outcomes and higher costs than manual CPR, arguing against routine deployment from a value perspective [^115YcUax]. Real-world utilization in the U.S. increased more than fourfold from 2010 to 2016 despite the absence of outcome benefit, underscoring a disconnect between evidence and practice and raising concerns about resource allocation without proven returns [^111jnaPd] [^111zd6Zf].

> But wait, what if mechanical CPR is harmful in some settings? I should double-check for potential downsides. Device deployment requires pauses in chest compressions, and even brief interruptions can be detrimental, particularly early in shockable rhythms when rapid defibrillation is critical; in PARAMEDIC, a subgroup with initial shockable rhythm had worse 30-day survival with mechanical CPR, plausibly related to defibrillation delays during device placement, although the delay was not directly measured in that analysis [^116Hj8eD]. Observational data from Japan suggested worse outcomes when mechanical CPR was used in the emergency department, likely reflecting selection bias toward sicker patients, but it still cautions against assuming benefit where confounding is strong [^115Btbsn]. Mechanical CPR has also been associated with increased rates of rib or sternal fractures and internal organ injuries in some series, reinforcing the need for meticulous training and quality assurance if devices are used [^112QcUws].

> Let me consider legitimate niche scenarios where mechanical CPR might still be reasonable despite the lack of routine benefit. In prolonged resuscitations with limited personnel, during ambulance or helicopter transport where effective manual compressions are unsafe or unreliable, in the cardiac catheterization lab during PCI, as a bridge to extracorporeal CPR in refractory arrest, or in special circumstances like hypothermic arrest, mechanical CPR can be a rational alternative when systems are trained to minimize deployment pauses and monitor quality closely [^116EJXWe] [^113z3fwW] [^115UwiXq]. I should confirm that expert reviews and implementation guidance consistently frame mechanical CPR as an adjunct for these constrained environments rather than a replacement for manual CPR in routine care [^111QZ7Lk].

> Next, I should review implementation cautions if a system elects to use devices. Training to achieve rapid deployment with minimal interruption is essential. Pit-crew approaches and video review can reduce pause times and improve adherence to high-quality CPR processes, which may mitigate some of the harm signals seen in routine-use trials [^111QZ7Lk] [^114nLCLp]. I need to ensure that teams track chest compression fraction, time to first shock, and device-related complications, and that protocols specify when to deploy the device to avoid early delays in shockable rhythms, aligning with the timing concerns raised by PARAMEDIC subgroup findings [^116Hj8eD].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was a large, definitive RCT proving harm from routine mechanical CPR, but I should verify that nuance. The clearest harm signal in an RCT comes from an older trial using a load-distributing band device that showed reduced survival with good neurologic outcome compared with manual CPR, yet this single study and its context limit generalizability, and subsequent larger pragmatic trials have more often shown equivalence rather than consistent harm, so the balance of high-quality evidence is best summarized as no benefit rather than proven routine harm across all devices and settings [^114m2FWu] [^112n4m9e] [^114EoN43].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. High-quality randomized trials and convergent meta-analyses demonstrate that routine use of mechanical CPR in OHCA does not improve survival or neurologic outcomes compared with manual CPR, and may be inferior in some contexts due to deployment delays and confounding. Therefore, routine deployment is not supported by current evidence or guidelines, while selective use in specific logistical constraints remains reasonable with rigorous training and quality monitoring [^112n4m9e] [^114EoN43] [^116EJXWe] [^111QZ7Lk].

Mechanical CPR is **not superior to manual CPR** for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) [^116EJXWe] [^112NxJ23]. Large RCTs (PARAMEDIC, LINC, CIRC) show **no improvement in survival or neurologic outcomes** with mechanical CPR compared to manual CPR [^112n4m9e] [^114EoN43] [^113yQRBW]. Meta-analyses confirm **no significant benefit** and suggest possible harm in some settings [^1177uVzr] [^112NxJ23]. Mechanical CPR may be considered only when high-quality manual CPR is not feasible (e.g. during transport, prolonged resuscitation, or as a bridge to ECPR) [^116EJXWe] [^113z3fwW]. Routine use is not recommended due to lack of benefit, potential harm, and high cost [^111jnaPd] [^115YcUax].

## Summary of evidence

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

- **PARAMEDIC trial**: 4,471 patients; no difference in 30-day survival (6% mechanical vs 7% manual; adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.15) [^112n4m9e].
- **LINC trial**: 2,589 patients; no difference in 4-hour survival (23.6% vs 23.7%; risk difference −0.05%, 95% CI −3.3% to 3.2%) or neurologic outcomes [^114EoN43].
- **CIRC trial**: 4,231 patients; no difference in survival to discharge (9.4% vs 11.0%; adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.83–1.37) [^113yQRBW].

---

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews show **no significant benefit** of mechanical CPR over manual CPR in survival, neurologic outcomes, or ROSC [^116EJXWe] [^112NxJ23] [^1177uVzr]. Some analyses suggest possible harm, particularly with delayed deployment or in specific subgroups [^116Hj8eD] [^116EJXWe].

---

## Clinical outcomes

| **Outcome** | **Mechanical CPR** | **Manual CPR** | **Significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Survival to discharge | 9.4–11.0% | 11.0–12.0% | No significant difference [^113yQRBW] [^112NxJ23] |
| Favorable neurologic outcome | 7.5–8.5% | 7.3–8.3% | No significant difference [^114EoN43] [^112NxJ23] |
| ROSC | No consistent difference | No consistent difference | No significant difference [^117AgSKv] |

---

## Limitations and potential harms

- **Deployment delays**: Mechanical CPR can cause interruptions, reducing chest compression fraction and potentially worsening outcomes [^111QZ7Lk] [^116EJXWe].
- **Device-related injuries**: Rib fractures, sternal fractures, and visceral injuries have been reported [^112QcUws].
- **Cost**: Devices are expensive (~$10,000–$15,000) and require training and maintenance [^111jnaPd] [^116doThq].

---

## Situations where mechanical CPR may be beneficial

Mechanical CPR may be considered when high-quality manual CPR is not feasible, such as during **transport** — where uninterrupted compressions are needed in ambulances or helicopters [^116EJXWe] — or during **prolonged resuscitation**, when rescuer fatigue limits manual CPR quality [^113z3fwW]. It is also used as a **bridge to ECPR**, maintaining perfusion until extracorporeal support is established [^116EJXWe] [^11369Hg3].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend routine use** of mechanical CPR for OHCA [^111cTJN9]. It may be considered in specific circumstances where high-quality manual CPR is not feasible, with attention to minimizing interruptions and ensuring proper training [^116EJXWe] [^111QZ7Lk].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research is evaluating **patient selection**, timing, and device improvements to clarify when mechanical CPR might benefit specific subgroups. Implementation studies are examining training, deployment strategies, and quality assurance to reduce harm and improve outcomes [^116Hj8eD] [^1149JyZ7].

---

Mechanical CPR **does not improve survival or neurologic outcomes** compared to manual CPR in OHCA and may cause harm if deployment is delayed. It should be used selectively when manual CPR is not feasible, with careful attention to minimizing interruptions and ensuring proper training.

Background

Airway and ventilation interventions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and in those with a return of a spontaneous circulation (ROSC) follow a stepwise approach as the precise interventions are thought to depend on patient factors, rescuer skills and the stage of the resuscitation. Current guidelines for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are based primarily on evidence from observational studies and expert consensus, and the optimal interventions remain uncertain. In addition, our knowledge of airway management during IHCA is mainly extrapolated from OHCA studies.

Timing of deployment

In systems where mechanical devices are available, a key challenge for the clinician is the decision as to the time point during the cardiac arrest at which to deploy the mechanical chest compression device. In a meta-regression of out-of-hospital data, Bonnes et al. identified an association between improved outcome and earlier device deployment.

A sub-group analysis in the PARAMEDIC trial identified decreased 30-day survival in patients treated with a mechanical device that presented in a shockable rhythm (odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.52, 0.98). One plausible explanation for this is that the study protocol required deployment of the mechanical device prior to defibrillation, leading to delays in defibrillation in the mechanical CPR arm, although this delay was not measured in the trial. In contrast, the LINC study, which adopted a modified mechanical CPR treatment algorithm, found no difference in outcome between treatment groups in patients presenting in a shockable rhythm (e.g. hospital discharge treatment difference 0.6%, 95% CI − 5.6, 6.9), despite an increased median time to first shock in the mechanical CPR arm (mechanical 4 min (IQR 2,5) vs manual 3 min (IQR 2, 4), P < 0.001).

Delivery of high-quality manual chest compressions for a prolonged period of time is physically exhausting. In the context of a prolonged cardiac arrest with limited personnel available, use of a mechanical chest compression device may be a reasonable strategy to avoid the potential harm associated with suboptimal chest compression delivery.

Based on these data, it would seem reasonable to deploy devices early in circumstances where high-quality manual chest compressions cannot be safely delivered. In patients where high-quality CPR is deliverable, delayed deployment would seem prudent in patients in a shockable rhythm.

Aim

To assess the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), compared with manual or mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in adults and children.

Methods

The PRISMA guidelines were followed. We searched Medline, Embase, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews for randomized clinical trials and observational studies published before May 22, 2018. The population included adult and pediatric patients with OHCA and IHCA of any origin. Two investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. Outcomes included short-term and long-term survival and favorable neurological outcome.

Results

We included 25 observational studies, of which 15 studies were in adult OHCA, 7 studies were in adult IHCA, and 3 studies were in pediatric IHCA. There were no studies in pediatric OHCA. No randomized trials were included. Results from individual studies were largely inconsistent, although several studies in adult and pediatric IHCA were in favor of ECPR. The risk of bias for individual studies was overall assessed to be critical, with confounding being the primary source of bias. The overall quality of evidence was assessed to be very low. Heterogeneity across studies precluded any meaningful meta-analyses.

Conclusions

There is inconclusive evidence to either support or refute the use of ECPR for OHCA and IHCA in adults and children. The quality of evidence across studies is very low.

While our analysis supports the finding that mechanical CPR does not improve ROSC rates in OHCA settings, as highlighted in the meta-analysis by El-Menyar et al. the variable results for IHCA indicate a need for further investigation. In particular, the discrepancies between RCTs and non-RCTs in IHCA settings imply underlying differences that could influence CPR outcomes. These differences may include variations in patient characteristics, response times, and hospital settings. Additionally, limitations in study design, such as selection biases commonly seen in observational studies, could also be contributing factors. Further large-scale RCTs are required to determine the effectiveness of mechanical versus manual CPR in improving patient outcomes during cardiac arrest.

Routine deployment in OHCA

The routine deployment of mechanical devices has been robustly tested in the pre-hospital setting in large high-quality randomised controlled trials. In 2014–2015, the CIRC (Circulation Improving Resuscitation Care), LINC (LUCAS in Cardiac Arrest), and PARAMEDIC (Prehospital Randomised Assessment of a Mechanical Chest Compression Device in Cardiac Arrest) trials were published. These studies, alongside two earlier small randomised studies, are summarised in Table 1.

EMS Emerency Medical Service, OHCA out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, RCT randomised controlled trial, STD survival to discharge, adj OR adjusted odds ratio

The CIRC trial was an industry sponsored trial, designed to determine equivalence, superiority, or inferiority in survival to hospital discharge for OHCA patients who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either manual CPR or Autopulse CPR. The study was terminated early, in accordance with pre-defined stopping rules, after 4753 randomised patients were enrolled. Of those randomised, 4231 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Overall, manual CPR showed a numeric increase in survival to hospital discharge compared to Autopulse CPR (11.0 versus 9.4%). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83, 1.37) after adjustment for covariates and interim analyses. This fell within the pre-defined equivalence region (OR 0.69–1.44), although the width of the equivalence margin incorporates the potential for both significant harm and benefit. Overall hospital survival rate was higher than that reported in similar studies (PARAMEDIC 30 day survival 6.6%; LINC hospital survival 8.0%). This may reflect the stringent study inclusion criteria and intensive training and oversight by the study team which emphasised the importance of high-quality CPR.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included the IHCA and OHCA studies and SRs that used randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. This approach allowed for a wide range of evidence, methodology, and perspectives in the literature. Trentino et al. concluded that it is essential not only to consider the study method but also the critical elements of the study design. We considered studies on different mechanical CPR devices (LBD and PD) and different outcome measures. Even though the inclusion of these distinct populations, study designs, devices, and outcome measures create heterogeneity, it is necessary for a comprehensive analysis of the topic and its overall effectiveness. Exclusion criteria are given in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
PRISMA flow chart for a systematic review of systematic reviews (up to February 2024)

We aimed to include every SR published from January 15, 2014, to February 15, 2024, comparing mechanical to manual CPR. We excluded records that were not SRs (e.g. narrative reviews, case reports), did not compare mechanical with manual CPR, or included pediatric patients. Thereafter, we performed an up-to-date SR of the studies published after the last published SR.

PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome)

The population of interest was cardiac arrest patients, both IHCA and OHCA. The intervention groups consisted of patients who received mechanical or manual CPR. The outcomes of interest included one or more of the following: ROSC, survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, 30-day survival, and survival to hospital discharge with good neurological function.

The objectives of our work included (1) identifying and summarizing existing SRs (UR) to focus on the essential findings and methodologies, (2) identifying the consensus, discrepancies, and the effectiveness of mechanical versus manual CPR, (3) performing a new SR of the studies that were not included in the latest published SR, (4) performing subgroup analyses including age, gender, initial rhythm, type of device, and location of CA (IHCA and OHCA). These sub-analyses will include only studies that explicitly mention the number of patients, events, outcomes, and type of CPR device.

### In-hospital cardiac arrest [^112wx77B]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To review the current management of in-hospital cardiac arrest and to identify variables that influence outcomes, OLDMEDLINE from 1950 to 1966 and MEDLINE from 1966 to March 2005 were searched using the keywords cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardiac arrest, in hospital, and adult. Secondary sources were derived from review publications and personal communications by one of the authors. There is no secure evidence that the ultimate outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in settings of in-hospital cardiac arrest have improved in the > 40 yrs that followed the landmark report by Kouwenhoven, Jude, and Knickerbocker, which launched the modern era of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A paucity of objective measurements preclude secure protocols for sequencing of interventions and, even more, when to initiate and discontinue cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The preparedness of both physicians and nursing professionals to implement the published guidelines has itself been questioned. Whereas early access defibrillation with automated external defibrillators may be of benefit in out-of-hospital settings, there has as yet been no secure evidence that automated external defibrillators have had a favorable impact on in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation when used on infrequent occasions by first responders. This contrasts with the much greater success of advanced life support providers and especially when electrical defibrillation is promptly performed by expertly trained personnel after onset of cardiac arrest. Outcomes are therefore improved in critical care settings and especially in coronary care units in which patients are continuously monitored.

### Mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation during in-hospital cardiac arrest [^117Bwj1W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Optimizing the quality of CPR remains a crucial factor to improve survival rates from IHCA. Although an this is an attractive solution, studies have not demonstrated the superiority of mechanical CPR compared with conventional CPR during IHCA. Although use of these devices may have a place in specific resuscitation scenarios, the current evidence does not support a strategy for routine use of mechanical CPR devices for in‐hospital resuscitation. More research is needed to establish how the balance of risks and benefits of mechanical CPR use differs in IHCA when compared with OHCA.

### International consensus on evidence gaps and research opportunities in extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop [^1155wvEH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The increased accessibility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following the COVID‐19 pandemic and the publication of the first randomized trial of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) prompted the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to sponsor a workshop on ECPR. Two more randomized trials have since been published in 2022 and 2023. Based on the combined findings and review of the evidence, an international panel of authors identified gaps in science, inequities in care and diversity in outcomes, and suggested research opportunities and next steps. The science pertaining to ECPR would benefit from the United States contributing uniform data to existing registries and sharing common data with the ELSO (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) international registry to increase the sample size for observational research. In addition, well‐designed efficacy trials, recruiting across different regions of care evaluating long‐term follow‐up, including patient reported outcomes, cost effectiveness, and equity measures, would contribute significantly to the body of science. Workshop participants defined the population of patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest most likely to benefit from ECPR. ECPR‐eligible patients include those aged 18 to 75 years functioning independently without comorbidity; before suffering a witnessed out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest and without any obvious cause of the cardiac arrest; presenting in a shockable rhythm and transported with mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation to an ECPR‐capable institute within 30 minutes, which is recommended after 3 rounds of advanced life support treatment without return of spontaneous circulation. There are significant inequities in out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest care that need to be addressed such that outcomes are optimized for each target region before implementing ECPR in a clinical or implementation trial.

REGISTRY DATA

Registries collect data for surveillance, quality improvement, and research purposes. By design, data burden is least with surveillance and greatest with research. Understanding ECPR impact at the hospital, community, regional, state, and national levels requires a thoughtful approach to goals and sustainability based on a clear understanding of funding commitment over time and baseline data. Registries are informative in several scenarios for clinical practice and with regulatory agencies. For example, a registry can provide valid evidence for an off‐label indication to be transitioned to on‐label. However, cohort studies have limitations for using causal inference including missing data and limited data quality oversight generic to all registries. Specific to ECPR, it is important to note that inclusion of only subjects receiving ECPR will limit the ability to infer any ECPR harm or benefit, and such inference would rely only on comparisons with historical data or data from other sources that might not have the same detail. There is also a potential bias of clinicians selecting ECPR, whereby unmeasured features of the patients might make them qualitatively different from comparators in a way that is invisible to the registry. Therefore, a registry that includes all ECPR‐eligible patients and ensures complete capture of ECPR cases would be informative to allow case estimation and regional use over time.

The largest international registry of > 200 000 patients of all ages undergoing ECMO, including ECPR, is maintained by ELSO, an international nonprofit consortium of health care institutions, researchers, patients, and industry partners dedicated to research, patient advocacy, education, and supporting industry partners in their development and monitoring of extracorporeal life support therapies. ELSO supports observational research and embedded prospective studies. ELSO collects predominantly inpatient data from over 543 self‐reporting centers on 6 continents and across 56 countries. ELSO also includes data from 369 US registered member hospitals, systems, or institutions, enrolling both OHCA and IHCA and reporting outcomes. ELSO has recently updated ECPR data collection, but it does not currently capture information on outcomes after hospital discharge. Participating institutions pay a subscription based on country of origin from $75 to $2250 per annum. As of October 2022, 12 125 adult cardiac arrest ECPR cases have been entered with a 30% survival rate to hospital discharge.

Studies Comparing Survival AfterWith MechanicalVersus Conventional

Few studies have focused on barriers to high‐quality CPR during IHCA, where impediments are likely to differ substantially from those seen during OHCA. In addition to differences in the patient populations who experience IHCA compared with OHCA, the provider response to IHCA also differs considerably. Given the resources available in the hospital setting, CPR is typically started earlier than in OHCA, prolonged CPR by a single individual is unusual, and survival rates are often higher than in OHCA. Given these differences, the results from studies of mechanical CPR during OHCA may not be generalizable to cardiac arrests occurring in the in‐hospital environment.

Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined whether mechanical CPR has a survival benefit over conventional manual CPR during IHCA. Most of these trials failed to demonstrate superiority of mechanical CPR over conventional CPR, consistent with OHCA trials of mechanical CPR. The most robust of these was COMPRESS‐RCT, an RCT that randomized 127 patients in a 3:1 ratio to mechanical CPR versus conventional CPR. Although mortality was not the primary outcome, no difference was found between mechanical CPR and conventional CPR when comparing rates of teturn of spontaneous circulation (ROSC; 28% versus 25%), survival to hospital discharge (4% versus 4%), or survival with a good neurological outcome at 6 months (1.0% versus 0%). However, this study was limited by low survival in both arms and lower‐than‐expected recruitment. There are 2 published prior RCTs of mechanical CPR use in IHCA, which served as preliminary efficacy studies describing novel mechanical CPR devices. Neither of these trials found a difference in survival between mechanical CPR or manual CPR, although one study found that the use of mechanical CPR was associated with higher rates of ROSC and survival at 1 hour. However, no patients in this trial survived to hospital discharge. Another RCT, performed by Lu and colleagues, enrolled only patients who experienced cardiac arrest in the emergency department and as such represented a very specific arrest population. Several observational studies have also been published comparing patients with IHCA who received mechanical CPR and those who received conventional CPR. However, these observational studies should be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias, particularly from confounding by indication as the responding providers may be unlikely to start mechanical CPR in cases of IHCA that they deem to be futile, and additional confounding from immortal time bias as patients who receive mechanical CPR have not attained ROSC by the time the responding team members apply mechanical CPR devices. Therefore, current evidence does not support routine use of mechanical CPR for all in‐hospital resuscitation events.

### International consensus on evidence gaps and research opportunities in extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop [^112D36a1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 356 000 people (116/100 000 person‐years) have out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) annually in the United States. American Heart Association (AHA) Statistical Update from 2021 reported an OHCA survival rate of 5% to 10%. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium reported in 2017 survival rates from 4.2% to 19.8% across regions serving over 23 million people where cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) metrics were reported and compliant with guidelines. The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium investigators reported that age‐adjusted survival was lower for Black and Hispanic individuals when compared with White individuals. Regional variation in survival is even more apparent in a key clinical subgroup of bystander‐witnessed ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, where survival rates span 12.9% to 53.1%. Cardiac arrest is considered responsible for 3.3 million years of potential life lost annually, and this rate is 2‐fold higher in lower socioeconomic census tracts. Unlike other cardiovascular diseases (eg, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) that have all demonstrated a decrease in death in recent decades, the improvement in outcome after treatment of cardiac arrest with time‐sensitive interventions has remained modest over the past 30 years. This lack of progress is attributable to the known lethality of cardiac arrest, inadequate investment in either optimizing systems of care or in building optimal capacity through training, and inadequate translational research.

### A meta-analysis of the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^112s65Rz]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis included 15 relevant studies. There were no significant differences in the rate of ROSC, rate of survival to admission, rate of survival to discharge, and neurological function scores between the manual compression and mechanical compression groups. When the mechanical compression group was divided into Lucas and Autopulse subgroups, the results showed that the Lucas subgroup did not differ significantly in the ROSC, admission survival rate, discharge survival rate, and CPC scores compared with the manual compression group. The Autopulse subgroup had no difference in ROSC, discharge survival rate, and CPC scores compared with the manual compression group. However, manual compression is more advantageous because it can be implemented in a timely and effective manner, while mechanical compression tends to cause more complications. Therefore, we recommend that manual compression be performed in the early stage of CPR to rescue OHCA patients. Mechanical compression can be used as part of advanced life support, but it cannot currently completely replace timely manual compression.

Potential Risks of Mechanical

Delays infor Device Application

The use of mechanical CPR in IHCA does not come without risks. The time required to apply mechanical CPR devices can lead to delays in initiation of CPR during the early phase of cardiac arrest when the likelihood of achieving ROSC may be greatest. Prolonged pauses could potentially have a substantial impact on the likelihood of achieving ROSC but are not widely reported in the published literature. In the setting of RCTs, relatively short deployment times have been reported, highlighting that delays can be minimized with appropriate training. For example, in the COMPRESS‐RCT, the mean pause durations for backplate and upper portion deployment were 7.3 seconds and 9.8 seconds respectively, which highlights the importance of ongoing training of resuscitation teams in the use of mechanical CPR devices when such devices are used as a standard part of IHCA resuscitation practice.

Injuries From Mechanical

Several studies have demonstrated traumatic injuries associated with the use of mechanical CPR, which range from relatively benign injuries to life‐threatening or fatal ones. Such injuries are commonly caused by CPR, whether manual or mechanical and include fractures of ribs and sternum as well as damage to organs such as the liver, heart, and lungs. A recent meta‐analysis suggested that mechanical CPR may be associated with an increased risk of rib fractures as well as heart and liver injuries. Such injuries may be caused by poor placement or migration of the device during resuscitation. The risks of CPR pauses and injuries may be mitigated by ongoing high‐quality training of cardiac arrest teams in the correct use of mechanical CPR devices, although whether such training reduces such complications has not been rigorously studied.

The efficacy of mechanical CPR for IHCA remains incompletely understood. Several knowledge gaps remain that, when answered, might help to clarify the population who should receive mechanical CPR, where in the hospital it should be used, and how best to implement a mechanical CPR program. Some of these are highlighted in Table 2.

Discussion

The application of CPR for CA patients aims to restore spontaneous circulation as soon as possible and to obtain better neurological function after discharge. The 2015 AHA guidelines for CPR emphasize the importance of high-quality CPR for the survival of CA patients. Current methods of compression include manual compression and mechanical compression, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. The network meta-analysis by Khan et al. in 2018 showed that manual compression was significantly better than mechanical compression in 30-day survival, discharge survival, and neurological function, especially over load-distributed distribution press provided by Autopulse; however, it had no significant difference with the Lucas mechanical press. Moreover, manual compression was better than the Autopulse mechanical compression in the formation of pneumothorax and hematoma. Li et al. performed a meta-analysis of in-hospital and out-of-hospital CA patients in 2016 and showed that for out-of-hospital CA, there was no significant difference in CPC score, admission survival rate, and discharge survival rate between manual compression and mechanical compression, and that manual compression was superior to mechanical compression in the rate of spontaneous circulation recovery, especially superior to mechanical compression provided by Autopulse. For in-hospital CA, manual compression was superior to mechanical compression in the rate of spontaneous circulation recovery and discharge survival. Brooks et al. conducted a meta-analysis in 2014, only analyzed the neurological function scores, and showed that manual compression was superior to mechanical compression. Westfall et al. conducted a meta-analysis in 2013 and showed that the mechanical compression provided by LBD was superior to manual compression in the rate of spontaneous circulation recovery, but there was no difference in the rate of spontaneous circulation recovery between the piston-driven cardiopulmonary resuscitation and manual compression. There were no consistent results in the previous results about the superiority of mechanical compression and manual compression, so the conclusions may be not reliable. This meta-analysis included 15 relevant studies: 9 RCTs and 6 cohort studies. The results showed that there were no differences between manual compression and mechanical compression in terms of the four observed indicators (the ROSC rate, the rate of survival to hospital admission, the rate of survival to hospital discharge, and CPC scores). In addition to the ROSC rate, the results of the remaining three outcome measures were consistent with the results of the meta-analysis of outpatients with CA performed by Li et al. in 2016. When mechanical compression was divided into Lucas and Autopulse subgroups, the results showed no significant difference between the Lucas subgroup and the manual compression group for the ROSC, survival to admission rate, survival to discharge rate, and CPC scores. There were no differences between the Autopulse subgroups and the manual compression group for the ROSC, survival to discharge rate, and CPC score. The Autopulse subgroup was superior to the manual compression group in terms of the survival to admission rate, but this conclusion was drawn from only one study (Marcus Eng Hock Ong's study in 2012), and the study uses manual compression to reduce the duration of compression interruption before and Autopulse application. Therefore, the study may have a large bias, and more original studies are needed to further verify the results. The possible reasons for the above results are as follows: (1) Although most of the studies included were RCTs, the descriptions of the randomization methods, such as the generation of random sequences, were not specific; additionally, there were significant differences in the way in which compression was performed, and the requirements for blinding were not met. Some studies used two compression methods; however, mechanical compression requires more preparation time than manual compression, and CPR requires early chest compression. Due to the need to save the patient's life, both the experimental group and the control group first received manual compression and then were grouped into the manual and mechanical compression groups. (2) In actual situations, mechanical compression can be often used for patients in whom early defibrillation cannot be applied or for CA patients who require long-term chest compressions. These CA patients usually have a worse prognosis than patients who receive early defibrillation or who experience early ROSC. Because most of the studies included stratification of shockable and nonshockable rhythm and CA with witnesses and CA without witnesses, further meta-analysis was performed between patients with shockable and nonshockable rhythm and patients with witnessed CA and unwitnessed CA. For nonshockable CA and shockable CA, the included studies showed no significant difference between the mechanical compression group and the manual compression group (nonshockable CA: OR = 1.10, 95% CI (0.93, 1.31), P = 0.26; shockable CA: OR = 0.87, 95% CI (0.72, 1.06), P = 0.16); there was also no significant differences between the witness and unwitnessed CA subgroups (unwitnessed CA: OR = 0.94, 95% CI (0.71, 1.25), P = 0.68; witnessed CA: OR = 1.07, 95% CI (0.81, 1.41), P = 0.66); however, there was a lack of detailed descriptions of the populations that received mechanical compression and manual compression, e.g. whether the CA victims had unpredictable factors such as ineffective early defibrillation and a need for long-term compression. It is impossible to determine whether there was selection bias in the included studies. (3) Complications or comorbidities of CPR have significant impacts on the prognosis of CA patients. Although some studies have shown that the type and extent of injury caused by manual compression is not significantly different from that caused by mechanical compression, CA patients who receive mechanical compression are more likely to develop rib or sternal fractures, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema, resulting in more complex treatment after admission and an increased risk of death. Therefore, it seems that mechanical compression is not better than manual compression. The network meta-analysis by Khan et al. in 2018 also showed that compared with mechanical compression, manual compression led to less pneumothorax and hematoma. This finding requires further meta-analysis or RCTs to verify. (4) At the same time, the current mechanical compression systems have drawbacks. Although the mechanisms of cardiac compression can be simulated well, mechanical compression systems, from the early Thumper system to the current Lucas and Autopulse systems, have consistently lacked quality detection methods and cannot indicate the quality and safety of chest compressions in a timely manner. These systems are not suitable for very large or very small patients, and they are difficult to transport, rendering them less useful for the early application of compression. In fact, in addition to the effects of timely and uninterrupted high-quality compression on the prognosis of CA patients, other factors, such as the time between cardiac arrest and treatment and the type of initial arrhythmia, also affect the quality of CPR. As described in a prospective, multicenter, observational article by Hayashida in 2017, mechanical compression may be associated with a poor prognosis for CA victims given the potential confounders of out-of-hospital first aid. It is believed that further research is needed to clarify whether there is a benefit to mechanical compression. Therefore, it can be concluded that mechanical chest compression is not superior to manual chest compression.

### Use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2010–2016 [^111jnaPd]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

Between 2010 and 2016, use of mechanical CPR devices for patients identified with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by EMS professionals increased more than 4-fold, with wide variation in use across communities by agency type and Census Division. Our findings should be used to inform current state and local EMS efforts to use cost-effective, high-quality care for patients experiencing cardiac arrest in the community. Although mechanical CPR devices may be useful in certain clinical circumstances, the routine and increasing use of mechanical CPR devices for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest does not appear to be justified by the current available evidence. To justify the significant increase in use of these devices, better evidence is needed of improved, clinically meaningful outcomes for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with mechanical CPR by prehospital EMS professionals.

### Prehospital extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117YTgTs]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the available published evidence of the effects of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) in the prehospital setting on clinical outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews an Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Setting

In the prehospital setting.

Participants

All randomized control trials (RCTs) and observational trials using pre-hospital ECPR in adult patients (> 17 years).

Interventions

Prehospital ECPR.

Measurements and Main Results

The study authors searched Medline, Embase, and PUBMED for all RCTs and observational trials. The studies were assessed for clinical, methodologic, and statistical heterogeneity. The primary outcome was survival at hospital discharge. The study outcomes were aggregated using random-effects meta-analysis of means or proportions as appropriate. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to assess the quality of evidence. Four studies were included, with a total of 222 patients receiving prehospital ECPR (mean age = 51 years [95% CI 44–57], 81% of patients were male (CI 74–87), and 60% patients had a cardiac cause for their arrest (95% CI 43–76). Overall survival at discharge was 23.4% (95% CI 15.5–33.7; I² = 62%). The pooled low-flow time was 61.1 minutes (95% CI 45.2–77.0; I² = 97%). The quality of evidence was assessed to be low, and the overall risk of bias was assessed to be serious, with confounding being the primary source of bias.

Conclusion

No definitive conclusions can be made as to the efficacy of prehospital ECPR in refractory cardiac arrest. Higher quality evidence is required.

In-hospital cardiac arrest

In contrast to the OHCA setting, few studies have sought to evaluate the routine use of mechanical CPR in the IHCA setting. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis identified only three randomised controlled trials which enrolled 234 patients.

The largest of these trials, and the only study published in the last 20 years, enrolled 150 in-hospital cardiac arrest patients who were randomised to receive either mechanical CPR delivered by a piston device or manual CPR. The study report is available only in Chinese. After translation, unfortunately, key patient characteristics, such as initial rhythm, are not reported. The study reported that the use of a mechanical device improved survival to hospital discharge (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.26, 6.24). This trial, alongside the two other trials, are summarised in Table 2.

Table 2

The meta-analysis of the three randomised trials alongside six (455 patients) observational studies found very low quality evidence supporting an association between mechanical CPR use and increased likelihood of ROSC (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.11, 4.13) and survival to hospital discharge/30 days (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.42, 3.85). Neurological outcome was not assessed in any study. The results of the meta-analysis were broadly consistent between the sub-groups of randomised controlled trials and observational studies.

These findings seemingly contrast with research findings from out-of-hospital studies. Reasons for this apparent discrepancy may reflect differences in either the quality of evidence or clinical characteristics between the two settings, such that mechanical devices may be more effective than manual chest compressions in the hospital setting. Examples of such characteristics include the opportunity for early device deployment and the challenges of delivering effective manual chest compressions on a bed mattress.

Based on this discrepancy, the need for a randomised controlled trial in the in-hospital setting was recently highlighted as a research priority. The ongoing COMPRESS-RCT (ISRCTN38139840) study is assessing the feasibility of undertaking such a trial.

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) — timing and age considerations: ECPR should be considered in patients with OHCA who receive immediate bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), do not achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) within 10 minutes, and can receive temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) within 50–60 minutes. Elderly patients benefit much less from ECPR; although not an absolute contraindication, elderly patients should be carefully evaluated before ECPR is initiated, and the DanGer trial showed a cut-off of 77 years for benefit of treatment with a partial support mAFP in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

### Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adults and children with mechanical circulatory support: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116NpcvT]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association scientific statement on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adults and children with mechanical circulatory support (MCS) — scope and rationale emphasize that cardiac arrest in patients on mechanical support is a new phenomenon and that this statement highlights recognition and treatment of cardiovascular collapse or cardiopulmonary arrest in patients who have a ventricular assist device (VAD) or total artificial heart, with expert consensus recommendations for the role of external chest compressions. Because of the unique characteristics of mechanical support, these patients have physical findings that cannot be interpreted the same as for patients without MCS, and stable patients supported by a durable, continuous-flow VAD often do not have a palpable pulse, contributing to different and sometimes conflicting instructions on core resuscitative practices. No evidence-based or consensus recommendations currently exist for the evaluation and treatment of cardiovascular emergencies in patients with MCS, so there is a need for emergency care providers to receive specific guidance on how to assess and treat a patient with MCS who is unresponsive or hypotensive; accordingly, the purpose of this scientific statement is to describe common MCS devices and to present expert, consensus-based recommendations for the evaluation and resuscitation of adult and pediatric patients with MCS with suspected cardiovascular collapse or cardiac arrest.

To the editor

We read with great interest the article by El-Menyar et al. titled "Mechanical versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): an umbrella review of contemporary systematic reviews and more", recently published in Critical Care. The findings from the umbrella review and the new systematic review in this study suggest that mechanical CPR is not superior to manual CPR in achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

Although this article offers valuable insights, several issues warrant further discussion and clarification. In Fig. 2 's Forest plot for ROSC from El-Menyar et al.'s article, we observed some issues with the study selection. The umbrella meta-analysis included duplicated studies and studies with no ROSC-related data upon our detailed review. Additionally, the inclusion of just the abstracts from three studies could potentially limit the robustness of the findings. Moreover, when replicating the authors' search strategy, we identified a missing randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing mechanical and manual CPR in in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) settings.

We consolidated studies from the umbrella review and the new systematic review, excluding improperly included studies and adding the newly identified RCT. Using Stata Version 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), we conducted subgroup analyses for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and IHCA patients across RCTs and non-RCTs. For OHCA patients, mechanical CPR did not improve ROSC rates in either study type. However, the IHCA outcomes varied by study type: RCTs showed a higher probability of ROSC with mechanical CPR, whereas non-RCTs indicated a reduced likelihood of achieving ROSC (Figs. 1 and 2)

Return of spontaneous circulation rate

Twelve of the included studies (including 98,826 cases) performed statistical analyses of the observed indicators. Among these studies, there were 23,871 cases in the mechanical compression group and 74,955 cases in the manual compression group. There were 6 RCTs and 6 cohort studies. The heterogeneity test results showed that I² was 73% and 87% for the RCTs and cohort studies, respectively, suggesting significant heterogeneity among the studies. Statistical analysis was performed using the random effects model, and no significant difference was found in the ROSC rate between the mechanical compression group and the manual compression group [RCT: OR = 1.12, 95% CI (0.90, 1.39), P = 0.31; cohort study: OR = 1.08, 95% CI (0.85, 1.36), P = 0.54]. The forest plots are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

When the mechanical compression group was further divided into the Lucas group and the Autopulse group, the results showed that there was no heterogeneity among the 6 studies in the Lucas group (OR = 1.07, 95% CI (0.95, 1.20), P = 0.25). The heterogeneity among the 4 studies in the Autopulse group was I² = 91% (OR = 1.15, 95% CI (0.94, 1.41), P = 0.38). There were no significant differences in the ROSC rate between the two mechanical compression subgroups and the manual compression group in patients with OHCA.

We also disagree with Zhao et al. on their concern for inclusion of Couper et al. (2021) Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT). Our previous meta-analysis focused on publications from April 2021 to February 2024; this RCT was published in January 2021. Therefore, it fell outside our search period and was not included in our new SR and meta-analysis.

The survival rate post-cardiac arrest varies according to several factors, including the location of arrest (in-hospital (IHCA) vs out-of-hospital (OHCA) cardiac arrest), time to ROSC, and the impact of the post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction or syndrome. After IHCA, the survival is almost twice that of OHCA, as an early ROSC is highly attained after IHCA (≈ 50%). Zhao et al. results were consistent with our findings, showing that in patients with OHCA, mechanical CPR did not improve the ROSC in RCTs and non-RCTs, while after IHCA, RCTs showed improved ROSC with mechanical CPR. However, the subgroup analysis for the IHCA group included very old RCTs (two out of four, namely Taylor 1978 and Halperin 1993), in addition to the comparatively high variances. It is essential to highlight those significant changes in the resuscitation protocols and advancements in technology that have occurred over the past decades. The age of these studies presents a considerable challenge, as they were conducted under vastly different clinical environments and standards of care compared to more recent studies. These variations, including differences in CPR techniques, medications, and post-resuscitation care, further contribute to the heterogeneity and bias of the outcomes data.

The update identified one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that was added to three RCTs evaluated in the previous reviews. The observational studies included in the previous systematic reviews were limited by a critical risk of bias, the 2024 updated systematic review was limited to RCTs, and meta-analyses were not performed.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The increased accessibility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following the COVID-19 pandemic and the publication of the first randomized trial of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) prompted the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to sponsor a workshop on ECPR. Two more randomized trials have since been published in 2022 and 2023. Based on the combined findings and review of the evidence, an international panel of authors identified gaps in science, inequities in care and diversity in outcomes, and suggested research opportunities and next steps. The science pertaining to ECPR would benefit from the United States contributing uniform data to existing registries and sharing common data with the ELSO (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) international registry to increase the sample size for observational research. In addition, well-designed efficacy trials, recruiting across different regions of care evaluating long-term follow-up, including patient reported outcomes, cost effectiveness, and equity measures, would contribute significantly to the body of science. Workshop participants defined the population of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest most likely to benefit from ECPR. ECPR-eligible patients include those aged 18 to 75years functioning independently without comorbidity; before suffering a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without any obvious cause of the cardiac arrest; presenting in a shockable rhythm and transported with mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation to an ECPR-capable institute within 30 minutes, which is recommended after 3 rounds of advanced life support treatment without return of spontaneous circulation. There are significant inequities in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest care that need to be addressed such that outcomes are optimized for each target region before implementing ECPR in a clinical or implementation trial.

Conclusions

E‐CPR for refractory OHCA may improve outcomes in carefully selected patients. However, the evidence base for E‐CPR efficacy, patient selection, and postcardiac arrest management is poor. Much work is needed in this area and large‐scale high‐quality trials, although challenging, should be made a priority.

### Mechanical, team-focused, video-reviewed cardiopulmonary resuscitation improves return of spontaneous circulation after emergency department implementation [^114nLCLp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Survival from cardiac arrest remains suboptimal, despite recent improvements in public health measures, resuscitation science research, and technological advances. In 2016, out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival remained low at 12%. 1 A 2018 scientific statement by the American Heart Association suggests that enhanced resuscitation education has the potential to improve patient outcomes as much as any new scientific breakthroughs in the field. 2 Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that monitoring the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with improved cardiac arrest outcomes. 3, 4, 5 Recent research on team‐focused, or high performance, CPR has shown improvements in neurologically intact survival in a prehospital setting, revealing the importance of teamwork, education, and quality improvement programs on cardiac arrest outcomes. 6, 7 Video review of cardiac arrest resuscitation provides a unique opportunity to both monitor the quality of the resuscitation and provide feedback and education to individuals and teams to improve the quality of cardiac arrest resuscitation. Previous video review research in the trauma setting has demonstrated improved team functioning, compliance with Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines, and time to definitive care. 8, 9

Manual CPR has been found to be difficult both in and out of the hospital. 10, 11 Mechanical CPR with a mechanical chest compression device (MCCD) rather than manual CPR should improve the quality of CPR that is delivered by ensuring adequate chest compression depth and rate. In addition, it provides the ability to transport patients safely in an ambulance and for safe defibrillation with ongoing chest compressions. Despite these potential benefits, large randomized controlled trials using mechanical CPR in the prehospital setting have failed to demonstrate a survival benefit. 12, 13 Further, the AutoPulse Assisted Prehospital International Resuscitation (ASPIRE) 14 randomized controlled trial, observational studies, 15, 16 and a Cochrane meta‐analysis suggest that outcomes may be worse with mechanical CPR, compared with manual CPR. 17 One system where mechanical CPR appears to be producing benefit is the Minnesota Resuscitation Consortium's use of an MCCD as a bridge from the prehospital setting directly to the cardiac catheterization suite for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or extracorporeal CPR (E‐CPR), in refractory ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia OHCA. 18

### An update on the mechanical versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation in cardiac arrest patients [^111ywBUz]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

It is of utmost importance that the data used in our umbrella review and SR showed a heterogeneity due to the different methodologies employed in the original studies and SRs. The design and quality of studies were also of concern. Moreover, the definitions of ROSC and the cause of cardiac arrest varied across studies, introducing additional complexity to the analysis. We meticulously addressed these issues in our review including a comprehensive limitations section for the readers.

Of note is that the likelihood of ROSC and survival is expected to significantly improve when CPR is performed promptly and at a high-quality level using advanced technology and guidelines. Despite advances in CPR, poor survival rates remain challenging, even with achieving the ROSC. Therefore, ROSC should not be the end of the game, and research must also focus on preventing the post-cardiac arrest syndrome that could occur within several hours of the arrest and ROSC. A recent SR (24 studies) showed no statistically significant differences in ROSC and survival between the two kinds of CPR following OHCA. However, a favorable neurological outcome (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.07–1.84) was observed with manual CPR in 13 of these OHCA studies. Therefore, we addressed these essential outcomes after CPR along with the ROSC, such as survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, 30-day survival, and neurological outcomes. Additionally, we investigated the impact of gender, age, type of device, initial rhythm, duration of CPR, and location of arrest on the CPR outcomes in subgroups, ensuring comprehensive and robust analysis. Consequently, we urge well-designed multicenter RCT and living SR and umbrella review to support favorable post-CPR outcomes and overcome the gaps in contemporary literature.

### Mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation and hospital survival among adult patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest attending the emergency department: a prospective, multicenter, observational study in Japan (SOS-KANTO [survey of survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in kanto area] 2012 study) [^115Btbsn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an association between mCPR in the ED and the clinical outcomes after adult nontraumatic OHCA using data from a large, multicenter, prospective cohort study of OHCA in Japan. None of the previous studies accounted for the within‐institution clustering effect and potential confounders, as was done in the current study. We found that, although the use of mCPR devices in the ED has become widespread in Japan, most CPR efforts were performed without them in the ED. When adjusted for potential confounders and within‐institution clustering effects, mCPR in the ED was significantly associated with decreased likelihoods of favorable clinical outcomes in those patients.

Previous studies failed to demonstrate an improved clinical outcome in comparison to manual CPR when mCPR devices were used in the prehospital setting. The PARAMEDIC (Pre‐hospital Randomized Assessment of a Mechanical Compression Device in Cardiac Arrest) trial, 45 CIRC (Circulation Improving Resuscitation Care) trial, 19 and LINC (LUCAS in Cardiac Arrest) study 46 reported that the superiority of prehospital mCPR in comparison to manual CPR had not been demonstrated. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to suggest the superiority of prehospital mCPR devices, which is reflected by a class IIb recommendation (Usefulness is less well established by evidence.) and a level of evidence of C (consensus opinion of experts) in the American Heart Association guidelines. 47 However, although the results from clinical trials have been conflicting, the use of mCPR devices is currently established and they are widely used not only in the prehospital setting but also in the ED in Japan.

### Use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2010–2016 [^1157iWJN]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How frequently were mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices used in the United States by prehospital emergency medical services professionals for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from 2010 to 2016?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study, the risk-adjusted use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices rose from 1.9% to 8.0% among all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. This increase was consistent among patients when stratified by demographic characteristics and geographical location.

Meaning

Use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices has increased more than 4-fold among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by emergency medical services professionals, despite significant costs and minimal evidence that these devices improve clinically meaningful outcomes among patients.

### ILCOR scientific knowledge gaps and clinical research priorities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care: a consensus statement [^115Vjt6F]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Vasopressors during cardiac arrest — Given uncertainty from observational studies, the 2015 CoSTR suggested that epinephrine continue to be administered to patients in cardiac arrest by using existing dosing and timing strategies. The page notes no adequately powered placebo-controlled prospective trial assessing long-term outcomes; an underpowered randomized controlled trial in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest documented a higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation without improving survival to discharge or neurological outcome, and a meta-analysis of large observational studies associated epinephrine with no change in survival to discharge and worse long-term neurological outcomes despite higher ROSC. A propensity-matched analysis of the Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry reported that epinephrine given within the first 2 minutes after the first defibrillation to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest and an initially shockable rhythm was associated with decreased odds of survival (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.59–0.82).

### Emergency medicine updates: cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^111XTgj1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest is the loss of functional cardiac activity; emergency clinicians are integral in the management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Discussion

Cardiac arrest includes shockable rhythms (i.e., pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) and non-shockable rhythms (i.e., asystole and pulseless electrical activity). The goal of cardiac arrest management is to achieve survival with a good neurologic outcome, in part by restoring systemic perfusion and obtaining return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), while seeking to diagnose and treat the underlying etiology of the arrest. CPR includes high-quality chest compressions to optimize coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure. Chest compressions should be centered over the mid-sternum, with the compressor's body weight over the middle of the chest. A compression depth of 5–6 cm is recommended at a rate of 100–120 compressions per minute, while allowing the chest to fully recoil between each compression. Clinicians should seek to minimize any interruptions in compressions. When performed by bystanders, compression-only CPR may be associated with improved survival to hospital discharge when compared to conventional CPR with ventilations. However, in trained personnel, there is likely no difference with compression-only versus conventional CPR. Mechanical approaches for CPR are not associated with improved patient outcomes, including ROSC or survival with good neurologic function, but mechanical compression devices may be beneficial in select circumstances (e.g., few rescuers available, prolonged arrest/transport). Monitoring of chest compressions is not associated with improved ROSC, survival, or neurologic outcomes, but it can improve guideline adherence. Types of monitoring include real-time feedback, a CPR coach, end tidal CO 2, arterial line monitoring, regional cerebral tissue oxygenation, and point-of-care ultrasound.

Conclusions

An understanding of CPR literature updates can improve the ED care of patients in cardiac arrest.

### Mechanical chest compressions and simultaneous defibrillation vs conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: the LINC randomized trial [^114EoN43]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

A strategy using mechanical chest compressions might improve the poor outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but such a strategy has not been tested in large clinical trials.

Objective

To determine whether administering mechanical chest compressions with defibrillation during ongoing compressions (mechanical CPR), compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (manual CPR), according to guidelines, would improve 4-hour survival.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter randomized clinical trial of 2589 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest conducted between January 2008 and February 2013 in 4 Swedish, 1 British, and 1 Dutch ambulance services and their referring hospitals. Duration of follow-up was 6 months.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive either mechanical chest compressions (LUCAS Chest Compression System, Physio-Control/Jolife AB) combined with defibrillation during ongoing compressions (n = 1300) or to manual CPR according to guidelines (n = 1289).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Four-hour survival, with secondary end points of survival up to 6 months with good neurological outcome using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score. A CPC score of 1 or 2 was classified as a good outcome.

Results

Four-hour survival was achieved in 307 patients (23.6%) with mechanical CPR and 305 (23.7%) with manual CPR (risk difference, -0.05%; 95% CI, -3.3% to 3.2%; P > .99). Survival with a CPC score of 1 or 2 occurred in 98 (7.5%) vs 82 (6.4%) (risk difference, 1.18%; 95% CI, -0.78% to 3.1%) at intensive care unit discharge, in 108 (8.3%) vs 100 (7.8%) (risk difference, 0.55%; 95% CI, -1.5% to 2.6%) at hospital discharge, in 105 (8.1%) vs 94 (7.3%) (risk difference, 0.78%; 95% CI, -1.3% to 2.8%) at 1 month, and in 110 (8.5%) vs 98 (7.6%) (risk difference, 0.86%; 95% CI, -1.2% to 3.0%) at 6 months with mechanical CPR and manual CPR, respectively. Among patients surviving at 6 months, 99% in the mechanical CPR group and 94% in the manual CPR group had CPC scores of 1 or 2.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, there was no significant difference in 4-hour survival between patients treated with the mechanical CPR algorithm or those treated with guideline-adherent manual CPR. The vast majority of survivors in both groups had good neurological outcomes by 6 months. In clinical practice, mechanical CPR using the presented algorithm did not result in improved effectiveness compared with manual CPR.

### A meta-analysis of the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^112ghCQM]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Type of study

This meta-analysis includes published randomized controlled clinical trials and cohort studies on the use of mechanical compression and manual compression to treat out-of-hospital CA. The included studies included different types of mechanical compression and manual compression groups. The patients in the studies were required to be adults with CA, and the outcome measures included the rates of the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge, and Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scores.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria

(1) Patients or participants: the included participants were OHCA patients. (2) Intervention measures: the comparison was between mechanical compression and manual compression. (3) Outcome indicators: the outcome indicators included primary outcome indicators, such as the rate of the ROSC, and secondary outcome indicators, such as the rate of survival to hospital admission, the rate of survival to hospital discharge, and CPC scores. Each study included at least one of the primary and one of the secondary indicators. (4) Study type: the included studies were RCTs or cohort studies.

Exclusion criteria

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the study lacked a control group or was not one of the two included types of studies. (2) The study included children younger than 18 years, animal studies, or simulation studies. (3) The original text could not be obtained, and the available information was insufficient. (4) The original data could not be transformed to be used in this study. (5) If the same institutions or individuals were found to have published a number of related studies, all but the most comprehensive study was excluded to avoid repetition. When relevant studies with different sample populations were published by the same institutions or individuals, all but the study with the largest sample size were excluded. The specific screening process is shown in Fig. 1.

### Chest compression-only CPR by lay rescuers and survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest… [^1156YXmt]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

These efforts included changes in the approach to the care provided by both bystanders and emergency medical services personnel5 and were based on the increasing evidence in favor of minimizing interruptions in chest compressions during CPR. 6–10 This led to alterations in the resuscitative care provided by EMS personnel, termed minimally interrupted cardiac resuscitation. 11, 12 Simultaneously, we launched a statewide, multifaceted effort to encourage bystanders to use compression-only CPR because this approach is easier to teach, learn, remember, and perform than conventional CPR.
13. Multivariable logistic regression showed that COCPR was associated with improved odds of survival compared with no bystander CPR or conventional CPR after controlling for the following variables: witnessed arrest, shockable rhythm, EMS response interval, age, sex, location of arrest, provision of MICR by EMS personnel, and use of therapeutic hypothermia. This study is the first of which we are aware to report an intentional effort to encourage and endorse COCPR to the public. We identified 3 major findings: a significant increase in the rate of bystander CPR, an increase in the likelihood of bystanders performing COCPR vs conventional CPR, and a significant independent association between COCPR and survival when compared with conventional CPR. In the largest of these studies, there was a statistically significant increase in neurologically intact survival. 28 In our study, there also was a significant difference between good neurologic status in the COCPR group compared with the conventional CPR group.

### The cost-effectiveness of a mechanical compression device in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^115YcUax]. Resuscitation (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the cost-effectiveness of LUCAS-2, a mechanical device for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as compared to manual chest compressions in adults with non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

We analysed patient-level data from a large, pragmatic, multi-centre trial linked to administrative secondary care data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to measure healthcare resource use, costs and outcomes in both arms. A within-trial analysis using quality adjusted life years derived from the EQ-5D-3L was conducted at 12-month follow-up and results were extrapolated to the lifetime horizon using a decision-analytic model.

Results

4471 patients were enrolled in the trial (1652 assigned to the LUCAS-2 group, 2819 assigned to the control group). At 12 months, 89 (5%) patients survived in the LUCAS-2 group and 175 (6%) survived in the manual CPR group. In the vast majority of analyses conducted, both within-trial and by extrapolation of the results over a lifetime horizon, manual CPR dominates LUCAS-2. In other words, patients in the LUCAS-2 group had poorer health outcomes (i.e. lower QALYs) and incurred higher health and social care costs.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that the use of the mechanical chest compression device LUCAS-2 represents poor value for money when compared to standard manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

### Mechanical CPR: who? When? How? [^113z3fwW]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

In cardiac arrest, high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a key determinant of patient survival. However, delivery of effective chest compressions is often inconsistent, subject to fatigue and practically challenging. Mechanical CPR devices provide an automated way to deliver high-quality CPR. However, large randomised controlled trials of the routine use of mechanical devices in the out-of-hospital setting have found no evidence of improved patient outcome in patients treated with mechanical CPR, compared with manual CPR. The limited data on use during in-hospital cardiac arrest provides preliminary data supporting use of mechanical devices, but this needs to be robustly tested in randomised controlled trials. In situations where high-quality manual chest compressions cannot be safely delivered, the use of a mechanical device may be a reasonable clinical approach. Examples of such situations include ambulance transportation, primary percutaneous coronary intervention, as a bridge to extracorporeal CPR and to facilitate uncontrolled organ donation after circulatory death. The precise time point during a cardiac arrest at which to deploy a mechanical device is uncertain, particularly in patients presenting in a shockable rhythm. The deployment process requires interruptions in chest compression, which may be harmful if the pause is prolonged. It is recommended that use of mechanical devices should occur only in systems where quality assurance mechanisms are in place to monitor and manage pauses associated with deployment. In summary, mechanical CPR devices may provide a useful adjunct to standard treatment in specific situations, but current evidence does not support their routine use.

### Pre-arrest and intra-arrest prognostic factors associated with survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11726sqQ]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest refers to cessation of mechanical heart function and effective blood circulation, and is typically considered as either out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or in-hospital cardiac arrest. Although evidence from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is often extrapolated to in-hospital cardiac arrest, the epidemiology is different, and the determinants of success might differ accordingly. In comparison to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, data on incidence and survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest are limited. Most studies report an incidence of one to six events per 1000 hospital admissions. Survival to discharge ranges between 12% and 25%, with increased survival recently reported. One year outcomes are similar, with only modest increases over the past decade.

Prognostic factors associated with survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest are an important focus of ongoing research. Patients admitted to hospital have increasingly complex conditions and present unique challenges when managing in-hospital cardiac arrest. Clinicians have to rapidly process many factors related to preadmission status (including age, sex, comorbidities) and factors related to the arrest itself (whether the arrest was witnessed or monitored, initial rhythm) to determine the effectiveness of ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Additionally, clinicians need to discuss expected prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest with patients at the time of hospital admission to inform care plans, and whether to include cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of cardiac arrest. Patient understanding of survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest is poor, and is often influenced by popular media where unrealistic rates of survival to discharge approach 67%. Furthermore, when discussing inclusion of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in goals of care, clinicians rarely mention prognostic factors and likelihood of survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

A greater understanding of the factors associated with successful resuscitation of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest is needed. This information will help in developing a predictive model used in shared decision making with patients and families, and clinical decision making at the time of in-hospital cardiac arrest and after return of spontaneous circulation. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the association between pre-arrest and intra-arrest factors and survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

### A meta-analysis of the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^112wrvdb]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The limitation of this meta-analysis lies in the fact that it is a secondary analysis of original literature. Although most of the original studies included were RCTs, their quality scores were low, and the included studies did not include Chinese patients; the majority of the medical records examined in each study were from Europe and the USA. This may lead to a geographical limitation on the applicability of the results. This meta-analysis targeted adult OHCA patients but included different age groups. In addition, different individuals may have different underlying diseases, and the causes of OHCA in different individuals may affect the quality of CPR. At the same time, the results of the study also suggest that regardless of how technology develops, manual compression is the most timely method of CPR, and it is an effective way to rescue patients with OHCA.

### A meta-analysis of the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^117AgSKv]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Methods

All randomized controlled and cohort studies comparing the effects of mechanical compression and manual compression on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in OHCA patients were retrieved from the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid databases from the date of their establishment to January 14, 2019. The included outcomes were as follows: the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate, the rate of survival to hospital admission, the rate of survival to hospital discharge, and neurological function. After evaluating the quality of the studies and summarizing the results, RevMan5.3 software was used for the meta-analysis.

Results

In total, 15 studies (9 randomized controlled trials and 6 cohort studies) were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences in the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in terms of the ROSC rate, the rate of survival to hospital admission and survival to hospital discharge, and neurological function in OHCA patients (ROSC: RCT: OR = 1.12, 95% CI (0.90, 1.39), P = 0.31; cohort study: OR = 1.08, 95% CI (0.85, 1.36), P = 0.54; survival to hospital admission: RCT: OR = 0.95, 95% CI (0.75, 1.20), P = 0.64; cohort study: OR = 0.98 95% CI (0.79, 1.20), P = 0.82; survival to hospital discharge: RCT: OR = 0.87, 95% CI (0.68, 1.10), P = 0.24; cohort study: OR = 0.78, 95% CI (0.53, 1.16), P = 0.22; Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score: RCT: OR = 0.88, 95% CI (0.64, 1.20), P = 0.41; cohort study: OR = 0.68, 95% CI (0.34, 1.37), P = 0.28). When the mechanical compression group was divided into Lucas and Autopulse subgroups, the Lucas subgroup showed no difference from the manual compression group in ROSC, survival to admission, survival to discharge, and CPC scores; the Autopulse subgroup showed no difference from the manual compression subgroup in ROSC, survival to discharge, and CPC scores.

Conclusion

There were no significant differences in resuscitative effects between mechanical and manual chest compression in OHCA patients. To ensure the quality of CPR, we suggest that manual chest compression be applied in the early stage of CPR for OHCA patients, while mechanical compression can be used as part of advanced life support in the late stage.

### Automated device equal to manual chest compression… [^114wyj97]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Which method of resuscitation optimizes outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: manual chest compression or the use of an automated chest compression device. Setting: Population-based Study Design: Randomized controlled trial Allocation: Unconcealed. Synopsis: The investigators randomized 1, 071 eligible adults 18 years or older, with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest presumed to be of cardiac origin, to cardiopulmonary resuscitation via standard manual chest compression or the use of an automated load-distributing band chest compression device. Study outcomes included survival with spontaneous circulation at four hours, survival to hospital discharge, and neurologic function at discharge. Survival to hospital discharge was nonsignificantly higher in the manual CPR group than in the LDB group, but the safety monitoring board stopped the study before completion.

Neurologic outcome at hospital discharge was significantly better in the manual CPR group, with 7. 5 versus
3. 1 percent of patients achieving a cerebral performance category score of 1 or 2. A similar report in the same issue used a before-after study design; in that study, resuscitation with a LDB device was associated with a slightly but significantly improved rate of survival to hospital discharge. JAMA 2006; 295: 2661–4*) the authors indicate that the seemingly contradictory results are most likely the result of methodologic differences and possible sources of bias in both studies, including the differences in deployment time required for the LDP device, enrollment bias caused by the nonconcealed allocation assignment, and the potential for the Hawthorne effect in the manual CPR group. Bottom Line: Current evidence is unable to support a recommendation for the use of manual chest compression or an automated chest compression device for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation. Overall survival with good neurologic function at hospital discharge occurs in fewer than 10 percent of individuals with the use of either CPR method.

### Mechanical chest compression for out of hospital cardiac arrest: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177uVzr]. Resuscitation (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To summarise the evidence from randomised controlled trials of mechanical chest compression devices used during resuscitation after out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

Systematic review of studies evaluating the effectiveness of mechanical chest compression. We included randomised controlled trials or cluster randomised trials that compared mechanical chest compression (using any device) with manual chest compression for adult patients following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Outcome measures were return of spontaneous circulation, survival of event, overall survival, survival with good neurological outcome. Results were combined using random-effects meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Studies were identified by searches of electronic databases, reference lists of other studies and review articles.

Results

Five trials were included, of which three evaluated the LUCAS or LUCAS-2 device and two evaluated the AutoPulse device. The results did not show an advantage to the use of mechanical chest compression devices for survival to discharge/30 days (average OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77, 1.02) and survival with good neurological outcome (average OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53, 1.11).

Conclusions

Existing studies do not suggest that mechanical chest compression devices are superior to manual chest compression, when used during resuscitation after out of hospital cardiac arrest.

### Updates in cardiac arrest resuscitation [^114w5rWK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests annually in the United States, with survival rates of approximately 5% to 10% and 24%, respectively. The critical factors that have an impact on cardiac arrest survival include prompt recognition and activation of prehospital care, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and rapid defibrillation. Advanced life support protocols are continually refined to optimize intracardiac arrest management and improve survival with favorable neurologic outcome. This article focuses on current treatment recommendations for adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest, with emphasis on the latest evidence and controversies regarding intracardiac arrest management.

### Mechanical versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): an umbrella review of contemporary systematic reviews and more [^115irBKn]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of cardiac arrest (CA) differs significantly worldwide, with some centers reporting up to ten times higher numbers than others. The average global incidence of out-of-hospital CA (OHCA) is estimated to be 55 per 100,000 persons per year. Although there is a noticeable improvement in the utility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), poor outcomes remain challenging. The in-hospital CA arrest (IHCA) in the USA occurs as 6–7 CAs per 1000 hospital admissions in contrast to 1.5–2.8 per 1000 in Europe, with a survival rate of 15–34% at hospital discharge or 30 days. However, the overall bystander CPR in Europe is documented in only 58% of the OHCA settings (13–83%). One study from Sweden reported that resuscitation was attempted in only 12% of the IHCA. The restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after CPR varies from 36 to 54%. In some studies, the men-to-women incidence of IHCA is estimated as 1.4–1.6 to 1. The survival rate after OHCA is nearly 3–6% in Asia, 8% in Europe (0–18%), 11% in the USA, and 12% in Australia. The annual incidence of OHCA in Europe is 67–170 per 100,000 persons. Generally, the short-term survival rate after OHCA is 10–15% (one-tenth) in contrast to 20–25% (one-quarter) after IHCA. The survival rate heterogeneity could be related to several factors, namely the gender, etiology of arrest, initial cardiac rhythm during CPR, time elapsed before CPR, location of cardiac arrest, and patient's ethnicity. Therefore, high-quality CPR is required to attain the ROSC, preserve brain perfusion and function, and save lives.

### Use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2010–2016 [^116zqTqy]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Study Population

We limited our sample to patients who received treatment in the field with cardiac arrest identified by prehospital EMS professionals; patients found dead at the scene, who refused care, or for whom treatment was not required were excluded. Patients with cardiac arrest were identified using information provided by EMS professionals, including a primary or secondary "clinical impression" that the patient was experiencing cardiac arrest or that a cardiac arrest protocol was initiated. All other patients, regardless of whether manual or mechanical CPR was performed, were excluded from our study.

Main Outcome

We determined use of CPR, categorized as either manual or mechanical, based on a combination of procedure codes, including both a CPR "flag" and CPR type listed under procedure. All of the following codes were used to categorize patients as receiving mechanical CPR devices: CPR–AutoPulse device, CPR–mechanical thumper type device, or CPR by other external automated device. Manual CPR was defined based on the following categories: CPR–start compressions and ventilations, CPR–start compressions only without ventilation, CPR–start rescue breathing without compressions, or CPR–stop. Patients for whom mechanical or manual CPR was not explicitly noted were considered not to have received CPR.

Our main outcome was the proportion of out-of-hospital patients with cardiac arrest who received CPR from a mechanical CPR device. We chose to focus on proportions, instead of absolute numbers, to account for the increasing number of states and localities contributing data to NEMSIS during the study period. We also characterized patient disposition (eg, the proportion of patients who died prior to hospital transfer and the proportion who were transferred to the hospital) and the duration required for transfer, which was reported in minutes. Disposition data are provided by NEMSIS as transportation to hospital, deceased on arrival, transportation to other places (ie, home, nursing home, medical office or clinic, or police station or jail), or missing for cases for which information was not available.

### Mechanical CPR: who? When? How? [^112TXw5X]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The provision of high-quality CPR is a key modifiable factor associated with survival in cardiac arrest. Mechanical chest compression devices consistently deliver high-quality chest compressions, but this does not translate into improved patient outcomes when devices are routinely used in OHCA. Further trials are needed to evaluate the routine use of mechanical devices in IHCA.

The use of mechanical devices in specific circumstances (e.g. ambulance/helicopter transport, pPCI) where high-quality chest compressions cannot be safely delivered may be a reasonable strategy. In all situations where mechanical devices are used, clinicians must ensure that the device is deployed with minimal interruption to chest compression delivery.

### Mechanical chest compression devices at in-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jHP3q]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To summarise the evidence in relation to the routine use of mechanical chest compression devices during resuscitation from in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of studies which compared the effect of the use of a mechanical chest compression device with manual chest compressions in adults that sustained an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Critical outcomes were survival with good neurological outcome, survival at hospital discharge or 30-days, and short-term survival (ROSC/1-h survival). Important outcomes included physiological outcomes. We synthesised results in a random-effects meta-analysis or narrative synthesis, as appropriate. Evidence quality in relation to each outcome was assessed using the GRADE system.

Data Sources

Studies were identified using electronic databases searches (Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL), forward and backward citation searching, and review of reference lists of manufacturer documentation.

Results

Eight papers, containing nine studies [689 participants], were included. Three studies were randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses showed an association between use of mechanical chest compression device and improved hospital or 30-day survival (odds ratio 2.34, 95% CI 1.42–3.85) and short-term survival (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.11–4.13). There was also evidence of improvements in physiological outcomes. Overall evidence quality in relation to all outcomes was very low.

Conclusions

Mechanical chest compression devices may improve patient outcome, when used at in-hospital cardiac arrest. However, the quality of current evidence is very low. There is a need for randomised trials to evaluate the effect of mechanical chest compression devices on survival for in-hospital cardiac arrest.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^114Xcpxz]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shock — mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS): There are no large randomized trials to date evaluating the use of MCS devices among OHCA patients with shock. The DanGer Shock trial is being evaluated whereby 360 patients will be randomized to percutaneous transvalvular microaxial flow plus conventional therapy, while in IMPRESS, 48 patients, (92% with cardiac arrest prior to randomization) were randomly assigned to Impella CP versus intra-aortic balloon pump, and treatment with Impella CP did not reduce mortality compared to IABP at 30 days. The use of MCS, specifically Impella, has rapidly been increasing among patients undergoing PCI with limited evidence of efficacy and possible increase in adverse events. For refractory OHCA, the role of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is of research interest; single centers with the necessary resources and regimented protocols have demonstrated benefit, ongoing randomized trials aim to determine benefit in carefully selected OHCA patients, and whether this strategy is generalizable outside dedicated centers has not been demonstrated. Institutions need to implement appropriate pathways and transfer protocols to hospitals with adequate resources for deteriorating patients.

### A meta-analysis of the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^1137Bby8]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a sudden cardiac arrest and loss of consciousness that occurs outside of a hospital. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the only effective way to rescue patients with OHCA. Chest compression is the core of modern CPR. Its quality directly affects the perfusion of the coronary and common carotid arteries and ultimately influences the prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest (CA). Some studies have reported that high-quality CPR (mainly high-quality chest compression) improves the recovery and survival rates of CA patients. The 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines suggest that high-quality CPR has the following characteristics: adequate frequency, sufficient depth, full chest recoil, minimal interruptions during compressions, and avoidance of hyperventilation. The advantage of manual compression as a traditional chest compression method is that it can be used to quickly intervene in the rescue of an OHCA patient without the need for any mechanical assistance; however, the compression quality is degraded by fatigue after prolonged implementation. Since the first chest compression device was introduced in 1908, mechanical compression methods have been proposed and implemented in various animal studies of CPR. Because the machine does not stop or tire, it can ensure the implementation of high-quality compression with sufficient frequency, sufficient depth, and a lack of interruptions. Some animal and clinical experimental studies have also shown that mechanical compression can achieve higher intrathoracic pressure than manual compression, thereby increasing blood flow and perfusion pressure in coronary and systemic circulation. The current mechanical compression systems are mainly divided into two types. The first is a point-to-point press, which is represented by Lucas. It mainly provides compression of the lower sternum. The other type is a load-distribution press, which is represented by Autopulse. This type evenly distributes the pressure throughout the whole thorax to achieve three-dimensional pressing. The disadvantages of mechanical compression are that it requires equipment that is often not available and is not used in a timely manner. For CPR in patients with OHCA, both manual and mechanical compression have advantages and disadvantages, and there is no consensus regarding their effects and outcomes. Several recent meta-analyses have been performed, including the network meta-analysis by Khan et al. in 2018. Although that meta-analysis included 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it also used network meta-analysis and showed that the 30-day survival rate, the discharge survival rate, and the nervous system function of those treated with manual compression were significantly better than those treated with the load distribution provided by Autopulse and were not significantly different from those treated with mechanical compression provided by Lucas. However, this study only performed a meta-analysis of RCTs, and our study not only added two RCTs to the original literature but also conducted a meta-analysis of cohort studies. In 2016, Li et al. conducted a meta-analysis of in-hospital and out-of-hospital CA patients; they included 8 RCTs, 3 prospective studies, and 1 descriptive study, which were combined for meta-analysis, and separately analyzed the victims of CA in the hospital and outside the hospital. Brooks et al. in 2014 and Westfall et al. in 2013 performed two meta-analyses, which included subgroup analyses despite the presence of fewer out-of-hospital RCTs and could not definitely explain the advantages and disadvantages of mechanical compression and manual compression. In 2012, Ong et al. completed only a systematic review and did not perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, the conclusions drawn by these studies are not reliable. Hence, we conducted this meta-analysis, which includes the latest RCTs with OHCA patients and cohort studies, to investigate and compare the effects of mechanical and manual compression on the survival and prognosis of OHCA patients. To avoid data duplication, we selected only the most current study with the largest sample size when multiple studies were published by the same author. We retrieved 4 new RCTs and divided the studies into Lucas and Autopulse subgroups to further determine the advantages and disadvantages of mechanical compression and manual compression.

### Interventions to improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a review of meta-analyses and future agenda [^1149ZgJj]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Hardly any other medical intervention is as directly relevant for life-and-death outcomes as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). One would have expected, therefore, extensive evidence from rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for fine-tuning best approaches that maximize CPR effectiveness. However, this is not the case. Professional guidelines reflect little tangible progress, and recommendations are not driven by strong effects seen in RCTs.

To map the landscape of meta-analyses of RCTs on CPR, we searched PubMed (April 8, 2019) for "cardiopulmonary resuscitation AND meta-analysis AND (randomized OR randomised)". We screened 114 retrieved items for meta-analyses of RCTs in real patients (not education or simulation/manikins), addressing aspects pertaining to CPR per se rather than interventions done afterwards (e.g. hypothermia) and using survival and/or neurologically intact survival as outcomes. Whenever multiple overlapping meta-analyses existed, we kept all of them if they were published after 2013, to examine consistency of results.

The available evidence (Table 1) suggests that we have a dearth of interventions that improve survival rates at hospital discharge and, even less so, neurological outcomes. All benefits, if any, pertain to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest circumstances, while no new technology or improvement seems to work for in-hospital arrests. For out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, continuous (versus interrupted) chest compressions, epinephrine, and use of endotracheal tube intubation (versus supraglottic airway devices) may achieve modest increases in survival at hospital discharge. However, the lower 95% confidence intervals of the risk ratios in the most recent, inclusive meta-analyses on these interventions reach down to 1.00–1.02. Therefore, we cannot exclude that even these benefits are negligible or even non-existent. Survival with neurologically intact outcome is not conclusively increased by any of the interventions listed in the Table 1; epinephrine achieves a nominally statistically significant modest benefit over pooled control treatments, but this is less clear in separate comparisons against different control options. Epinephrine saves some patients who are admitted to the hospital, but they are not discharged neurologically intact. Other interventions also have disappointing results, e.g. no clear benefit is seen with mechanical devices for chest compression (they are even harmful for in-hospital cardiac arrest) and the order of chest compression versus defibrillation may not matter.

### Mechanical versus manual chest compressions for cardiac arrest [^116EJXWe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mechanical chest compression devices have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of resuscitation strategies using mechanical chest compressions versus resuscitation strategies using standard manual chest compressions with respect to neurologically intact survival in patients who suffer cardiac arrest.

Search Methods

On 19 August 2017 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science databases. Biotechnology and Bioengineering Abstracts and Science Citation abstracts had been searched up to November 2009 for prior versions of this review. We also searched two clinical trials registries for any ongoing trials not captured by our search of databases containing published works: Clinicaltrials.gov (August 2017) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal (January 2018). We applied no language restrictions. We contacted experts in the field of mechanical chest compression devices and manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and quasi-randomised studies comparing mechanical chest compressions versus manual chest compressions during CPR for patients with cardiac arrest.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included five new studies in this update. In total, we included 11 trials in the review, including data from 12,944 adult participants, who suffered either out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) or in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). We excluded studies explicitly including patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma, drowning, hypothermia and toxic substances. These conditions are routinely excluded from cardiac arrest intervention studies because they have a different underlying pathophysiology, require a variety of interventions specific to the underlying condition and are known to have a prognosis different from that of cardiac arrest with no obvious cause. The exclusions were meant to reduce heterogeneity in the population while maintaining generalisability to most patients with sudden cardiac death. The overall quality of evidence for the outcomes of included studies was moderate to low due to considerable risk of bias. Three studies (N = 7587) reported on the designated primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function (defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of one or two), which had moderate quality evidence. One study showed no difference with mechanical chest compressions (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.39), one study demonstrated equivalence (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.04), and one study demonstrated reduced survival (RR 0.41, CI 0.21 to 0.79). Two other secondary outcomes, survival to hospital admission (N = 7224) and survival to hospital discharge (N = 8067), also had moderate quality level of evidence. No studies reported a difference in survival to hospital admission. For survival to hospital discharge, two studies showed benefit, four studies showed no difference, and one study showed harm associated with mechanical compressions. No studies demonstrated a difference in adverse events or injury patterns between comparison groups but the quality of data was low. Marked clinical and statistical heterogeneity between studies precluded any pooled estimates of effect.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence does not suggest that CPR protocols involving mechanical chest compression devices are superior to conventional therapy involving manual chest compressions only. We conclude on the balance of evidence that mechanical chest compression devices used by trained individuals are a reasonable alternative to manual chest compressions in settings where consistent, high-quality manual chest compressions are not possible or dangerous for the provider (eg, limited rescuers available, prolonged CPR, during hypothermic cardiac arrest, in a moving ambulance, in the angiography suite, during preparation for extracorporeal CPR [ECPR], etc.). Systems choosing to incorporate mechanical chest compression devices should be closely monitored because some data identified in this review suggested harm. Special attention should be paid to minimising time without compressions and delays to defibrillation during device deployment.

HEALTH CARE DELIVERY WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS

The workshop also focused on extending the reach of ECPR systems of care for OHCA resuscitation from large academic centers to community, rural, and remote sites to improve equitable access to this advanced therapy. Whether the success of the ARREST trial can be replicated in other communities remains to be proven. It is recognized that ECPR‐facilitated resuscitation, which was used in the ARREST trial, is a complex, resource‐intensive system of care.

### Mechanical versus manual chest compressions in the treatment of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients in a non-shockable rhythm: a multi-centre feasibility randomised controlled trial (COMPRESS-RCT) [^111cTJN9]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In the UK, there are approximately 35,000 in-hospitals cardiac arrests per year with an overall hospital survival of 18.4%. High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, and reversal of the underlying cause are the mainstay of cardiac arrest treatment. However, delivery of high-quality CPR in clinical practice is often challenging.

Mechanical chest compression devices (mech-CPR) deliver high-quality CPR. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, large randomised controlled trials show that mech-CPR is not superior to manual CPR (man-CPR). As such, current guidelines recommend against the routine use of mech-CPR. In contrast, research on mech-CPR use in the hospital setting has been limited. Small randomised controlled trials and observational studies have produced very low-certainty evidence that mech-CPR use in the hospital setting is associated with improved clinical outcomes.

Based on evidence of mech-CPR use at in-hospital cardiac arrest and uncertainty regarding its effectiveness, we identified a need for a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of the routine use of mech-CPR, compared with man-CPR in adults that sustain an in-hospital cardiac arrest. In contrast to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, there have been relatively few trial of intra-arrest interventions for in-hospital cardiac arrests. As such, we decided to first test the deliverability of a mech-CPR trial in a feasibility trial.

### Mechanical versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): an umbrella review of contemporary systematic reviews and more [^117Rrcm5]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can restore spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurological function and save lives. We conducted an umbrella review, including previously published systematic reviews (SRs), that compared mechanical and manual CPR; after that, we performed a new SR of the original studies that were not included after the last published SR to provide a panoramic view of the existing evidence on the effectiveness of CPR methods.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline were searched, including English in-hospital (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) SRs, and comparing mechanical versus manual CPR. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) and GRADE were used to assess the quality of included SRs/studies. We included both IHCA and OHCA, which compared mechanical and manual CPR. We analyzed at least one of the outcomes of interest, including ROSC, survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, 30-day survival, and survival to hospital discharge with good neurological function. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed for age, gender, initial rhythm, arrest location, and type of CPR devices.

Results

We identified 249 potentially relevant records, of which 238 were excluded. Eleven SRs were analyzed in the Umbrella review (January 2014–March 2022). Furthermore, for a new, additional SR, we identified eight eligible studies (not included in any prior SR) for an in-depth analysis between April 1, 2021, and February 15, 2024. The higher chances of using mechanical CPR for male patients were significantly observed in three studies. Two studies showed that younger patients received more mechanical treatment than older patients. However, studies did not comment on the outcomes based on the patient's gender or age. Most SRs and studies were of low to moderate quality. The pooled findings did not show the superiority of mechanical compared to manual CPR except in a few selected subgroups.

Conclusions

Given the significant heterogeneity and methodological limitations of the included studies and SRs, our findings do not provide definitive evidence to support the superiority of mechanical CPR over manual CPR. However, mechanical CPR can serve better where high-quality manual CPR cannot be performed in selected situations.

### Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: recent advances in resuscitation and effects on outcome [^111WoJyx]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Successful treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains an unmet health need. Key elements of treatment comprise early recognition of cardiac arrest, prompt and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), effective defibrillation strategies and organised post-resuscitation care. The initiation of bystander CPR followed by a prompt emergency response that delivers high quality CPR is critical to outcomes. The integration of additional tasks such as defibrillation, airway management, vascular access and drug administration should avoid interruptions in chest compressions. Evidence for the routine use of CPR prompt/feedback devices, mechanical chest compression devices and pharmacological therapy is limited.

### Manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation versus CPR including a Mechanical chest compression device in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a comprehensive meta-analysis from randomized and observational studies [^112NxJ23]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Mechanical chest compression devices have been developed to facilitate continuous delivery of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Despite promising hemodynamic data, evidence on clinical outcomes remains inconclusive. With the completion of 3 randomized controlled trials, we conduct a meta-analysis on the effect of in-field mechanical versus manual CPR on clinical outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

With a systematic search (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries), we identified all eligible studies (randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies) that compared a CPR strategy including an automated mechanical chest compression device with a strategy of manual CPR only. Outcome variables were survival to hospital admission, survival to discharge, and favorable neurologic outcome.

Results

Twenty studies (n = 21,363) were analyzed: 5 randomized controlled trials and 15 nonrandomized studies, pooled separately. For survival to admission, the pooled estimate of the randomized controlled trials did not indicate a difference (odds ratio 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.05; p = 0.24) between mechanical and manual CPR. In contrast, meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies demonstrated a benefit in favor of mechanical CPR (odds ratio 1.42; 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.67; P < .001). No interaction was found between the endorsed CPR guidelines (2000 versus 2005) and the CPR strategy (P = 0.27). Survival to discharge and neurologic outcome did not differ between strategies.

Conclusion

Although there are lower-quality, observational data that suggest that mechanical CPR used at the rescuer's discretion could improve survival to hospital admission, the cumulative high-quality randomized evidence does not support a routine strategy of mechanical CPR to improve survival or neurologic outcome. These findings are irrespective of the endorsed CPR guidelines during the study periods.

### Mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation and hospital survival among adult patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest attending the emergency department: a prospective, multicenter, observational study in Japan (SOS-KANTO [survey of survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in kanto area] 2012 study) [^113K4mGJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death. 1 There are almost 424 000 cases of emergency medical service (EMS)–assessed OHCA each year in the United States, 1 300 000 in Europe, 2 100 000 in Japan, 3 and upwards of 3.7 million worldwide. 4 The achievement of a successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) depends on a chain of survival, including the recognition of early signs of cardiac arrest and the provision of early and high‐quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 5 Several studies have shown that the high‐quality CPR improves the survival rate and the neurological outcome of patients experiencing nontraumatic OHCA. 6, 7, 8

Most mechanical CPR (mCPR) devices have been proposed to provide compressions of an appropriate depth and frequency for long periods without interruption or fatigue. The use of mCPR devices during CPR has become more widespread and allows for constant chest compressions to be performed during transportation from the scene of cardiac arrest to the hospital. 9 However, the evidence to support or refute the use of mCPR devices during the transfer of patients with OHCA to the hospital is insufficient to support that it achieves high‐quality CPR. 9, 10

Besides the mCPR in the prehospital setting, the use of mCPR for patients with OHCA attending the emergency department (ED) has also become more widespread in Japan. Although there is no randomized clinical trial or large‐cohort study to determine the effectiveness of mCPR in the ED on the clinical outcomes of patients with OHCA in comparison to manual CPR, it is conceivable that the shortcomings of manual CPR can be overcome by mCPR devices, which can help minimize interruptions in chest compressions during CPR and reduce the demands on medical staff in the ED. However, the frequency of real‐world use and the beneficial effect of mCPR in the ED on clinical outcomes in cases of adult nontraumatic OHCA are still unknown.

The objective of this study was to determine the association between the mCPR for the resuscitation of adult patients with nontraumatic OHCA in the ED and the clinical outcomes using the database from a large, prospective, multicenter cohort of patients with OHCA in the Kanto area of Japan.

Even the best conventional manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is highly inefficient, producing only a fraction of normal cardiac output. Over the past several decades, many therapeutic devices have been designed to improve on conventional CPR during cardiac arrest and increase the probability of survival. This article reviews several adjuncts and mechanical alternatives to conventional CPR for use during cardiac arrest. Recent clinical studies comparing conventional resuscitation techniques with the use of devices during cardiac arrest are reviewed, with a focus on clinical implications and directions for future research.

### In-depth extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114jLvGn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

While some systematic reviews and meta‐analyses suggested that E‐CPR may improve survival or neurological outcome 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 the most recent and comprehensive systematic review from Holmberg et al 14 yielded mixed results. This review included 12 studies on adult OHCA reporting survival to discharge. Of these, 7 showed higher odds of survival with E‐CPR versus C‐CPR, while 5 showed lower odds. Among 8 studies reporting survival with good neurological outcome, 7 favored E‐CPR. A meta‐analysis was not performed because of high study heterogeneity.

All systematic reviews of E‐CPR have rated the quality of evidence as very low. The inability of the available reviews to draw consistent strong conclusions on E‐CPR for OHCA is a direct result of significant limitations of the individual studies reviewed. Most reviewed studies were small, single‐center, and from diverse locations with different EMS systems, all of which limit the quality of the comparative data. Furthermore, inclusion criteria for E‐CPR differ between studies, and other unmeasured confounders may limit the internal and external validity of results. Finally, several E‐CPR studies have assessed a bundle of care that includes expedited transport to hospital, mechanical CPR, and immediate coronary angiography. While these have not been shown to be convincingly beneficial in their respective own right, 37, 38, 39 it is possible that a whole E‐CPR "bundle" contributes more to outcomes than E‐CPR in isolation.

Based on the low quality of the current E‐CPR literature, in its recent Focused Update on Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support, 40 the American Heart Association concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of E‐CPR but that it should be considered as rescue therapy for selected patients when it can be rapidly implemented and supported by skilled providers (class 2b, level of evidence C).

### A meta-analysis of the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^115T5ciF]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Two independent researchers collected the data from the included studies that were needed to perform a meta-analysis. If the evaluators had different opinions, they resolved the discrepancies by discussion or, if necessary, by sending the data to be evaluated by a third investigator. The outcome indicators were as follows: the primary outcome was the ROSC rate, and the secondary outcome indicators were the rate of survival to hospital admission, the rate of survival to discharge, and the neurological function score. Neurological function scores were assessed using levels 1 and 2 of the Glasgow-Pittsburgh CPC scale. The CPC score mainly revealed the patients' neurological function at discharge.

Literature quality evaluation

The study included RCTs and cohort studies. The quality of the included studies was independently evaluated by two authors according to the Cochrane Quality Rating Scale and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). This study used the Cochrane scale to evaluate the RCTs; the Cochrane scale assesses the generation of random sequences, randomized concealment, blinding, and the description of outcomes. The NOS scale was used for the cohort studies; it includes the selection of the cohort, the comparability between groups, and the results and yields a possible score of 9 points.

Data analysis

Meta-analysis of the data was performed using Review Manager 5.3, and the χ² test and the I² heterogeneity test were applied. I² was used to test the heterogeneity between the included studies. Study heterogeneity was measured using the χ² and I² statistics, with χ² P < 0.05 and I² ≥ 50% indicating heterogeneity. According to the Cochrane systematic review mentioned in the Cochrane Handbook, as long as I² is no more than 50%, the heterogeneity is acceptable. Considering the between-study heterogeneity, a "random effects" meta-analytical technique was applied, resulting in a more conservatively calculated OR than that obtained with a fixed effects model. The count data are described as the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). A funnel plot was used to analyze publication bias.

### Mechanical versus manual chest compressions for cardiac arrest [^113HdrWr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Mechanical chest compression devices have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of mechanical chest compressions versus standard manual chest compressions with respect to neurologically intact survival in patients who suffer cardiac arrest.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation abstracts, Biotechnology and Bioengineering abstracts and Clinicaltrials.gov in November 2009. No language restrictions were applied. Experts in the field of mechanical chest compression devices and manufacturers were contacted.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs and quasi-randomised studies comparing mechanical chest compressions to manual chest compressions during CPR for patients with atraumatic cardiac arrest.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (SCB and LJM) abstracted data independently. Disagreement between reviewers was resolved by consensus and a third author (BB) if consensus could not be reached. The methodologies of selected studies were evaluated for risk of bias by a single author (SCB). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic outcome. We used the DerSimonian & Laird method (random-effects model) to provide a pooled estimate for relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Four trials, including data from 868 patients, were included in the review. The overall quality of included studies was poor and significant clinical heterogeneity was observed. Only one study (N = 767) reported survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function (as defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2), demonstrating reduced survival with mechanical chest compressions when compared with manual chest compressions (RR 0.41 (95% CI 0.21–0.79). Data from other studies included in this review were used to calculate relative risks for having a return of spontaneous circulation (2 studies, N = 51, pooled RR 2.81, 95% CI 0.96 to 8.22) and survival to hospital admission (1 study, N = 17, RR 4.13, 95% CI 0.19 to 88.71) in patients who received mechanical chest compressions versus those who received manual chest compressions.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from human RCTs to conclude that mechanical chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardiac arrest is associated with benefit or harm. Widespread use of mechanical devices for chest compressions during cardiac is not supported by this review. More RCTs that measure and account for CPR process in both arms are needed to clarify the potential benefit from this intervention.

### Use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2010–2016 [^116doThq]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) devices came to market in the mid-1960s as a tool to provide consistent chest compressions during treatment for cardiac arrest. Although initial mechanical CPR devices were often cumbersome, later generations of devices slowly became portable and suitable for use outside of hospital settings. With this evolution, between 1976 and 2018, approximately 40 models of mechanical CPR devices were cleared for use by the US Food and Drug Administration through the 510(k) premarket notification pathway.

Despite the proliferation of these devices over time, there remains limited evidence supporting their use during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Randomized clinical trials focused on clinical outcomes have yet to demonstrate benefit when compared with manual CPR. Neither the PARAMEDIC (Prehospital Randomized Assessment of Mechanical Compression Device in Cardiac Arrest)trial nor the CIRC (Circulation Improving Resuscitation Care)trial, each testing different manual CPR devices among thousands of patients, found any significant differences in survival to discharge or 30-day survival between patients who received mechanical CPR and manual CPR. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis found similar results, determining there to be no significant difference in outcomes among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between those who received mechanical CPR and those who received manual CPR. Using the PARAMEDIC data, investigators also concluded that mechanical CPR was not cost-effective, demonstrating that those treated with the LUCAS 2 (Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System 2) mechanical CPR device experienced poorer health outcomes as measured by lower quality-adjusted life-years as well as higher health and social costs compared with those treated with manual CPR. However, data from a statewide, prospectively collected cardiac arrest registry did provide some suggestion of clinical benefit associated with mechanical CPR devices.

Despite the lack of evidence that mechanical CPR devices improve clinically meaningful outcomes among patients, there are anecdotal reports suggesting that their use is increasing among emergency medical services (EMS) professionals for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. If true, such an increase would be particularly worrisome not only because of the uncertainty of clinical benefit associated with device use, but also because of the devices' known significant costs; mechanical CPR devices are often priced higher than $10 000 per unit. Accordingly, our objectives were to characterize recent trends in mechanical CPR device use for patients identified with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by prehospital EMS professionals and to determine whether patient characteristics and geographical location were associated with use.

### A meta-analysis of the resuscitative effects of mechanical and manual chest compression in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^114yWTiA]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Literature search

From the databases, 1841 related documents were identified; 820 articles were repeats, and 971 articles were excluded after reading the titles and abstracts. Two authors read the full texts of 50 articles, and 15 studies were finally included in the analysis. The screening process is shown in Fig. 1.

Document quality assessment and data extraction

The basic information for the 15 studies included the year of publication, authors' names, country, and type of mechanical compression examined. The relevant physiological indexes and prognostic indexes included the ROSC rate, the rate of survival to hospital admission, the rate of survival to discharge, and the CPC score. Two authors read 15 articles (104,715 cases, including 78,157 in the manual compression group and 26,558 in the mechanical compression group) and summarized the quality and specific characteristics of these articles (Tables 1, 2, and 3).

### Advanced life support: 2025 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation consensus on science with treatment recommendations [^115bgpV3]. Resuscitation (2025). Medium credibility.

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation conducts continuous reviews of new, peer-reviewed published cardiopulmonary resuscitation science and publishes more comprehensive reviews every 5 years. The Advanced Life Support Task Force chapter of the 2025 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation Consensus on Science With Treatment Recommendations addresses all resuscitation evidence reviewed by the task force in the past year, as well as brief summaries of topics reviewed since 2020, to provide a comprehensive update. Newly updated topics this year include defibrillator pad placement, mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices, mechanical circulatory support after return of spontaneous circulation, intravenous versus intraosseous access, vasopressor choice and hemodynamic targets after return of spontaneous circulation, treatment of cardiac arrest related to hyperkalemia and opioid toxicity, and neuroprotective drugs, among others. Task Force members have assessed, discussed, and debated the certainty of the evidence based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, and their statements include consensus treatment recommendations. Insights into the deliberations of the task force are provided in the Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights sections. In addition, the task force lists priority knowledge gaps for further research.

### ILCOR scientific knowledge gaps and clinical research priorities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care: a consensus statement [^1112nZSN]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Epinephrine during cardiac arrest — knowledge gaps include the dose and timing of epinephrine administration, and an ongoing randomized out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) trial in the United Kingdom (PARAMEDIC-2) comparing epinephrine (adrenaline) versus placebo aims to clarify outcomes; until high-quality, well-powered placebo-controlled trials are completed, studies of dose response and timing are of lower priority except as a third arm embedded in an epinephrine versus placebo trial.

### Mechanical versus manual chest compressions in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a meta-analysis [^111xq86e]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of literature examining rates of return of spontaneous circulation from load-distributing band and piston-driven chest compression devices as compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, the ClinicalTrials.gov registry, and bibliographies on manufacturer websites for studies written in English.

Study Selection

Selection criteria for the meta-analysis required that studies must be human controlled (randomized, historical, or case-control) investigations with confirmed out-of-hospital cases.

Data Extraction

A total of 12 studies (load-distributing band cardiopulmonary resuscitation versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation = 8, piston-driven cardiopulmonary resuscitation versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation = 4), comprising a total of 6,538 subjects with 1,824 return of spontaneous circulation events, met the selection criteria.

Data Synthesis

Random effects models were used to assess the relative effect of treatments on return of spontaneous circulation. Compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, load-distributing band cardiopulmonary resuscitation had significantly greater odds of return of spontaneous circulation (odds ratio, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.36, 1.92], p < 0.001). The treatment effect for piston-driven cardiopulmonary resuscitation was similar to manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (odds ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.92, 1.68]; p = 0.151). The corresponding difference in percentages of return of spontaneous circulation rates from cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 8.3% for load-distributing band cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 5.2% for piston-driven cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Compared with manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation, combining both mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices produced a significant treatment effect in favor of higher odds of return of spontaneous circulation with mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices (odds ratio, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.32, 1.78], p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The ability to achieve return of spontaneous circulation with mechanical chest compression devices is significantly improved when compared with manual chest compressions. In the case of load-distributing band cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it was superior to manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation as the odds of return of spontaneous circulation were over 1.6 times greater. The robustness of these findings should be tested in large randomized clinical trials.

### Mechanical CPR: who? When? How? [^115UwiXq]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

In cardiac arrest, high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a key determinant of patient survival. However, delivery of effective chest compressions is often inconsistent, subject to fatigue and practically challenging.

Mechanical CPR devices provide an automated way to deliver high-quality CPR. However, large randomised controlled trials of the routine use of mechanical devices in the out-of-hospital setting have found no evidence of improved patient outcome in patients treated with mechanical CPR, compared with manual CPR. The limited data on use during in-hospital cardiac arrest provides preliminary data supporting use of mechanical devices, but this needs to be robustly tested in randomised controlled trials.

In situations where high-quality manual chest compressions cannot be safely delivered, the use of a mechanical device may be a reasonable clinical approach. Examples of such situations include ambulance transportation, primary percutaneous coronary intervention, as a bridge to extracorporeal CPR and to facilitate uncontrolled organ donation after circulatory death.

The precise time point during a cardiac arrest at which to deploy a mechanical device is uncertain, particularly in patients presenting in a shockable rhythm. The deployment process requires interruptions in chest compression, which may be harmful if the pause is prolonged. It is recommended that use of mechanical devices should occur only in systems where quality assurance mechanisms are in place to monitor and manage pauses associated with deployment.

In summary, mechanical CPR devices may provide a useful adjunct to standard treatment in specific situations, but current evidence does not support their routine use.

### Mechanical versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): an umbrella review of contemporary systematic reviews and more [^112yVoYe]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

We pooled the data irrespective of the type of devices (e.g. LUCAS or AutoPulse) or their updated versions, the design of the studies included (RCTs or non-RCTs), and whether they were used for in-hospital or OHCA cases, which can lead to clinical heterogeneity. Due to the nature of the intervention, no care providers were blinded by the individual RCTs. There was an overlapping of studies included in the umbrella review, which might influence the overall conclusion driven by these SRs and limited us to attempting an overall meta-analysis for the UR. However, after removing the duplicated and outliers' studies used in the UR, we showed the pooled effect for some of the outcomes of interest. We did not consider the use of mechanical CPR in exceptional circumstances as an objective of our study. We also did not conduct an analysis based on the etiology of cardiac arrest due to the unavailability of data from the SRs that focused on outcomes. Future research should prioritize investigating the impact of mechanical versus manual CPR across different etiologies of cardiac arrest to provide more nuanced insights into optimal resuscitation strategies for specific patient populations. Even though we analyzed how mechanical CPR devices were used differently according to age and gender, we could not conduct the same for the UR due to the unavailability of the data and the fact that CPR outcomes were not based on age or gender. The latter observation needs more investigation to address the efficacy of either model of CPR on the outcomes based on gender and age. In umbrella reviews, the quality of each SR remains a challenge. However, the current analysis meticulously addresses this issue and adds a new, up-to-date SR. Lastly, the GRADE assessment was not applied to the survival to hospital admission outcome as it was only reported in one study in the new systematic review. In addition, we don't address whether these resuscitation outcomes were applied to shockable or non-shockable scenarios in some studies/SR and whether they were randomized/distributed equally between the groups. These studies did not have a well-described indication or protocol for using mechanical over manual CPR.

### Mechanical versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): an umbrella review of contemporary systematic reviews and more [^116a1gzJ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

However, one study described the potential benefit of using mechanical CPR during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to manual CPR while wearing personal protective equipment. The study did not find significant differences between the two methods concerning survival and neurological outcomes; however, the authors did not comment on the team and patients' safety among the two methods of CPR. Mechanical CPR can play a role in countries where an ambulance has to ride long distances before it reaches a hospital. Although an umbrella review acts as a bird's-eye view, saves research resources, identifies SR gaps, informs future research recommendations, and compares evidence between interventions and associations, it still suffers from the primary studies' quality problems and unsolved biases. After writing and submitting this UR, one SR on the manual vs mechanical CPR during OHCA was published after February 15, 2024. This SR showed no significant differences between the two types of CPR concerning the ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and 24-h, and 30-day survival. However, the poorer neurological outcome was more evident after the mechanical CPR.

### Mechanical versus manual chest compression for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC): a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial [^112n4m9e]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Mechanical chest compression devices have the potential to help maintain high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but despite their increasing use, little evidence exists for their effectiveness. We aimed to study whether the introduction of LUCAS-2 mechanical CPR into front-line emergency response vehicles would improve survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

The pre-hospital randomised assessment of a mechanical compression device in cardiac arrest (PARAMEDIC) trial was a pragmatic, cluster-randomised open-label trial including adults with non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from four UK Ambulance Services (West Midlands, North East England, Wales, South Central). 91 urban and semi-urban ambulance stations were selected for participation. Clusters were ambulance service vehicles, which were randomly assigned (1:2) to LUCAS-2 or manual CPR. Patients received LUCAS-2 mechanical chest compression or manual chest compressions according to the first trial vehicle to arrive on scene. The primary outcome was survival at 30 days following cardiac arrest and was analysed by intention to treat. Ambulance dispatch staff and those collecting the primary outcome were masked to treatment allocation. Masking of the ambulance staff who delivered the interventions and reported initial response to treatment was not possible. The study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN08233942.

Findings

We enrolled 4471 eligible patients (1652 assigned to the LUCAS-2 group, 2819 assigned to the control group) between April 15, 2010 and June 10, 2013. 985 (60%) patients in the LUCAS-2 group received mechanical chest compression, and 11 (< 1%) patients in the control group received LUCAS-2. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 30 day survival was similar in the LUCAS-2 group (104 [6%] of 1652 patients) and in the manual CPR group (193 [7%] of 2819 patients; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.15). No serious adverse events were noted. Seven clinical adverse events were reported in the LUCAS-2 group (three patients with chest bruising, two with chest lacerations, and two with blood in mouth). 15 device incidents occurred during operational use. No adverse or serious adverse events were reported in the manual group.

Interpretation

We noted no evidence of improvement in 30 day survival with LUCAS-2 compared with manual compressions. On the basis of ours and other recent randomised trials, widespread adoption of mechanical CPR devices for routine use does not improve survival.

### Mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation during in-hospital cardiac arrest [^115macYd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In‐hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) strikes ≈300 000 hospitalized patients every year in the United States alone. High‐quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a critical component of IHCA resuscitation care and is associated with higher rates of survival and reduced neurocognitive disability. As such, optimizing the quality of CPR during IHCA is a key priority emphasized in scientific statements from the American Heart Association and international cardiac arrest guidelines. Despite these educational efforts, studies have shown that CPR quality during IHCA remains suboptimal, likely because of a range of factors including rescuer fatigue during prolonged resuscitation; interruptions in CPR during defibrillation, intubation, and other intra‐arrest interventions; and inadequate depth and rate of chest compressions.

In contrast to conventional delivery of manual CPR, mechanical CPR devices represent a potentially appealing alternative as they can provide uninterrupted chest compressions at appropriate rate and depth and are not limited by human performance variability and fatigue. During prolonged resuscitation efforts, these devices can free team members for other tasks and potentially reduce room crowding. Currently available devices include the Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System (LUCAS, Stryker Medical, Kalamazoo, MI), the Autopulse (ZOLL Medical Corporation, Chelmsford, MA), and the Thumper (Michigan Instruments, Grand Rapids, MI). These devices use a piston, band, or vest to externally compress the thoracic cavity. However, the use of these devices is not without disadvantages, including the need to pause CPR for device deployment and a risk of traumatic injuries from the devices themselves. The majority of high‐quality studies comparing mechanical CPR to manual CPR have been performed in the setting of out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and have not found a benefit of mechanical CPR over manual CPR. The data comparing the effectiveness of mechanical CPR devices in IHCA are much more limited (Table 1). In the absence of robust clinical trial data, members of hospital cardiac arrest committees must weigh the risks, benefits, and costs of whether, how, and when to integrate these technologies into their IHCA response. Given these data, the American Heart Association states that "the use of mechanical CPR devices by trained personnel may be beneficial in settings where reliable, high‐quality manual compressions are not possible or may cause risk to personnel", but the guidelines do not give specific consideration for the use of mechanical CPR during IHCA. In this Perspective, we present a summary of current data on the use of mechanical CPR during IHCA to inform these decisions.

### In-depth extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^113Snrku]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR) for the treatment of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who do not respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR) has increased significantly in the past 10 years, in response to case reports and observational studies reporting encouraging results. However, no randomized controlled trials comparing E-CPR with conventional CPR have been published to date. The evidence from systematic reviews of the available observational studies is conflicting. The inclusion criteria for published E-CPR studies are variable, but most commonly include witnessed arrest, immediate bystander CPR, an initial shockable rhythm, and an estimated time from CPR start to establishment of E-CPR (low-flow time) of < 60 minutes. A shorter low-flow time has been consistently associated with improved survival. In an effort to reduce low-flow times, commencement of E-CPR in the prehospital setting has been reported and is currently under investigation. The provision of an E-CPR service, whether hospital based or prehospital, carries considerable cost and technical challenges. Despite increased adoption, many questions remain as to which patients will derive the most benefit from E-CPR, when and where to implement E-CPR, optimal post-arrest E-CPR care, and whether this complex invasive intervention is cost-effective. Results of ongoing trials are awaited to determine whether E-CPR improves survival when compared with conventional CPR.

### Mechanical CPR: who? When? How? [^116mtefD]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The PARAMEDIC study also collected cost-effectiveness and quality of life data following hospital discharge. The long-term (up to 12 months) outcome analysis found no clinically important differences between groups in relation to outcomes such as survival, neurological outcome, and quality of life at 3 months and 12 months, although the analysis was subject to a high risk of attrition bias. The cost-effectiveness analysis found that routine use of mechanical CPR devices in the out-of-hospital setting was not cost-effective.

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Gates et al. incorporated all five randomised controlled trials, as summarised in Table 1, with a total patient population of 12,206. The random-effects meta-analysis found that mechanical CPR was not superior to manual CPR, in relation to key outcomes such as return of spontaneous circulation (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85, 1.10), survival at hospital discharge/30 days (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77, 1.02), or good neurological outcome (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53, 1.11).

In summary, these data do not support the routine use of mechanical CPR in OHCA.

### Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardiac arrest: an updated systematic review [^115eUjbG]. Resuscitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To provide an updated systematic review on the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) compared with manual or mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation during cardiac arrest.

Methods

This was an update of a systematic review published in 2018. OVID Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized trials and observational studies between January 1, 2018, and June 21, 2022. The population included adults and children with out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest. Two investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data, and assessed bias. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE.

Results

The search identified 3 trials, 27 observational studies, and 6 cost-effectiveness studies. All trials included adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and were terminated before enrolling the intended number of subjects. One trial found a benefit of ECPR in survival and favorable neurological status, whereas two trials found no statistically significant differences in outcomes. There were 23 observational studies in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or in combination with in-hospital cardiac arrest, and 4 observational studies in children with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Results of individual studies were inconsistent, although many studies favored ECPR. The risk of bias was intermediate for trials and critical for observational studies. The certainty of evidence was very low to low. Study heterogeneity precluded meta-analyses. The cost-effectiveness varied depending on the setting and the analysis assumptions.

Conclusions

Recent randomized trials suggest potential benefit of ECPR, but the certainty of evidence remains low. It is unclear which patients might benefit from ECPR.

### Basic life support. CPR techniques and process [^114htkHq]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Evidence summary — delayed ventilation versus early ventilations in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest indicates limited direct data: a 2022 evidence update of a 2017 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) systematic review looked for studies of adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received chest compressions with delayed ventilation by emergency medical services compared with chest compressions with early ventilations, and identified a single observational study showing that the tidal volume generated with chest compressions alone (20 milliliters [mL]; interquartile range, 13 to 28 mL) is inadequate to provide adequate alveolar ventilation.

### Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation versus conventional CPR in cardiac arrest: an updated meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^11369Hg3]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) may reduce mortality and improve neurological outcomes in patients with cardiac arrest. We updated our existing meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis to further evaluate ECPR compared to conventional CPR (CCPR).

Methods

We searched three international databases from 1 January 2000 through 1 November 2023, for randomised controlled trials or propensity score matched studies (PSMs) comparing ECPR to CCPR in both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). We conducted an updated random-effects meta-analysis, with the primary outcome being in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included short- and long-term favourable neurological outcome and survival (30 days-1 year). We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to evaluate the required information size in the meta-analysis to detect a clinically relevant reduction in mortality.

Results

We included 13 studies with 14 pairwise comparisons (6336 ECPR and 7712 CCPR) in our updated meta-analysis. ECPR was associated with greater precision in reducing overall in-hospital mortality (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50–0.79, high certainty), to which the trial sequential analysis was concordant. The addition of recent studies revealed a newly significant decrease in mortality in OHCA (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45–0.84). Re-analysis of relevant secondary outcomes reaffirmed our initial findings of favourable short-term neurological outcomes and survival up to 30 days. Estimates for long-term neurological outcome and 90-day-1-year survival remained unchanged.

Conclusions

We found that ECPR reduces in-hospital mortality, improves neurological outcome, and 30-day survival. We additionally found a newly significant benefit in OHCA, suggesting that ECPR may be considered in both IHCA and OHCA.

### Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation versus conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in adults with cardiac arrest: a comparative meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^113tN4WV]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Although outcomes of patients after cardiac arrest remain poor, studies have suggested that extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) might improve survival and neurological outcomes. We aimed to investigate any potential benefits of using ECPR over conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CCPR) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA).

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from Jan 1, 2000, to April 1, 2023, for randomised controlled trials and propensity-score matched studies. We included studies comparing ECPR with CCPR in adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with OHCA and IHCA. We extracted data from published reports using a prespecified data extraction form. We did random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses and rated the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Developments, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. We rated the risk of bias of randomised controlled trials using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 2.0 tool, and that of observational studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included complications during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, short-term (from hospital discharge to 30 days after cardiac arrest) and long-term (≥ 90 days after cardiac arrest) survival with favourable neurological outcomes (defined as cerebral performance category scores 1 or 2), and survival at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after cardiac arrest. We also did trial sequential analyses to evaluate the required information sizes in the meta-analyses to detect clinically relevant reductions in mortality.

Findings

We included 11 studies (4595 patients receiving ECPR and 4597 patients receiving CCPR) in the meta-analysis. ECPR was associated with a significant reduction in overall in-hospital mortality (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51–0.87; p = 0.0034; high certainty), without evidence of publication bias (p egger = 0.19); the trial sequential analysis was concordant with the meta-analysis. When considering IHCA only, in-hospital mortality was lower in patients receiving ECPR than in those receiving CCPR (0.42, 0.25–0.70; p = 0.0009), whereas when considering OHCA only, no differences were found (0.76, 0.54–1.07; p = 0.12). Centre volume (ie, the number of ECPR runs done per year in each centre) was associated with reductions in odds of mortality (regression coefficient per doubling of centre volume -0.17, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.017; p = 0.030). ECPR was also associated with an increased rate of short-term (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.02–2.68; p = 0.042; moderate certainty) and long-term (2.04, 1.41–2.94; p = 0.0001; high certainty) survival with favourable neurological outcomes. Additionally, patients receiving ECPR had increased survival at 30-day (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.08–1.96; p = 0.015), 3-month (3.98, 1.12–14.16; p = 0.033), 6-month (1.87, 1.36–2.57; p = 0.0001), and 1-year (1.72, 1.52–1.95; p < 0.0001) follow-ups.

Interpretation

Compared with CCPR, ECPR reduced in-hospital mortality and improved long-term neurological outcomes and post-arrest survival, particularly in patients with IHCA. These findings suggest that ECPR could be considered for eligible patients with IHCA, although further research into patients with OHCA is warranted.

### Mechanical versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): an umbrella review of contemporary systematic reviews and more [^116wVDuN]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

GRADE assessment and outcomes of the new SR

The GRADE assessment revealed that overall confidence in the entire outcomes were very low (Table 12). We downgraded for risk of bias as most of the individual studies had low or moderate methodological quality. Inconsistency was downgraded due to the high heterogeneity and the non-consistent direction of effect. The indirectness was absent as all the studies directly compared manual and mechanical CPR. The wide confidence intervals of the odds ratio contributed to the imprecision, and publication bias was not observed (Fig. 5). None of the three rating up criteria of the GRADE tool were applicable to the studies included. The assessment of survival to hospital admission was reported only in one study; hence, it was excluded from calculating the certainty of evidence.

### Assessment of community interventions for bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116L5qUf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are community interventions aimed to improve bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation associated with outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the communities that received interventions?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 studies including 21 266 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests found that community interventions were associated with better out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rates; the difference for both outcomes was approximately 1.3-fold with vs without community interventions. Despite moderate to high interstudy heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses supported the main result.

Meaning

The results of this study suggest that community interventions may be associated with better rates of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and patient survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

### A randomized trial of continuous versus interrupted chest compressions in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: rationale for and design of the resuscitation outcomes consortium continuous chest compressions trial [^113c4RiU]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium is conducting a randomized trial comparing survival with hospital discharge after continuous chest compressions without interruption for ventilation versus currently recommended American Heart Association cardiopulmonary resuscitation with interrupted chest compressions in adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without obvious trauma or respiratory cause. Emergency medical services perform study cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 3 intervals of manual chest compressions (each ~2 minutes) or until restoration of spontaneous circulation. Patients randomized to the continuous chest compression intervention receive 200 chest compressions with positive pressure ventilations at a rate of 10/min without interruption in compressions. Those randomized to the interrupted chest compression study arm receive chest compressions interrupted for positive pressure ventilations at a compression:ventilation ratio of 30:2. In either group, each interval of compressions is followed by rhythm analysis and defibrillation as required. Insertion of an advanced airway is deferred for the first ≥ 6 minutes to reduce interruptions in either study arm. The study uses a cluster randomized design with every-6-month crossovers. The primary outcome is survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes are neurologically intact survival and adverse events. A maximum of 23,600 patients (11,800 per group) enrolled during the post-run-in phase of the study will provide ≥ 90% power to detect a relative change of 16% in the rate of survival to discharge, 8.1% to 9.4% with overall significance level of 0.05. If this trial demonstrates improved survival with either strategy, > 3,000 premature deaths from cardiac arrest would be averted annually.

### Chest-compression-only versus standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a meta-analysis [^115zYjhJ]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, dispatcher-assisted chest-compression-only bystander CPR might be superior to standard bystander CPR (chest compression plus rescue ventilation), but trial findings have not shown significantly improved outcomes. We aimed to establish the association of chest-compression-only CPR with survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

Medline and Embase were systematically reviewed for studies published between January, 1985, and August, 2010, in which chest-compression-only bystander CPR was compared with standard bystander CPR for adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In the primary meta-analysis, we included trials in which patients were randomly allocated to receive one of the two CPR techniques, according to dispatcher instructions; and in the secondary meta-analysis, we included observational cohort studies of chest-compression-only CPR. All studies had to supply survival data. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. A fixed-effects model was used for both meta-analyses because of an absence of heterogeneity among the studies (I² = 0%).

Findings

In the primary meta-analysis, pooled data from three randomised trials showed that chest-compression-only CPR was associated with improved chance of survival compared with standard CPR (14% [211/1500] vs 12% [178/1531]; risk ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.46). The absolute increase in survival was 2.4% (95% CI 0.1–4.9), and the number needed to treat was 41 (95% CI 20–1250). In the secondary meta-analysis of seven observational cohort studies, no difference was recorded between the two CPR techniques (8% [223/2731] vs 8% [863/11 152]; risk ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.83–1.11).

Interpretation

For adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, instructions to bystanders from emergency medical services dispatch should focus on chest-compression-only CPR.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

SYNTHESIS

Objective 1: Review the Current Science and Regulatory Issues Related to

Systematic Review

A search of Medline, Embase, and Evidence‐Based Medicine Reviews for randomized clinical trials and observational studies published before May 22, 2018, identified 25 observational studies pertaining to adult OHCA (15), adult in‐hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA; 7) and pediatric IHCA (3). The authors concluded that the studies had a critical risk of confounding potentially limiting internal validity, and the heterogeneity across studies precluded a meaningful meta‐analysis. The review illustrated the need for rigorous randomized clinical trials or alternative, minimizing bias to clarify the role of ECPR in cardiac arrest. Based on this review, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation currently suggests that ECPR may be considered as a rescue therapy for selected patients with cardiac arrest when conventional CPR is failing in settings in which ECPR can be implemented (weak recommendation, very‐low‐certainty evidence).

### Use of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation devices for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2010–2016 [^111zd6Zf]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a common scenario facing prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) professionals and nearly always involves either manual or mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Mechanical CPR devices are expensive and prior clinical trials have not provided evidence of benefit for patients when compared with manual CPR.

Objectives

To investigate the use of mechanical CPR in the prehospital setting and determine whether patient demographic characteristics or geographical location is associated with its use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed using the 2010 through 2016 National Emergency Medical Services Information System data. Participants included all patients identified by EMS professionals as having out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Use of CPR, categorized as manual or mechanical.

Results

From 2010 to 2016, 892 022 patients (38.6% female, 60.4% male, missing for 1%; mean [SD] age, 61.1 [20.5] years) with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were identified by EMS professionals. Overall, manual CPR was used for 618 171 patients (69.3%) and mechanical CPR was used for 45 493 patients (5.1%). The risk-standardized rate of mechanical CPR use, accounting for patient demographic and geographical characteristics, rose from 1.9% in 2010 to 8.0% in 2016 (P < .001). In multivariable analyses, use of mechanical CPR devices was increasingly likely over time among patients identified with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by EMS professionals, increasing from an adjusted odds ratio of 1.58 (95% CI, 1.42–1.77; P < .001) when comparing 2011 with 2010, to an adjusted odds ratio of 11.32 (95% CI, 10.22–12.54; P < .001) when comparing 2016 with 2010. In addition, several other patient demographic and geographical characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving mechanical CPR, including being 65 years or older, being male, being Hispanic, as well as receiving treatment in the Northeast Census Region, in a suburban location, or in a zip code with a median annual income greater than $20 000.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mechanical CPR device use increased more than 4-fold among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by EMS professionals. Given the high costs of mechanical CPR devices, better evidence is needed to determine whether these devices improve clinically meaningful outcomes for patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by prehospital EMS professionals to justify the significant increase in their use.

### Emergency medical service agency practices and cardiac arrest survival… [^1149JyZ7]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Which emergency medical services agency practices are associated with favorable neurological survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Findings This cohort study among 470 EMS agencies in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival for OHCA identified 7 practices related to training, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and transport that were associated with favorable neurological survival. Adoption of more than half of these practices was more common at EMS agencies in the highest quartile of favorable neurological survival vs agencies in the lowest quartile. Conclusions and Relevance In a national registry for OHCA, 7 practices associated with higher rates of favorable neurological survival were identified at EMS agencies. Given wide variability in neurological survival across EMS agencies, these findings provide initial insights into EMS practices associated with top-performing EMS agencies in OHCA survival.

Future studies are needed to validate these findings and identify best practices for EMS agencies. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize survey responses regarding CPR training of staff and data review and EMS agency management of OHCA in the field, respectively. Nearly all agencies reported using waveform capnography, 433 agencies reported use of trained emergency medical dispatchers, and 388 agencies reported using a mechanical CPR device for resuscitation in the field. Among the EMS agencies, a mean of 6. 8 hours of cardiac arrest training was provided to new employees during orientation. Although routine use of mechanical CPR by EMS has not been shown to improve OHCA survival in randomized clinical trials, 21, 22 we found that EMS agencies with higher survival rates were more likely to conduct training in the use of mechanical CPR devices at least annually.

This observation is important because incorrect use of mechanical CPR devices has been shown to lead to interruption in CPR and risk of serious visceral injuries and complications.
23. Differences were also noted in EMS agencies' approach to the management of cardiac arrest in the field. Agencies with the highest survival rates were more likely to use automated CPR feedback devices. By providing real-time feedback to chest compressors, these devices have been shown to improve CPR quality and minimize interruptions. 24, 25 Agencies with higher survival rates were also more likely to transport patients with OHCA to a cardiac arrest center or a STEMI center.

### Mechanical versus manual chest compressions for cardiac arrest [^114m2FWu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of the Cochrane review on mechanical chest compression devices published in 2011 (Brooks 2011). Mechanical chest compression devices have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of mechanical chest compressions versus standard manual chest compressions with respect to neurologically intact survival in patients who suffer cardiac arrest.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies (CENTRAL; 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 2013 January Week 1), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 January Week 2), Science Citation abstracts (1960 to 18 November 2009), Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to 11 January 2013) on Thomson Reuters Web of Science, biotechnology and bioengineering abstracts (1982 to 18 November 2009), conference proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to 11 January 2013) and clinicaltrials.gov (2 August 2013). We applied no language restrictions. Experts in the field of mechanical chest compression devices and manufacturers were contacted.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs and quasi-randomised studies comparing mechanical chest compressions versus manual chest compressions during CPR for patients with atraumatic cardiac arrest.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors abstracted data independently; disagreement between review authors was resolved by consensus and by a third review author if consensus could not be reached. The methodologies of selected studies were evaluated by a single author for risk of bias. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome. We planned to use RevMan 5 (Version 5.2. The Nordic Cochrane Centre) and the DerSimonian & Laird method (random-effects model) to provide a pooled estimate for risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), if data allowed.

Main Results

Two new studies were included in this update. Six trials in total, including data from 1166 participants, were included in the review. The overall quality of included studies was poor, and significant clinical heterogeneity was observed. Only one study (N = 767) reported survival to hospital discharge with good neurological function (defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of one or two), demonstrating reduced survival with mechanical chest compressions when compared with manual chest compressions (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79). Data from four studies demonstrated increased return of spontaneous circulation, and data from two studies demonstrated increased survival to hospital admission with mechanical chest compressions as compared with manual chest compressions, but none of the individual estimates reached statistical significance. Marked clinical heterogeneity between studies precluded any pooled estimates of effect.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from RCTs in humans is insufficient to conclude that mechanical chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardiac arrest are associated with benefit or harm. Widespread use of mechanical devices for chest compressions during cardiac events is not supported by this review. More RCTs that measure and account for the CPR process in both arms are needed to clarify the potential benefit to be derived from this intervention.

### Mechanical versus manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR): an umbrella review of contemporary systematic reviews and more [^113cRdJX]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Given the significant heterogeneity and methodological limitations, the pooled analysis of the UR and the new SR of the studies published after the last SR did not provide enough evidence to support a superiority of the mechanical CPR over manual CPR. Only a few low-quality SRs indicated a superiority over manual CPR, and none of the RCT subgroup analyses showed an improvement of outcomes. However, mechanical CPR could be an alternative in selected situations where manual CPR cannot be performed appropriately. High-quality, large-scale RCTs are required to support the UR findings and the SR sub-analyses.

### Advanced life support. CPR techniques and process [^116abLy4]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) — observational evidence and systematic review findings report that a 2021 consensus and review identified a single observational before-and-after clinical trial of 1,835 adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with evidence judged to be of very low certainty and at high risk of bias. A pit-crew approach interrupted manual compressions for no more than 5 seconds, and patients were gradually placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position at approximately 20 degrees after placement of the mechanical CPR device with simultaneous placement of an advanced airway connected to an impedance threshold device. Data analysis showed a higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) to hospital arrival with approximately 20 degree head-up CPR versus supine CPR (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.61–2.26; P < 0.001; ARR, 16.1%; 95% CI, 20.0%–12.2%, or 161 more patients out of 1000 survived with the intervention [95% CI, 109 more patients out of 1000 to 225 more patients out of 1000 survived with the intervention]). The trial authors reported that there were no problems or physical complications observed or reported with the head-up/torso-up positioning group and angled mechanical CPR (n = 1,489), and improvements in ROSC were reported across all subgroups for demographics, presenting rhythm and provision of bystander CPR.
