## Question

Can Sprintec be prescribed to a patient with a history of von Willebrand disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Sprintec (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), a combined hormonal contraceptive, can be prescribed safely for a patient with a history of von Willebrand disease, and what key risks and alternatives should be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical goals in vWD-related heavy menstrual bleeding and what the guidelines recommend. Then, I should verify how combined hormonal contraception affects von Willebrand factor levels and menstrual blood loss. Next, I will need to assess thrombotic risk with CHCs and how to handle thrombophilia or VTE family history. After that, I should consider alternative options such as levonorgestrel IUDs or tranexamic acid. Finally, I will synthesize counseling points and monitoring needs to ensure safe use and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the drug and the condition so I don't miss anything important. Sprintec contains norgestimate 0.25 mg and ethinyl estradiol 0.035 mg and is a combined oral contraceptive, with known class effects and adverse reactions described in the FDA labeling for norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol products [^1127k4Pg]. Heavy menstrual bleeding is very common in von Willebrand disease, which is the most prevalent inherited bleeding disorder; among women with heavy menstrual bleeding, the prevalence of vWD is roughly 15%, underscoring the importance of therapies that both provide contraception and reduce blood loss [^11798kDm].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline-recommended first-line therapies for vWD with heavy menstrual bleeding in patients who do not wish to conceive. The 2021 ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH guideline recommends either hormonal therapy (combined hormonal contraception or a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) or tranexamic acid, with desmopressin typically reserved for selected cases based on type/response and not as the default first-line for HMB control [^111YKKUM]. I should also remember to involve gynecology and hematology in shared decision-making and to correct iron deficiency, which the same guideline emphasizes [^114msFSa] [^111B2mQS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about estrogen's impact on vWF biology; I should check the data. A systematic review of controlled studies found that combined hormonal contraceptives did not significantly change VWF antigen, factor VIII, or ristocetin cofactor in most users; one small study showed a decrease, but overall there was no consistent detrimental effect, supporting that CHCs generally do not mask vWD or worsen the underlying defect when used during evaluation or treatment of HMB [^113KUiZr]. That means, practically, continuation of CHC during testing can be acceptable if diagnosis is suspected, which helps avoid rebound heavy bleeding during workup [^113KUiZr].

> Hmm, wait a minute — does CHC actually control bleeding in vWD, or am I overattributing? Although randomized trial data are limited, expert consensus and guideline recommendations endorse CHCs as a valid option to reduce menstrual blood loss in women with vWD who desire contraception; older gynecologic guidance also identified CHCs as a mainstay for HMB control in this setting, aligning with current hematology guidelines favoring CHC or LNG-IUS or tranexamic acid as first-line options [^111jiNpw] [^111YKKUM]. I should confirm that any persistent HMB despite therapy triggers a standard gynecologic assessment for structural causes like fibroids or polyps, per the ASH vWD guideline [^114PungM].

> I need to check thrombotic safety because CHCs increase VTE risk. The FDA notes that CHC use is associated with approximately 3–12 VTEs per 10,000 woman-years, with the highest risk in the first year of use or after a break of 4 or more weeks; risk factors include smoking, obesity, and a positive family history, and risk appears higher with certain non-oral systems at higher estrogen exposure, though the class effect applies broadly [^112XNT1y]. Professional guidance reiterates that, when CHCs are otherwise appropriate, any current formulation can be considered, but VTE risk counseling and risk-factor mitigation are essential [^116UCo8n].

> But wait, what if there is a family history of thrombosis — should I order thrombophilia testing before prescribing CHCs? The 2023 ASH thrombophilia guidance suggests testing if there is a family history of a known high-risk defect (antithrombin, protein C or protein S deficiency) and to avoid CHCs if such high-risk thrombophilia is present; in contrast, for low-risk familial defects like factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A, they advise against routine testing solely to guide CHC use [^112bQdBz] [^113EvMeh]. Hold on, I should verify I'm not implying vWD itself protects from VTE — no, it does not; vWD status does not obviate standard CHC VTE precautions, so individualized counseling remains necessary [^115vdsco].

> I initially thought desmopressin might be the preferred first-line for HMB control in vWD — wait, that's not correct for most who want contraception; the guideline prioritizes CHC/LNG-IUS or tranexamic acid for HMB, reserving desmopressin for selected types or situations, and I must remember desmopressin is contraindicated in type 2B vWD due to platelet aggregation and thrombocytopenia risk, which could paradoxically worsen outcomes [^111YKKUM] [^113xTLwi]. Let me also reconsider that even in candidates for desmopressin, a test dose and documented response are generally needed outside emergencies, aligning with best practice in vWD management [^111haTLj].

> Next, I should review practical use and side effects for Sprintec specifically so counseling is concrete. Daily administration at the same time improves contraceptive efficacy; early-cycle spotting and nausea commonly occur and often resolve with continued use, and clear missed-pill guidance helps reduce failure risk [^112DJoyB]. I need to ensure the patient has no contraindications such as acute or decompensated liver disease and to review class adverse reactions and rare serious events listed in norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol labeling, including mood changes, hypertension, and rare hepatic or thrombotic complications, before prescribing [^1145zW8v] [^1127k4Pg] [^116CFH8A].

> Let me consider alternatives in case estrogen-containing methods are not acceptable or if VTE risk is elevated. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is guideline-endorsed for vWD-related HMB and provides highly effective contraception with substantial reduction in menstrual blood loss; oral tranexamic acid during menses is another first-line option when contraception is not required or as adjunctive therapy, typically at 25 mg/kg (about 1000–1300 mg) three times daily for 10–14 days depending on flow, in shared decision-making with hematology and gynecology [^111YKKUM] [^112fMtB5]. If estrogen is to be avoided, progestin-only methods may be suitable depending on patient preference and bleeding pattern, while still observing general VTE considerations even if risk is lower than with CHCs [^115vdsco].

> I should double-check global care steps for vWD patients with HMB so we don't miss foundational measures. The vWD guideline advises a standard gynecologic assessment to exclude structural causes in those not responding to first-line therapy and emphasizes regular assessment and treatment of iron deficiency and anemia to improve outcomes and quality of life, which should proceed in parallel with contraceptive management [^114PungM] [^111B2mQS]. Ongoing multidisciplinary input is recommended, particularly when tailoring therapy to bleeding phenotype, comorbidities, and reproductive goals [^114msFSa].

> Bottom line, after verifying the evidence and safety considerations: Sprintec (a CHC) is a reasonable first-line option for a patient with vWD who desires contraception and reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding, provided there are no CHC contraindications and after counseling on VTE risk and mitigation; alternatives such as a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD or tranexamic acid should be discussed in shared decision-making, with hematology and gynecology collaboration and attention to iron deficiency and structural causes of bleeding as appropriate [^111YKKUM] [^112bQdBz] [^114PungM] [^111B2mQS] [^114msFSa].

Sprintec (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol) **can be used** in women with von Willebrand disease (VWD) to manage heavy menstrual bleeding [^111jiNpw], as combined hormonal contraception [^111YKKUM] is recommended for this purpose. However, **individualized risk assessment** is essential because CHCs [^112bQdBz] increase venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk [^115vdsco], especially in women with additional risk factors (e.g. obesity, smoking, thrombophilia) [^112XNT1y]. For women with high VTE risk or contraindications to estrogen, consider progestin-only methods or the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) [^114msFSa] [^114w8Er3]. Shared decision-making and close monitoring for bleeding or thrombotic events are recommended [^114msFSa].

## Clinical considerations for sprintec use in vwd

### Benefits

Key benefits include **menstrual control** — CHCs (including Sprintec) [^111YKKUM] are effective for heavy menstrual bleeding in VWD [^111jiNpw] — and **ovarian suppression**, as CHCs reduce hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, which are common in VWD [^113vZUEb].

---

### Risks

Key risks include **thrombotic risk** — CHCs increase VTE risk [^112bQdBz], particularly with additional factors such as obesity, smoking, or thrombophilia [^115vdsco] — and **bleeding risk**, as CHCs may cause breakthrough bleeding [^112DJoyB] [^111UaAUT], which can be problematic in VWD.

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

The ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH 2021 guidelines **recommend CHCs [^111YKKUM] or the LNG-IUS** for heavy menstrual bleeding in VWD, with individualized risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^114msFSa]. The **LNG-IUS is particularly effective** [^114w8Er3] and may be preferred for some patients [^114msFSa].

---

## Alternative contraceptive options

For women with VWD who have contraindications to estrogen or elevated thrombotic risk, **consider** the following:

- **Progestin-only methods**: Pills, injectables, or implants.
- **LNG-IUS**: Highly effective for bleeding control and contraception [^114msFSa] [^114w8Er3].
- **Non-hormonal methods**: Copper IUD or barrier methods.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring** is essential for women with VWD using Sprintec and should include [^114PungM]:

- **Bleeding assessment**: Track menstrual bleeding and breakthrough bleeding [^111B2mQS].
- **Thrombotic surveillance**: Monitor for VTE symptoms (leg swelling, pain, shortness of breath) [^115vdsco].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Periodic VWF and factor VIII levels as indicated [^11798kDm].

---

## Patient counseling

Counsel patients on the following:

- **Risks and benefits**: Discuss bleeding control and thrombotic risks [^115vdsco].
- **Adherence**: Emphasize consistent use to minimize breakthrough bleeding [^112DJoyB].
- **Warning signs**: Educate on symptoms of bleeding and thrombosis [^112bQdBz].

---

Sprintec can be used in women with VWD for menstrual bleeding control [^111YKKUM], but **requires individualized risk assessment**, shared decision-making, and close monitoring. Alternative options should be considered for those with higher thrombotic risk or estrogen contraindications [^114msFSa].

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol [^112bQdBz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate the use of CHCs. The risk of VTE may be greater with the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system in women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² compared to women with a lower BMI [see Contraindications (4)].

While the risk of VTE associated with the use of CHCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, especially during the postpartum period [see Figure 1]. The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 woman-years.

The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and when restarting hormonal contraception following a break of 4 weeks or longer. This initial higher risk declines during the first year; however, users of CHCs remain at an increased risk of VTE compared to non-users. Based on results from a few studies, there is evidence that this is also true for non-oral products. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to CHCs gradually disappears after CHC use is discontinued.

- **Figure 1 description**: Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs with a range of doses and routes of administration, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year…

### Recombinant von Willebrand factor prophylaxis in patients with severe von Willebrand disease: Phase 3 study results [^116VMiKp]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Treated spontaneous ABRs are explored for both the prior on-demand group and the switch group (FAS). Figures illustrate the proportion of patients in each bleeding category, both historically and on study, along with the mean (SD) and median (range) change from historical to on-study sABR through month 12. Historically, within the past 12 months, none of the patients in the prior on-demand group had a 0 or > 0 to 2 sABR.

Most patients (18/23) experienced 0 treated spontaneous bleeding episodes (BEs) while on rVWF prophylaxis through month 12. Of the 5 patients who did experience treated spontaneous BEs, 3 had reductions from their historical sABR, while 2 showed an increase from their historical sABR. Historical and on-study spontaneous BEs are detailed by patient in supplemental Figure 1. Most on-study treated spontaneous BEs in the 5 patients were mucosal bleeds and/or menorrhagia. Specifically, the prior on-demand group experienced 5 oral/other mucosal, 3 menorrhagia, and 1 other location bleeds. The switch group experienced 14 oral/other mucosal, 1 hemarthrosis, and 3 with unknown locations. There were no instances of muscle/soft tissue, skin, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, or body cavity bleeds, and no cases of hematuria.

- **rVWF prophylactic consumption**: Most patients (prior on-demand: 100%; switch: 80%) initiated a twice-weekly rVWF prophylaxis regimen. Three patients required ≥ 1 increase in their dosage regimen. One patient in the prior on-demand group transitioned from twice weekly to thrice weekly, and two patients in the switch group changed from twice weekly to either thrice weekly or every 3 days. The mean (SD) weight-adjusted weekly rVWF dose per patient was 98.6.

### Can von Willebrand disease be investigated on combined hormonal contraceptives [^113KUiZr]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to review the medical literature and determine whether testing for von Willebrand disease can be performed in adolescents using combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC). A literature review was conducted, searching Embase and Medline using the keywords "von Willebrand factor", "von Willebrand disease", "contraceptive agents", and "menorrhagia". Articles were included if they were controlled trials comparing a form of CHC versus a control group, and testing for von Willebrand factor was performed and reported.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome assessed was the impact of CHC on von Willebrand factor antigen. Secondary outcomes included effects on Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor activity, known as the Ristocetin cofactor.

- **Results**: Seven articles met the inclusion criteria. All seven assessed VWF Ag with CHC use. Six of the seven demonstrated no change, while one study by Gevers Leuven demonstrated a significant decrease after CHC use. Three studies measured Factor VIII and showed no significant change with use. One study by Kadir assessed the Ristocetin cofactor and also failed to demonstrate change on CHC.

- **Conclusion**: The literature suggests that adolescents assessed for menorrhagia and already on combined hormonal contraceptives can be tested for von Willebrand disease if this diagnosis is suspected by the physician. By allowing adolescents to remain on combined hormonal contraceptives during testing, the risk of resuming severe menorrhagia, which could result in admission and transfusion, is avoided.

### Gynecologic and obstetric management of women with von Willebrand disease: Summary of 3 systematic reviews of the literature [^111yYYHe]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

These systematic reviews (SRs) have several strengths: First, we conducted them according to rigorous methodological standards. Second, we used broad eligibility criteria to include any type of evidence that could be informative. For example, we included evidence from women with bleeding disorders other than von Willebrand disease (VWD), as well as study designs that are not considered optimal for making inferences about treatment effects, such as case series, when these were the only evidence available. Third, we conducted an explicit and transparent assessment of the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach and used this assessment to make conclusions that considered not only the effect estimates but also the certainty of the evidence.

Our SRs have limitations common to all SRs. Finding the relevant studies depends on the quality of the indexing process of the searched databases, and some of the studies included in the SRs were not indexed under the terms describing women with bleeding disorders used in our initial search strategy. Similarly, including studies depends on clear reporting in titles and abstracts, which was not the case for many of these studies. We overcame these limitations by maintaining close collaboration with the guideline panel members who were familiar with the literature and were able to point out studies that may be relevant but had not been originally found because of the limitations described herein. This way, we were certain to include all relevant evidence.

### Management of von Willebrand disease with a factor VIII-poor von Willebrand factor concentrate: Results from a prospective observational post-marketing study [^111AmuuT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). High credibility.

Seventy patients were treated for 676 minor bleeding episodes, of which 138 occurred in 17 children under 12 years. Most of these bleeding episodes were treated on an ambulatory basis. The median number of emergency department visits per episode for a given patient was 2.0, ranging from 1.0 to 12.4 in a patient with severe type 1 repeatedly treated for rehemarthrosis. The median daily dose administered was 49.8 VWF:RCo IU/kg (range 24–177 IU/kg). Factor VIII was co-administered at the first VWF injection in 55.9% of events and 56.9% for those occurring in patients with basal FVIII:C less than 20 IU/dL.

- **Long-term prophylaxis**: Long-term prophylaxis was initiated to prevent rebleeding episodes in 32 VWD patients, including five patients below 12 years of age. The most frequent reasons for long-term prophylaxis were the prevention of joint bleeding (43.8%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (40.6%), mainly concerning type 3 and type 2 VWD patients, respectively. Patients under long-term prophylaxis received 43.5 VWF:RCo IU/kg (median) per infusion administered approximately twice a week, more frequently in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with those with a history of joint bleeds (median 2.5 versus 1.9 infusions per week). Breakthrough bleeding occurred following 1.5% of prophylactic infusions and required additional treatment with Wilfactin. In the subgroup of patients with available data and treated for at least 12 months (n = 20), the median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was 1.0 (range 0.0 to 11.0). The highest ABR was due to the recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding in one patient with type 2A.

### Efficacy of the 1-year (13-cycle) segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system: Results of two multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trials [^1137ahnY]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

Our results raise the methodological issue of obtaining accurate reports about contraceptive use during clinical trials and in real-life settings. Women in these trials used paper diaries to record information required for calculating pregnancy rates, which did not reveal between-group differences in adherence and highlight the challenges that investigators must confront when trying to show product efficacy in clinical trials. Investigators need more innovative technologies and strategies for obtaining accurate information about participant motivation and behaviors in contraceptive trials, especially for user-controlled methods.

The strengths of this efficacy analysis are its large sample size, the two-study, multicentre, multicountry participant population, the frequency of pregnancy testing, and the ongoing follow-up and surveillance. Although 962 (42%) patients discontinued the study, this was expected, was taken into account when determining the sample size, and was similar to reports from other contraceptive clinical trials and real-world settings. A limitation of the study is possible under-reporting or inaccuracies in the participant-completed paper diaries for the use of the contraceptive vaginal system and back-up contraception. Another important limitation relates to the DSMB decision to limit enrolment of and discontinue from the study women with a BMI greater than 29.0 kg/m², which might influence the generalizability of the data such that additional research is warranted. Similarly, studies with women from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia might be warranted.

Regarding preventative measures for deep vein thrombosis, specifically with respect to thrombophilia testing before hormone therapy (combined oral contraceptives), the ASH 2023 guidelines recommend considering testing for known familial thrombophilia in females who have a family history of VTE and known antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency in the family (high-risk thrombophilia). It is advised to avoid using combined oral contraceptives in patients with high-risk thrombophilia.

### Von Willebrand factor levels in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11798kDm]. Blood Advances (2022). High credibility.

The reported prevalence of VWD is up to 1% in the general population based on epidemiologic studies, with a symptomatic prevalence of approximately 0.1% at the level of primary care. The prevalence of VWD is approximately 15% in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, making it the most common inherited bleeding disorder known in humans. VWD is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of VWF, a multimeric glycoprotein that binds platelets at sites of vascular injury and stabilizes circulating coagulation factor VIII (FVIII).

Patients with VWD can experience easy bruising, bleeding from the oral cavity, heavy menstrual bleeding, as well as bleeding after dental work, surgical procedures, and childbirth. Joint bleeding may also occur in more severe deficiency. These symptoms vary among patients with VWD, and the bleeding phenotype can fluctuate throughout the life of a patient with VWD, leading to the need for accurate diagnosis of VWD types and subtypes and individualized management plans. Different types and subtypes of VWD have been defined depending on the type of abnormality in VWF. A patient with partial quantitative deficiency in VWF would have type 1 VWD, whereas a patient with virtual absence of VWF would have type 3 VWD. Patients with type 2 VWD have qualitative abnormalities of VWF: type 2A is characterized by reduced or absent high molecular weight VWF, type 2B results from a gain of function in VWF that increases its affinity for platelets, type 2M is caused by reduced VWF interactions with platelets or collagen, and type 2N results from reduced binding of VWF to FVIII.

### Interaction between oral contraceptive use and coagulation factor levels in deep venous thrombosis [^116Ch45h]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis is a multicausal disease, indicating that multiple risk factors must be present to cause the disease. Oral contraceptive use increases the risk of venous thrombosis; however, not all women using oral contraceptives develop thrombosis, suggesting the likely presence of additional risk factors in patients. This study aimed to assess the joint effect of oral contraceptive use and the levels of procoagulant factors, specifically FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, FXIII, and fibrinogen. Data from premenopausal women were re-analyzed in the Leiden Thrombophilia Study.

- **Relative risks**: The highest relative risks were observed for the combination of oral contraceptive use and high levels (greater than the 90th percentile) of FII (Odds Ratio [OR] OC+FII 10.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5–29.0), FV (OR OC+FV 12.6; 95% CI 3.8–41.5), and FXI (OR OC+FXI 11.9; 95% CI 3.6–39.2).

### Efficacy of the 1-year (13-cycle) segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system: Results of two multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trials [^115TCiXw]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Participants were healthy, sexually active, non-pregnant, non-sterilised women aged 18–40 years, who did not intend to become pregnant over the next 13 months. Participants also had to have an intact uterus and both ovaries, and have a history of regular menstrual cycles that usually occurred every 28 days (± 7 days) when not using hormonal contraception. If post-partum or post-abortal, participants needed a history of regular menstrual cycles of 21–35 days and resumption of at least one cycle with a cycle length consistent with past cycles. They had to be willing to discontinue their contraceptive method to participate in the study and, in the opinion of the investigator, be able to comply with the protocol (e.g. live within the clinic catchment area or within a reasonable distance of the clinic).

Exclusion criteria included known hypersensitivity to oestrogens or progestins, known hypersensitivity to silicone rubber, known or suspected pregnancy, history of infertility of longer than one year in the woman or her male partner, history of vasectomy or sterility in the male partner, and tubal ligation (sterilisation) in women. Participants with undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding or undiagnosed vaginal discharge, lesions, or abnormalities were also excluded. Participants diagnosed at screening with a chlamydia or gonococcus infection could be included in the trial after treatment; partner treatment was also recommended. Investigators determined whether participants were at high risk for reinfection (e.g. because of multiple sex partners or an untreated partner) and whether such participants could be included.

Regarding preventative measures for deep vein thrombosis, and more specifically thrombophilia testing before hormone therapy (combined oral contraceptives), the ASH 2023 guidelines recommend avoiding testing for known familial thrombophilia to guide the use of combined oral contraceptives. This is especially relevant for females with a family history of VTE and known factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A in the family (low-risk thrombophilia).

### A 12-month clinical investigation with a 24-day regimen containing 15 microg ethinylestradiol plus 60 microg gestodene with respect to hemostasis and cycle control [^115KzFLW]. Contraception (2001). Low credibility.

The effects of a 24-day regimen containing 15 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) plus 60 microg gestodene on cycle control and hemostasis were evaluated in 58 healthy women aged 19–47 years. All participants received the pill for 12 months. Among them, 84.5% experienced withdrawal bleeding at every cycle during the tablet-free interval. The overall incidence of irregular bleeding was 19.3%.

Hemostasis was evaluated in 20 women. No changes were observed in plasma fibrinogen concentrations, nor in prothrombin fragment F1+2. A slight increase in thrombin-antithrombin III complexes was observed after 6 and 12 months of oral contraceptive use. Antithrombin III activity significantly increased after one year of pill intake. The concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor, both antigen and activity, did not change.

These results show that very low doses of EE, such as 15 microg, do not impair hemostasis in healthy females. However, the reduction of the EE dose is responsible for some of the effects on cycle control.

For patients with von Willebrand disease (vWD), particularly pregnant patients, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend specific management strategies. They advise that all women with type 2 and type 3 vWD, as well as women with type 1 vWD whose von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels are unlikely to normalize, should deliver in an obstetric unit. This unit should ensure close collaboration between hematology, obstetric, anesthetic, and neonatal teams and provide access to 24-hour monitoring of factor VIII and vWF levels.

### Use of contraceptive methods by women with current venous thrombosis on anticoagulant therapy: A systematic review [^114w8Er3]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

As nearly all women with venous thromboembolism (VTE) will be treated with anticoagulant therapy, it is important to consider how anticoagulation affects the safety of contraceptive use.

- **Study design**: We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of contraceptive methods in women with VTE on anticoagulant therapy. Due to the limited direct evidence that was identified, we expanded our search to include women on anticoagulant therapy for indications other than VTE and women with bleeding disorders.

- **Results**: Six articles met our inclusion criteria. Three observational studies found that the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNG-IUD) was an effective treatment for menorrhagia for women on anticoagulation therapy or with bleeding disorders. Prevention of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts was observed in women on chronic anticoagulation treated with depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in one small observational study. Among women with bleeding disorders, no complications were seen in 16 women with the placement of the LNG-IUD. One pharmacokinetic study found no statistically significant interaction between combined oral contraceptives and warfarin. Other than one case report, no evidence was found regarding the risk of thrombosis recurrence in women on anticoagulation therapy using a contraceptive method.

- **Conclusion**: The majority of studies in this review examined the treatment effects of the LNG-IUD or DMPA on complications of anticoagulation and found overall beneficial effects of their use in these circumstances.

### The von Willebrand disease prophylaxis network (vWD PN): exploring a treatment concept [^117R8xF1]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

The von Willebrand Disease Prophylactic Network (vWD PN) has been initiated to study the natural history of vWD bleeding and to prospectively examine the role of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) concentrate prophylaxis in vWD. Patients with all types of vWD who require treatment with vWF concentrate will be enrolled in the study. The quality of life will be measured, and safety and efficacy will be monitored at predetermined intervals.

Between February 2005 and July 18, 2005, 62 investigators from Europe and North America participated in the vWD PN; of these, 61 have submitted census data. A total of 5343 patients have been identified for enrollment, with 991 patients treated with plasma-derived products in the preceding 12 months. Out of these, 99 patients have received prophylaxis, predominantly for joint-related bleeds. The vWD PN aims to further elucidate the role of vWF concentrate prophylaxis in vWD and to identify patients most likely to benefit from prophylaxis.

### Mili [^112DJoyB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Mili (Norgestimate and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP 0.250 mg/0.035 mg) is an oral contraceptive. Here is some important information about taking Mili:

- **Instructions for use**: Take 1 pill every day at the same time, following the order directed on your blister pack. Do not skip pills, even if you do not have sex often. Missing pills or starting the pack late increases the risk of pregnancy. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. If you have trouble remembering to take Mili, consult your healthcare provider.

- **Spotting or light bleeding**: When you first start taking Mili, spotting or light bleeding between periods may occur. If this persists following a few months, contact your healthcare provider.

- **Nausea**: You may experience nausea, especially during the first few months of taking Mili. Do not stop taking the pill if you feel nauseous; the problem usually resolves itself. If the nausea persists, contact your healthcare provider.

- **Missed pills**: Missing pills can cause spotting or light bleeding, even if you take the missed pills later. On days when you take 2 pills to compensate for missed pills, you might feel slightly nauseous. Refer to "What should I do if I miss any Mili pills?" for guidance.

- **Missed periods**: Missing a period can occur. However, if you skip a period and have not followed Mili directions, miss two periods in a row, or suspect pregnancy, call your healthcare provider. A positive pregnancy test means you should stop taking Mili.

- **Vomiting or diarrhea**: If you experience vomiting or diarrhea within 3 to 4 hours of taking your pill, take another pill of the same dosage.

Contact your healthcare provider for any concerns or further advice regarding Mili usage.

### Efficacy of the 1-year (13-cycle) segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system: Results of two multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trials [^115hfzHb]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

An open-label, pharmacokinetic study of the segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system in 39 women verified rapid absorption of both steroids through the vaginal mucosa after insertion, with steady-state systemic levels of segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol achieved by day 4 of use. Mean serum segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol concentrations peak immediately after the first contraceptive vaginal system insertion in cycle 1 and decline rapidly to a steady state by 96 hours. Peak and steady-state levels fall modestly in subsequent cycles.

The segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system has several potential advantages for women across diverse settings. The cyclic regimen of 21 days in and 7 days out provides regular withdrawal bleeds, a pattern familiar to and desirable for many women. Using the same contraceptive vaginal system for thirteen 28-day cycles (1 year) enhances convenience and addresses a common access issue that can be a factor in unintended pregnancies — difficulties returning to health-care facilities or pharmacies for refills or new prescriptions for hormonal contraceptives requiring timely use. Additionally, the segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system does not require refrigeration before dispensing or during non-use, facilitating storage and distribution, an access element affecting providers and women across many regions.

Here, we present data from two 13-cycle, open-label trials designed to assess the contraceptive efficacy of the segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system.

### Prophylaxis escalation in severe von Willebrand disease: a prospective study from the von Willebrand disease prophylaxis network [^116pLYCT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of mucosal bleeding (epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and menorrhagia) and joint bleeding remains problematic in clinically severe von Willebrand disease (VWD). Patients are often unresponsive to treatment, such as desmopressin or antifibrinolytic therapy, and may require von Willebrand factor (VWF) replacement therapy. There are little data on the use of prophylaxis in VWD, and none have been applied in a prospective, treatment escalation design.

- **Objective**: Evaluate the effect of escalating dose prophylaxis in severe VWD.

- **Methods**: Patients eligible for enrollment in this prospective study included those with type 1 VWD with VWF activity-ristocetin cofactor ratio ≤ 20% and unresponsive to desmopressin, patients with type 2 VWD not responsive to desmopressin, and all subjects with type 2B and type 3 VWD. Entry criteria were strictly defined, as were therapy escalation parameters and clinical data collection.

- **Results**: Eleven subjects completed the study. Six had type 2A, and five had type 3 VWD. Six patients presented with epistaxis, three with GI bleeding, and two with joint bleeding. Seven had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of prophylaxis decreased the median annualized bleeding rate from 25 to 6.1 [95% confidence interval of the rate difference: -51.6 to -1.7], and the median annualized bleeding rate was even lower (4.0; 95% confidence interval: -57.5 to -5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level.

### Recombinant von Willebrand factor prophylaxis in patients with severe von Willebrand disease: Phase 3 study results [^1167ou9s]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

In patients previously receiving on-demand VWF treatment, the model-based mean sABR for treated bleeds was reduced by 91.5% (ratio, 0.085; 95% CI, 0.021–0.346) during the 12-month study period, relative to the mean historical sABR. Mean sABR for treated bleeds decreased from 6.54 (95% CI, 2.52–17.00) to 0.56 (95% CI, 0.15–2.05). In patients who switched from prior pdVWF prophylaxis to rVWF prophylaxis in this study, the model-based mean sABR for treated bleeds was reduced by 45% (ratio, 0.550; 95% CI, 0.086–3.523) from 0.51 (95% CI, 0.04–6.31) to 0.28 (95% CI, 0.02–3.85).

- **Primary efficacy analysis**: The observed reductions in sABR based on descriptive statistics were consistent with the model-based analysis of sABR. Median (range) change from historical to on-study (while on rVWF prophylaxis) sABR for treated bleeds was −3.0 (−155.0 to 2.8) in the prior on-demand group and 0 (−33.9 to 3.9) in the switch group. The proportions of patients with a treated sABR of 0 during rVWF prophylaxis (on-study through month 12) was 84.6% (11/13) in the prior on-demand group and 70.0% (7/10) in the switch group. In the prior on-demand group, 92.3% (12/13) of patients (95% CI, 64.0% to 99.8%) had a reduction of ≥ 25% in sABR during on-study rVWF prophylaxis (through month 12) relative to their historical sABR. In the switch group, 90% (9/10) of patients (95% CI, 55.5% to 99.7%) had an sABR during on-study rVWF prophylaxis that was not higher than their historical sABR.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^111haTLj]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Desmopressin is the most commonly used treatment option to increase VWF and FVIII levels in patients with mild or moderate VWD, achieved through the administration of desmopressin (1‐deamino‐8‐d‐arginine vasopressin, DDAVP). Desmopressin stimulates the release of endogenous VWF from the endothelium into the circulation. However, patients with type 3 VWD are unresponsive due to the lack of endogenous VWF, and only a limited number of severe type 1 and type 2 VWD patients can be treated with desmopressin.

In a large study on severe VWD patients with VWF levels below 10 IU/dL at the time of desmopressin administration, response to desmopressin was defined as an increase of plasma FVIII:C and VWF:RCo of at least threefold over baseline, levels of at least 30 IU/dL, and a bleeding time of 12 minutes or less two hours after the end of desmopressin infusion. Most type 1 patients did not respond. Furthermore, other factors, such as the type, pathophysiology, and genotype of VWD, influence the response to desmopressin.

Therefore, severe VWD type 1 and 2 patients without contraindications for desmopressin should receive a test dose of desmopressin (0.3 μg/kg intravenously) to evaluate whether they respond sufficiently. In severe VWD patients who respond well, treatment with desmopressin is often sufficient to manage minor bleeding and prevent bleeding during minor surgery or interventions. In cases of life-threatening bleeding or major surgery, VWF/FVIII concentrates are necessary.

### Oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy: How strong a risk factor for venous thromboembolism [^113N3ryE]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Exogenous hormone therapies, such as combined oral contraceptives (COC) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), cause blood hypercoagulability and are a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). There is controversy over how strong this "provoking" risk factor is and how other risk factors may synergize VTE risk. We aim to review the latest literature on the risk of initial and recurrent VTE with COC and HRT use to provide guidance for decision-making about the duration of anticoagulation and to guide future research efforts.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^111Pvx1t]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Although several studies have been performed on postpartum haemorrhage in VWD patients, the quality of those observational studies is low. It is generally accepted that no treatment is necessary if the levels of VWF and FVIII are greater than 50 iu/dl during the third trimester. Desmopressin can be administered in women with type 1 VWD who are known to have a good desmopressin response. We only administer desmopressin after clamping the umbilical cord to prevent severe hypotension in the mother, which can harm the unborn child.

There is still limited evidence for treatment recommendations using FVIII/VWF concentrates in pregnant VWD patients. In an observational study, no incidence of PPH was found in 17 type 1 VWD patients with VWF and FVIII levels greater than 50 iu/dl during the third trimester who did not receive prophylactic treatment. In 15 women (7 with type 1 and 8 with type 2) with a mean VWF:RCo of 34 (0–75) iu/dl during the third trimester who were prophylactically treated with factor concentrate during labour, only one patient with type 2B VWD experienced excessive bleeding. VWD women who were prophylactically treated with factor concentrates had, despite treatment, more blood loss compared to women without VWD and untreated type 1 VWD women.

Over 50% of type 1 and type 2 VWD patients with VWF levels less than 50 iu/dl in the third trimester experienced PPH, despite VWF concentrate treatment aiming for target levels of 100 iu/dl.

The ASH/ISTH/NHF/WFH 2021 guidelines make specific recommendations for managing von Willebrand disease in patients experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. These guidelines suggest obtaining a standard gynecologic assessment for patients with known bleeding disorders and heavy menstrual bleeding. This assessment is similar to that for patients in the general population with heavy menstrual bleeding to rule out common pelvic pathologies, such as fibroids and polyps. This is especially important for patients who do not respond to first-line therapy.

### Recombinant von Willebrand factor prophylaxis in patients with severe von Willebrand disease: Phase 3 study results [^111DX5hz]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

This study had several limitations. It was a nonrandomized, noncomparative trial involving a limited number of patients, although a justified and acceptable number by regulatory guidelines for this rare disease. Furthermore, differences between the data collection methods for historical BEs (i.e. retrospective extraction from medical records) and on-study BEs (i.e. prospective monitoring with an electronic patient diary) may have introduced bias and resulted in some data gaps. Historical BEs were included in the primary and secondary efficacy analyses if there was adequate evidence of a BE occurring and being treated with VWF infusions; however, the investigator assessment of hemostatic efficacy was not available for all historical BEs.

In summary, this prospective, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of rVWF prophylaxis in patients with severe VWD. In patients previously treated on-demand with VWF products, rVWF prophylaxis reduced the frequency of spontaneous BEs requiring VWF treatment. Furthermore, patients switching from prophylaxis with pdVWF to rVWF prophylaxis experienced a similar level of hemostatic control over spontaneous BEs, and a high proportion of patients in both groups had no treated spontaneous BEs during rVWF prophylaxis. The safety profile of rVWF observed in this study was consistent with the previously established safety profile, and no new adverse drug reactions were identified.

### Topics of interest in women with myeloproliferative neoplasms [^112U5mC5]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Issues in adolescent women with**:
	- Menstrual disorders and contraception, heavy menstrual bleeding may be the presenting sign of MPN, particularly ET, especially when accompanied by acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS). While it is recommended to obtain a formal assessment by a gynecologist, from a hematological standpoint, the management approach may include reducing the aspirin dose, administering low doses of clot-stabilizing drugs (e.g. tranexamic acid), or using a hormone-coated intrauterine device (IUD) such as Mirena. Consultations with female MPN patients of childbearing age should integrate discussions regarding forms of contraception and preconception planning.

- **Thrombotic risk and contraception**:
	- Of paramount and recurring concern is the potential thrombotic risk associated with contraceptive use. There is currently insufficient evidence to support a clear association between estrogen-based contraception and thrombosis in MPN, with a retrospective review disclosing that estrogen-based therapy appeared safe in ET outside the setting of the combined OC pill — the latter's use may be associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. It may therefore be reasonable to recommend avoidance of estrogen-based contraception in favor of alternatives — progesterone-only pill, implant, depot, IUD (e.g. Mirena), or barrier methods. Moreover, it is vital to discuss the potential teratogenic effect of cytoreductive therapy as well as requisite contraceptive measures as needed.

### The impact of a male or female thrombotic family history on contraceptive counseling: A cohort study [^114G8qnW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Essentials: It is unknown if a male or female thrombotic family history influences risk in female relatives. We assessed thrombotic risk in female relatives of male and female patients with thrombosis. A hormonally related female thrombotic family history further increases risk in female relatives. This information could be important in counseling women on contraceptive options.

Background: Women from thrombophilic families have increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which increases further during oral contraceptive (COC) use and pregnancy-postpartum. Whether this additional risk differs between relatives of male and female patients, or is different when that female patient had a hormonally related VTE (during COC use/pregnancy), is unknown.

Methods: One thousand and five female relatives of consecutive patients with VTE from a family-based cohort were retrospectively followed for incident VTE from ages 15 to 50, first VTE, or study inclusion. Absolute and relative VTE risks adjusted for factors of patients (sex, age) and relatives (thrombophilia, COC use, pregnancy) were estimated in relatives of female and male patients and in relatives of female patients with and without hormonally related VTE.

Results: Absolute risk in relatives of female (0.32 [95% confidence interval 0.23–0.43]) versus male patients (0.39 [95% CI 0.28–0.53]) was comparable. However, the heterogeneity analysis of risk estimates suggested that in relatives of female versus male patients…

### Diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease: Guidelines for primary care [^1143F86Z]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease is an inherited condition characterized by a deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which is essential in hemostasis. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has released new evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the disease. There are three major subtypes of von Willebrand disease, classified as partial quantitative deficiency (low levels) of von Willebrand factor (type 1), qualitative deficiency (type 2), or virtually complete deficiency (type 3).

Diagnosis is usually made by reviewing the patient's personal and family history of bleeding and by clinical evaluation for more common reasons for bleeding, supplemented with laboratory tests. Assessment may be used to determine bleeding risk before surgery and other invasive procedures, and to diagnose reasons for unexplained hemorrhaging. Von Willebrand factor levels of 30 IU per dL or lower are required for the definite diagnosis of inherited von Willebrand disease. Persons with levels of 30 to 50 IU per dL may not have the disease but may need agents to increase von Willebrand factor levels during invasive procedures or childbirth.

Treatment is tailored to the subtype of the disease: increasing plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor by releasing endogenous stores with desmopressin or replacing nonexistent or ineffective von Willebrand factor using human plasma-derived, viral-inactivated concentrates. Treatment is often combined with hemostatic agents that have mechanisms other than increasing von Willebrand factor. Regular prophylaxis is seldom required, and treatment continues as needed.

### Selection of contraceptive therapy for patients with thrombophilia: A review of the evidence [^116UCo8n]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

Awareness of the contributions of thrombophilia to thrombosis-related morbidity and mortality has been growing in the last few decades. Thrombophilia is especially concerning in females seeking contraception because some types of hormonal contraception have been associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Clinicians face a growing need for awareness of evidence-based contraception selection for this population.

- **Methods**: PubMed literature searches were conducted to provide a review of the literature describing contraceptive use in patients with thrombophilia. This review also describes contraceptive selection and counseling for this population.

- **Results**: Studies of combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use demonstrate a 2- to 50-fold increase in VTE in individuals with thrombophilia, depending on the type of thrombophilia and the reference group identified. Two small studies describing VTE incidence in progesterone-only contraceptive (POC) users with thrombophilia were identified, but they did not provide conclusive information regarding VTE risk in this population.

- **Conclusions**: POC may be recommended for contraception in patients with most thrombophilias, but studies should be undertaken to further define the safety of POC use in this population.

### Von Willebrand's disease and menorrhagia: Prevalence, diagnosis, and management [^114vb2VG]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

The reported prevalence of von Willebrand's disease (vWD) is increased in women with menorrhagia, with estimates ranging from 5% to 20%. The consistent results of multiple studies suggest that testing should be included in the evaluation of patients with menorrhagia, especially in unexplained cases and prior to surgical intervention. Although a cyclic variation in von Willebrand's factor levels has not been confirmed, several studies suggest lower levels during menses and the early follicular phase.

Menorrhagia is one of the most common bleeding manifestations of von Willebrand's disease, reported by 60–95% of women afflicted with this bleeding disorder. It is typically severe, often resulting in anemia and interfering with quality of life. Despite the frequency of menorrhagia, there is no consensus on optimal management. Although oral contraceptives are frequently prescribed, there are no studies confirming their efficacy using objective measures of response. Desmopressin was associated with an 80–92% response rate in several uncontrolled studies relying on patient assessment of efficacy. However, a small, randomized trial found no significant reduction in menstrual blood flow compared with placebo.

There are anecdotal reports of the successful use of antifibrinolytic agents alone and in combination with other therapies. There are no studies comparing the relative efficacy and safety of the available medical therapies for von Willebrand's disease-associated menorrhagia. Until these studies are completed, treatment should be individualized based on von Willebrand's disease characteristics.

### Diagnosis of von Willebrand disease [^1134Y5dm]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, resulting from a deficiency and/or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Since its first description 100 years ago, the diagnosis of VWD has evolved due to advancements in laboratory diagnostic tests and clinical guidelines and recommendations. There are three established diagnostic criteria for VWD: a personal history of excessive mucocutaneous bleeding, a family history of bleeding, and reduced VWF levels. Over the years, the diagnosis of VWD has been challenging due to a lack of consensus and barriers to achieving an accurate and timely diagnosis. In 2021, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines were developed. These guidelines have provided clarity and consensus, but challenges and opposing views continue to persist. Additionally, there remain barriers to achieving a diagnosis of VWD that need to be addressed.

Statistical analysis

Because no formal statistical tests were planned for this study, the sample size was not based on a power calculation for a significance test, but was driven mainly by the European Medicines Agency guideline on the clinical investigation of human pdVWF products. Approximately 22 adults were to be included in the study: ≥ 8 patients in each cohort and a total of ≥ 5 patients with type 3 VWD.

The safety analysis set comprised all patients who signed informed consent and received any amount of rVWF. The full analysis set, which was the primary analysis population for the efficacy outcome measures, comprised all patients who received rVWF prophylaxis. The PK/PD full analysis set included all patients who received ≥ 1 rVWF infusion and provided ≥ 1 quantifiable PK or PD measurement after administration for the PK or PD analysis.

The primary endpoint analysis provided an estimation of sABR through month 12. The mean and 95% Wald confidence interval (CI) for the historical and on-study sABRs and the ratio of the two sABRs (on-study/historical) were estimated within each group using a generalized linear mixed-effects model fitting a negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function. The number of unique BEs for each patient by observation period (historical or on-study) was a dependent variable, and the observation period (historical or on-study) an independent term. The model options included the logarithm of the observation period duration (in years) as an offset. Historical sABR was based on reliable medical records for BEs occurring within 12 months.

- **Increased risk of thrombosis in patients with von Willebrand's disease type IIB**: Use of desmopressin acetate in patients with Type IIB von Willebrand's disease may result in platelet aggregation, thrombocytopenia, and possibly thrombosis.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with intravenous and intranasal desmopressin acetate, including cases of fatal anaphylaxis with intravenous desmopressin acetate. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to desmopressin acetate or any of its components [see Contraindications (4)]. It is not known whether antibodies to desmopressin acetate injection are produced after repeated injections. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during administration; treatment should be interrupted should a reaction occur and managed medically. Permanently discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Fluid retention**: Desmopressin acetate injection can cause fluid retention, which can worsen underlying conditions that are susceptible to volume status. Patients with heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk. Desmopressin acetate injection is not recommended in patients at risk for increased intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Advise patients to limit fluid intake [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Management of von Willebrand disease with a factor VIII-poor von Willebrand factor concentrate: Results from a prospective observational post-marketing study [^115BG9bs]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is caused by a deficiency or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric glycoprotein with a high molecular weight. VWF plays a crucial role in primary hemostasis, promoting the adhesion of platelets to subendothelium after vascular injury and in blood coagulation, as it carries and protects factor VIII (FVIII) from inactivation and rapid catabolism. VWD is a heterogeneous disease, ranging from moderate to very severe deficiency in VWF, and is classified into three different types: type 1 and type 3 are characterized by a partial or (virtually) complete quantitative deficiency of VWF, while type 2 results from qualitative defects. The prevalence of VWD in patients referred for clinically relevant bleeding symptoms is about 0.01%, although the most severe form, type 3 VWD, is very rare (0.5‐5 cases/million).

The goal of VWD therapy is the correction of the VWF defect and, consequently, the correction of abnormal platelet adhesion and the abnormal intrinsic coagulation pathway. Several plasma‐derived VWF/FVIII factor concentrates, initially developed for the treatment of hemophilia A and also containing large amounts of VWF, can be used to treat desmopressin‐unresponsive or intolerant patients with VWD. These VWF/FVIII products vary in VWF/FVIII ratio, depending upon the manufacturing process. As the FVIII defect in VWD is secondary to that of VWF, the endogenous synthesis of FVIII is normal, contrary to hemophilia A. Thus, correction of the VWF defect results also in the correction of FVIII.

### How I treat von Willebrand disease [^114b8sh1]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Recent multicenter studies have clarified the molecular basis underlying the different von Willebrand disease (VWD) types, all of which are caused by the deficiency and/or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF). These studies have suggested a unifying pathophysiologic concept. The diagnosis of VWD remains difficult because its clinical and laboratory phenotype is very heterogeneous and may overlap with normal subjects. Therefore, stringent criteria are required for a clinically useful diagnosis.

In this paper, we delineate a practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of VWD. Our approach is based on the critical importance of a standardized bleeding history that has been condensed into a final bleeding score and a few widely available laboratory tests, such as VWF ristocetin cofactor activity, VWF antigen, and factor VIII. This approach would help identify those subjects who will probably benefit from a diagnosis of VWD.

The next step involves performing a trial infusion with desmopressin in all patients who fail to exhibit an enhanced responsiveness to ristocetin. On the basis of these results and through a series of illustrative examples, the clinician will be able to select the best approach for the optimal management of VWD, according to the patient's characteristics and clinical circumstances.

### How I manage severe von Willebrand disease [^116LJHnq]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder (Leebeek & Eikenboom, 2016). The estimated prevalence of VWD patients with clinically relevant bleeding is 1:10,000. VWD is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding, such as menorrhagia, epistaxis, and gum bleeds (de Wee et al, 2012; Leebeek & Eikenboom, 2016). However, other bleeds, such as joint bleeds and gastrointestinal bleeds, also occur, especially in more severely affected patients (van Galen et al, 2017). VWD diagnosis is based on personal bleeding history, family history of VWD, and a detailed laboratory evaluation (Leebeek & Eikenboom, 2016).

Von Willebrand disease is classified into three subtypes based on a quantitative reduction or a qualitative defect of von Willebrand factor (VWF) (Sadler et al, 2006; Leebeek & Eikenboom, 2016). Type 1 VWD is characterized by a quantitative reduction of VWF and is the most common form of VWD, affecting 70–80% of patients. The bleeding phenotype of type 1 VWD patients is generally milder than in type 2 and type 3 VWD (de Wee et al, 2012). Type 2 VWD, diagnosed in 20% of VWD patients, is characterized by a qualitative defect of VWF, and the bleeding phenotype is generally more severe than in type 1 VWD patients. Type 3 VWD is the rarest (prevalence < 5%) and most severe form of VWD; it is characterized by a complete absence of VWF (Leebeek & Eikenboom, 2016).

### Von Willebrand's disease in the year 2003: Towards the complete identification of gene defects for correct diagnosis and treatment [^1152tSAd]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand's disease (VWD) is an autosomally inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or abnormality of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF is a multimeric adhesive protein that plays an important role in primary hemostasis by promoting platelet adhesion to the subendothelium at sites of vascular injury and platelet-platelet interactions in high shear-rate conditions. It is also the carrier of factor VIII (FVIII), thus indirectly contributing to the coagulation process. VWD has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population, but the figure for clinically relevant cases is lower (about 100/million inhabitants). Bleeding manifestations are heterogeneous: mucosal bleeding is typical of all VWD cases, but hemarthrosis and hematomas may also be present when FVIII levels are low.

- **Information sources**: Most cases appear to have a partial quantitative deficiency of VWF (type 1 VWD) with variable bleeding tendency, whereas qualitative variants (type 2 VWD), due to a dysfunctional VWF, are clinically more homogeneous. Type 3 VWD is rare, and patients have a moderate to severe bleeding diathesis because of the virtual absence of VWF and a recessive pattern of inheritance. The diagnosis of VWD, especially type I, may be difficult because the laboratory phenotype is highly heterogeneous and is confounded by the fact that factors outside the VWF gene (e.g. blood group) influence VWF levels. An array of tests is usually required to characterize the VWD types of the disorder and establish the best treatment modality.

### Von Willebrand's disease diagnosed after menorrhagia worsened from levonorgestrel intrauterine system [^112XGGbj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Adult females with menorrhagia may have unrecognized mild von Willebrand's disease, as most females with known von Willebrand's disease report menorrhagia.

- **Case**: A 38-year-old healthy female desired contraception. She described heavy menses lasting 8 days since menarche. Her history included uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, and her physical examination was normal. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system was placed, after which her menorrhagia worsened to 14 successive days each month. Evaluation revealed mild von Willebrand's disease. After 19 months of follow-up, she retained her levonorgestrel intrauterine system and avoided pregnancy. Her menses slowly improved to spotting for 8 days each month.

- **Conclusion**: Von Willebrand's disease is a likely cause of menorrhagia that can go unrecognized and may contribute to "failed" conservative treatment for menorrhagia. Understanding the cause of menorrhagia is an important aspect of evaluating this common symptom.

### The diagnosis and management of von Willebrand disease: A United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organization guideline approved by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^115WeHtV]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease serve as a vital clinical tool for identifying patients with this common inherited bleeding disorder. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling appropriate management and treatment strategies for affected individuals.

The diagnostic process involves two key components. The first is a history of significant mucocutaneous bleeding, which is a common symptom in patients with von Willebrand disease. This could include symptoms such as easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from minor wounds, or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding in women.

The second component is a laboratory finding of von Willebrand factor activity less than 0.3 units/mL. Von Willebrand factor is a protein that helps blood to clot, and its activity can be measured in a laboratory test. A low level of von Willebrand factor activity is indicative of von Willebrand disease.

The diagnosis of von Willebrand disease is confirmed if both these criteria are met. If either of these criteria is not met, the diagnosis is not confirmed. This binary approach ensures a high degree of specificity in the diagnostic process, reducing the likelihood of false-positive results.

The tool is designed to determine whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for von Willebrand disease based on two key clinical inputs:

- **History of significant mucocutaneous bleeding**: This input assesses whether the individual has experienced symptoms such as easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from minor wounds, or heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.

- **Von Willebrand factor activity measurement**: This input confirms whether the von Willebrand factor activity is less than 0.3 units/mL in a laboratory test.

### Case-based discussion on the implications of exogenous estrogens in hemostasis and thrombosis: The obstetrician's view [^113vZUEb]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

This text presents the obstetrician's perspective on three distinct clinical scenarios concerning bleeding and thrombotic disorders.

- **Scenario 1**: An 18-year-old with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding since menarche presents with abdominal pain and ultrasound findings suggestive of a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. The association with an underlying bleeding disorder is recognized. The management goals, which include controlling hemorrhage and preserving fertility, are stated. Ovarian suppression, the most effective method to prevent recurrent hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, is outlined. Long-term management of heavy menstrual bleeding with hormonal contraception is described.

- **Scenario 2**: The same patient returns five years later for a preconception visit. The potential risks to an unborn baby with von Willebrand disease (VWD) are addressed. The natural rise in von Willebrand factor (VWF) during pregnancy is discussed, but it is emphasized that women with VWD do not achieve the same VWF levels as women without VWD, and the implications are presented. In anticipation of pregnancy, the need for nonhormonal management of heavy menstrual bleeding and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts is mentioned.

- **Scenario 3**: The patient's cousin with factor V Leiden seeks consultation regarding the risks of thrombosis with in vitro fertilization. The steps of assisted reproductive technology are described. Strategies to prevent venous thromboembolism by preventing ovarian hyperstimulation and reducing the likelihood of multiple gestation are detailed.

### Case-based discussion on the implications of exogenous estrogens in hemostasis and thrombosis: The hematologist's view [^112jCrDD]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

In the childbearing years, hormonal therapy or hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle or the puerperium may be complicated by bleeding or thrombosis; however, among women with congenital disorders of hemostasis and thrombosis, the risk of bleeding or thrombosis may be increased. In women with congenital bleeding disorders, heavy menstrual bleeding is the most common bleeding symptom, and postpartum hemorrhage occurs despite treatment. Given the limitations of therapy and the associated medical and psychological burden in women with bleeding disorders, better treatment approaches are needed to improve health outcomes and quality of life.

In women with congenital thrombotic disorders, thromboembolism may complicate exogenous hormonal therapy and endogenous hormonal change during pregnancy and procedures; risk differs by type of thrombophilia, procedure, time at risk, and thrombosis risk factors, all of which affect management.

In this article, I shall consider a case-based discussion of issues in women with congenital bleeding and clotting disorders, including heavy menstrual bleeding in a woman with VWD, postpartum hemorrhage risk in VWD, and thrombosis risk with oocyte retrieval in a woman with factor V Leiden and past thromboembolism. The goals are to review bleeding or thrombosis risk in these cases, data, limitations of treatment guidelines, and areas for future study.

### New advances in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease [^1161t2Jc]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common autosomal inherited bleeding disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 1000 individuals. VWD can be classified into quantitative and qualitative forms. Diagnosis of VWD is complex and requires: (1) a personal history of bleeding symptoms, (2) family history of bleeding or VWD, and (3) confirmatory laboratory testing. There are specific bleeding assessment tools to objectively measure bleeding symptoms in patients; these tools have been shown to correlate with the diagnosis and severity of VWD.

Laboratory diagnosis initially requires measuring von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen levels, VWF platelet binding activity (VWF:RCo, VWF:GPIbM, and VWF:GPIbR), and factor VIII (FVIII) activity. Additional testing to confirm the specific subtype may include VWF collagen binding activity, low-dose ristocetin VWF-platelet binding, FVIII-VWF binding, VWF multimer analysis, and VWF propeptide antigen. Recent advances have been made regarding some of these assays.

Molecular testing in VWD is generally not useful for 'low VWF' or most type 1 VWD cases but may be informative in patients with severe type 1 VWD, type 1C VWD, type 2 VWD, or type 3 VWD for accurate diagnosis, genetic counseling, and appropriate treatment. The diagnostic algorithm for VWD is complex, but advances continue to be made in improving VWF functional assays and diagnostic pathways.

### Efficacy of the 1-year (13-cycle) segesterone acetate and ethinylestradiol contraceptive vaginal system: results of two multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 trials [^112zqvhm]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Six months after the trial commenced, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended excluding women with a BMI greater than 29.0 kg/m² rather than exclusion based on weight. This recommendation was due to the well-characterized risk of venous thromboembolism in obese women and the occurrence of non-fatal venous thromboembolisms in two participants with a BMI greater than 29.0 kg/m² reported early in the study.

Participants were recruited to the trial through IRB-approved local advertising.

- **Procedures**: Participants were screened after expressing interest and consenting to trial involvement. Screening involved clinical tests, a physical examination including a gynecological examination, and obtaining a medical history, including history of pregnancy. After screening, all eligible participants began the study identically, regardless of their previous contraceptive method use.

	- The use of the contraceptive vaginal system was initiated at the baseline visit, which occurred between menstrual days 2 and 5, and following a negative urine pregnancy test. Urine pregnancy tests were repeated at all subsequent visits (cycles 3, 6, 9, and 13), and at the final study termination visit (1–2 weeks after cycle 13). Women who discontinued the study early had pregnancy tests at their last study visit.

	- The day of contraceptive vaginal system insertion became day 1 of the first treatment cycle. Site staff counselled participants on the proper use of the contraceptive vaginal system, provided written instructions that outlined the 21-days-in and 7-days-out regimen, and reinforced directions about keeping the contraceptive vaginal system in place continuously.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 451: Von Willebrand disease in women [^111jiNpw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 3 million women in the United States have inherited bleeding disorders, with the prevalence particularly high among those with menorrhagia. Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Once a diagnosis is made, collaboration with a hematologist is helpful for long-term management. Women with von Willebrand disease may be at increased risk for gynecologic and obstetric complications. Many treatments are available for controlling menorrhagia in women with von Willebrand disease, but the first-line therapy remains combined hormonal contraception.

Intermenstrual bleeding can be attributed to a variety of causes including endometrial polyps, von Willebrand disease, sexually transmitted infections, estrogen withdrawal, and oral contraception noncompliance. Other potential causes include hydatidiform mole, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, adenomyosis, vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer, choriocarcinoma, cervical cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, vulvovaginitis, and uterine fibromyoma.

Additionally, intermenstrual bleeding may be induced by medications such as ulipristal, misoprostol, medroxyprogesterone, selegiline, mifepristone, verapamil, verapamil SR, verapamil ER, cetirizine, and tiagabine.
