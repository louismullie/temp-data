## Question

Sinusitis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sinusitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify sinusitis by duration and etiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria that distinguish viral from bacterial disease. Next, I will review the evidence for antibiotics versus watchful waiting, including magnitude of benefit and adverse effects. After that, I need to check first-line antibiotic choices, dosing, and duration for adults and children, and when to escalate or change therapy. Finally, I will consider special populations, complications, and summarize a practical decision framework with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the classification so I don't mislabel disease. Sinusitis, more accurately rhinosinusitis, is classified by duration as acute (< 4 weeks), subacute (4–12 weeks), and chronic (> 12 weeks), and by etiology as viral, bacterial, or noninfectious, with most acute cases being viral and self-limited, which frames the rest of the decision-making process [^6757e8cb] [^5600ca63].

> I need to verify the diagnostic criteria that separate viral from presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). ABRS is suggested by persistent symptoms without improvement for at least 10 days, a worsening course after initial improvement ("double sickening"), or severe onset with fever ≥ 39°C plus purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days; importantly, routine imaging is not recommended for uncomplicated cases because it does not distinguish bacterial from viral disease and increases false positives [^5600ca63] [^9201df28] [^c0975a90].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should review the magnitude of benefit. High-quality evidence shows that antibiotics confer only a modest benefit in adults with clinically diagnosed ABRS, with an absolute risk reduction in clinical failure of about 5–11% and a number needed to treat around 10–19, while spontaneous improvement without antibiotics is common (about 46% at 1 week and 64% at 2 weeks), and adverse events are more frequent with antibiotics, with a number needed to harm around 8 [^f7f6a5e8] [^2141c357] [^0d33feb9].

> Wait, let me verify the balance of benefits and harms in children. Pediatric data are more limited and heterogeneous, but meta-analytic and guideline syntheses suggest a modest benefit of antibiotics in some children, particularly those with severe or worsening presentations, while many improve without antibiotics; adverse events are common, so shared decision-making is essential, and observation is reasonable for persistent symptoms without red flags [^4ad6bfc1] [^429f7af7] [^71bd5881].

> I should confirm the default initial strategy for uncomplicated ABRS in adults. Contemporary guidelines recommend watchful waiting as the initial approach for most adults with uncomplicated ABRS, with a short window of 3–5 days before reconsidering antibiotics, provided there is assurance of follow-up and no concerning features; this strengthens prior guidance that allowed watchful waiting even after 10 days of symptoms [^f2161b54] [^84d62a4c] [^cffbd70f].

> Let me think about when to start antibiotics despite watchful waiting. Indications include severe disease (high fever with purulent discharge for ≥ 3 days), worsening course after initial improvement, or persistent symptoms beyond about 10 days without improvement; in these scenarios, the likelihood of bacterial disease is higher and the net benefit of antibiotics may outweigh harms, though shared decision-making remains important [^5600ca63] [^3b365ed9] [^e58e7a35].

> I should double-check first-line antibiotic choices and duration for adults. If antibiotics are chosen, amoxicillin or amoxicillin–clavulanate for 5–7 days is recommended; amoxicillin alone is reasonable for mild disease in low-resistance settings, whereas amoxicillin–clavulanate is preferred when resistance risk is higher or symptoms are more severe; longer courses do not improve outcomes and increase adverse effects, so 5–7 days is favored over 10 days [^e674ee33] [^ba999865] [^c3b2a7aa].

> But wait, what if someone proposes high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate for faster relief? I need to check that. Randomized trials in adults show no advantage of high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate over standard-dose regimens for early symptom improvement, so escalating the amoxicillin dose does not improve outcomes and may increase gastrointestinal adverse effects, reinforcing the principle to use standard dosing unless there is a specific resistance risk [^6e6c4945] [^00962b5c].

> Next, I should review pediatric specifics. For children with severe or worsening ABRS, antibiotics are recommended; for persistent symptoms, either antibiotics or close observation for 3 days is acceptable, with amoxicillin as first-line if resistance risk is low and amoxicillin–clavulanate when resistance risk is higher or illness is moderate to severe; typical pediatric durations are 10 days, though some guidelines allow 7 days after clinical response, and reassessment at 72 hours is advised if not improving [^429f7af7] [^af9a7f77] [^d2196b97].

> I will now examine treatment failure and when to change therapy. Failure is generally defined as worsening at any time or lack of improvement after 3–5 days of appropriate therapy; if failure occurs, clinicians should reassess the diagnosis, exclude other causes, evaluate for complications, and consider changing the antibiotic or obtaining cultures in refractory cases; IDSA also advises evaluating for structural issues or resistant pathogens in nonresponders [^e72adfb2] [^7fa8adcc] [^f4388abf].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers. In penicillin-allergic adults, doxycycline is a reasonable alternative; in children with severe beta-lactam allergy, options include a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, though macrolide resistance is high and fluoroquinolones carry safety concerns; in immunocompromised patients, those with severe disease, or suspected complications, a lower threshold for antibiotics and imaging is appropriate, and ENT involvement may be needed [^0f250053] [^f702da10] [^c0975a90].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of adjuncts. Intranasal corticosteroids can be considered, particularly in patients with a history of allergic rhinitis, and saline irrigation may provide symptomatic relief; oral corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy and, when combined with antibiotics, show only modest short-term benefit in severe presentations, so routine use is not advised [^5f5134e8] [^a08846bc] [^aade8ffa].

> I need to ensure I address chronic rhinosinusitis separately. Routine antibiotics are not recommended for chronic rhinosinusitis without an acute bacterial exacerbation; first-line management is intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation, with evaluation for underlying contributors such as allergies, asthma, or anatomic variants, and antibiotics reserved for acute exacerbations or specific scenarios like odontogenic infection [^4912c1a7] [^85b082f7].

> Let me reconsider the practical decision framework to ensure internal consistency. For adults with acute rhinosinusitis, classify by duration and trajectory; if viral or mild, provide symptomatic care; if ABRS is suspected, default to watchful waiting with 3–5 day reassessment; start antibiotics for severe onset, worsening course, or persistent symptoms beyond about 10 days; choose amoxicillin or amoxicillin–clavulanate for 5–7 days; reassess at 3–5 days and change therapy if failing; throughout, incorporate patient preferences and local resistance patterns [^f2161b54] [^e674ee33] [^3b365ed9].

> Finally, I should confirm the key takeaways so I don't overstate anything. Most acute rhinosinusitis is viral and improves without antibiotics; antibiotics offer a modest absolute benefit in carefully selected adults with ABRS; watchful waiting is the preferred initial strategy for uncomplicated cases; when antibiotics are used, keep them narrow and short; and reassess early if not improving to catch misdiagnosis, complications, or treatment failure [^f7f6a5e8] [^f2161b54] [^e674ee33] [^e72adfb2].

Sinusitis is **inflammation of the paranasal sinuses** [^d3bdaf0b], most often due to viral upper respiratory infections, with bacterial infection suspected when symptoms persist ≥ 10 days, worsen after initial improvement, or are severe at onset [^5600ca63] [^3b365ed9]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on symptoms and duration; imaging is reserved for complications or refractory cases [^c0975a90]. Most cases resolve spontaneously, so **watchful waiting is first-line** for uncomplicated cases [^f2161b54]; antibiotics are reserved for bacterial features or severe disease, with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5–7 days as first-line therapy [^e674ee33] [^ba999865]. Adjunctive measures include intranasal corticosteroids, saline irrigation, and analgesics [^a08846bc]; surgery is considered for chronic or refractory disease [^notfound].

---

## Classification

Sinusitis is classified by **duration and etiology**:

| **Duration** | **Etiology** |
|-|-|
| Acute (< 4 weeks) | Viral (most common) |
| Subacute (4–12 weeks) | Bacterial (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) [^dded5e71] |
| Chronic (> 12 weeks) | Fungal (Aspergillus, dematiaceous molds) |
| Recurrent acute (≥ 4 episodes/year) | Noninfectious (allergic, structural, autoimmune) [^4a04e655] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include:

- **Nasal congestion/obstruction**: Common [^b79a5be6].
- **Purulent nasal discharge**: Yellow/green [^b79a5be6].
- **Facial pain/pressure**: Especially unilateral [^0862f8b3].
- **Hyposmia/anosmia**: Reduced smell [^6757e8cb].
- **Cough**: Particularly in children [^1d0a4a89].
- **Fever**: More common in acute bacterial cases [^bc594a56].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, guided by symptom duration and pattern [^5600ca63]:

- **Viral sinusitis**: Symptoms < 10 days, improving.
- **Bacterial sinusitis**: Persistent ≥ 10 days, worsening after initial improvement, or severe onset with fever ≥ 39°C and purulent discharge ≥ 3 days [^5600ca63] [^3b365ed9].
- **Imaging**: Not routine; reserved for complications or refractory cases (CT/MRI) [^c0975a90].

---

## Treatment

### Acute viral sinusitis

Management is **supportive** [^a08846bc]:

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs [^a08846bc].
- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: For inflammation [^5f5134e8].
- **Saline irrigation**: For symptom relief [^a08846bc].
- **Watchful waiting**: Reassess if symptoms persist or worsen [^f2161b54].

---

### Acute bacterial sinusitis

#### Antibiotic therapy

- **First-line**: Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5–7 days [^e674ee33] [^ba999865].
- **Penicillin allergy**: Doxycycline or a macrolide (if local resistance is low) [^0f250053].
- **Failure**: Reassess at 3–5 days; consider alternative antibiotics or imaging [^e72adfb2] [^7fa8adcc].

---

#### Adjunctive therapy

Adjunctive therapy includes **intranasal corticosteroids** to reduce inflammation [^5f5134e8], **saline irrigation** for symptom relief [^a08846bc], and **analgesics** for pain control [^c0975a90].

---

### Chronic sinusitis

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: Long-term [^notfound].
- **Saline irrigation**: Regular use [^85b082f7].
- **Antibiotics**: Only for acute bacterial exacerbations [^4912c1a7].
- **Surgery**: For refractory cases or structural abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Although rare, complications can be **severe**:

- **Orbital**: Cellulitis, abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis.
- **Intracranial**: Meningitis, epidural abscess, brain abscess.
- **Bone**: Osteomyelitis (Pott's puffy tumor).

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **hand hygiene** to reduce viral transmission, **allergy management** to limit mucosal edema, and **smoking cessation** to improve mucociliary clearance [^notfound].

---

Sinusitis is common and usually self-limited; **accurate clinical diagnosis and judicious antibiotic use** are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize resistance [^3b365ed9].

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^f8df4b9a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Expert opinions vary on the appropriate role of antibiotics for sinusitis, one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions among adults in ambulatory care.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are the most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and quality assessed trials. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for differences in the intervention and control groups to see whether or not the treatment was a failure. In meta-analysing the placebo-controlled studies, the data across antibiotic classes were combined. Primary outcomes were the clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow up.

Main Results

Fifty-seven studies were included in the review; six placebo-controlled studies and 51 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics. Five studies involving 631 participants provided data for comparison of antibiotics to placebo, when clinical failure was defined as a lack of cure or improvement at 7 to 15 days follow up. These studies found a slight statistical difference in favor of antibiotics, compared to placebo, with a pooled RR of 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98). However, the clinical significance of the result is equivocal, also considering that cure or improvement rate was high in both the placebo group (80%) and the antibiotic group (90%). Based on six studies, when clinical failure was defined as a lack of total cure, there was significant difference in favor of antibiotics compared to placebo with a pooled RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.84) at 7 to 15 days follow up. None of the antibiotic preparations was superior to each other.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics have a small treatment effect in patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis in a primary care setting with symptoms for more than seven days. However, 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improve within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population level.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^96aaa703]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^f347cf0c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes and the side effects of different treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey (accessed 15 January 2013)), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model. In meta-analyses of the placebo-controlled studies, we combined data across antibiotic classes. Primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up. We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 63 studies in this updated review; nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1915 participants (seven of the studies clearly conducted in primary care settings) and 54 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics (10 different comparisons). Five studies at low risk of bias comparing penicillin or amoxicillin to placebo provided information on the main outcome: clinical failure rate at 7 to 15 days follow-up, defined as a lack of full recovery or improvement, for participants with symptoms lasting at least seven days. In these studies antibiotics decreased the risk of clinical failure (pooled RR of 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, 1084 participants randomised, 1058 evaluated, moderate quality evidence). However, the clinical benefit was small. Cure or improvement rates were high in both the placebo group (86%) and the antibiotic group (91%) in these five studies. When clinical failure was defined as a lack of full recovery (n = five studies), results were similar: antibiotics decreased the risk of failure (pooled RR of 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, high quality evidence) at 7 to 15 days follow-up. Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%). However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups. In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another. However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis. However, about 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improved within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population levels.

### Acute sinusitis in children: do antibiotics have any role? [^4ad6bfc1]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Bacteria can be recovered from paranasal sinuses in the majority of patients given the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), and bacteriologic cure can be achieved with appropriate antibiotic treatment. The critical question is whether bacteriologic cure correlates with meaningful clinical endpoints such as clinical improvement, reduction in recurrent disease, or prevention of complications. Of the 4 pediatric placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (PCRCTs), 2 suggest superiority of antibiotic treatment and 2 suggest lack of superiority. PCRCTs in adults are mixed as to clinical benefit. Pediatric and adult meta-analyses demonstrate modest benefit of antibiotic therapy and rates of spontaneous recovery without antibiotics of 60–65%. Although retrospective studies indicate that some patients who develop orbital or neurologic complications of sinusitis were pre-treated with antibiotic therapy, a low rate of complications precludes determination of whether antibiotic treatment prevents complications in some proportion of patients. Like the literature evidence, expert guideline recommendations are mixed. Although the evidence base is incomplete and conflicting, the limited data suggest that antibiotics probably do have a role in the treatment of pediatric ABS. The most compelling rationale is prevention of serious complications, but proof for this rationale is lacking.

### Strategies for diagnosing and treating suspected acute bacterial sinusitis: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^18c65919]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Symptoms suggestive of acute bacterial sinusitis are common. Available diagnostic and treatment options generate substantial costs with uncertain benefits. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies to identify the optimal approach.

Design

For such patients, we created a Markov model to examine four strategies: 1) no antibiotic treatment; 2) empirical antibiotic treatment; 3) clinical criteria-guided treatment; and 4) radiography-guided treatment. The model simulated a 14-day course of illness, included sinusitis prevalence, antibiotic side effects, sinusitis complications, direct and indirect costs, and symptom severity. Strategies costing less than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained were considered "cost-effective".

Measurements and Main Results

For mild or moderate disease, basing antibiotic treatment on clinical criteria was cost-effective in clinical settings where sinusitis prevalence is within the range of 15% to 93% or 3% to 63%, respectively. For severe disease, or to prevent sinusitis or antibiotic side effect symptoms, use of clinical criteria was cost-effective in settings with lower prevalence (below 51% or 44%, respectively); empirical antibiotics was cost-effective with higher prevalence. Sinus radiography-guided treatment was never cost-effective for initial treatment.

Conclusions

Use of a simple set of clinical criteria to guide treatment is a cost-effective strategy in most clinical settings. Empirical antibiotics are cost-effective in certain settings; however, their use results in many unnecessary prescriptions. If this resulted in increased antibiotic resistance, costs would substantially rise and efficacy would fall. Newer, expensive antibiotics are of limited value. Additional testing is not cost-effective. Further studies are needed to find an accurate, low-cost diagnostic test for acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: continuing challenges and current management [^385f5219]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral; however, many patients receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits have a major impact on health care costs, contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens, and reflect many of the challenges in differentiating viral and bacterial disease. Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not appropriate for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or that worsen after 7–10 days are currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis can select patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected on the basis of local resistance patterns, and their spectrum of activity should cover the common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^f7f6a5e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Comparison of antibiotics with placebo for treatment of acute sinusitis: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^0d33feb9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

We did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the therapeutic role of antibiotics for acute sinusitis compared with placebo. Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed and Scopus. 17 double-blind RCTs were included (three involving children). Acute sinusitis was diagnosed with clinical criteria in nine RCTs, imaging studies in six RCTs, and microbiological or laboratory methods in two RCTs. Amoxicillin was used in ten of 23 antibiotic treatment groups. To account for potential statistical heterogeneity between studies, a random-effects model was used for all analyses. Compared with placebo, antibiotics were associated with a higher rate of cure or improvement (2648 patients, odds ratio [OR] 1.64 [95% CI 1.35–2.00], data from 16 RCTs), or cure alone (1813 patients, OR 1.82 [1.34–2.46], 12 RCTs), but also with more adverse events (1963 patients, OR 1.87 [1.21–2.90], 12 RCTs). The rate of symptom resolution was faster with antibiotics in most RCTs. Disease complications, disease recurrence, and study withdrawals because of adverse events did not differ between compared treatments. In conclusion, use of antibiotics for acute sinusitis confers a small therapeutic benefit over placebo with a corresponding rise in the risk for adverse events. We suggest that antibiotics should be reserved for carefully selected patients with a higher probability for bacterial disease.

### Sinusitis (acute) [^6757e8cb]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is defined pathologically, by transient inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks. Clinically, it is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial pain, hyposmia, sneezing, and, if more severe, additional malaise and fever. It affects 1% to 5% of the adult population each year in Europe.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, and in people with radiologically or bacteriologically confirmed acute sinusitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [co-amoxiclav], doxycycline, cephalosporins, macrolides; different doses, long-course regimens), antihistamines, decongestants (xylometazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), saline nasal washes, steam inhalation, and topical corticosteroids (intranasal).

### Clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis [^05bcd911]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This executive summary will alert clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Included in the guideline are 17 boldfaced action statements: 3 on viral rhinosinusitis, 7 on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and 7 on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Evidence profiles that accompany each statement are summarized to show why it was made and how it can be implemented. Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately. Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis focus on appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Surgical therapy is not discussed.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^546dbd37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For adults seeking care in ambulatory medical practices, sinusitis is the most common diagnosis treated with antibiotics.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective.

Search Strategy

Relevant studies were identified from searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2001, contacts with pharmaceutical companies and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials were eligible that compared antibiotic to control or antibiotics from different classes, for acute maxillary sinusitis. Additional criteria for inclusion were diagnostic confirmation by radiograph or sinus aspiration, outcomes that included clinical cure or improvement, and a sample size of 30 or more adults. Of 2058 potentially relevant studies, two or more reviewers identified 49 studies meeting selection criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two persons and synthesized descriptively. Some data were analyzed quantitatively using a random effects model. Primary outcomes were: a) clinical cure, and b) clinical cure or improvement. Secondary outcomes were radiographic improvement, relapse rates, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

Main Results

Forty-nine trials, involving 13,660 participants, evaluated antibiotic treatment for acute maxillary sinusitis. Major comparisons were antibiotic versus control (n of 5); newer, non-penicillin antibiotic versus penicillin class (n of 10); and amoxicillin-clavulanate versus other extended spectrum antibiotics (n of 17), where n is the number of trials. Most trials were conducted in otolaryngology settings. Only 8 trials described adequate allocation and concealment procedures; 20 were double-blind. Compared to control, penicillin improved clinical cures [relative risk (RR) 1.72; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.96]. Treatment with amoxicillin did not significantly improve cure rates (RR 2.06; 95% CI 0.65 to 6.53) but there was significant variability between studies. Radiographic outcomes were improved by antibiotic treatment. Comparisons between classes of antibiotics showed no significant differences: newer non-penicillins versus penicillins (RR for cure 1.07; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.17); newer non-penicillins versus amoxicillin-clavulanate (RR for cure 1.03; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11). Compared to amoxicillin-clavulanate, dropouts due to adverse effects were significantly lower for cephalosporin antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73). Relapse rates within one month of successful therapy were 7.7%.

Reviewer's Conclusions

For acute maxillary sinusitis confirmed radiographically or by aspiration, current evidence is limited but supports the use of penicillin or amoxicillin for 7 to 14 days. Clinicians should weigh the moderate benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^00962b5c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Will additional amoxicillin benefit adults with acute bacterial sinusitis treated with standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 157 patients with sinusitis was stopped early for futility when an interim analysis showed that a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days was reported by 31 of 70 patients (44.3%) who received a standard dose of amoxicillin plus clavulanate but only 24 of 66 patients (36.4%) receiving a high dose.

Meaning

Additional amoxicillin does not appear to benefit adults receiving standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate for acute sinusitis.

Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role. Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years — initial management and antibiotics: The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for children with severe onset or worsening course, and should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the first-line treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is caregiver report of worsening or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management, and if the diagnosis is confirmed with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e674ee33]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^f2161b54]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — initial management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) states: "Clinicians should offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) for adults with uncomplicated ABRS with assurance of follow-up", and "The duration of watchful waiting may depend on the factors and timing under which the diagnosis was originally made". Evidence qualifiers include "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A", "Level of Confidence in Evidence: Medium", and "Policy level: Recommendation". The update specifies "reduced watchful waiting to 3 to 5 days duration from time of diagnosis", while prior guidance "endorsed watchful waiting without an antibiotic… even when signs and symptoms had persisted for 10 days or longer". Patient preference has a "Large role for shared decision-making for watchful waiting vs. antibiotic therapy". Exceptions include "Complicated sinusitis, immune deficiency, or coexisting bacterial illness", and the clinician should consider age, general health, cardiopulmonary status, co-morbid conditions, and factors suggesting "severe" disease when assessing suitability; the guideline notes "the strengthening of the recommendation of watchful waiting to the default initial therapy", with allowance to differ "when the clinician believes that 'severe' disease requires antibiotic therapy".

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^71bd5881]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Additional observation for persistent onset acute bacterial sinusitis — The guideline recommends either antibiotic therapy or an additional brief period of observation as initial management for children with persistent acute bacterial sinusitis, noting benefits to antibiotic therapy (number needed to treat, 3–5) while some children improve on their own and the risk of suppurative complications is low; benefits must also be balanced against an increased risk of adverse events (number need to harm, 3). Choosing between antibiotic therapy or additional observation presents an opportunity for shared decision-making with families. Children with persistent acute bacterial sinusitis who received antibiotic therapy in the previous 4 weeks, those with concurrent bacterial infection (pneumonia, suppurative cervical adenitis, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, or acute otitis media), those with actual or suspected complications, or those with underlying conditions should generally be managed with antibiotic therapy; the latter group includes children with asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, previous sinus surgery, or anatomic abnormalities of the upper respiratory tract. Limiting antibiotic use in children who may improve on their own reduces common antibiotic-related adverse events, and in the most recent RCT adverse events were 44% with antibiotic and 14% with placebo.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^608c67b5]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — scope and key changes are defined as follows: Using stringent criteria, acute sinusitis has been observed in between 6% and 7% of children seeking care for respiratory symptoms. The revision focuses on diagnosis and management in children between 1 and 18 years of age and does not apply to children with subacute or chronic sinusitis; it does not consider neonates and children younger than 1 year or children with anatomic abnormalities of the sinuses, immunodeficiencies, cystic fibrosis, or primary ciliary dyskinesia. Changes from the 2001 guideline include addition of a clinical presentation designated as "worsening course", inclusion of new data on antibiotic effectiveness, and evidence indicating that imaging is not necessary to identify those children who will benefit from antimicrobial therapy. The guideline is intended for use in a variety of clinical settings (eg, office, emergency department, hospital) by clinicians who treat pediatric patients, and it will be reviewed in 5 years unless new evidence emerges that warrants revision sooner.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^c0975a90]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis in children: a systematic review [^f1bba9e7]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics published clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) in children. The technical report accompanying those guidelines included 21 studies that assessed the diagnosis and management of ABS in children. This update to that report incorporates studies of pediatric ABS that have been performed since 2001. Overall, 17 randomized controlled trials of the treatment of sinusitis in children were identified and analyzed. Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy have been published. The results of these studies varied, likely due to differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria. Because of this heterogeneity, formal meta-analyses were not performed. However, qualitative analysis of these studies suggests that children with greater severity of illness at presentation are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy. An additional 5 trials compared different antimicrobial therapies but did not include placebo groups. Six trials assessed a variety of ancillary treatments for ABS in children, and 3 focused on subacute sinusitis. Although the number of pediatric trials has increased since 2001, there are still limited data to guide the diagnosis and management of ABS in children. Diagnostic and treatment guidelines focusing on severity of illness at the time of presentation have the potential to identify those children most likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy and at the same time minimize unnecessary use of antibiotics

Severe-onset cases are presumed bacterial because "a temperature of at least 39°C/102.2°F coexisting for at least 3 consecutive days with purulent nasal discharge is not consistent with the well-documented pattern of acute viral URI", and "children with worsening-course acute bacterial sinusitis have a clinical course that is also not consistent with the steady improvement that characterizes an uncomplicated viral URI"; additionally, "In both guidelines, however, children presenting with severe or worsening illness (which was not defined explicitly in the 2001 guideline) are to receive antibiotic therapy".

### Definition of sinusitis-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^d3bdaf0b]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

sinusitis A condition in which the tissue lining the sinuses becomes swollen or inflamed. The sinuses are lined with cells that make mucous. Sinusitis can occur when too much mucous builds up in the sinuses or their openings become blocked. It is usually caused by a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. Signs and symptoms include headache, facial pain or pressure, stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, fever, cough, fatigue, bad breath, and reduced sense of smell and taste. Having certain conditions, such as allergies, nasal polyps or other nasal problems, a weak immune system, or certain medical conditions, may increase the risk of developing sinusitis. Smoking or being exposed to secondhand smoke may also increase the risk of sinusitis.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^4a04e655]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. There are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS). and some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting > 12 weeks. Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS, which reflects both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article will review the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence as well as the current understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will be discussed also. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of the various phenotypes and endotypes. Despite being the subject of considerable research, the etiology of CRS remains poorly understood. A wide range of potential causative agents have been investigated: microbes, aberrant inflammatory patterns, anatomic variations, the genetics underlying the innate immune system and epithelial barrier integrity and mucociliary clearance, hypersensitivities associated with asthma, hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency. There is little doubt that the condition is multifactorial. Defining the therapeutic role of antibiotics requires some understanding of the pathogenic role of bacteria in CRS.

### Issues in the management of bacterial sinusitis [^dded5e71]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Office visits for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) have increased steadily in the past 2 decades, and ABRS accounted for 0.4% of ambulatory diagnoses in 1995, ranking as the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. ABRS typically begins as a viral respiratory tract infection, but bacterial growth is demonstrated in 60% of adults with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms of at least 10 days duration. Important factors to consider when selecting an antibiotic regimen for ABRS include: severity of disease, rate of disease progression, earlier antibiotic treatment, regional resistance rates, and, in children, an age < 5 years and attendance in day care centers. The most prevalent causative pathogens of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial agent use is under significant scrutiny in this era of emerging bacterial resistance, and antibiotic treatment for sinusitis should include consideration of drug pharmacodynamics. Several agents, once considered first-line therapies, can no longer be considered dependable in this role. Rather, newer antibiotics may be called on to provide efficacy and forestall additional antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — initial management by severity: Children with persistent sinusitis may be managed with either an antibiotic or an additional brief period of observation, allowing up to another 3 days to improve, whereas all children diagnosed with severe or worsening sinusitis should start antibiotic treatment. Observation is reasonable because some episodes of persistent sinusitis may improve on their own, and antibiotics can have adverse effects including vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach, skin rash, allergic reactions, yeast infections, and development of resistant bacteria.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — definition and timing of antibiotic treatment failure are specified as follows: For patients who have started on antibiotic therapy, treatment failure is defined as worsening of symptoms or failure to improve after 3 to 5 days, with worsening defined as the progression of presenting signs or symptoms of ABRS or the onset of new signs or symptoms, and failure to improve defined as a lack of reduction in presenting signs or symptoms of ABRS that would not apply if symptoms are persistent yet gradually improving. The statement lists "Policy level: Option". Fluctuations in signs and symptoms within the first 48 to 72 hours of initial therapy were not uncommon and not necessarily indicative of failure. Prior guidelines noted an "acceptable percentage of poor outcomes" when failure was defined at 7 days, but subsequent studies demonstrate an early response to effective antibiotic therapy, usually within 3 days, and the GUG felt that keeping a 7‑day cut‑point before changing antibiotics would result in more than an "acceptable percentage of poor outcomes".

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute sinusitis [^aade8ffa]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are oral or parenteral corticosteroids associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute sinusitis compared with placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?

Bottom Line

Oral corticosteroids combined with antibiotics may be associated with modest benefit for short-term relief of symptoms in adults with severe symptoms of acute sinusitis compared with antibiotics alone. Oral corticosteroids as monotherapy are not associated with improved clinical outcomes in adults with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^c3b2a7aa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — antibiotic duration and adverse events: the guideline recommends 5 to 7 days of empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected ABRS instead of 5 to 10 days, citing a systematic review finding no difference in clinical success for antibiotics given for 3 to 7 days versus 6 to 10 days and similar success when 5 days were compared with 10 days; adverse events are common with antibiotic therapy with an average event rate of 15% to 40%, and antibiotic therapy increases adverse event rate on average by 10% to 12% over placebo with an odds ratio of 1.8 to 2.1; the incidence of adverse events is lower when antibiotics are given for 5 days instead of 10 days (odds ratio, 0.79), so short courses should be considered for patients with less severe illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^b79a5be6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis — defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^cf95e123]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^ce066305]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

Severe acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as temperature ≥ 39°C with purulent nasal discharge present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days; worsening illness is defined by sudden worsening with new-onset fever ≥ 38° C/100.4° F or substantial increase in nasal discharge or cough after transient improvement; persistent illness is defined by nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement. A footnote notes an "Opportunity for shared decision-making" and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens at any time or fails to improve within 3 days of observation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^5600ca63]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Acute sinusitis in children [^c85542fa]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^6e6c4945]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Acute bacterial sinusitis is common, but currently recommended antibiotic treatment provides minimal benefit.

Objective

To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

Interventions

Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment.

Results

At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7–84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms", as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; P = 0.35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that adults treated for clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis did not appear to benefit from taking high-dose compared with standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^fb734ce7]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children and adolescents.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline (2001).

Results

The diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is made when a child with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI) presents with (1) persistent illness (nasal discharge [of any quality] or daytime cough or both lasting more than 10 days without improvement), (2) a worsening course (worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or fever after initial improvement), or (3) severe onset (concurrent fever[temperature ≥ 39°C/102.2°F] and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days). Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of any kind to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI, because they do not contribute to the diagnosis; however, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained whenever a child is suspected of having orbital or central nervous system complications. The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children with severe onset or worsening course. The clinician should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the firstline treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is either a caregiver report of worsening(progression of initial signs/symptoms or appearance of new signs/symptoms) or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management. If the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed in a child with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, then clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy for the child initially managed with antibiotic or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include the addition of a clinical presentation designated as "worsening course", an option to treat immediately or observe children with persistent symptoms for 3 days before treating, and a review of evidence indicating that imaging is not necessary in children with uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis.

### A trial of high-dose, short-course levofloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis [^181339bb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Compare two dosage strengths of levofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis.

Study Design and Setting

Multicenter clinical trial comparing levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 days vs levofloxacin 500 mg for 10 days.

Results

Sinus fluid samples were obtained by antral puncture (59.2%) or by sinus endoscopy (40.8%). Among microbiologically evaluable patients, 91.4% (139/152) of patients receiving levofloxacin 750 mg achieved clinical success vs 88.6% (132/149) of patients receiving levofloxacin 500 mg (95% CI -10.0, 4.2). Clinical success rates by pathogen were above 90% in both treatment groups for the 3 typical pathogens of acute sinusitis: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The safety profile of the 2 dosage strengths was similar.

Conclusion

Levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 days is noninferior to levofloxacin 500 mg for 10 days.

Significance

Levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 days represents a safe and effective treatment regimen for acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Beginning antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis and choosing the right treatment [^f702da10]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) is an extremely common problem in both children and adults. There are three clinical presentations of acute sinusitis: (1) onset with persistent symptoms (nasal symptoms or cough or both for > 10 but < 30 d without evidence of improvement); (2) onset with severe symptoms (high fever and purulent nasal discharge for 3–4 consecutive days); and (3) onset with worsening symptoms (respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, which worsen after several days of improvement). Images to confirm the presence of acute sinusitis are necessary in older children (> 6 years) and adults to enhance the certainty of diagnosis. The predominant bacterial species that are implicated in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. In the last decade, there has been an increasing prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Although there has been some controversy in the literature regarding the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of ABS, most studies in which the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed with images and appropriate anti-biotics are prescribed show superior outcomes in recipients of antibiotics. Therapy may be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. In penicillin-allergic patients or those who are unresponsive to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate. Alternatives include cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or cefdinir. In cases of serious drug allergy, clarithromycin or azithromycin may be prescribed. The optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Some recommend treatment until the patient becomes free of symptoms and then for an additional 7 d.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^9ff8dfe9]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth x 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily x 10 to 14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study comparing levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates (defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary) in the microbiologically evaluable population were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (95% CI [-4.2, 10] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg).

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post treatment (see Table 14).

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis first-line therapy in children: Amoxicillin remains the antimicrobial agent of choice for first-line treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis when antimicrobial resistance is not suspected. For children aged 2 years or older with mild to moderate uncomplicated disease who do not attend child care and have not been treated with an antimicrobial agent within the last 4 weeks, amoxicillin is recommended at 45 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses. In communities with a high prevalence of nonsusceptible S pneumoniae (> 10%), treatment may be initiated at 80 to 90 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose. Patients with moderate to severe illness or those younger than 2 years, attending child care, or recently treated with an antimicrobial may receive high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 80–90 mg/kg per day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg per day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose; potassium clavulanate levels are adequate to inhibit β-lactamase–producing H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Risk factors for resistance include attendance at child care, antimicrobial treatment within the previous 30 days, and age younger than 2 years.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^75c77463]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is a common outpatient diagnosis and is typically treated with antibiotics even though the current recommended regimen (875 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg of clavulanate by mouth twice a day)has been shown in clinical trials to provide only minimal benefit beyond placebo. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends using high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate (containing amoxicillin 2000 mg rather than 875 mg twice a day) only when the prevalence in the community of penicillin-resistant pneumococci exceeds 10%. However, few primary care clinicians will know this prevalence, and evidence from studies in children of the penetration of amoxicillin into middle ear fluidand of the treatment of acute sinusitis with high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanatesuggests that higher-dose amoxicillin might provide more benefit to adults as well, even in areas with a low prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed from 2014 to 2017 comparing high-dose and standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate for adults with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis. That study confirmed that very few individuals carried resistant bacteria. The primary outcome was the participants' subjective rating of improvement after 3 days of treatment, knowing that most people get better by 2 weeks but value rapid relief and that the benefit of other common treatments — eg, for streptococcal pharyngitisand influenza — is largely a quicker improvement. The study drug was the extended-release formulation of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. Midway through the trial, the manufacturer stopped producing all formulations of the study drug. The study drug was transitioned to a combination of standard immediate-release amoxicillin with clavulanate (875/125 mg) and immediate-release amoxicillin (875 mg) twice a day. Unexpectedly, the extended-release formulation provided no significant benefit, but the immediate-release formulation did; in the second, immediate-release part of the study, 52% of participants receiving the high dose rated symptoms as "a lot better" at the end of 3 days of treatment vs 34% receiving the standard dose (P = 0.04).

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory practice. Although often caused by viruses, it sometimes is caused by bacteria, a condition that is called acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The signs and symptoms of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and prolonged viral upper respiratory infection are similar, which makes accurate clinical diagnosis difficult. Because two thirds of patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis improve without antibiotic treatment and most patients with viral upper respiratory infection improve within seven d antibiotic therapy should be reserved for use in patients who have had symptoms for more than seven days and meet clinical criteria. Four signs and symptoms are the most helpful in predicting acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain (especially unilateral), unilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, and worsening symptoms after initial improvement. Sinus radiography and ultrasonography are not recommended in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, although computed tomography has a role in the care of patients with recurrent or chronic symptoms.

Statement 7a: Diagnosis of Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) or Recurrent Acute Rhinosinusitis (RARS) — Clinicians should distinguish CRS and RARS from isolated episodes of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and other causes of sinonasal symptoms. This recommendation is based on cohort and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action profile specifies a quality improvement opportunity to promote effective communication and coordination of care by raising awareness of the distinct clinical entities of CRS and RARS so that appropriate management strategies may be implemented; aggregate evidence quality is Grade C (cohort and observational studies) with a high level of confidence in evidence. Benefits are to distinguish conditions that might benefit from additional management strategies than isolated cases of ABRS, while risks include potential misclassification due to overlapping symptomatology with other illnesses; no cost. The benefits-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, with value judgments emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis, intentional vagueness noted as none, and the role of patient preferences as not applicable.

### Short-duration therapy for respiratory tract infections [^460a7d35]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs) must be of sufficient duration to result in clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Elimination of the causative bacteria may prevent disease progression, relapse, or recurrence while minimizing the risk for emergence of resistant bacterial strains. Standard 10-day courses of antibiotic therapy often are not completed by patients. This may decrease the likelihood of bacterial eradication and contribute to increased selection of resistant organisms. The ideal antimicrobial agent for the treatment of CARTIs would have an appropriate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile for short-course therapy (eg, 5 days) without loss of either clinical or bacteriologic efficacy. Short-course therapy for CARTIs (such as acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia) has been demonstrated to be effective with antibiotics from several different classes, including the ketolide antimicrobials.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: the value of antimicrobial treatment and the natural history [^8c9684a5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Two areas of investigation were reviewed: (1) placebo-controlled trials of antimicrobial treatment involving patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis (ACABS) for whom pre- and posttherapy sinus aspirate cultures were not performed, and (2) uncontrolled trials of antimicrobial treatment involving patients with ACABS for whom pre- and posttherapy sinus aspirate cultures were performed. The clinical diagnostic criteria in the controlled trials were not correlated with sinus aspirate culture results and, thus, were of questionable validity. Most of the populations probably included patients with viral rhinosinusitis. In 10 uncontrolled studies, the posttreatment, weighted, pooled mean bacterial resolution rate (± standard error) at 7–10 days, based on sinus aspirate culture results, was 91% ± 10%. In 9 controlled trials, the weighted pooled mean rate of clinical improvement (± standard deviation) at 7–14 days for placebo recipients was 52% ± 18%. In 1 controlled trial in which diagnosis was based on duration of unimproved illness, 57% of placebo recipients and 85.5% of treated patients were healthy or had improved by day 10. Additional studies of ACABS are needed.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^85b082f7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosis in children emphasizes differentiating it from uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection (URI): Uncomplicated viral URIs typically last 5 to 7 days, with respiratory symptoms peaking by days 3 to 6, fever and constitutional symptoms disappearing in the first 24 to 48 hours, and some resolving signs persisting after day 10. Persistence without improvement of nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough (which may be worse at night), or both, suggests acute sinusitis, yet only a minority (~6%–7%) of children with URI symptoms meet criteria for persistence. An alternative presentation is worsening ("double sickening") with substantial acute worsening of respiratory symptoms or a new fever often on the sixth or seventh day after initial recovery. A severe-onset presentation is concurrent high fever (temperature > 39°C) and purulent nasal discharge for the first 3 to 4 days of an acute URI. Bad breath, fatigue, headache, and decreased appetite are not specific indicators, and physical examination, sinus percussion, and transillumination are not helpful; nasopharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the etiology.
