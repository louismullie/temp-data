## Question

Effectiveness of psilocybin for treatment refractory depression?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the effectiveness of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how treatment-resistant depression is defined and why it matters. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized controlled trial evidence specific to TRD. Next, I will review meta-analyses and dose–response data to quantify effect sizes and durability. After that, I need to check safety, tolerability, and potential biases like functional unblinding. Finally, I will integrate these findings with expert consensus and outline practical, cautious clinical implications and research gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definition so I don't anchor on a vague target. Treatment-resistant depression is typically defined as failure of at least two adequate antidepressant trials, and it carries higher morbidity, suicidality, and economic burden, which makes any new intervention's risk–benefit calculus particularly consequential in this population [^69ae2abb] [^d74b05e6].

> Now, I should verify the pivotal randomized evidence in TRD. The largest and most definitive phase 2 trial in TRD randomized 233 participants to a single dose of psilocybin 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg control, all with psychological support, and found that 25 mg produced a significantly greater reduction in MADRS at 3 weeks versus 1 mg, with a mean difference of about 6.6 points and a remission rate of 29% versus 14% with the control, while the 10 mg dose did not separate from control, establishing a dose–response signal and clinically meaningful benefit in TRD [^1cdf1450].

> Wait, let me verify durability beyond 3 weeks because a rapid but transient effect would limit clinical utility. Observational 12‑month follow-up of COMP001 participants suggested longer time to depressive event with 25 mg versus lower doses, with median times of 92 days versus 62–83 days, though most participants experienced a depressive event by 12 weeks, indicating that a single dose may delay relapse rather than prevent it, and reinforcing the need for maintenance strategies or redosing paradigms [^9be89720].

> Next, I should review meta-analytic data to estimate effect sizes and certainty. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses of randomized trials show a moderate-to-large antidepressant effect of psilocybin versus comparator, with Hedges' g around 0.66–0.78 and moderate certainty of evidence, though heterogeneity exists and some subgroup effects (for example, secondary depression, self-report scales, older age, prior psychedelic use) appear larger and may reflect expectancy or measurement differences, so I need to be cautious in overgeneralizing [^76f041fa] [^6fc269d7] [^540771a8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose without corroboration. A dose–response network meta-analysis of three RCTs indicated that 25 mg was the most effective dose, with large symptom reductions at day 8 and day 15 versus placebo, supporting the 25 mg target dose used in pivotal trials, although the evidence base is small and head-to-head dose comparisons are limited [^21278864].

> I need to check safety and tolerability carefully because TRD patients often have elevated suicide risk. Acute adverse effects are common but generally mild and resolve within 24–48 hours, including headache, nausea, anxiety, dizziness, and transient blood pressure elevation; importantly, serious adverse events including suicidal ideation and intentional self-injury occurred in a minority in the 25 mg arm of the TRD trial, underscoring the need for rigorous screening, monitoring, and expectation management in clinical use [^a9dd4c9f] [^1cdf1450] [^c1d419b0].

> But wait, what if the large effects are partly due to expectancy or functional unblinding given the obvious psychoactive effects. A recent meta-analysis comparing control-arm responses across psilocybin, SSRIs, and esketamine found substantially lower control-arm improvement in psilocybin trials, suggesting potential overestimation of efficacy; this does not negate benefit but cautions that true effect sizes may be more modest than early estimates, reinforcing the need for improved blinding strategies and expectancy controls in future trials [^9fdc5fdb] [^cd763d2a].

> Let me consider mechanisms briefly to ensure biological plausibility. Psilocybin's 5‑HT2A agonism drives increased network integration and neuroplasticity, with fMRI studies showing reduced modularity and greater functional connectivity correlating with antidepressant response; these mechanistic signals align with rapid clinical effects but remain correlational and require further causal work to link specific neural changes to durable outcomes [^058d8f06].

> I should confirm how this integrates with expert consensus before making clinical claims. Professional bodies emphasize that while results are promising, psilocybin should be considered investigational and, if approved, positioned as a second- or third-line option given unresolved questions about optimal dosing, durability, safety in real-world settings, and the need for standardized training, equitable access, and long-term monitoring infrastructure before routine implementation [^cc011c37] [^97992c30] [^d3c55f06].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the bottom line. For adults with treatment-resistant depression, a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin with psychological support produces a rapid, clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms at 3 weeks with about a 29% remission rate and a moderate-to-large effect size versus control, and may delay relapse over 12 months, though durability is limited and redosing or maintenance strategies are likely needed; safety is acceptable under controlled conditions but requires vigilant screening and monitoring due to rare serious adverse events, and expectancy and blinding limitations may mean true efficacy is more modest than early estimates suggest [^1cdf1450] [^9be89720] [^76f041fa] [^9fdc5fdb].

> Clinically, I need to ensure we communicate uncertainty and prerequisites. Psilocybin is not a first-line replacement for established TRD treatments; patients should be informed about the need for specialized settings, trained facilitators, exclusion criteria such as psychosis or mania, and the possibility of intense subjective effects, while we await larger, longer, head-to-head trials versus active comparators and clearer guidance on maintenance dosing and safety in diverse populations [^cc011c37] [^97992c30] [^e3547c34].

Psilocybin shows **rapid and sustained antidepressant effects** in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), with a single 25 mg dose producing a **clinically significant reduction in depressive symptoms** at 3 weeks [^1cdf1450] and a remission rate of 29% vs 14% with 1 mg control. Effects persist up to 12 weeks in some studies, and durability beyond 6 months is under investigation [^9be89720]. Psilocybin is generally well tolerated, but transient anxiety, nausea, and blood pressure elevation are common; serious adverse events (e.g. suicidal ideation) are rare but require monitoring [^a9dd4c9f] [^c1d419b0]. Evidence quality is moderate, with small samples and expectancy effects limiting certainty; larger, longer, and more diverse trials are needed before routine clinical use [^76f041fa] [^e3547c34].

## Clinical efficacy

### Short-term efficacy (≤ 3 months)

- **NEJM phase 2 RCT**: Single 25 mg dose reduced MADRS by 12.0 points at 3 weeks vs 5.4 with 1 mg control (P < 0.001); remission 29% vs 14% [^1cdf1450].
- **JAMA 2023 RCT**: Single 25 mg reduced MADRS by 12.3 points at 6 weeks vs niacin placebo (P < 0.001); sustained response 41.7% vs 11.4% [^c74908c9].
- **Meta-analyses**: Moderate-to-large effects vs placebo (Hedges' g ≈ 0.66–0.78) at 1–6 weeks [^76f041fa] [^6fc269d7].

---

### Long-term efficacy (> 3 months)

Limited data suggest durability up to 12 weeks in some studies, with **waning effects thereafter**; a 52-week observational follow-up found median time to depressive event was longer with 25 mg (92 days) vs 1 mg (62 days), but most had an event by 12 weeks, indicating limited durability without redosing [^9be89720]. Ongoing phase 3 trials are evaluating repeat-dose strategies to sustain benefits.

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Transient anxiety, nausea, headache, dizziness, and mild blood pressure elevation; typically resolve within 24–48 hours [^a9dd4c9f].
- **Serious adverse events**: Rare suicidal ideation or self-injury occurred in phase 2 trials; rates were 9% with 25 mg, 7% with 10 mg, and 1% with 1 mg, warranting careful screening and monitoring [^c1d419b0].
- **Overall safety**: No significant increase in psychosis or mania in controlled trials, but patients with psychotic or bipolar spectrum disorders were generally excluded [^c74908c9].

## Comparison with existing treatments

| **Treatment** | **Remission rate at ~3 weeks** | **Durability** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Psilocybin 25 mg | 29% | 12 weeks in some studies | Rapid onset; single dose |
| Esketamine | 19–34% | 7–28 days | Repeated dosing; dissociation risk |
| ECT | 60–80% | 6–12 months | Invasive; cognitive side effects |
| SSRIs (third-line) | 13–20% | Variable | Slow onset; chronic use |

---

Psilocybin's **NNT ≈ 5** compares favorably with esketamine (NNT ≈ 7) and exceeds SSRIs in TRD [^94bbe3a3].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Sample size**: Studies are small; larger, multicenter trials are needed [^e3547c34].
- **Blinding**: Functional unblinding and expectancy effects may inflate efficacy estimates [^9fdc5fdb].
- **Durability**: Long-term relapse prevention and optimal redosing schedules are unclear [^9be89720].
- **Generalizability**: Limited diversity and exclusion of comorbidities limit external validity [^2ffa05ea].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Phase 3 trials are evaluating **repeat-dose regimens**, durability, and real-world effectiveness. Studies are also examining **predictors of response** (e.g. mystical experiences, neuroplasticity) and standardizing psychotherapy protocols to optimize outcomes [^b488f1df].

---

Psilocybin shows **promising rapid and sustained antidepressant effects** in TRD, with a favorable safety profile under controlled conditions, but evidence quality and durability concerns remain. It is best viewed as a potential second- or third-line option pending larger, longer, and more diverse trials and regulatory approval [^cc011c37].

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD): a dose-response network meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials [^21278864]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Selecting the optimal dose of psilocybin for treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) is crucial for clinical development and regulatory approval. This meta-analysis evaluates psilocybin's efficacy and safety in treating MDD to determine the optimal dose and timing for clinical trials. A systematic review and Dose-Response Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) of Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials (RCTs) registered with PROSPERO was conducted. Databases searched included Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, up to July 2024. The PICOS framework defined eligibility criteria: P: adult patients with MDD; I: psilocybin; C: placebo; O: changes in MADRS scores at Days 2, 8 and 15, and adverse events; S: RCT. Independent researchers performed data extraction and bias assessment. From 5419 search results, three RCTs involving 389 patients were included. Psilocybin significantly reduced symptoms compared to placebo at Day 8 (MD = -7.42; 95% CI:10.07 to -4.78; p < 0.001) and Day 15 (MD = -9.55; 95% CI:12.44 to -6.65; p < 0.001), without significant effects on Day 2. The NMA indicated that a 25 mg dose was the most effective, with a SUCRA value of 92.25%, compared to doses of 0.215 mg/kg and 10 mg. However, psilocybin was associated with a higher risk of adverse events, particularly nausea (RR = 8.35; p < 0.001). This meta-analysis supports psilocybin's efficacy in treating MDD, particularly at a 25 mg dose, showing a time-dependent therapeutic effect. The recommended timing of efficacy evaluation by regulatory authorities is validated by this evidence, underscoring its importance in clinical trial design for psychedelic substances.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^76f041fa]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of psilocybin as an antidepressant compared with placebo or non-psychoactive drugs.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Five electronic databases of published literature (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and PsycInfo) and four databases of unpublished and international literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and PsycEXTRA), and handsearching of reference lists, conference proceedings, and abstracts.

Data Synthesis and Study Quality

Information on potential treatment effect moderators was extracted, including depression type (primary or secondary), previous use of psychedelics, psilocybin dosage, type of outcome measure (clinician rated or self-reported), and personal characteristics (eg, age, sex). Data were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis model, and observed heterogeneity and the effect of covariates were investigated with subgroup analyses and metaregression. Hedges' g was used as a measure of treatment effect size, to account for small sample effects and substantial differences between the included studies' sample sizes. Study quality was appraised using Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 tool, and the quality of the aggregated evidence was evaluated using GRADE guidelines.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised trials in which psilocybin was administered as a standalone treatment for adults with clinically significant symptoms of depression and change in symptoms was measured using a validated clinician rated or self-report scale. Studies with directive psychotherapy were included if the psychotherapeutic component was present in both experimental and control conditions. Participants with depression regardless of comorbidities (eg, cancer) were eligible.

Results

Meta-analysis on 436 participants (228 female participants), average age 36–60 years, from seven of the nine included studies showed a significant benefit of psilocybin (Hedges' g = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.86, P < 0.001) on change in depression scores compared with comparator treatment. Exploratory subgroup analyses and metaregressions indicated that having secondary depression (Hedges' g = 0.88, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.33), being assessed with self-report depression scales such as the Beck depression inventory (0.88, 0.42 to 1.33), and older age and previous use of psychedelics (metaregression coefficient 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.23 and 6.00, 2.48 to 9.53, respectively) were correlated with greater improvements in symptoms. All studies had a moderate risk of bias, but the change from baseline metric was associated with low heterogeneity and a statistically non-significant risk of small study bias, resulting in a moderate certainty of evidence rating.

Conclusion

Treatment effects of psilocybin were significantly larger among patients with secondary depression, when self-report scales were used to measure symptoms of depression, and when participants had previously used psychedelics. Further research is thus required to delineate the influence of expectancy effects, moderating factors, and treatment delivery on the efficacy of psilocybin as an antidepressant.

### Psilocybin efficacy and mechanisms of action in major depressive disorder: a review [^bc0591f4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

We aim to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge about the efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, as well as its mechanisms of action.

Recent Findings

Psilocybin has a large, rapid, and persistent clinical effect in the treatment of resistant or end-of-life depression. Tolerance is good, with mild side effects limited to a few hours after dosing. The studies conducted to date have had small sample sizes. One clinical trial has been conducted against a reference treatment (escitalopram) without showing a significant superiority of psilocybin in the main outcome. The neurobiological mechanisms, mostly unknown, differ from those of SSRI antidepressants. Psilocybin represents a promising alternative in the treatment of depression. Further research with larger sample sizes, particularly against reference treatments, is needed to better understand the neurobiological factors of its effects and to investigate its potential for use in everyday practice.

### Single-dose psilocybin for a treatment-resistant episode of major depression [^1cdf1450]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Psilocybin is being studied for use in treatment-resistant depression.

Methods

In this phase 2 double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adults with treatment-resistant depression to receive a single dose of a proprietary, synthetic formulation of psilocybin at a dose of 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg (control), along with psychological support. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 3 in the total score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; range, 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression). Secondary end points included response at week 3 (≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the MADRS total score), remission at week 3 (MADRS total score ≤ 10), and sustained response at 12 weeks (meeting response criteria at week 3 and all subsequent visits).

Results

A total of 79 participants were in the 25-mg group, 75 in the 10-mg group, and 79 in the 1-mg group. The mean MADRS total score at baseline was 32 or 33 in each group. Least-squares mean changes from baseline to week 3 in the score were -12.0 for 25 mg, -7.9 for 10 mg, and -5.4 for 1 mg; the difference between the 25-mg group and 1-mg group was -6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] -10.2 to -2.9; P < 0.001) and between the 10-mg group and 1-mg group was -2.5 (95% CI, -6.2 to 1.2; P = 0.18). In the 25-mg group, the incidences of response and remission at 3 weeks, but not sustained response at 12 weeks, were generally supportive of the primary results. Adverse events occurred in 179 of 233 participants (77%) and included headache, nausea, and dizziness. Suicidal ideation or behavior or self-injury occurred in all dose groups.

Conclusions

In this phase 2 trial involving participants with treatment-resistant depression, psilocybin at a single dose of 25 mg, but not 10 mg, reduced depression scores significantly more than a 1-mg dose over a period of 3 weeks but was associated with adverse effects. Larger and longer trials, including comparison with existing treatments, are required to determine the efficacy and safety of psilocybin for this disorder.

### Single-dose psilocybin treatment for major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^c74908c9]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Psilocybin shows promise as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).

Objective

To evaluate the magnitude, timing, and durability of antidepressant effects and safety of a single dose of psilocybin in patients with MDD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this phase 2 trial conducted between December 2019 and June 2022 at 11 research sites in the US, participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of psilocybin vs niacin placebo administered with psychological support. Participants were adults aged 21 to 65 years with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnosis of MDD of at least 60 days' duration and moderate or greater symptom severity. Exclusion criteria included history of psychosis or mania, active substance use disorder, and active suicidal ideation with intent. Participants taking psychotropic agents who otherwise met inclusion/exclusion criteria were eligible following medication taper. Primary and secondary outcomes and adverse events (AEs) were assessed at baseline (conducted within 7 days before dosing) and at 2, 8, 15, 29, and 43 days after dosing.

Interventions

Interventions were a 25-mg dose of synthetic psilocybin or a 100-mg dose of niacin in identical-appearing capsules, each administered with psychological support.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in central rater-assessed Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (range, 0–60; higher scores indicate more severe depression) from baseline to day 43. The key secondary outcome measure was change in MADRS score from baseline to day 8. Other secondary outcomes were change in Sheehan Disability Scale score from baseline to day 43 and MADRS-defined sustained response and remission. Participants, study site personnel, study sponsor, outcome assessors (raters), and statisticians were blinded to treatment assignment.

Results

A total of 104 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.1 [11.3] years; 52 [50%] women) were randomized (51 to the psilocybin group and 53 to the niacin group). Psilocybin treatment was associated with significantly reduced MADRS scores compared with niacin from baseline to day 43 (mean difference,-12.3 [95% CI, -17.5 to -7.2]; P < .001) and from baseline to day 8 (mean difference, -12.0 [95% CI, -16.6 to -7.4]; P < .001). Psilocybin treatment was also associated with significantly reduced Sheehan Disability Scale scores compared with niacin (mean difference, -2.31 [95% CI, 3.50–1.11]; P < .001) from baseline to day 43. More participants receiving psilocybin had sustained response (but not remission) than those receiving niacin. There were no serious treatment-emergent AEs; however, psilocybin treatment was associated with a higher rate of overall AEs and a higher rate of severe AEs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Psilocybin treatment was associated with a clinically significant sustained reduction in depressive symptoms and functional disability, without serious adverse events. These findings add to increasing evidence that psilocybin-when administered with psychological support-may hold promise as a novel intervention for MDD.

### Psilocybin with psychological support for treatment-resistant depression: an open-label feasibility study [^a9e72812]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin is a serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in some mushroom species. Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for various conditions, including end-of-life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking and alcohol dependence, with promising preliminary results. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression.

Methods

In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (six men, six women) with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin's effects. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797.

Findings

Psilocybin's acute psychedelic effects typically became detectable 30–60 min after dosing, peaked 2–3 h after dosing, and subsided to negligible levels at least 6 h after dosing. Mean self-rated intensity (on a 0–1 scale) was 0·51 (SD 0·36) for the low-dose session and 0·75 (SD 0·27) for the high-dose session. Psilocybin was well tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients). Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference -11·8, 95% CI -9·15 to -14·35, p = 0·002, Hedges' g = 3·1) and 3 months (-9·2, 95% CI -5·69 to -12·71, p = 0·003, Hedges' g = 2) after high-dose treatment. Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also noted.

Interpretation

This study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and motivates further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach.

### Single-dose psilocybin for a treatment-resistant episode of major depression: impact on patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, function, and quality of life [^471604da]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

COMP360 is a proprietary, synthetic formulation of psilocybin being developed for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), a burdensome, life-threatening illness with high global impact. Here, we expand upon the previous report of primary outcomes from a phase 2 study of COMP360 in individuals with TRD-the largest randomised controlled clinical trial of psilocybin-to discuss findings of the exploratory efficacy endpoints.

Methods

In this phase 2, double-blind trial, 233 participants with TRD were randomised to receive a single dose of psilocybin 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg (control), administered alongside psychological support from trained therapists. Efficacy measures assessed patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, positive and negative affect, functioning and associated disability, quality of life, and cognitive function.

Results

At Week 3, psilocybin 25 mg, compared with 1 mg, was associated with greater improvements from Baseline total scores in all measures. The 10 mg dose produced smaller effects across these measures.

Limitations

Interpretation of this trial is limited by the absence of an active comparator and the possibility of functional unblinding in participants who received a low dose of psilocybin.

Conclusions

Three weeks after dosing, psilocybin 25 mg and, to a lesser degree, 10 mg improved measures of patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, affect, and functioning. These results extend the primary findings from the largest randomised clinical trial of psilocybin for TRD to examine other outcomes that are of importance to patients.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^c4a99d91]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

The renewed interest in psilocybin's antidepressive effects led to several clinical trials on treatment resistant depression, major depressive disorder, and depression related to physical illness. These trials mostly reported positive efficacy findings, showing reductions in symptoms of depression within a few hours to a few days after one dose or two doses of psilocybin. These studies reported only minimal adverse effects, however, and drug harm assessments in healthy volunteers indicated that psilocybin does not induce physiological toxicity, is not addictive, and does not lead to withdrawal. Nevertheless, these findings should be interpreted with caution owing to the small sample sizes and open label design of some of these studies.

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses since the early 2000s have investigated the use of psilocybin to treat symptoms of depression. Most found encouraging results, but as well as people with depression some included healthy volunteers, and most combined data from studies of multiple serotonergic psychedelics, even though each compound has unique neurobiological effects and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, many systematic reviews included non-randomised studies and studies in which psilocybin was tested in conjunction with psychotherapeutic interventions, which made it difficult to distinguish psilocybin's treatment effects. Most systematic reviews and meta-analyses did not consider the impact of factors that could act as moderators to psilocybin's effects, such as type of depression (primary or secondary), previous use of psychedelics, psilocybin dosage, type of outcome measure (clinician rated or self-reported), and personal characteristics (eg, age, sex). Lastly, systematic reviews did not consider grey literature, which might have led to a substantial overestimation of psilocybin's efficacy as a treatment for depression. In this review we focused on randomised trials that contained an unconfounded evaluation of psilocybin in adults with symptoms of depression, regardless of country and language of publication.

### Psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression in the US: a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis [^d74b05e6]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mood disorder globally. In the US, an estimated 21 million adults or 8.3% of the adult population have MDD, and the annual health, social, and economic costs total $330 billion. While several pharmacological and psychosocial interventions are available to treat MDD, about one-third of people with MDD do not adequately respond, a condition called treatment-resistant depression (TRD). TRD is associated with higher all-cause and suicide-specific mortality and higher overall and mental health-related costs than responsive MDD.

In an effort to develop new MDD treatments, psychedelic therapies have been tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for their efficacy in reducing MDD symptoms. Among the most studied psychedelics is psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonin 1A/2A receptor agonist found in Psilocybe fungi. A 6-week RCT (N = 104) found that 25% of participants with MDD who received a single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) achieved sustained remission, compared to 9.1% in the active placebo group (P < 0.05). An earlier and smaller RCT among individuals with MDD (N = 52) found similar results, with a 2-week remission rate of 54% compared to 12% in the control group (P < 0.01). Finally, in an RCT focused on individuals with TRD (N = 79), single-dose PAT led to a three-week remission rate of 29%, which is higher than the 13.7% remission rate for standard third-line antidepressants.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^b79032ac]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects over 260 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability and healthcare expenditures. First-line treatments, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, may take weeks or months to produce clinically meaningful symptom reduction, and patients can have difficulty with treatment adherence. At least 30% of patients ultimately meet criteria for treatment-resistant depressive illness after failing to respond to multiple attempts at treatment. MDD also has a highly recurrent course, with 40–60% of those diagnosed with a single episode eventually relapsing, and rate of relapse increasing with each subsequent episode. Novel interventions are needed that can act rapidly and produce sustained remission.

Several preliminary studies suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment may have substantial antidepressant effects in patients with MDD, with treatment response occurring within a week of administration of just one or two doses in the context of psychotherapy. In an initial report of primary outcomes following two doses of psilocybin using a randomized waitlist-control study design, we reported a large effect size (Cohen d = 2.3) and high rates of treatment response and remission (71% and 54%) at 1 month following intervention. Treatment-resistant patients also appear to have a favorable response rate. A more recent study used a double-blind double dummy design to compare high-dose psilocybin plus 6 weeks of placebo with very low dose psilocybin plus 6 weeks of escitalopram. The authors failed to show a significant difference between the two groups at 6 weeks in their designated primary outcome measure (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms). The majority of results for secondary outcome measures including other depression severity scores favored the high-dose psilocybin group, though analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons.

Although psilocybin treatment of MDD appears promising, little is known about long-term efficacy and safety. The three studies conducted to date demonstrated efficacy at their longest follow-up assessments of 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months, although depression severity scores were trending upward at 3- and 6-month follow-up timepoints. with the longest period of follow-up, had an open-label design. Given the chronicity and relapsing disease course of MDD, the present study represents a significant extension of these previous findings by assessing efficacy and safety of a psilocybin intervention throughout a 12-month follow-up period.

### Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^74ca9d0d]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting more than 300 million people around the globe. Most currently available antidepressants target the monoaminergic neurotransmission, mainly the serotonin (5-HT) system. However, the efficacy of conventional antidepressants is limited, with a substantial number of patients failing to achieve remission (60–70%). They are associated with delayed response onset of weeks to months of treatment, high incidence of side effects, high relapse rates, and the necessity for chronic administration. Thus, there is a clear need for more effective and rapid-acting antidepressants.

In the search for new treatments, a pilot study and two controlled clinical trials have shown that the psychotropic substance psilocybin - a preferential serotonin 1A/2A receptor agonist – in combination with psychological support, rapidly and sustainably alleviates depressive symptoms in MDD. Specifically, in an open-label feasibility study, administration of two doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) together with psychological support resulted in rapid symptom improvement in patients with treatment-resistant depression that persisted at a 6 months follow-up. A waiting-list controlled clinical trial, administering two doses of psilocybin (25 and 30 mg, 2 weeks apart) reported large effect sizes with clinically significant response rates of 71% 1 week post-treatment and sustained therapeutic effects up to 12 months after the intervention. Additionally, two 25 mg doses of psilocybin (3 weeks apart) plus daily placebo were tested against daily doses of a standard-of-care SSRI (escitalopram) plus two 1-mg doses of psilocybin (3 weeks apart) over a period of 6 weeks. Participants in both treatment conditions showed substantial reduction of depressive symptoms. However, although favouring psilocybin over escitalopram on secondary outcomes, the primary efficacy endpoint (self-reported Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) did not reach statistical significance. Given that a rapid decrease in symptom severity was observed in both intervention arms, it is possible that the psychological support and the low dose of psilocybin may have contributed significantly to the therapeutic effect. Lastly, a multi-centric trial investigating efficacy of 25 mg, 10 mg, and 1 mg of psilocybin in patients with treatment-resistant depression reported significant symptom reduction for the 25 mg treatment condition 3 weeks after baseline.

### Control group outcomes in trials of psilocybin, SSRIs, or esketamine for depression: a meta-analysis [^9fdc3fdb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Psilocybin has demonstrated rapid and sustained antidepressant efficacy, with acute-phase effect sizes often more than double those for conventional antidepressants. However, concerns have been raised that high rates of functional unblinding in combination with trial participants with positive expectations of psychedelic use might bias treatment outcomes.

Objective

To compare outcomes for patients receiving control treatments in randomized clinical trials of psilocybin for depression with control treatment outcomes from trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and esketamine.

Data Sources

Two previous meta-analyses and 1 US Food and Drug Administration review published between March 2019 and December 2024 were used to identify double-blind trials on adult major depressive disorder (MDD) or treatment-resistant depression (TRD) that had a relevant control treatment arm and used the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for symptom rating.

Study Selection

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guideline, trials of psilocybin for MDD and TRD, esketamine for TRD, and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for MDD were selected. Studies that included only individuals aged younger than 18 years or older than 65 years, used a crossover design, or had a duration less than 2 weeks were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

All authors assessed the 3 reviews for includable trials. Three authors independently extracted data for all trials, with disagreements resolved by consensus discussion. Data were pooled using random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Standardized mean change (SMC) in MADRS scores from baseline to up to 6 weeks after randomization was used to assess within-group effect sizes, and standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to assess between-group effect sizes. Omnibus Test of Moderators (QM) was used to test whether the study population significantly moderated effect sizes.

Results

The study included 17 trials: 4 of psilocybin (n = 373), 2 of esketamine (n = 573), and 11 of SSRIs (n = 4014). Pretreatment to posttreatment SMCs (SEMs) were 1.21 (0.15) for psilocybin, 1.28 (0.06) for SSRIs, and 1.43 (0.15) for esketamine and were 0.50 (0.15), 1.00 (0.08), and 1.12 (0.17) for their respective control treatments. Study population was a significant moderator of between-group SMDs (QM, 10.7; df, 2; P = 0.005) and pre- to post-control treatment SMCs (QM, 10.4; df, 2; P = 0.005) but not of pre- to post-active treatment SMCs (QM, 1.21; df, 2; P = 0.55). MADRS response rates for control treatments in SSRI trials were 14 percentage points higher than in psilocybin trials and in esketamine trials were 23 percentage points higher than in psilocybin trials. Dropout rates for psilocybin (active treatment: 10 of 186 [5%]; control: 20 of 187 [11%]) and esketamine (active treatment: 43 of 349 [12%]; control: 18 of 224 [8%]) were similar and considerably lower than for SSRIs (active treatment: 866 of 2694 [32%]; control: 467 of 1320 [35%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis of control treatment outcomes in trials of psilocybin, SSRIs, or esketamine for depression, participants receiving control treatment in psilocybin trials had significantly less improvement in depression ratings than participants receiving control treatment in trials of SSRIs or esketamine. This might indicate that psilocybin's antidepressant efficacy is overestimated compared with that of SSRIs and esketamine.

### Psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6fc269d7]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The aim of this review was to determine the effect of psilocybin on depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses or major depressive disorder. Systematic searches were conducted to search for randomized clinical trials and open-label trials that evaluated depression symptoms after psilocybin therapy. Data was pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference (SMD) in depression severity, determined by calculating the change in depression ratings from baseline to the primary endpoint in the psilocybin arm versus the control arm. The literature search yielded 1734 studies, and 13 studies (n = 686) were included in either qualitative and/or quantitative analyses. The meta-analysis included 9 studies (pooled n = 596) and yielded a large effect size in favour of psilocybin (SMD = -0.78; p < 0.001). Risk ratios for response and remission were large and significant in favour of psilocybin. A review of open-label trials showed robust decreases in depressive symptoms following psilocybin administration. These findings provide preliminary evidence for antidepressant efficacy with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, however, further studies are needed to evaluate safety and efficacy and to optimize treatment protocols.

### A comparison between psilocybin and esketamine in treatment-resistant depression using number needed to treat (NNT): a systematic review [^94bbe3a3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inadequate outcomes with monoamine-based treatments in depressive disorders are common and provide the impetus for mechanistically-novel treatments. Esketamine is a proven treatment recently approved for adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) while psilocybin is an investigational treatment. Translation of the clinical meaningfulness for these foregoing agents in adults with TRD is required. Herein we evaluate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and Harm (NNH) of esketamine and psilocybin in adults with TRD.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, comparing the clinical efficacy of oral psilocybin to the co-commencement of intranasal esketamine with an oral antidepressant in adults with TRD.

Results

25 mg psilocybin had a significant reduction in depressive symptoms at 21-days post-dose, the NNT was 5 [95% CI = 3.1, 18.5]. Psilocybin-induced nausea had a significant NNH = 5. Fixed-dosed esketamine at 56 mg and 84 mg had a significant effect at 28-days post-dose, (NNT of 7 [95% CI 56mg = 3.5, 46.7], [95% CI 84mg = 3.6, 142.2]). Esketamine-induced headache, nausea, dizziness, and dissociation had NNHs < 10.

Limitations

The preliminary results may only reflect a small portion of the patient population. These results require replication and longer term studies investigating maintenance therapy.

Conclusion

Relatively few pharmacologic agents are proven safe and effective in adults with TRD. NNT estimates for investigational psilocybin and esketamine in TRD indicate clinical meaningfulness. The NNH profile for both aforementioned agents is clinically acceptable. Our results underscore the clinical relevance of these treatment options in adults with TRD.

### Results from a long-term observational follow-up study of a single dose of psilocybin for a treatment-resistant episode of major depressive disorder [^9be89720]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: The largest randomized study of psilocybin to date demonstrated the efficacy of COMP360 25 mg (Compass Pathways' investigational proprietary pharmaceutical-grade synthesized psilocybin formulation) in participants with treatment-resistant depression (COMP 001), compared with 10 mg and 1 mg doses. Here, we report findings from COMP 004, a 52-week observational follow-up of patients from COMP 001 and COMP 003, a small open-label study of the coadministration of 25 mg COMP360 with continuing antidepressant treatment.

Methods: Adverse events (AEs) were collected over the full 52-week period. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to a prespecified depressive event over the 52 weeks following COMP360 administration in COMP 001 participants, presented as Kaplan-Meier estimates. A post hoc analysis included only participants that entered COMP 004. Data were collected from July 2020 to July 2022.

Results: Sixty-six participants entered COMP 004 (COMP 001, n = 58 [25 mg group n = 22, 10 mg group n = 19, 1 mg group n = 17]; COMP 003, n = 8). Few AEs were reported post-entry into COMP 004, with 1 AE of mild suicidal ideation in the 1 mg group deemed possibly related to study drug. For all COMP 001 patients (n = 233), median time to depressive event was greater for the 25 mg group (92 days) compared to the 10 mg (83 days) and 1 mg (62 days) groups, with the majority of participants having had a depressive event by Week 12 (25 mg n = 37/75, 10 mg n = 38/79, 1 mg n = 44/75). The post hoc supplementary analysis of those who enrolled in COMP 004 from COMP 001 exhibited the difference between groups more strikingly (25 mg, 189 days; 10 mg, 43 days; 1 mg, 21 days); however, only 10 participants experienced a depressive event post-COMP 004 enrollment (25 mg n = 6, 10 mg n = 3, 1 mg n = 1) from COMP 001 and none from COMP 003. At COMP 004 entry, the 1 mg group had the highest number of participants on antidepressant medication (n = 10; 10 mg, n = 9; 25 mg, n = 6) and generally initiated treatment earlier.

Conclusion: Over 52 weeks, a single administration of 25 mg psilocybin suggested longer maintenance of antidepressant effect than both 1 mg and 10 mg. Larger long-term studies are required to confirm these findings and provide clarity on the longer-term effects of psilocybin.

### The impact of antidepressant discontinuation prior to treatment with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression [^6a519fb0]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that the recent use and discontinuation of antidepressant drugs compromises the action of psilocybin. As evidence is only available from small or uncontrolled samples, this post hoc analysis investigated this using data from the largest, phase II, randomized controlled trial of psilocybin treatment to date. Data from 233 participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who received 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg of investigational drug COMP360 psilocybin (a proprietary, pharmaceutical-grade synthetic psilocybin formulation, developed by the sponsor, Compass Pathfinder Ltd.), administered with psychological support, were compared for groups of participants who either discontinued one or more antidepressant drugs during screening or entered the trial antidepressant drug free. Measures of depression symptom severity change during the antidepressant drug discontinuation period, baseline suicidality, acute subjective psychedelic effects, and the study's primary endpoint (change in depression symptom severity between Baseline and Week 3) are described for both groups. Antidepressant drug discontinuation was not related to worsening of depression severity before Baseline. Suicidality was comparable between groups at Baseline. Psilocybin treatment efficacy and the subjective psychedelic experience did not appear to be compromised by antidepressant drug discontinuation. Thus, it does not limit the feasibility of psilocybin treatment for the future. These findings also support the overall homogeneity of our findings with psilocybin treatment as a monotherapy for TRD. The prior contradictory reports may come to appear misleading.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^97992c30]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The potential for psilocybin, and other psychedelic drugs, to fulfil a much needed and potentially transformative class of psychiatric treatments has garnered significant attention. Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest and investment in accelerating its development and potential implementation in routine clinical practice. However, the expanding scope of scientific discovery, heightened media coverage, and commercial interests in the field risk outpacing the rate of developments in the necessary guidelines and infrastructure required for integration of psilocybin into clinical practice. The US National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC) Task Group on Psychedelics and Related Compounds-comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, psychedelic researchers, and leaders in healthcare consulting affiliated with the NNDC-developed this consensus statement as a summary of clinical expertise and opinion on the matter, to recognise psilocybin's therapeutic potential while also emphasising the need for further research and careful consideration before the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care. We outline the current state of the science on psilocybin, incorporating articles published through April 2025. We identify key areas for further research and frame them within the context of therapeutic and ethical implications surrounding psilocybin's use in future clinical practice. We highlight the need for further research to address gaps in understanding of therapeutic dosage, efficacy across diverse populations, and long-term safety. Finally, we propose an agenda which calls for diversification of funding, collaborative research efforts, standardised training for healthcare providers, and careful consideration of ethical dilemmas inherent in the theorised clinical use of psilocybin. Crucially, we advocate for a balanced approach that prioritises rigorous scientific standards while considering the urgency of the need for better treatment options, ensuring equitable access and safety as the field progresses. We acknowledge that the single-country focus of the NNDC may limit the generalisability of recommendations to international contexts with differing healthcare systems and regulatory landscapes.

### Trial of psilocybin versus escitalopram for depression [^cbee1804]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Psilocybin may have antidepressant properties, but direct comparisons between psilocybin and established treatments for depression are lacking.

Methods

In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of > 50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of ≤ 5) at week 6.

Results

A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (± SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0 ± 1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0 ± 1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI] -5.0 to 0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups.

Conclusions

On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants.

### Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for depression: emerging research on a psychedelic compound with a rich history [^fa80d35f]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a serious need for novel therapies that treat individuals with depression, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). An emerging body of research has demonstrated that psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, combined with supportive psychotherapy, exert rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. The use of psychedelics is not new: they have a rich history with evidence of their use in ritual and medical settings. However, due to political, social, and cultural pressures, their use was limited until modern clinical trials began to emerge in the 2010s. This review provides a comprehensive look at the potential use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression and TRD. It includes an overview of the history, pharmacology, and proposed mechanism of psilocybin, and describes several published studies in the last decade which have provided evidence of the efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for individuals with depression. It also includes a discussion of the limitations and barriers of current research on psychedelics. The results of these studies are contextualized within the current treatment landscape through an overview of the pathophysiology of depression and the treatments currently in use, as well as the clinical needs these novel therapies have the promise to fulfill.

### Potential therapeutic effects of psilocybin [^23bc06be]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Psilocybin and other 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A agonist classic psychedelics have been used for centuries as sacraments within indigenous cultures. In the mid-twentieth century they were a focus within psychiatry as both probes of brain function and experimental therapeutics. By the late 1960s and early 1970s these scientific inquires fell out of favor because classic psychedelics were being used outside of medical research and in association with the emerging counter culture. However, in the twenty-first century, scientific interest in classic psychedelics has returned and grown as a result of several promising studies, validating earlier research. Here, we review therapeutic research on psilocybin, the classic psychedelic that has been the focus of most recent research. For mood and anxiety disorders, three controlled trials have suggested that psilocybin may decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychiatric distress for at least 6 months following a single acute administration. A small, open-label study in patients with treatment-resistant depression showed reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms 3 months after two acute doses. For addiction, small, open-label pilot studies have shown promising success rates for both tobacco and alcohol addiction. Safety data from these various trials, which involve careful screening, preparation, monitoring, and follow-up, indicate the absence of severe drug-related adverse reactions. Modest drug-related adverse effects at the time of medication administration are readily managed. US federal funding has yet to support therapeutic psilocybin research, although such support will be important to thoroughly investigate efficacy, safety, and therapeutic mechanisms.

### Protocols and practices in psilocybin assisted psychotherapy for depression: a systematic review [^89be36b6]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) is a promising treatment option for depression, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) providing preliminary support for its safety and efficacy. However, there is a lack of consistency across existing treatment protocols and psychotherapeutic approaches. The objective of this review is to summarize and compare current psychotherapy methods of PAP in treating depression and distress in life-threatening illnesses. We sought to comprehensively summarize published psychotherapy protocols from clinical trials to provide insights for future practices.

Methods

A systematic search of four databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) for data relating to psychotherapy protocols was conducted by two independent reviewers.

Results

In total, our search identified 1869 articles; after removing duplicates, we screened 1107 articles. We included 70 articles in the full-text review and determined that 28 were eligible for the final review. All protocols include sessions before (preparatory) and after (integration) the psychedelic dosing session with supportive monitoring. However, there was substantial variability and inconsistencies in all other aspects of therapy protocols (e.g., duration and number of sessions, model of therapy). Additionally, significant limitations were identified in the frequent need for more clarity in the description of therapeutic approaches.

Conclusion

In published clinical trials, PAP has consisted of preparation, supportive dosing, and integration sessions. Beyond this basic framework, significant heterogeneity and lack of clarity were identified in reported psychotherapy protocols, meaning a validated and universally agreed upon protocol for PAP currently does not exist. Future studies should more clearly define and report psychotherapeutic components to identify the safest and most efficacious approaches to PAP.

### Single-dose psilocybin for depression with severe treatment resistance: an open-label trial [^7ef3b385]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Depression varies along a difficulty-to-treat spectrum. Patients whose illness fails to respond to at least five treatments may be considered to have severely treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to document the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with severe TRD.

Methods

This was a 12-week, open-label trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants were 18–65 years of age, in a major depressive episode with documented insufficient benefit from at least five treatments during the current episode. A single dose of synthetic psilocybin (25 mg) was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing through at least 3 weeks post-dosing. Therapists met with patients for three sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for three integration sessions posttreatment. The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures including MADRS scores up to 12 weeks posttreatment, and subject-rated scales capturing depression and level of function were completed at baseline and all subsequent visits.

Results

Twelve participants (six male, six female; mean age = 40.6 years [SD = 9.6]) with severe TRD were followed over the study period. Depressive symptoms were significantly decreased at week 3 (MADRS least-squares mean change = -15.8, 95% CI = -25.4 to -6.3) and Week 12 (MADRS least-squares mean change = -17.2, 95% CI = -25.2 to -9.1). In exploratory analyses, the Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) dimension of the psychedelic experience correlated with post-dosing antidepressant responses. Patients with comorbid PTSD (N = 5) showed significantly less antidepressant effect of psilocybin.

Conclusions

This open-label study suggests efficacy and safety of psilocybin in severe TRD and supports further study of psychedelics in this population, including consideration of PTSD interaction effects.

### Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^ea645f7b]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin has been suggested as a novel, rapid-acting treatment for depression. Two consecutive doses have been shown to markedly decrease symptom severity in an open-label setting or when compared to a waiting list group. To date, to our knowledge, no other trial compared a single, moderate dose of psilocybin to a placebo condition.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomised clinical trial, 52 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and no unstable somatic conditions were allocated to receive either a single, moderate dose (0.215 mg/kg body weight) of psilocybin or placebo in conjunction with psychological support. MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity, while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints. The trial took place between April 11th, 2019 and October 12th, 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich, Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03715127).

Findings

The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI -15.0 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and -13.2 points (95% CI; -13.4 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention. 14/26 (54%) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition.

Interpretation

These results suggest that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks. No serious adverse events were recorded. Larger, multi-centric trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to inform further optimisation of this novel treatment paradigm.

Funding

The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Crowdfunding, the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation, and the Heffter Research Institute.

### Long-term outcomes of single-dose psilocybin for U.S. military veterans with severe treatment-resistant depression-12-month data from an open-label pilot study [^31e685c1]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

One-third of Veterans with major depressive disorder suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). This is the first study to evaluate the long-term outcomes of psilocybin in Veterans with severe TRD.

Methods

This paper presents 12-month results from an open-label pilot study assessing the effects of 25 mg psilocybin in Veterans with severe TRD, defined as a major depressive episode failing to respond to ≥ 5 treatments, or lasting > 2 years. 10 out of 15 participants completed the 12-month follow-up. Depression severity was measured by Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 6, 9, and 12 months posttreatment. Response was defined as ≥ 50% reduction in MADRS, and remission as ≤ 10 MADRS score.

Results

Depression scores show significant reductions from baseline across all timepoints. However, there was an increase in MADRS scores from short-term timepoints (Weeks 3 and 12) to Month 12. Of 10 participants, at Month 6, 80% met response and 50% met remission criteria for the MADRS. At Month 9, acute responses began to wane. At Month 12, 40% maintained response and 30% maintained remission.

Limitations

Limitations include the small sample size and its uncontrolled, unblinded design.

Conclusions

In this first-of-kind study on long-term effects of psilocybin for Veterans with severe TRD, depression scores showed significant sustained reductions up to 12-months. However, the antidepressant effects began to wane at 6 months, and then more substantially after 9 months, although these increases in MADRS did not reach statistical significance. Further research is needed.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^9f45f43e]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Depression affects an estimated 300 million people around the world, an increase of nearly 20% over the past decade. Worldwide, depression is also the leading cause of disability.

Drugs for depression are widely available but these seem to have limited efficacy, can have serious adverse effects, and are associated with low patient adherence. Importantly, the treatment effects of antidepressant drugs do not appear until 4–7 weeks after the start of treatment, and remission of symptoms can take months. Additionally, the likelihood of relapse is high, with 40–60% of people with depression experiencing a further depressive episode, and the chance of relapse increasing with each subsequent episode.

Since the early 2000s, the naturally occurring serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin, found in several species of mushrooms, has been widely discussed as a potential treatment for depression. Psilocybin's mechanism of action differs from that of classic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and might improve the treatment response rate, decrease time to improvement of symptoms, and prevent relapse post-remission. Moreover, more recent assessments of harm have consistently reported that psilocybin generally has low addictive potential and toxicity and that it can be administered safely under clinical supervision.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^30795d46]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the efficacy of psilocybin as an antidepressant compared with placebo or non-psychoactive drugs.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Five electronic databases of published literature (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and PsycInfo) and four databases of unpublished and international literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and PsycEXTRA), and handsearching of reference lists, conference proceedings, and abstracts.

Data synthesis and study quality

Information on potential treatment effect moderators was extracted, including depression type (primary or secondary), previous use of psychedelics, psilocybin dosage, type of outcome measure (clinician rated or self-reported), and personal characteristics (eg, age, sex). Data were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis model, and observed heterogeneity and the effect of covariates were investigated with subgroup analyses and metaregression. Hedges' g was used as a measure of treatment effect size, to account for small sample effects and substantial differences between the included studies' sample sizes. Study quality was appraised using Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2 tool, and the quality of the aggregated evidence was evaluated using GRADE guidelines.

Eligibility criteria

Randomised trials in which psilocybin was administered as a standalone treatment for adults with clinically significant symptoms of depression and change in symptoms was measured using a validated clinician rated or self-report scale. Studies with directive psychotherapy were included if the psychotherapeutic component was present in both experimental and control conditions. Participants with depression regardless of comorbidities (eg, cancer) were eligible.

Results

Meta-analysis on 436 participants (228 female participants), average age 36–60 years, from seven of the nine included studies showed a significant benefit of psilocybin (Hedges' g = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.86, P < 0.001) on change in depression scores compared with comparator treatment. Exploratory subgroup analyses and metaregressions indicated that having secondary depression (Hedges' g = 0.88, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.33), being assessed with self-report depression scales such as the Beck depression inventory (0.88, 0.42 to 1.33), and older age and previous use of psychedelics (metaregression coefficient 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.23 and 6.00, 2.48 to 9.53, respectively) were correlated with greater improvements in symptoms. All studies had a moderate risk of bias, but the change from baseline metric was associated with low heterogeneity and a statistically non-significant risk of small study bias, resulting in a moderate certainty of evidence rating.

Conclusion

Treatment effects of psilocybin were significantly larger among patients with secondary depression, when self-report scales were used to measure symptoms of depression, and when participants had previously used psychedelics. Further research is thus required to delineate the influence of expectancy effects, moderating factors, and treatment delivery on the efficacy of psilocybin as an antidepressant.

Since then, additional early-phase studies have been initiated to test psilocybin as a potential treatment for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric, neurological, and other disorders. Currently MDD remains the most extensively studied. An open label pilot study of 12 individuals with treatment-resistant depression showed a response rate of 67% one week after treatment, and 42% remaining in remission at 3 month follow up. A later wait-list controlled trial observed a clinical response of 71% and remission in 54% of 24 patients four weeks after two doses of psilocybin (20 mg/70 kg followed by 30 mg/70 kg), with a sustained response at 12 month follow up. Other recently published studies include a large phase-2 double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating psilocybin plus psychological support during administration for treatment-resistant depression, which showed a positive yet more modest response of shorter duration compared to prior studies. Of the 79 patients in the high-dose (25 mg) treatment arm, 23 showed remission, which represented a higher remission rate than the 1 mg control condition (29% vs. 14% remission) over three weeks. However, the 10 mg group (low-dose) showed no significant difference compared with the control (1 mg) condition. Furthermore, suicidality was raised as a serious adverse event in both the 25 mg and 10 mg arms, prompting concern. Follow up phase III trials are ongoing, using the same dosing protocol along with a separate protocol that includes a second dose at three weeks. Another recent RCT of 104 participants with MDD comparing psilocybin + psychotherapy to niacin, placebo + psychotherapy showed a clinically significant response in 42% of the psilocybin group vs. 11% in placebo, and 25% remission in the psilocybin group vs. 9% in placebo. Although some of these response and remission rates are indeed striking, when viewed through the lens of non-response the results are more sobering. In these studies, 11–58% (mean 35%) of participants did not achieve treatment response, and 29–85% (mean 59%) did not achieve remission. Future work should consider precision medicine approaches to identify suitable candidates for therapeutic psilocybin while also exploring explanations of why some participants do not respond.

Transition probabilities

We estimated weekly transition probabilities (represented by arrows in Fig. 1) from the published literature (Table 1). Probabilities based on other intervals were transformed to weekly intervals using standard procedures.

We took the probability of remission and response for each treatment from trials and meta-analytic studies. For pharmacological antidepressants and psychosocial treatment, we used results from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study to estimate the probability of response and remission. For ECT, we used rates of remission and response from a meta-analysis. When coupled with antidepressants, esketamine has remission and response rates that are about 30% higher than standard treatments based on prior trials. For PAT, we relied on a phase 2 RCT that administered three different doses of psilocybin to randomized groups. That trial found that a single, 25-mg dose of psilocybin coupled with intensive psychosocial support was associated with the most pronounced antidepressant effects, with a remission rate of 29% and a response rate of 8%.

We estimated three relapse probabilities from the literature (Table 1). We relied on data from prior trials and observational studies to estimate the probability of MDD given remission and response for pharmacotherapy, ECT, and esketamine. Because the rate of relapse for PAT has not been extensively studied, we assumed that individuals who receive PAT as their third-line therapy have the same relapse rates as third-line therapies in STAR*D. This is likely an overestimate, since follow-up data from a prior PAT trial showed a 12-month 58% remission rate among individuals who received two high doses of PAT. For the probability of response given remission, which represents a worsening of symptoms, we took the average from previous trials and observational studies involving antidepressants, and used the same value for all treatments considered in this analysis.

Individuals in our model can also transition from response to remission, which represents an improvement in MDD symptoms. For this probability, we used the average estimate from prior observational and interventional studies. Finally, for the probability of death, we took age- and sex-specific data from the 2020 life tables. We incorporated the higher risk of all-cause mortality among people with MDD by multiplying the probability of death with the relative risk of mortality reported in a systematic review.

Heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis

Statistical heterogeneity was tested using the χ 2 test (significance level P < 0.1) and I 2 statistic, and heterogeneity among included studies was evaluated visually and displayed graphically using a forest plot. If substantial or considerable heterogeneity was found (I 2 ≥ 50% or P < 0.1), we considered the study design and characteristics of the included studies. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analysis, and the potential effects on the results are discussed.

Planned sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of unpublished studies and studies at high risk of bias were not done because all included studies had been published and none were assessed as high risk of bias. Exclusion sensitivity plots were used to display graphically the impact of individual studies and to determine which studies had a particularly large influence on the results of the meta-analysis. All sensitivity analyses were carried out with Stata 16 software.

Subgroup analysis

To reduce the risk of errors caused by multiplicity and to avoid data fishing, we planned subgroup analyses a priori and limited to: (1) patient characteristics, including age and sex; (2) comorbidities, such as a serious physical condition (previous research indicates that the effects of psilocybin may be less strong for such participants, compared with participants with no comorbidities); (3) number of doses and amount of psilocybin administered, because some previous meta-analyses found that a higher number of doses and a higher dose of psilocybin both predicted a greater reduction in symptoms of depression, whereas others reported the opposite; (4) psilocybin administered alongside psychotherapeutic guidance or as a standalone treatment; (5) severity of depressive symptoms (clinical v subclinical symptomatology); (6) clinician versus patient rated scales; and (7) high versus low quality studies, as determined by RoB 2 assessment scores.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^54bdc9d0]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

The potential for psilocybin, and other psychedelic drugs, to fulfil a much needed and potentially transformative class of psychiatric treatments has garnered significant attention. Consequently, there has been a great deal of interest and investment in accelerating its development and potential implementation in routine clinical practice. However, the expanding scope of scientific discovery, heightened media coverage, and commercial interests in the field risk outpacing the rate of developments in the necessary guidelines and infrastructure required for integration of psilocybin into clinical practice. The US National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC) Task Group on Psychedelics and Related Compounds — comprising psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, psychedelic researchers, and leaders in healthcare consulting affiliated with the NNDC — developed this consensus statement as a summary of clinical expertise and opinion on the matter, to recognise psilocybin's therapeutic potential while also emphasising the need for further research and careful consideration before the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care. We outline the current state of the science on psilocybin, incorporating articles published through April 2025. We identify key areas for further research and frame them within the context of therapeutic and ethical implications surrounding psilocybin's use in future clinical practice. We highlight the need for further research to address gaps in understanding of therapeutic dosage, efficacy across diverse populations, and long-term safety. Finally, we propose an agenda which calls for diversification of funding, collaborative research efforts, standardised training for healthcare providers, and careful consideration of ethical dilemmas inherent in the theorised clinical use of psilocybin. Crucially, we advocate for a balanced approach that prioritises rigorous scientific standards while considering the urgency of the need for better treatment options, ensuring equitable access and safety as the field progresses. We acknowledge that the single-country focus of the NNDC may limit the generalisability of recommendations to international contexts with differing healthcare systems and regulatory landscapes.

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^8ee97264]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects among patients with MDD. These data expand the findings of previous studies involving patients with cancer and depression as well as patients with treatment-resistant depression by suggesting that psilocybin may be effective in the much larger population of MDD. Further studies are needed with active treatment or placebo controls and in larger and more diverse populations.

Psilocybin clinical outcomes across cancer-related distress, treatment-resistant depression, and major depressive disorder (MDD) are quantified with response, remission, and dosing details. In cancer cohorts, 51 participants had improvement with depressive symptoms (HAM-D: 89% response, 71% remission) and anxiety symptoms (HAM-A: 80% response, 50% remission) at 6 month follow up, and a second study of 24 participants showed anxiolytic 78% response and antidepressant 58% response relative to control 14% at 7 weeks with effects sustained at 6.5 months and 4.5 years. In treatment-resistant depression, an open label pilot in 12 individuals reported 67% response at one week and 42% remission at 3 month follow up, and a wait-list controlled trial found 71% response and 54% remission of 24 patients four weeks after two doses (20 mg/70 kg followed by 30 mg/70 kg). In a multi-site randomized trial (n = 233), the high-dose 25 mg arm had 79 patients with 23 remissions and a higher remission rate than the 1 mg control (29% vs. 14%) over three weeks, while the 10 mg group showed no significant difference versus 1 mg. For MDD, an RCT of 104 participants reported 42% response versus 11% with placebo and 25% remission versus 9% with placebo. Across studies, non-response ranged 11–58% (mean 35%) and non-remission 29–85% (mean 59%), and an earlier therapeutic study in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) reported an acute reduction of symptom severity in 9 patients.

### Effect of psilocybin on treatment-resistant depression | NEJM resident 360… [^69ae2abb]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published November 2, 2022 Goodwin et al. conducted a phase 2 trial that evaluated a synthetic, proprietary formulation of psilocybin, administered together with psychological support, in patients with a treatment-resistant major depressive episode. Read the NEJM Original Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: How is treatment-resistant depression generally defined. A: Treatment-resistant depression is a challenging disorder to treat, as shown in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial. Incidences of remission became progressively lower from the first course of antidepressant treatment to the second course, third course, and fourth course. Failure of two courses of treatment has generally been considered to define a group of patients who have treatment-resistant depression.

Q: What is psilocybin. A: Psilocybin is a tryptamine alkaloid found in several species of psilocybe mushrooms. Its potential antidepressant efficacy was suggested by preliminary studies involving patients with life-threatening cancer. Amelioration of symptomatic depression in pilot studies of major depressive disorder, including those that compared psilocybin with escitalopram and that investigated its use in treatment-resistant depression, has suggested therapeutic potential for this agent. A: The primary end point of the trial was the change from baseline to week 3 in the total score on the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. The least-squares mean change from baseline to week 3 in the MADRS total score was −12. 0 points in the 25-mg group, −7. 9 in the 10-mg group, and −5. 4 in the 1-mg group.

A: Limitations of the current trial included the lack of an active comparator, the lack of an ethnically diverse participant sample, and the exclusion of persons judged to be at a clinically significant risk for suicide. The intensity of the acute subjective effect of the 25-mg and 10-mg doses, as compared with the 1-mg dose, reduced the effectiveness of the double-blind structure of the trial.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^fc4ba0f4]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical and practical considerations — safety highlight that while most early psilocybin studies have brought relative reassurance in terms of safety profile, recent expansion of data demonstrates a need for studies designed to include more diverse populations and leaves many unanswered questions about drug-drug interactions, optimal environment and expectancy, dosing comparisons, the role of adjunct psychotherapy, longitudinal and sustained benefits, possible harms not observed in shorter trials, and use in patients with major medical comorbidities. Long acknowledged risks include distressing or psychologically challenging experiences, heightened anxiety, or emergence of psychotic symptoms during the psychedelic experience, and as clinical studies have grown in size and complexity a possible signal for increased suicidal thinking and behaviour has emerged. For example, a recent phase-II trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression reported serious adverse events in 9% of the 25 mg group.

Call to action — psilocybin clinical research priorities are stated explicitly: To this end, we advocate for expansion of funding mechanisms (including from major public funders such as the National Institutes of Health) to enable rigorous and hypothesis-driven evidence and pilot studies; large-scale studies incorporating multidisciplinary expansion across basic, translational, and clinical sciences; multicentre collaboration via consortia with predefined data harmonisation to facilitate big-data approaches and multi-site secondary analyses; further studies involving diverse study populations with intentional inclusion of marginalised communities and diverse backgrounds; and large-scale safety studies to evaluate the relative contributions of drug vs. associated therapy as well as their interactions.

Psilocybin — clinical and public health positioning — should be approached with optimism but caution; messaging about status and promise should be tempered, careful monitoring in clinical and unsanctioned settings is necessary to ensure protection, psychedelics should be considered as second- or third-line therapies until more clarity is gained, an adequate evidence base must be developed to guide appropriate training and expertise, and the limits of efficacy must be carefully articulated with sustained commitment to monitoring, implementation science, and continuing education for any future roll-out if approved as therapies.

### Single-dose synthetic psilocybin with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant bipolar type II major depressive episodes: a nonrandomized open-label trial [^8622031b]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a lifelong condition characterized by recurrent hypomanic and depressive episodes with a lifetime prevalence of at least 0.4% among adults. It causes a level of functional impairment and disability comparable to bipolar I disorder (BDI). Despite treatment, patients with BDII are typically symptomatic most of the time, primarily experiencing protracted and difficult-to-treat periods of depression. Bipolar disorder has high mortality, as 30% of affected individuals attempt and 5% to 15% commit suicide. Historically, BDII was viewed as the lesser of the bipolar disorders due to the absence of florid mania. However, recent studies document that functional impact and risk of suicide are similar in BDI and BDII.

Treatment options are limited for patients with BDII depression. Until recently, treatment guidelines did not distinguish between BDI and BDII. The recent Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments and International Society for Bipolar Disorders 2018 guidelines for management of bipolar disorder devoted a separate discussion to BDII. The primary conclusion was that the extant literature is inadequate to make evidence-based recommendations for patients with BDII. This is largely because most randomized trials of pharmacological treatments for bipolar depression do not include patients with BDII in sufficient number to independently test efficacy. In general, antidepressant medications have not demonstrated reliable benefit for this population, with ongoing debate as to whether their potential harms outweigh benefits in BDII. There is compelling need for novel agents in BDII depression for patients who have insufficiently benefited with or not tolerated existing therapies.

Psilocybin is a naturally occurring plant alkaloid derived from psilocybin mushrooms. When ingested, it creates a mind-altering effect mediated in part through its action as a 5HT2a receptor agonist. Psilocybin appears to increase associative learning, cognitive flexibility, and neuroplasticity. Several recent studies suggest that this agent has therapeutic properties in patients with major depressive disorder. The largest study compared 1-mg, 10-mg, and 25-mg dosages of psilocybin accompanied by psychological support in 233 patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. The higher doses showed a marked antidepressant effect with evidence of durability at 3 months following the single exposure to psilocybin. These trials were not without adverse effects, with headache, nausea, fatigue, and insomnia being the most common.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^cd032f70]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

This review's findings on psilocybin's efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression are encouraging for its use in clinical practice as a drug intervention for patients with primary or secondary depression, particularly when combined with psychological support and administered in a supervised clinical environment. However, the highly standardised treatment setting, high cost, and lack of regulatory guidelines and legal safeguards associated with psilocybin treatment need to be dealt with before it can be established in clinical practice.

### Increased global integration in the brain after psilocybin therapy for depression [^058d8f06]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Psilocybin therapy shows antidepressant potential, but its therapeutic actions are not well understood. We assessed the subacute impact of psilocybin on brain function in two clinical trials of depression. The first was an open-label trial of orally administered psilocybin (10mg and 25mg, 7d apart) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was recorded at baseline and 1d after the 25-mg dose. Beck's depression inventory was the primary outcome measure (MR/J00460X/1). The second trial was a double-blind phase II randomized controlled trial comparing psilocybin therapy with escitalopram. Patients with major depressive disorder received either 2×25mg oral psilocybin, 3 weeks apart, plus 6 weeks of daily placebo ('psilocybin arm') or 2×1mg oral psilocybin, 3 weeks apart, plus 6 weeks of daily escitalopram (10-20mg) ('escitalopram arm'). fMRI was recorded at baseline and 3 weeks after the second psilocybin dose (NCT03429075). In both trials, the antidepressant response to psilocybin was rapid, sustained and correlated with decreases in fMRI brain network modularity, implying that psilocybin's antidepressant action may depend on a global increase in brain network integration. Network cartography analyses indicated that 5-HT2A receptor-rich higher-order functional networks became more functionally interconnected and flexible after psilocybin treatment. The antidepressant response to escitalopram was milder and no changes in brain network organization were observed. Consistent efficacy-related brain changes, correlating with robust antidepressant effects across two studies, suggest an antidepressant mechanism for psilocybin therapy: global increases in brain network integration.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^ec831dc0]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin therapy (PT) produces rapid and persistent antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the long-term effects of PT have never been compared with gold-standard treatments for MDD such as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy alone or in combination.

Methods

This is a 6-month follow-up study of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial involving patients with moderate-to-severe MDD. Participants were recruited from a hospital in the UK. Male or female patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV), moderate to severe depression (HAM-D ≥ 17), no MRI or SSRI contraindications, confirmed diagnosis by a GP or mental healthcare professional, aged 18–80, and competent in English were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either two 25 mg doses of the psychedelic drug psilocybin administered orally combined with psychological support ('psilocybin therapy' or PT) and book-ended by further support or a 6-week course of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (administered daily at 10 mg for three weeks and 20 mg for the subsequent three weeks) plus matched psychological support ('escitalopram treatment' or ET). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) at week 6, which has been reported previously. Herein, we present results at the 6-month follow-up time point. Measures of social functioning, connectedness, and meaning in life constituted the study's secondary outcomes during follow-up. Safety in the follow-up period was not assessed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03429075.

Findings

Between January 15th, 2019 and March 20th, 2020, 59 patients were enrolled and 30 (11 females [37%] and 19 males [63%]) were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 (9 females [31%] and 20 males [69%]) to the escitalopram group. 25 participants in the PT group and 21 in the ET group completed the 6-month follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up, both PT and ET conditions yielded sustained improvements in depressive symptom severity. The mean between-condition difference in QIDS-SR-16 scores at 6-months was 1.51 (95% CI: -1.35, 4.38; p = 0.311). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that PT had greater mean between-condition differences in functioning (WSAS: -7.46; 95% CI: -12.4, -2.47; p < 0.001), psychological connectedness (WCS: 11.02; 95% CI: 1.25, 20.83; p = 0.033), and meaning in life (MLQ: 4.86; 95% CI: 0.67, 9.05; p = 0.021) compared to ET.

Interpretation

Six-week intensive treatments with either psilocybin or escitalopram (with psychological support) for MDD were associated with long-term improvements in depressive symptom severity. The greater degree of improvement in the PT arm at follow-up on psychosocial functioning, meaning in life, and psychological connectedness suggests warrant future research. However, these results are descriptive and should be interpreted with caution. Key limitations of the study include its suboptimal power to detect small but meaningful differences between treatments, missing data, the potential use of additional interventions during the follow-up period, and reliance on self-reported treatment assessments. These factors may affect the interpretation of the study findings and should be considered when evaluating the results.

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^2857e697]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial public health burden, but current treatments have limited effectiveness and adherence. Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment-resistant depression.

Objective

To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, waiting list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population).

Interventions

Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of ≥ 17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR).

Results

Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4–3.5; P < .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–3.7; P < .001). The QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8–3.5; P < .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5–3.0; P < .001). In the overall sample, 17 participants (71%) at week 1 and 17 (71%) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention (≥ 50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score), and 14 participants (58%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54%) at week 4 were in remission (≤ 7 GRID-HAMD score).

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating MDD, thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^2ffa05ea]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, evidence for therapeutic benefits of psilocybin suggest promise, though several limitations should be acknowledged. Clinical trials, for example, are highly protocolised and controlled, and may not always generalise to non-research clinical settings. Investigations of diverse populations which adequately represent the target population of the disorders in question are much needed. For instance, more than 80% of the study participants in psychedelic trials have been white individualswhich severely limits our ability to understand efficacy amongst other racial and ethnic groups, and in other underserved and underrepresented populations. Finally, therapeutic mechanisms of action are also understudied, and they are likely more complicated than first envisaged and may differ drastically across indications. In particular, the differential contributions of pharmacology and psychotherapy are closely intertwined and not yet separable based on the current literature, but psychotherapeutic approaches, whether structured or unstructured, could plausibly play a role in observed efficacy. Overall, therapeutic mechanisms likely involve diverse pathophysiological processes across cellular, circuit-based, cognitive, psychological, social and anthropological systems, requiring expansion of resources to new disciplines and multi-disciplinary collaboration to identify the contribution of any given process, level, or system to both risks and potential benefits of psychedelic therapies.

Call to action

To this end, we advocate for (Fig. 1):
1 Expansion of funding mechanisms, including those from major public funding bodies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to facilitate rigorous and hypothesis driven evidence with clear impact on clinical decision making and to facilitate hypothesis generating pilot studies.
2 Large-scale studies incorporating multidisciplinary expansion across basic, translational, and clinical sciences, to support richer understanding of mechanisms of therapeutic action.
3 Multicentre collaboration through consortia of leading centres with predefined data harmonisation protocols to facilitate big-data approaches and multi-site secondary analyses.
4 Further studies involving diverse study populations with intentional efforts to involve participants from marginalised communities and diverse backgrounds with varying degrees of disease severity and complexity of life circumstances.
5 More robust longitudinal evaluations of potential harms of short-term and long-term psilocybin administration as well as potential risk factors for adverse events.
6 Large-scale factorial design studies to evaluate the relative contributions of drug vs. associated therapy as well as the interactions between drug and therapy.

Call to action

We recommend (Fig. 2):
1 Further support for collaboration between research centres with the clinical research and data analytic expertise required to facilitate a feedforward loop of refinement of clinical protocol optimisation.
2 Further studies of dose-response relationships and alternative treatment protocols (e.g. group administration, short-acting doses, micro-dosing, dismantling of psychotherapeutic components).
3 Further development of standardised monitoring systems to track the incidence and prevalence of adverse events related to psilocybin use in a clinical context.
4 Investment in carefully collected phenotypic data in patients undergoing psychedelic therapy, both to identify predictors of therapeutic response and predictors of adverse outcomes, including outcomes such as transition to mania, psychosis, or HPPD, as these outcomes appear rare and elusive in current clinical trials data.
5 Further economic modelling, cost-benefit analyses, and studies of clinical implementation.
6 Consultation with payers, regulators, clinician, and other key implementation stakeholders to define barriers and roadmaps towards reimbursement benchmarks.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^9cce1fe0]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although protocols have differed, most of the efficacy-determining studies to date have administered psilocybin alongside some degree of psychotherapeutic support. Typically, psychotherapeutic support is given before and after psilocybin administration (historically referred to as "psychedelic therapy"). This contrasts with the prevailing model used with MDMA, where psychotherapeutic support is given during administration (historically referred to as "psycholytic therapy"). Different terminology has been used in the literature to reflect these different interventions. We will broadly refer to psilocybin therapy as it has been delivered in the field to date, encompassing the diversity of dosing and psychotherapeutic protocols implemented in psilocybin research.

To date, a growing body of evidence has shown great promise for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and tobacco use disorder. Results from several Phase-II studies of psilocybin for depression have been replicated with positive and sustained results, which have led to ongoing Phase-III registration trials investigating its use for MDDand treatment-resistant depression. Many other investigations are also currently underway, including Phase-I or Phase-II trials evaluating psilocybin for the treatment of a range of other psychiatric, neurological, inflammatory, and other illnesses. While psilocybin remains a Schedule I substance and is approved by the FDA for investigational use, there are ongoing efforts at the state level to promote access and decriminalisation. For example, in 2020, Oregon became the first state to legalise "psilocybin services" at licenced centres, and in 2022 Colorado passed the Natural Medicine Health Act decriminalising psilocybin use along with several other psychedelic substances that exist in organic forms. In 2025, the New Mexico Medical Psilocybin Act established a regulated medical psilocybin program for licenced healthcare professionals to administer natural psilocybin for qualifying conditions in supervised settings. In addition, multiple countries, including Australiaand Canada, have already granted early compassionate access to psilocybin, allowing it to be used clinically in limited cases, and such compassionate use has been ongoing in Switzerland for many years. Even so, the clinical application of psychedelics in the US, Canada, and Australia has been incredibly limited and represents only a very limited scope of practice as explicit therapy. Further, such use has not been accompanied by open and rigorous tracking of patient outcomes, limiting the utility of these examples for informing cautions and considerations for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care.

### Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^05ef2c91]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

However, no placebo-controlled trial has been published to date, therefore limiting our understanding of the contribution of different pharmacological and non-pharmacological aspects of psychedelic-assisted therapy. Furthermore, all cited clinical trials used dosage regimens that are considered low (≤ 10 mg) or included a high dose (> 20 mg), while omitting the moderate dose range. It is still unknown, whether a single moderate dose of psilocybin may be sufficient to significantly alleviate MMD symptoms.

Therefore, the primary objective of this randomised clinical trial was to investigate the effect of a single moderate dose of psilocybin compared to placebo (equal time spent with psychological support in both treatment conditions) in patients with MDD. Given that moderate doses of psilocybin produced substantial psychological and neurobiological changes in a number of mechanistic studies in healthy participants, we hypothesise that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin is more efficacious than a placebo control. Seven visits over the course of 3 weeks provide the temporal resolution to capture rapid antidepressant effects and at the same time ensure appropriate psychological support during the preparation, drug, and integration sessions of the experience.

### Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^4c2db7a1]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present randomised trial comparing a single moderate dose of psilocybin with placebo with equal amounts of psychological support in patients with MDD yielded significant between-group differences at all time points post-treatment over two weeks. The mean between-group differences two weeks post-treatment were −13.0 points on the MADRS and −10.5 points on the BDI. Both the clinician-rated and the self-reported depressive symptom severity scales favoured psilocybin over placebo: at 14 days follow-up, 58% (MADRS) and 54% (BDI) of participants in the psilocybin condition met the criteria for treatment response compared to 16% (MADRS) and 12% (BDI) of participants in the placebo condition. All effects reported from pairwise comparisons remained significant even when applying the Bonferroni method to account for multiple comparisons. The present results support the hypothesis that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin produces clinically significant antidepressant effects in MDD patients compared to a placebo condition controlling for adjunctive psychological support.

The rapid and enduring antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy in this study are comparable to those reported in previous trials using multiple and higher doses of psilocybin in patients with MDD, highlighting that a) multiple administrations within a short period, b) high doses, and c) two instead of one therapist accompanying the intervention may not provide additional benefit in the first two weeks after treatment. Reported effect sizes for efficacy were generally lower in the most recently published trial. In fact, it is not uncommon to observe decreased efficacy estimates with increasing sample sizes which calls for further investigation of the influence of clinical characteristics (e.g. chronification of disease) and therapy design (e.g. optimal dose and dosing regimen) on treatment response. Furthermore, in the present study, psilocybin-assisted therapy appears to produce a similar rapid onset of antidepressant action as ketamine when comparing response rates obtained 48 h after treatment (69%) with those reported for ketamine obtained at 24 h post-treatment (71%). However, after 1 week, ketamine's response rates have been found to drop to approximately 35%, suggesting therapeutic advantages of a single, moderate dose psilocybin over ketamine.

### Single-dose synthetic psilocybin with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant bipolar type II major depressive episodes: a nonrandomized open-label trial [^97eddc8a]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

In this study, most participants remitted rapidly (ie, within 1 week of dosing), and in most participants, remission persisted for the 12-week study duration. The 3 participants who restarted medication due to lack of benefit or relapse following improvement generally had poorer response throughout the trial. Thus, in a sample of patients with treatment-resistant cyclical mood disorder, achieving persistent remission over a 3-month period is notable, especially given the single dosing of psilocybin. Further follow-up is warranted.

Despite the high remission rate, there was an association between general intensity of the psychedelic experience and clinical benefit. In particular, individuals in whom psilocybin administration had little subjective impact showed little clinical benefit. The necessity of a distinct psychedelic experience for response remains a point of debate within the field, and the findings of this study suggest that the degree of psychedelic experience is predictive of longer-term antidepressant effects.

This study supports further study of the utility of psychedelics in the BDII population. Consideration should be given to whether psilocybin administration alters (increases or decreases) the high risk of substance use disorders in the population, whether the novel changes in perspective and emotional processing seen with psychedelic administration can be reliably assessed in this population, and whether such cognitive alterations are necessary or sufficient for therapeutic effects. In light of this study, the safety and efficacy of psilocybin administration should be explored in a randomized clinical trial enrolling patients with BDII. Care should be taken in expanding this paradigm to BDI disorder given the higher potential risk.

Limitations

As an uncontrolled, open-label study, the efficacy findings could be influenced by multiple factors in addition to the effects of psilocybin, including selection biases in study participation, intensity of therapeutic contact, and expectation effects. The small sample size also limits results. The selected nature of the study population and high levels of motivation prevent extrapolation to the general population of people with bipolar illness. Participants were only followed up with for 12 weeks postdosing, providing limited information on the durability of response. Follow-up studies are needed to provide longer-term assessment. The single dose protocol of this study does not capture benefits or harms that could occur with multiple dosings. Also, these findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with BDI or BDII in a mixed or hypomanic phase of their illness.

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^e727c85a]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

The substantial negative public health impact of MDD underscores the importance of conducting more research into drugs with rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Current pharmacotherapies for depression have variable efficacy and unwanted adverse effects. Novel antidepressants with rapid and sustained effects on mood and cognition could represent a breakthrough in the treatment of depression and may potentially improve or save lives. Therefore, the primary objective of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD.

Conclusions

This study provides preliminary information about the potential cost-effectiveness of psilocybin for treating severe depression. The results indicate positive findings from a societal perspective, which may identify and facilitate more cost-effective approaches to psilocybin therapy. It is essential to better understand who the drug should be prioritised for in terms of treatment resistance and how much therapist support is required.

### Single-dose synthetic psilocybin with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant bipolar type II major depressive episodes: a nonrandomized open-label trial [^9282eeb1]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Will a single psychedelic dose of psilocybin with psychotherapy demonstrate evidence for efficacy and/or safety in drug-free, treatment-resistant participants with bipolar II depression?

Findings

In this nonrandomized open-label trial of 15 individuals with bipolar II depression, most participants met remission criteria on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 3 weeks after a single 25-mg psilocybin dose, and most remained in remission 12 weeks postdose with no increase in mania/hypomania symptoms or suicidality.

Meaning

The findings suggest efficacy and safety of psilocybin in bipolar II depression and support further study of psychedelics in this population.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^60941b7a]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conventional antidepressants such as the SSRI used in this trial (i.e. escitalopram) and psychotherapy are generally considered effective treatments for depression, and their combination produces greater and more persistent benefits, as well as greater tolerability, than either intervention alone. Nevertheless, even gold-standard treatments have limitations. SSRI pharmacotherapy typically involves long-term daily dosing even after positive responses to mitigate risks of depression relapse or recurrence. This is a particularly important drawback given that SSRIs are associated with adverse side-effects like sexual dysfunction, weight gain, fatigue, and emotional blunting, and non-adherence rates up to 50%. Psychotherapy is associated with fewer side-effects and more persistent benefits, but also relatively high treatment drop-rates of approximately 17.5% in depression. Further, both SSRIs and psychotherapy are relatively slow-acting, often requiring weeks or months to achieve clinical response. There is thus a clear need for new treatment options for depression.

PT is being increasingly investigated as a rapid-acting treatment for MDD and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Phase 1, Phase 2A, and Phase 2B, trials have demonstrated that one or two doses of psilocybin, administered with psychological support, can produce almost immediate reductions in depressive symptoms that may persist for months. These are primarily attributed to serotonin 2A receptor signaling in the brain, altering neural information processing that, in appropriate contexts, can lead to experiences like emotional catharsis, ego dissolution, cognitive reappraisaland psychological insight.

In our original study, PT and ET induced comparable reductions in depressive symptoms on the primary outcome of self-reported depression at 6-weeks. However, the PT group exhibited signs of superior response on certain domains of depression, including mood and anhedonia, as well as on all secondary outcomes, including measures of work and social functioning, well-being, rumination, and suppression of negative emotions. PT also appeared positively affect several sexual functioning domains, while those on ET reported declines.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the antidepressant response and evolution of all acquired secondary measures up to six months of naturalistic follow-up after the trial's primary endpoint at 6 weeks, including the differential response between PT and ET conditions. Such questions are of great relevance for evaluating the viability of psilocybin-assisted therapy as an emerging treatment of depression.

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^768bbebe]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial public health concern, affecting more than 300 million individuals worldwide. Depression is the number one cause of disability, and the relative risk of all-cause mortality for those with depression is 1.7 times greater than the risk for the general public. In the United States, approximately 10% of the adult population has been diagnosed with MDD in the past 12 months, and the yearly economic burden of MDD is estimated to be $210 billion.

Although effective pharmacotherapies for depression are available, these drugs have limited efficacy, produce adverse effects, and are associated with patient adherence problems. Although many patients with depression showed reduced or remitted symptoms after treatment with existing pharmacotherapies, approximately 30% to 50% of patients did not respond fully and as many as 10% to 30% of patients were considered treatment-resistant, resulting in average effects that were only modestly larger than the effects of placebo.

Most of the current pharmacotherapies for MDD, including the widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, increase levels of brain monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine (typically by blocking reuptake). A growing body of evidence suggests that newer ketamine-like medications exert therapeutic efficacy in MDD through effects on glutamate neurotransmission. Ketamine hydrochloride, a nonselective N -methyl — aspartate receptor antagonist, is the most well-researched of these newer medications. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a single ketamine infusion in rapidly (within hours) reducing depression symptoms and, when effective, lasting from a few days to about 2 weeks. However, ketamine has high abuse liability, and its administration involves moderate physiological risk that requires medical monitoring.

The combined serotonergic and glutamatergic action of psilocybin, (a classic hallucinogen) and the preliminary evidence of the antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy (among patients with life-threatening cancer or patients with treatment-resistant depression), indicate the potential of psilocybin-assisted therapy as a novel antidepressant intervention. Moreover, psilocybin has lower addiction liability and toxic effects compared with ketamine, and is generally not associated with long-term perceptual, cognitive, or neurological dysfunction.

Dose optimization for psilocybin — although a canonical dose of 25 mg has driven therapeutic response in recent trials, it is unclear whether this is optimal, different indications may require different doses, and evidence may suggest a higher dose up to 40 mg of psilocybin may be necessary in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD); questions also remain about best practices for integrating psychotherapy within treatment.

### Psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression in the US: a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis [^61935f96]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the similar findings, our analysis departs from the McCrone study in several ways. First, we use an individual-level state-transition model that better portrays sequential and recurring events, such as the progression of MDD, as well as individual characteristics such as age and types and lines of therapy over time. Second, we used a longer time horizon of 12 months and used a more defined population of interest (i.e. individuals with TRD). Third, we incorporated parameter uncertainty through probabilistic analyses, which allowed us to measure the impact of dynamic changes in model inputs. Finally, our study explored the cost-effectiveness of PAT in the US context, which has different cost considerations than the UK.

Our sensitivity analyses suggest that improvements in the effectiveness of PAT — measured in terms of its ability to promote and sustain remission — can increase the probability that PAT is cost-effective compared to SOC. However, we also found that the cost of PAT is likely to be the most influential factor when assessing its economic value. The cost of psychological support can be reduced by offering group therapy, allowing therapists to monitor simultaneous sessions, and utilizing alternative clinical personnel. However, the efficacy of these types and formats of psychological support requires further testing. The price of the psilocybin itself is also a significant portion of the total PAT cost, and a wide range of factors will affect the final price. These include risk mitigation requirements from the FDA, patents on psilocybin analogs (which is opposed by some groups on ethical, legal, and sociocultural grounds), effective demand, competition from other effective therapies (including other psychedelics), and sensitivity of third-party payers to these costs.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^41e3c8ec]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this long-term follow-up of participants who were not blinded to the drug condition suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment for MDD produces large and stable antidepressant effects throughout at least 12 months after treatment. These data document larger effects of longer duration than previous studies of psilocybin in depressed patients. Further studies are needed with active treatment or placebo comparison controls in larger and more diverse populations.

### Single-dose psilocybin treatment for major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^7a649676]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study Psilocybin in MDD was published by Charles L Raison and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Major depressive disorder. In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the trial question was: what is the role of a single dose of psilocybin in patients with major depressive disorder? In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the population was: 104 patients (52 female, 52 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 21–65 years with a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder of ≥ 60 days of duration and moderate or greater symptom severity. The key exclusion criteria were receiving antidepressants for ≥ 2 weeks; personal or first-degree family history of psychosis or mania; active substance use disorder; active suicidal ideation with intent. In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the interventions were: n = 51 psilocybin (25 mg administered with psychological support) n = 53 placebo (niacin 100 mg administered with psychological support). In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 43 (19.1 points vs. 6.8 points; MD 12.3, 95% CI 7.2 to 17.5). In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 8 (17.8 points vs. 5.8 points; MD 12, 95% CI 7.4 to 16.6) Significant increase in reduction in Sheehan Disability Scale score at day 43 (4.07 points vs. 1.76 points; MD 2.31, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.5) Significant increase in sustained depressive symptom response (41.7% vs. 11.4%; AD 30.3%, 95% CI 13.5 to 47.1). In the Psilocybin in MDD study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged 21–65 years with a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder of ≥ 60 days of duration and moderate or greater symptom severity, psilocybin was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 43.

### Assessing the risk of symptom worsening in psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^9860d410]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

We conducted a meta-analysis using individual participant data from three, two-dose psilocybin trials for depression (N = 102) with the aim of assessing the risk of symptom worsening. Clinically significant symptom worsening occurred for a minority of participants in the psilocybin and escitalopram conditions (∼10%) and for a majority of participants in the waitlist condition (63.6%). Using data from the two trials with control arms, the psilocybin arm showed a lower likelihood of symptom worsening versus waitlist, and no difference in the likelihood of symptom worsening versus escitalopram. The limitation of a relatively small sample size should be addressed in future studies.

### Psilocybin for major depressive disorder: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^5c2a7cb2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the unsatisfactory therapeutic effects of current antidepressants, research has been launched into alternative treatment approaches, such as the administration of psychedelics. Psilocybin, a classic hallucinogen, has been shown to exert considerable positive influence on depression symptoms through its serotonergic and glutamatergic effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin in treating depression.

Methods

A comprehensive search of Medline (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were applied to select studies that investigated the therapeutic impact of psilocybin on depression. A mixed-effects multi-level model was used to estimate the overall effect size. Effectiveness over time was also investigated as a secondary analysis.

Results

The results of the primary analysis revealed a large and clinically observable reduction (SMC: -1.24, 95%CI: -1.83 to -0.65, I 2 level2 = 11.39%, I 2 level3 = 77.67%) of depressive symptomatology in patients receiving psilocybin in addition to supportive therapy compared to baseline measurements. The decrease was also marked when compared to placebo (p -value = 0.032). The results remained significant even when a secondary analysis assessed the effect in various time intervals since the administration of psilocybin.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis substantiate the claim that psilocybin is superior in treating depression compared to established psychotherapy alone used for treating depression. This finding warrants further studies with larger sample sizes and across a longer timeframe.

### Control group outcomes in trials of psilocybin, SSRIs, or esketamine for depression: a meta-analysis [^1a57d28c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Antidepressant efficacy is typically established by comparing a candidate antidepressant with some control treatment for 4 to 12 weeks. The response to control treatments in depression varies but is often substantial. Jones and coworkersreported the average pretreatment to posttreatment effect size across a range of control treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) to be 1.05, and Cuijpers and colleaguesfound pretreatment to posttreatment effect sizes of 0.64 for care as usual and 0.37 for waiting list controls in a meta-analysis of psychotherapies for depression.

Psilocybin is a novel candidate antidepressant with a unique mechanism of action that has demonstrated substantial acute-phase efficacy in depression, with effect sizes often more than double those for conventional antidepressants. However, control treatment response rates have been noted to be lower than expected in some trials. Psilocybin in trials for depression has been given in psychedelic doses, which risks making functional unblinding both immediate and prevalent. Furthermore, since administration is usually supervised, unblinding may also extend to study personnel. If control treatment response rates are low across the board for psilocybin trials, it could indicate that efficacy is overestimated (eg, via functional unblinding and nocebo effects).

To assess whether low control treatment efficacy is a general phenomenon in trials of psilocybin for depression, we performed an indirect comparison of outcomes on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for 3 trial populations: (1) psilocybin trials on major depressive disorder (MDD) and TRD, (2) esketamine trials on TRD, and (3) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) trials on MDD. Since the hypothesis was that control treatment outcomes may differ systematically depending on which active drug is trialed, there was no common treatment through which indirect evidence might be contrasted (ie, inert placebo might work differently in an SSRI trial than it does in a psilocybin trial). For this reason, the analyses were undertaken using conventional meta-analysis techniques rather than using network meta-analysis.

### Postpartum depression: a role for psychedelics? [^087ddfb2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

The safety profile of psilocybin in the treatment of MDD is becoming established. Multi-centre phase 2 trials for psilocybin in MDD are currently in progress (NCT03775200, NCT03866174, NCT04670081, NCT03429075) and will likely give a more robust indication of efficacy. COMPASS Pathways recently announced results from a multi-centre phase IIb trial of psilocybin therapy in 233 participants with treatment-resistant depression. These results are not yet independently verified or peer-reviewed. A single dose of psilocybin 25 mg was reported to result in a rapid and enduring reduction in depressive symptom severity after 3 weeks, and nearly 25% of the patients had sustained response at 12 weeks. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events occurred and resolved on the day of psilocybin administration. Suicidal ideation and behaviours were reported, all occurring in participants who were non-responders to psilocybin. Taking into account the timing and circumstances of adverse events including suicidal behaviours, psilocybin was reported to be generally well-tolerated in this trial. In comparison with brexanolone in PPD, psilocybin therapy appears to have similar rapid reduction in depression scores, with enduring response at 6 months. Phase 3 trials of psilocybin will give a better indication of psilocybin efficacy in treatment of depression.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^d9b36077]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, psychedelic medicines have surged to the forefront of public attention as a potential new class of much-needed psychiatric therapeutic agents. Research into the applications of psilocybin has been largely encouraging, further promoting broad hope for psilocybin's potential to provide relief for individuals suffering from some of our most difficult-to-treat conditions. With positive findings from the completion of multi-national Phase-II clinical trials with psilocybin for the treatment of depression, and with Phase-III registration trials underway, many are anticipating a future "post-regulatory era". As members of the National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC), we share in this hope and recognise potential opportunities for breakthrough progress in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders if investment and public commitment to the development of psychedelic medicine continues. However, given the early stage of this field, many obstacles must first be addressed before we can arrive at this position. In this consensus statement, we discuss critical considerations as we move towards a future when psilocybin may be implemented into routine psychiatric care. In doing so, we outline areas of critical need for further investment and research, and we highlight several ethical considerations for the delivery of psychedelic therapy. Although other molecules such as DMT and LSD have been studied for depression and other indications, the bulk of contemporary evidence to date has arisen from the study of psilocybin, and as a result it is the only drug with reasonable prospects of clinical implementation for mood disorders in the near-term. For these reasons, we elect to limit the focus of this piece to psilocybin.

Our recommendations: clinical and public health implications

These recommendations carry the potential for broad clinical and public health implications, through guiding policy development, supporting equitable access, and helping prevent premature or unsafe implementation as interest in psychedelic therapies grows. Clinicians and the public should approach psychedelics with optimism but caution, as psychedelics are neither widely approved nor clearly understood within a health system context. Messaging regarding the status and promise of psychedelic medicine should be tempered by these facts. In addition, more preparation and education of lawmakers, policymakers, care providers, and the public is needed regarding the potential risks that are known (e.g. in those with potential cardiovascular vulnerabilities), suspected (e.g. unmasking mania and precipitating psychosis in those with specific psychiatric vulnerabilities), and as of yet unknown (e.g. 1/1000 or 1/10,000 risks that have yet to be encountered in clinical trials). Careful monitoring of psychedelic use and outcomes in both clinical and unsanctioned settings will aid in tracking and responding to these risks as access to psychedelics increases. Care must be taken to ensure that patients are adequately protected in periods of immense psychological vulnerability that can be encountered with psychedelic therapy. Given all of the known and unknown risks as well as our scope of knowledge regarding efficacy, psychedelics might best be considered as second- or third-line therapies until we gain more clarity about the use of psychedelics in the clinic. An adequate evidence base must be developed to guide the appropriate level of training and expertise that is necessary to ensure the safety of patients undergoing psychedelic therapy. Finally, the limits of efficacy of psychedelic therapy must be more carefully charted and communicated. These efforts will require a substantial commitment to monitoring, rigorous implementation science, and continuing education to best ensure a safe roll-out of psychedelics, if they are approved as therapies.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^75924ecd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, these results should be qualified by suboptimal visibility into treatment seeking behaviour within the follow-up period. Although there was no observed disparity in treatment uptake in the follow-up period between groups, 63% of patients in the PT arm still reported some form of additional treatment during the six months of follow-up, aligning with previous studies. Moreover, treatment uptake was not granularly measured beyond the presence or absence of psychedelic use, medication, and psychotherapy. As such, we cannot rule out the involvement of these adjunct treatments in having a causal role in the observed between-condition differences. Nevertheless, establishing the absence of disparity between groups on the measured treatment behaviour is a meaningful prerequisite for countenancing the present results and forming preliminary interpretation and hypotheses.

Notwithstanding this serious limitation, few modern studies have investigated the long-term effects of PT administered in a clinical trial of depression. Previously, Gukasyan and colleaguesfound sustained antidepressant effects up to 12 months following PT and Carhart-Harris and colleaguesdemonstrated sustained antidepressant effects up to 6 months in a treatment-resistant cohort. To the degree that the pattern of results observed here are causally related to the experimental treatment conditions and replicate in future work, a number of causal explanations are conceivable. The antidepressant effects of PT may arise from a combination of neurobiological, psychological, and social factors. By promoting neuroplasticity, engendering transformative experiences, and administering psychotherapy, psilocybin might offer unique opportunities for (re)learning mechanisms that can generate a healthy recalibration of an individual's psychological state. Accordingly, the active influence of psychotherapy on the therapeutic effect of psilocybin is important to consider in the present trial. Psychological support is regarded by the authors as an ethical standard, though the amount and type of support/psychotherapy provided remains variable and subject to considerations of population and disorder type. Furthermore, as in the case of combined antidepressant psycho- and pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy may produce greater sustained efficacy and lower relapse.

Research-to-practice considerations for psilocybin — patients in trials are rigorously screened for exclusionary criteria or contraindications (e.g., bipolar disorder, psychosis, substance use disorder), whereas in routine care patient histories can be partial or unclear and risk stratification more nuanced; highly trained mental health care specialists are required to be present before, during, and after treatment sessions, creating staffing and reimbursement challenges.

### Effect of psilocybin versus escitalopram on depression symptom severity in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder: observational 6-month follow-up of a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^0df2efe4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study investigated the sustained effects of Psilocybin Therapy (PT) versus Escitalopram Treatment (ET) in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) over a six-month follow-up period. MDD, the first or second leading cause of disability globally, is characterized by marked changes in mood, motivation, pleasure and cognition. Even when an episode of MDD has been successfully treated, the risks of relapse or recurrence are high — roughly one in three patients achieving remission will relapse within one year. A key consideration of any treatment of MDD, therefore, is its capacity to produce sustained antidepressant response or remission.

In the original 6-week trial,59 patients were randomised to one of two active treatment conditions: PT or ET. The PT condition consisted of two high-dose (25 mg) treatment sessions with the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin, administered with support from two study therapists (at least one being a qualified mental health professional), in addition to preparatory and integrative psychotherapy and daily placebo capsules. The ET condition consisted of daily doses of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram — 10 mg for three weeks followed by 20 mg for a further three weeks — as well as equivalent psychological support including dosing sessions with placebo-like doses of psilocybin (1 mg). This ET condition thus approximated a gold-standard treatment for depression of concomitant evidence-based pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, albeit at a somewhat briefer and more intensive treatment rhythm. That is, typical antidepressant drug effects are usually seen after 4–6 weeks of treatment, and most (non-private) psychotherapies for depression, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, are administered at a frequency of 1 h per week.

### Rapid and sustained symptom reduction following psilocybin treatment for anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer: a randomized controlled trial [^64be73ae]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Primary outcomes

Single moderate-dose psilocybin, in conjunction with psychotherapy, produced rapid, robust, and sustained clinical benefits in terms of reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer. This pharmacological finding is novel in psychiatry in terms of a single dose of a medication leading to immediate anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects with enduring (e.g. weeks to months) clinical benefits. Even though it is not possible to attribute causality of the experimental drug (in terms of sustained clinical benefit) after the crossover, the post-crossover data analyses of the two dosing sequences suggest that the clinical benefits, in terms of reduction of cancer-related anxiety and depression, of single-dose psilocybin (in conjunction with psychotherapy) may be sustained for longer than 7 weeks post-dosing, and that they may endure for as long as 8 months post-psilocybin dosing. The acute and sustained anti-depressant effects of psilocybin in this trial are consistent with a recently published open-label study of oral psilocybin treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in which psilocybin (25 mg) was associated with 1 week and 3 months post-psilocybin anti-depressant effects.

The within-group analyses for the primary outcome measures demonstrate that immediately after receiving psilocybin there is a marked reduction in anxiety and depression scores for both the psilocybin first and niacin first groups. Also, the magnitude of psilocybin-induced change across each participant's active psilocybin treatment session did not differ across treatment group for any of the primary outcome measures. Together, this suggests that the pharmacological/psilocybin intervention produced rapid anti-depressant and anxiolytic clinical benefits. Both groups demonstrated significant clinical improvements in anxiety/depression from baseline relative to the final assessment. It is unclear from the data whether the sustained benefits in clinical outcomes were due to psilocybin alone or some interactive effect of psilocybin plus the targeted psychotherapy. Future research would be necessary to separate out the various therapeutic contributions of psilocybin versus psychotherapy.

### The experimental effects of psilocybin on symptoms of anxiety and depression: a meta-analysis [^d4bfb39a]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The current meta-analysis examined the effects of psilocybin in combination with behavioral interventions on anxiety and depression in samples with elevated symptoms. Across four studies (one uncontrolled; three randomized, placebo-controlled; N = 117), within-group pre-post and pre-follow-up effects on anxiety and depression were large (Hedges' gs = 1.16 to 1.47) and statistically significant. Across three placebo-controlled studies, pre-post placebo-controlled effects were also large (gs = 0.82 to 0.83) and statistically significant. No serious adverse events were reported. Limitations include the small number of studies and risk for bias within studies. Results tentatively support future research on psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety and depression.

### Efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted treatment for major depressive disorder: prospective 12-month follow-up [^b25eb20a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Preliminary data suggest that psilocybin-assisted treatment produces substantial and rapid antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but little is known about long-term outcomes.

Aims

This study sought to examine the efficacy and safety of psilocybin through 12months in participants with moderate to severe MDD who received psilocybin.

Methods

This randomized, waiting-list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21–75 with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD)⩾17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8weeks) treatment condition in which they received two doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty-four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12months following their second dose.

Results

All 24 participants attended all follow-up visits through the 12-month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID-HAMD scores were observed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (⩾50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at 12months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long-term follow-up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after sessions predicted increased well-being at 12months, but did not predict improvement in depression.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12months following acute intervention in some patients.

### Preliminary evidence of sleep improvements following psilocybin administration, and their involvement in antidepressant therapeutic action [^57f51784]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of The Study

Psilocybin is a rapidly-emerging treatment for depression, yet its impact on sleep is not well understood. We sought to explore the literature on sleep and psilocybin use, and explore the topic using our own primary data.

Findings

Whilst clinical trials demonstrate large depressive symptom improvements, the impact of psilocybin on sleep quality or insomnia symptoms, has not been directly studied. Using our own preliminary-data we demonstrated that both depressive-symptoms and sleep-disturbances decreased significantly following psilocybin use, though sleep improvements were smaller compared to depressive symptoms. More severe sleep-disturbances at baseline were linked to lower probability of depression remission, underscoring a potential interaction between sleep and psilocybin's efficacy. Addressing sleep disturbances could enhance therapeutic outcomes in psilocybin-assisted therapy and could lead to more effective, personalized treatment-strategies. Future research should focus on populations with sleep disorders, and on examining causal-pathways of sleep physiology's impact on psilocybin efficacy.

### Single-dose synthetic psilocybin with psychotherapy for treatment-resistant bipolar type II major depressive episodes: a nonrandomized open-label trial [^5fe77655]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Bipolar II disorder (BDII) is a debilitating condition frequently associated with difficult-to-treat depressive episodes. Psilocybin has evidence for rapid-acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression.

Objective

To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a 12-week, open-label nonrandomized open-label trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII, a current depressive episode longer than 3 months, and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate. Of 70 approached, 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The trial was conducted between April 14, 2021, and January 5, 2023.

Interventions

A single dose of synthetic psilocybin, 25 mg, was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment, the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms-Self Rating (QIDS-SR), and the self-rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits. Safety measures included the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) completed at each visit.

Results

Of the 15 participants in this study (6 male and 9 female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.6] years), all had lower scores at week 3, with a mean (SD) change of -24.00 (9.23) points on the MADRS, (Cohen d = 4.08; 95% CI, -29.11 to -18.89; P < .001). Repeat measures analysis of variance showed lower MADRS scores at all tested posttreatment time points, including the end point (Cohen d = 3.39; 95% CI, -33.19 to -16.95; adjusted P < .001). At week 3, 12 participants met the response criterion (50% decrease in MADRS), and 11 met remission criterion (MADRS score ≤ 10). At the study end point, 12 patients met both response and remission criteria. QIDS-SR scores and Q-LES-Q-SF scores demonstrated similar improvements. YMRS and CSSRS scores did not change significantly at posttreatment compared to baseline.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings in this open-label nonrandomized open-label trial suggest efficacy and safety of psilocybin with psychotherapy in BDII depression and supports further study of psychedelics in this population.

Implications for future research

More large scale randomised trials with long follow-up are needed to fully understand psilocybin's treatment potential, and future studies should aim to recruit a more diverse population. Another factor that would make clinical trials more representative of routine practice would be to recruit patients who are currently using or have used commonly prescribed serotonergic antidepressants. Clinical trials tend to exclude such participants because many antidepressants that act on the serotonin system modulate the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2A receptor that psilocybin primarily acts upon, with prolonged use of tricyclic antidepressants associated with more intense psychedelic experiences and use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors or SSRIs inducing weaker responses to psychedelics. Investigating psilocybin in such patients would, however, provide valuable insight on how psilocybin interacts with commonly prescribed drugs for depression and would help inform clinical practice.

Minimising the influence of expectancy effects is another core problem for future studies. One strategy would be to include expectancy measures and explore the level of expectancy as a covariate in statistical analysis. Researchers should also test the effectiveness of condition masking. Another proposed solution would be to adopt a 2×2 balanced placebo design, where both the drug (psilocybin or placebo) and the instructions given to participants (told they have received psilocybin or told they have received placebo) are crossed. Alternatively, clinical trials could adopt a three arm design that includes both an inactive placebo (eg, saline) and active placebo (eg, niacin, lower psylocibin dose), allowing for the effects of psilocybin to be separated from those of the placebo.

Overall, future studies should explore psilocybin's exact mechanism of treatment effectiveness and outline how its physiological effects, mystical experiences, dosage, treatment setting, psychological support, and relationship with the therapist all interact to produce a synergistic antidepressant effect. Although this may be difficult to achieve using an explanatory randomised trial design, pragmatic clinical trial designs may be better suited to psilocybin research, as their primary objective is to achieve high external validity and generalisability. Such studies may include multiple alternative treatments rather than simply an active and placebo treatment comparison (eg, psilocybin v SSRI v serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor), and participants would be recruited from broader clinical populations. Although such studies are usually conducted after a drug's launch, earlier use of such designs could help assess the clinical effectiveness of psilocybin more robustly and broaden patient access to a novel type of antidepressant treatment.

Risk of bias

The Cochrane RoB 2 tools were used to evaluate the included studies (table 3). RoB 2 for randomised trials was used for the five reports of parallel randomised trials (Carhart-Harris et aland its secondary analysis Barba et al, Goodwin et aland its secondary analysis Goodwin et al, and von Rotz et al) and RoB 2 for crossover trials was used for the four reports of crossover randomised trials (Griffiths et al, Grob et al, and Ross et aland its follow-up Ross et al). Supplementary Appendix G provides a detailed explanation of the assessment of the included studies.

Table 3
Summary risk of bias assessment of included studies, based on domains in Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool

Domain 1 assessed bias arising from the randomisation process, including blinding and randomisation of the allocation sequence, and baseline differences between groups. Domain S assessed the period and carryover effects specific to the crossover trials. Domain 2 assessed bias due to deviations from the intended intervention, including participant and researcher blinding, and the effects of differential adherence between groups. Domain 3 assessed bias due to missing outcome data. Domain 4 assessed bias in measurement of the outcome, including the appropriateness of metrics and questionnaires used and between group differences in outcome assessment. Domain 5 assessed reporting bias arising from the selective reporting of results or data analyses, or both. The "other" criterion assessed bias due to potential conflicts of interest, such as industry funding and associations with pharmaceutical companies.

Quality of included studies

Confidence in the quality of the evidence for the meta-analysis was assessed using GRADE, through the GRADEpro GDT software program. Figure 2 shows the results of this assessment, along with our summary of findings.

Clinical and practical considerations

Safety

While most of the early studies of psilocybin have brought relative reassurance in terms of safety profile, limited representation in existing data clearly demonstrates a need for studies designed to include more diverse populations. Many unanswered questions include the potential for drug-drug interactions, optimal environment ('setting') and expectancy ('set') of participants completing dosing, the role of adjunct psychotherapy, longitudinal and sustained benefits, possible harms that have not surfaced in shorter duration trials, and considerations for its use in patients with major medical comorbidities.

Additionally, even in the existing limited literature, some complexities and potential safety concerns have emerged. Long acknowledged risks include the possibility of distressing or psychologically challenging experiences, heightened anxiety, or emergence of psychotic symptoms during the psychedelic experience. As clinical studies have grown in size and complexity, a possible signal for increased suicidal thinking and behaviour has emerged. For example, a recent phase-II trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression reported serious adverse events in 9% of the 25 mg group (two participants with suicidal ideation, two participants with intentional self-injury), 7% in the 10 mg group (two with suicidal ideation, one with 'intentional self-injury', one hospitalisation for severe depression), and one in the placebo group ('intentional self-injury'). While this study was too small to draw a link between suicidal ideation and psilocybin exposure, the findings do warrant careful consideration in future studies. Expectations about the psychedelic experience and disappointment at non-response or an underwhelming experience may feed into these adverse events - including one documented case of death by suicide after a patient with late-stage cancer received a placebo dose in Griffiths et al. (2016). Whether or not these considerations are more pertinent within psychedelic research than in other experimental therapeutics, evidence to date demands careful management and monitoring of expectations amongst vulnerable patients.

Conclusions

We see promise in the current wave of research in psychedelic medicine. At the same time, as physicians and medical researchers, we encourage caution given unanswered questions and practical implementation challenges that do not yet have clear, generalisable solutions. We highlight the need for the development of standardised training across a broad swath of disciplines in the event that this new field of medicine becomes a potential tool in our therapeutic toolbox. We emphasise the need to maintain guiding principles of medical ethics, even if doing so involves taking unpopular positions in the face of public and commercial enthusiasm. We believe strongly in the need for more research on psychedelics in the context of mental health, with special attention to their potential risks, and more multi-site collaboration and harmonisation to work towards answering some of these most pressing questions.

### Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^3eaf9faa]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Response rates 14 days after administration resulted in 58% for MADRS (Psilocybin: 15/26 vs. Placebo: 4/26; P = 0.0034) and for BDI in 54% (Psilocybin: 14/26 vs. Placebo: 3/26; P = 0.0025. Remission rates were reported in 54% of patients for MADRS (Psilocybin: 14/26 vs. Placebo: 3/26; P = 0.0023) and assessed by BDI in 46% (Psilocybin: 12/26 vs. Placebo: 3/26; P = 0.013).

To evaluate the time course of symptom change, analyses including all study visits were conducted for each primary endpoint (Fig. 2). There was a statistically significant interaction between treatment condition and time for MADRS: F(5,250) = 11.8, P < 0.0001, η 2 G = 0.058, as well as for BDI: F(5,250) = 10.4, P < 0.0001, η 2 G = 0.050. Post-hoc analysis confirmed significant differences (P < 0.05) between conditions at each timepoint following substance administration. Mean differences in depressive symptomatology between treatment conditions were highest two days after drug administration (visit 5) for MADRS (−14.4 points; CI −5.5 to −16.3; P = 0.0002; Cohens' d = 1.14) and for BDI (−14.7 points; CI −4.7 to −16.3; P = 0.0007; Cohens' d = 1.01). Reported response rates were highest for self-reported symptoms on the administration day with 73% (19/26; BDI) of participants in the psilocybin condition, although the clinician-rated instrument showed the highest response rates 2 days later with 69% (18/26; MADRS) of participants in the psilocybin condition. Individual symptom trajectories are presented in Supplemental Fig. S1.

### Acute adverse effects of therapeutic doses of psilocybin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a9dd4c9f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Psilocybin has been studied in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Clinical studies have mainly focused on efficacy, with systematic reviews showing favorable efficacy; however, none have primarily focused on psilocybin safety.

Objective

To evaluate the acute adverse effects of psilocybin at therapeutic doses in the treatment of depression and anxiety.

Data Sources

MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for publications available between 1966 and November 30, 2023.

Study Selection

Randomized, double-blind clinical trials that reported adverse effects of psilocybin in patients treated for depression and anxiety were screened.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were independently extracted by 2 authors and verified by 2 additional authors following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. The inverse variance method with the Hartung-Knapp adjustment for the random-effects model was used, with a continuity correction of 0.5 for studies with 0 cell frequencies. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by sequentially removing 1 study at a time to assess the robustness of the results.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was considered as the adverse effects of psilocybin at high and moderate (ie, therapeutic) dose regimens and compared with placebo, low-dose psilocybin, or other comparator in the treatment of depression and/or anxiety.

Results

Six studies met the inclusion criteria with a total sample of 528 participants (approximately 51% female; median age 39.8 years; IQR, 39.8–41.2). Seven adverse effects were reported in multiple studies and included in the analysis. Among these, headache (relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% CI 1.06–3.74), nausea (RR, 8.85; 95% CI, 5.68–13.79), anxiety (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.11–4.64), dizziness (RR, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.02–33.03), and elevated blood pressure (RR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.15–4.53) were statistically significant. Psilocybin use was not associated with risk of paranoia and transient thought disorder.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis, the acute adverse effect profile of therapeutic single-dose psilocybin appeared to be tolerable and resolved within 48 hours. However, future studies need to more actively evaluate the appropriate management of adverse effects.

### Examining mystical experiences as a predictor of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression [^f2432d73]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) is a promising treatment for various psychiatric disorders. However, the exact biological and psychological mechanisms of action of PAP remain to be determined. Examining predictors of PAP outcomes may help identify necessary processes for positive treatment outcomes. Mystical experiences are considered a key aspect of the subjective effects of ingesting psilocybin. Mystical experiences have been observed to be possibly predictive of positive outcomes in psilocybin treatments. Therefore, some argue that mystical-type experiences are necessary to achieve therapeutic benefits.

Aims

The current study examines mystical experiences as a predictor of antidepressant treatment outcomes in PAP, in a complex clinical sample.

Methods

Participants included 31 individuals with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or Bipolar II Disorder (BDII), with treatment resistance to symptoms of their disorder. Participants had one, two, or three PAP treatments with a fixed dose of 25mg of psilocybin. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline, at a pre-dose visit and at 2weeks post-dosing. The presence of mystical experiences was measured on the dosing day after the acute effects had resolved.

Results

For the first psilocybin dose, participants with greater levels of mystical experiences exhibited a greater antidepressant effect from PAP. This effect was not found at the second or third doses.

Conclusion

These results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that mystical experiences have therapeutic importance in PAP and extend the literature to include a clinical sample of individuals with treatment-resistant depression in the context of MDD or BDII.

### Preliminary evidence of sleep improvements following psilocybin administration, and their involvement in antidepressant therapeutic action [^1e46fe18]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of the study

Psilocybin is a rapidly-emerging treatment for depression, yet its impact on sleep is not well understood. We sought to explore the literature on sleep and psilocybin use, and explore the topic using our own primary data.

Findings

Whilst clinical trials demonstrate large depressive symptom improvements, the impact of psilocybin on sleep quality or insomnia symptoms, has not been directly studied. Using our own preliminary-data we demonstrated that both depressive-symptoms and sleep-disturbances decreased significantly following psilocybin use, though sleep improvements were smaller compared to depressive symptoms. More severe sleep-disturbances at baseline were linked to lower probability of depression remission, underscoring a potential interaction between sleep and psilocybin's efficacy.

Summary

Addressing sleep disturbances could enhance therapeutic outcomes in psilocybin-assisted therapy and could lead to more effective, personalized treatment-strategies. Future research should focus on populations with sleep disorders, and on examining causal-pathways of sleep physiology's impact on psilocybin efficacy.

### Acute adverse effects of therapeutic doses of psilocybin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e97aa3ec]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Psilocybin is classified as a serotonergic psychedelic and a prodrug of psilocin (4-hydroxy-dimethyltryptamine), which converts to the active form once ingested. The theoretical mechanism of action involves binding to serotonin 2A (5-HT 2a) predominantly in the amygdala, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex. The psychopharmacologic profile of psilocybin was examined in the 1960s. It was proposed that oral administration of approximately 10 mg was needed to induce psychological effects, with more potent effects developing with increasing doses. Psilocybin's psychological effects were comparable to those of lysergic acid diethylamide, but thought to be more vividly visual, less emotionally intense, more euphoric, and less likely to cause panic attacks or paranoia. Clinical studies suggest psilocybin produces an antidepressant benefit in patients with treatment-resistant depression. This impact is believed to be connected to its affinity for the serotonergic pathway in the brain, which is essential in controlling mood.

In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin in the treatment of mental health (eg, depression, anxiety) disorders. Psilocybin-assisted therapy typically involves 1 or 2 dosing sessions with individuals encouraged to explore their thoughts and emotions with the support of a therapist. Clinical studies have focused on psilocybin efficacy, resulting in studies pooling and presenting aggregate results. One recent meta-analysis investigated psilocybin adverse effects as a secondary aim, using a dose-dependent approach focused on select adverse effects. However, these studies have not primarily focused on or explored the adverse effect profile of psilocybin in depth. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to summarize and examine the relative risk (RR) of acute adverse effects of therapeutic doses of psilocybin in patients with depression and anxiety.

### Effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on major depressive disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^fad2497b]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This randomized clinical trial documented the substantial rapid and enduring antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy among patients with MDD. Although the rapid antidepressant effects of psilocybin are similar to those reported with ketamine, the therapeutic effects are different: ketamine effects typically last for a few days to 2 weeks, whereas the current study showed that clinically significant antidepressant response to psilocybin therapy persisted for at least 4 weeks, with 71% of the participants continuing to show a clinically significant response (≥ 50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score) at week 4 of follow-up. Furthermore, psilocybin was found to have low potential for addictionand a minimal adverse event profile, suggesting therapeutic advantages with less risk for associated problems than ketamine. The present findings in patients with MDD are consistent with results of studies that reported on the effectiveness of psilocybin-assisted therapy in producing antidepressant effects among patients with cancer who had psychological distress, and a small open-label study of patients with treatment-resistant depression.

The mounting evidence of the use of psilocybin as an adjunct to treatment of a variety of psychiatric conditions (eg, depression, tobacco use disorder, and alcohol use disorder) suggests a transdiagnostic mechanism of action. In several studies in patients, and in healthy volunteers, the intensity of mystical-type experiences reported after psilocybin sessions was associated with favorable outcomes. Furthermore, cross-sectional studies have suggested that mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences during a psychedelic session predict positive therapeutic effects. Consistent with these previous studies, the current trial showed that psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type, personally meaningful, and insightful experiences were associated with decreases in depression at 4 weeks (eResults in Supplement 2). Furthermore, a recent report suggested that psilocybin may decrease negative affect and the neural correlates of negative affect, which may be a mechanism underlying transdiagnostic efficacy. Taken together, these findings suggest that further studies into psychological and neural mechanisms across different psychiatric conditions are warranted.

### Control group outcomes in trials of psilocybin, SSRIs, or esketamine for depression: a meta-analysis [^cd763d2a]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis found that participants receiving control treatment in psilocybin trials had significantly less improvement in depression ratings than participants receiving control treatment in trials of SSRIs or esketamine. The low response to control treatment suggests that psilocybin may not be as broadly effective for depression as estimated. Future studies should strive toward better understanding of which factors moderate control treatment outcomes in psilocybin trials, such as by trialing multiple control treatments and/or by recruiting study participants with positive expectations of the control treatment also.

### Efficacy of psilocybin for treating symptoms of depression: systematic review and meta-analysis [^540771a8]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis we found that psilocybin use showed a significant benefit on change in depression scores compared with placebo. This is consistent with other recent meta-analyses and trials of psilocybin as a standalone treatment for depressionor in combination with psychological support. This review adds to those finding by exploring treatment effect moderators, with exploratory subgroup analyses showing that the type of depression (primary or secondary) and the depression scale used (Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale, quick inventory of depressive symptomatology, or Beck depression inventory) had a significant differential effect on the outcome. High between study heterogeneity has been identified by some other meta-analyses of psilocybin (eg, Goldberg et al), with a higher treatment effect in studies with patients with comorbid life threatening conditions compared with patients with primary depression. Although possible explanations, including personal factors (eg, patients with life threatening conditions being older) or depression related factors (eg, secondary depression being more severe than primary depression) could be considered, these hypotheses are not supported by baseline data (ie, patients with secondary depression do not differ substantially in age or symptom severity from patients with primary depression). The differential effects from assessment scales used have not been examined in other meta-analyses of psilocybin, but this review's finding that studies using the Beck depression inventory showed a higher treatment effect than those using the Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology is consistent with studies in the psychological literature that have shown larger treatment effects when self-report scales are used (eg, Beck depression inventory). This finding may be because clinicians tend to overestimate the severity of depression symptoms at baseline assessments, leading to less pronounced differences between before and after treatment identified in clinician assessed scales (eg, Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale, Quick Inventory of Depressive symptomatology). However, all subgroup analyses may have been affected by small study biases, and thus the findings should be considered exploratory.

### Examining mystical experiences as a predictor of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression [^60006fe5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) is a promising treatment for various psychiatric disorders. However, the exact biological and psychological mechanisms of action of PAP remain to be determined. Examining predictors of PAP outcomes may help identify necessary processes for positive treatment outcomes. Mystical experiences are considered a key aspect of the subjective effects of ingesting psilocybin. Mystical experiences have been observed to be possibly predictive of positive outcomes in psilocybin treatments. Therefore, some argue that mystical-type experiences are necessary to achieve therapeutic benefits.

Aims:

The current study examines mystical experiences as a predictor of antidepressant treatment outcomes in PAP, in a complex clinical sample.

Methods:

Participants included 31 individuals with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or Bipolar II Disorder (BDII), with treatment resistance to symptoms of their disorder. Participants had one, two, or three PAP treatments with a fixed dose of 25 mg of psilocybin. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline, at a pre-dose visit and at 2 weeks post-dosing. The presence of mystical experiences was measured on the dosing day after the acute effects had resolved.

Results:

For the first psilocybin dose, participants with greater levels of mystical experiences exhibited a greater antidepressant effect from PAP. This effect was not found at the second or third doses.

Conclusion:

These results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that mystical experiences have therapeutic importance in PAP and extend the literature to include a clinical sample of individuals with treatment-resistant depression in the context of MDD or BDII.

### Efficacy and safety of eight enhanced therapies for treatment-resistant depression: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs [^678c8535]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) challenges psychiatric treatment, with existing guidelines covering only a subset of augmentation strategies.

Methods

A network meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines examined the efficacy and safety of TRD treatments, analyzing 72 randomized controlled trials from eight databases, assessing response and remission rates, tolerability, and safety through the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and CINeMA framework.

Findings

Including 12,105 participants, the analysis highlighted ECT, Ketamine, Esketamine, and Psilocybin as superior first-line treatments due to their optimal balance between effectiveness and tolerability. Brexpiprazole and Quetiapine showed no significant efficacy over placebo in response rates, while Esketamine and Psilocybin exhibited lower tolerability.

Interpretation

The results advocate for ECT, Ketamine, Esketamine, and Psilocybin as preferred treatments for TRD, guiding clinical practice with evidence-based recommendations for enhancing treatment outcomes. This study underscores the importance of considering both efficacy and safety in selecting augmentation strategies for TRD.

### Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^4251b9df]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Change in symptom severity between visit 2 (4–6d before drug administration) and the last study visit (14d after drug administration) was a priori defined as primary efficacy endpoint. Mixed-effects model of covariance showed a significant main effect for treatment condition assessed for MADRS: F(1,49) = 14.20, P = 0.0004, η 2 G = 0.224, and for BDI: F(1,49) = 8.53, P = 0.005, η 2 G = 0.148. Significant interaction effects between study visits were found for MADRS: F(1,49) = 13.30, P = 0.0006, η 2 G = 0.213, and for BDI: F(1,49) = 16.1, P = 0.0002, η 2 G = 0.248. The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of −13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI −15.0 to −1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and −13.2 points (95% CI; −13.4 to −1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention.

### Postpartum depression: a role for psychedelics? [^04eefb34]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

An open-label study evaluating the feasibility of psilocybin assisted psychotherapy in 12 patients with moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression was the first modern-day depression trial conducted with psilocybin. Participants, after an initial preparatory session with a therapist, received 10 mg and 25 mg of oral psilocybin 7 days apart. Psychological support was provided during the sessions, with further psychological input at the 1-week follow-up visit. One week after dosing, 67% of participants had achieved complete remission with depression scores dropping from 21.4 to 7.4, and a Hedges' g effect size of 3.1. At 3-month follow-up, 58% of patients maintained response while 42% remained in complete remission, with an effect size of 2.0. Depression scores remained significantly reduced at the 6-month follow-up, with an effect size of 1.2. No major safety concerns were reported in this study. As this was an open-label pilot study, efficacy results are likely to be biased and should be treated with caution. However, this study demonstrated that the intervention was possible to deliver in a clinical trial setting, and laid a foundation for more rigorous forms of trial design.

A randomised, waiting list-controlled trial of psilocybin-assisted therapy in 27 participants with MDD aimed to investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in MDD. Participants in one arm of this study received a moderate dose of psilocybin (20 mg/70 kg) followed by a high dose (30 mg/70 kg) 1 week later. The control arm received the same intervention delayed by 8 weeks, in order to differentiate effects of psilocybin intervention from spontaneous symptom improvement. Both groups received supportive psychotherapy. Depression scores showed rapid reduction on day 1 after the first psilocybin dosing, from 16.7 to 6.3. Following the second psilocybin dose 1 week later, depression scores remained low at 4 weeks, with a Cohen d effect size of 2.2. In the overall sample, 67% of participants had clinically significant response (defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression scores from baseline) to the intervention at week 1, increasing to 71% at week 4. These results suggest that psilocybin may produce a rapid antidepressant response with sustained remission up to 4 weeks after dosing. This was a single centre trial with carefully selected participants, and replication of these results in multi-centre RCTs is needed.

### Psychedelic therapy for depressive symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a3066ce2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Psychedelic therapy shows promise for Major Depressive Disorder, especially when treatment-resistant, as well as life-threatening illness distress. The objective of this systematic review, inclusive of meta-analysis, is to examine recent clinical research on the therapeutic effects of classic psychedelics on depressive symptoms.

Methods

Fourteen psychedelic therapy studies, utilising psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, were systematically reviewed. For the meta-analysis, standardised mean differences were calculated for seven randomised controlled trials.

Results

The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support. In the meta-analysis, symptom reduction was significantly indicated in three timepoints out of four, including 1-day, 1-week, and 3–5 weeks, supporting the results of the systematic review, with the exception of the 6–8 weeks follow-up point which was less conclusive.

Limitations

The absence of required data for 2 studies necessitated the less precise use of graphical extraction and imputation. The small sample size in all but one study negatively affected the statistical power. None of the studies had long-term follow-up without also utilising the cross-over method, which did not allow for long-term results to be included in the meta-review.

Conclusions

This review indicates an association between psychedelic therapy and significant reduction of depressive symptoms at several time points. However, the small number of studies, and low sample sizes, calls for careful interpretation of results. This suggests the need for more randomised clinical trials of psychedelic therapy, with larger and more diverse samples.

### Mapping psilocybin therapy: a systematic review of therapeutic frameworks, adaptations, and standardization across contemporary clinical trials [^b488f1df]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Accumulating evidence suggests that psilocybin can produce rapid and sustained clinical benefits when administered in conjunction with psychological support. Though non-pharmacological procedures are considered integral, the field lacks therapeutic guidelines and little is known about current practices. This systematic review sought to provide a comprehensive and cross-diagnostic synthesis of current psilocybin therapy (PT) protocols across contemporary mental health related trials. Primary objectives were to define and compare PT models with respect to overall therapeutic framework, evidence-based psychotherapeutic adaptations, and therapeutic standardization measures. Database search identified 22 recent trials assessing psilocybin as treatment for major and treatment-resistant depression, medical condition-related distress, substance use, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and eating disorders. Cross-diagnostic review revealed broad consistency in therapeutic structure (i.e. before, during, and after psilocybin treatment), session themes, and external context during drug administration. However, trials varied in therapeutic intensity, diagnostic adaptations, and incorporation of evidence-based psychotherapies. Less than half of reviewed trials reported standardization measures such as manualized procedures, PT-specific training, or adherence and fidelity monitoring. With non-pharmacological treatment mechanisms still unclear, results highlight potential confounds and standardization gaps that undermine the replicability and generalizability of recent psilocybin interventions. Until adjunctive support protocols are adequately operationalized, mechanistic insight and uptake into clinical practice will remain a challenge.
