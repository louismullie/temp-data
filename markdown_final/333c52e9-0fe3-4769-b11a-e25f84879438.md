## Question

What age do you start asking about menstruation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate age to start asking about menstruation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is prepubertal, perimenarcheal, or postmenarcheal. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for anticipatory counseling and routine menstrual history-taking. Next, I will consider developmental appropriateness and how to frame questions by age. After that, I need to check for special populations and cultural sensitivities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, age-based approach and confirm red flags that warrant earlier evaluation or referral.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. For prepubertal girls, menstruation is not expected, so questions should focus on pubertal development and any bleeding concerns; for perimenarcheal girls, anticipatory guidance and baseline history are appropriate; for postmenarcheal adolescents and adults, routine menstrual history should be obtained at every visit as a vital sign to screen for abnormal uterine bleeding and related conditions [^114xA6xa] [^111u8SGw].

> I need to check guideline anchors. ACOG recommends that the initial adolescent visit for health guidance occur around ages 13–15, at which time clinicians should provide anticipatory counseling about normal puberty, menarche, and menstrual hygiene, and begin incorporating menstrual history as a vital sign once cycles begin [^113NHkFG] [^114xA6xa]. Family medicine literature similarly urges treating menstrual history as a routine vital sign across the lifespan, reinforcing that clinicians should ask about menses at regular visits once relevant to the patient's development and sex assigned at birth [^113T8b8A].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single "start age". I should confirm developmental appropriateness. Many girls begin puberty between 8–13 years, with menarche on average around 12–13 years, but some will start earlier; therefore, anticipatory education should begin before menarche, ideally in late elementary school, and intensify as breast development and other pubertal signs emerge [^112RhRFK] [^111u8SGw]. Let me verify that expert recommendations align with this: a recent expert survey supports introducing puberty timeline and reproductive anatomy around third grade and normal menstruation and products by fourth grade, which corresponds to ages 8–10, before many girls experience menarche [^111u8SGw].

> Wait, I should double-check the timing relative to breast development. On average, menarche follows the onset of breast development by about 2.5 years, so once breast budding begins, it is reasonable to initiate age-appropriate conversations about what to expect with menstruation and to start asking about any bleeding or discharge, normalizing the topic and reducing anxiety or stigma [^112RhRFK] [^1135d9aZ]. I need to ensure I also note that a meaningful minority of girls experience menarche at age 11 or earlier, which argues for not waiting until middle school to begin these discussions [^112tJzQn].

> Next, I should review how to frame questions by age. For ages 8–10, I can ask, "Have you noticed any breast changes, pubic hair, or vaginal discharge?" and "Has anyone talked with you about periods — do you have questions?" For ages 11–12, I should ask directly, "Have you started your period yet?" and if yes, "When was your first period, and how have your cycles been since then?" For ages 13 and older, I should obtain a full menstrual history including age at menarche, cycle regularity and length, duration and heaviness of flow, pain, premenstrual symptoms, and any missed periods, using FIGO terminology and patient-friendly prompts to overcome stigma and improve disclosure [^1134rVGZ] [^113T8b8A].

> But wait, what if the patient is transgender or nonbinary? I need to ensure I use inclusive language and ask which terms they prefer for their cycle and anatomy, and I should offer menstrual suppression options when dysphoria or other needs are present, following standards of care for transgender and gender diverse youth and adults [^1164p1x5]. Let me reconsider my default phrasing: instead of "When did you get your first period?" I should ask, "Do you menstruate, and if so, when did bleeding first begin?" and proceed using their chosen terms [^1164p1x5].

> I should confirm special circumstances that warrant earlier or more intensive discussion. In medically complex adolescents, those on anticoagulation, or those with cancer or rheumatic disease, menstrual management and anticipatory counseling should start early and be revisited frequently because of higher risks of heavy bleeding, dysmenorrhea, or treatment-related menstrual changes [^113nFmNV] [^115C9Yn3] [^112n6KCW]. Hold on, I should verify that clinicians often under-ask in these settings; indeed, documentation of menstrual history in oncology is frequently incomplete, underscoring the need to proactively incorporate it into care pathways [^114kMQRd].

> Next, I should review cultural and social considerations. Stigma, secrecy, and period poverty can inhibit disclosure and care-seeking, so I need to create a safe, private space, normalize menstruation, and screen for affordability and access to products, especially in adolescents and those from marginalized communities [^114BmGMx] [^115eEvgH]. Let me verify that early, emotionally attuned parent–child communication improves preparedness and attitudes; yes, adolescents who discussed emotional aspects of menses with mothers before menarche reported feeling more prepared and had more positive attitudes, supporting early, supportive conversations in clinic and at home [^117X72C8].

> I will now examine the clinical rationale for starting early. Treating the menstrual cycle as a vital sign allows early detection of abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, PCOS, and other conditions that affect quality of life, fertility, and long-term health; delays in diagnosis are common and costly, so routine, developmentally appropriate inquiry from late childhood onward is justified [^114xA6xa] [^111GBRUi]. Hold on, I should verify that adolescent cycles are often irregular initially; yes, cycles in the first gynecologic years commonly range 21–45 days, but persistent deviations beyond that range merit evaluation, reinforcing the value of early baseline history and follow-up [^113NHkFG] [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. Start asking about menstruation in a developmentally appropriate way from about age 8–10, focusing on pubertal changes and anticipatory guidance; ask directly about menarche and cycle characteristics once breast development begins or by age 11–12 for most girls; and from age 13 onward, obtain a complete menstrual history at every visit as a vital sign, adapting language for gender diversity and individual needs, while maintaining sensitivity to cultural context and access barriers [^111u8SGw] [^114xA6xa] [^113T8b8A]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with both pediatric and primary care guidance; it does, and it balances early preparation with clinical rigor and inclusivity [^113NHkFG] [^113T8b8A].

> Finally, I need to ensure I include red flags that warrant earlier evaluation. Primary amenorrhea by age 15 with normal secondary sexual development, absence of menses for 3 months in previously regular cycles, or 6 months in irregular cycles, cycles lasting 8 or more days, or bleeding between periods should prompt assessment; in adolescents with irregular cycles persisting beyond 3 years post menarche, consider evaluation for conditions such as PCOS using adolescent-appropriate criteria and timing [^1117ZBmJ] [^11611Ehq] [^114HkjwM]. Hold on, I should verify that early menarche and short cycles are recognized risk factors for endometriosis; yes, careful history in adolescents with these features is recommended to identify risk and guide counseling and follow-up [^111y3YRR].

Start asking about menstruation at **age 8–10** [^111u8SGw] to provide anticipatory guidance before menarche, and begin routine menstrual history at **age 11–12** [^11611Ehq] for all girls, as menarche typically occurs around 12–13 years [^114xA6xa]. Early discussions should be **developmentally appropriate** [^111u8SGw] and culturally sensitive [^115nXxyR], and clinicians should treat the menstrual cycle as a vital sign [^114xA6xa] to identify abnormalities early [^114xA6xa]. For adolescents with heavy or painful periods, or those with medical conditions affecting menstruation, start earlier and tailor questions to their needs [^115wygzt] [^113nFmNV].

---

## Recommended age to start asking about menstruation

- **Anticipatory guidance (ages 8–10)**: Begin age-appropriate conversations about puberty and menstruation before menarche [^111u8SGw], as some girls may start menstruating as early as age 9–10 [^notfound].

- **Routine menstrual history (ages 11–12)**: Start asking all girls about menstruation at age 11–12, as menarche typically occurs around 12–13 years [^114xA6xa].

- **Individualized approach**: For adolescents with heavy or painful periods, or medical conditions affecting menstruation, start earlier and tailor questions to their needs [^115wygzt] [^113nFmNV].

## Importance of early menstrual health discussions

Early discussions about menstruation are essential to:

- **Normalize menstruation**: Reduce stigma and promote open communication [^1171Jo8j].

- **Identify abnormalities**: Early detection of menstrual disorders (e.g. endometriosis, PCOS) [^111y3YRR] [^116nQGHZ].

- **Promote menstrual health literacy**: Empower adolescents to manage their menstrual health effectively [^1151fKyS].

---

## Developmental considerations

When discussing menstruation with adolescents, consider:

- **Cognitive development**: Use age-appropriate language and explanations [^111u8SGw].

- **Emotional readiness**: Address emotional aspects and provide reassurance [^117X72C8].

- **Cultural sensitivity**: Respect cultural beliefs and practices [^115nXxyR].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or early menstruation

Delayed menstruation (**primary amenorrhea**) warrants evaluation if there is no menses by age 15 with normal secondary sexual development, or within 5 years of breast development if that occurs before age 10 [^1117ZBmJ]. Early menstruation (**precocious puberty**) should be evaluated if menstruation occurs before age 8, as it may indicate underlying hormonal or medical conditions [^112RhRFK].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Start asking about menstruation at **age 8–10** for anticipatory guidance, and begin routine menstrual history at **age 11–12** for all girls. Early, developmentally appropriate discussions help normalize menstruation, identify abnormalities, and promote menstrual health literacy.

Family medicine clinicians and menstrual health

Family medicine clinicians care for people of all ages and life stages. They are on the front lines of preventative medicine and can be a great resource for patients trying to improve their quality of life through medical and lifestyle means. By caring for people across their lifespans, family medicine clinicians are well poised to address menstrual health with patients who menstruate. They may see their patients who menstruate when they first begin menstruating in adolescence, when they become sexually active, when they are trying to become pregnant, when they are trying not to become pregnant, when their periods begin to slow at perimenopause, and at all other times in between. Family medicine clinicians are trained to provide comprehensive women's health services and should include menstrual history as a vital sign to be addressed at routine visits. The scope of menstruation and menstrual wellness is expansive, with connections to family planning, sexual wellness, diet and exercise habits, and mental health. Patients can feel more in control of their bodies by understanding their menstrual cycle and its full-body impacts overall.

Common menstrual concerns to discuss with patients

A discussion on exact timing of symptoms in relation to the menstrual period can help guide prompt diagnosis and treatment. Menstrual concerns may include weight changes, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, swelling and tenderness of the breasts, nausea, change in appetite, constipation, and mental health concerns including, an increase in anxiety, irritability, anger, fatigue, mood swings and heavy or painful bleeding. Additional concerns may be leakage, physical activity limitations, fear of toxic shock syndrome, cost of products, painful or irregularity of bleeding, adolescents worried that they have not started menstruating because their friends have or ability to get pregnant. For menstruators who identify as non-binary or transgender, menstruation can be a trigger for gender dysphoria. Another concern is period poverty. Period poverty, the lack of access to menstrual products, clean facilities and health education, impacts nearly one in four menstruating people at least once in their life. Menstruators may perceive heavy bleeding as normal, fear embarrassment and dismissal by clinicians who do not validate their concerns. Family medicine clinicians should proactively engage in these discussions by eliciting a detailed menstrual history. Family medicine clinicians can help normalise these conversations, provide reassurance regarding the common physiological symptoms of menstruation, while also addressing abnormal symptoms, and work with patients to optimise their menstrual health for their individual circumstances at various stages across the lifespan.

In September 2018, the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch (GHDB) of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) convened a 2-day meeting to "identify gaps and opportunities in menstruation science and to raise awareness of the need for more research in this field". Leaders in the field with expertise in endometrial biology, omic analysis of the endometrium and menstrual effluent, new imaging or sampling modalities, smart technologies or applications (apps) and mobile health (mHealth) platforms, menstrual health, and health literacy and dissemination frameworks were invited to participate as speakers and discussants to critique and summarize new discoveries and avenues of future research surrounding menstruation. This meeting encompassed normal menstrual health and endometrial function and the potential of diagnostics for abnormal functioning and disease. To provide a broad perspective on menstruation science, this meeting included investigators and stakeholders across multiple disciplines, including population health and public health sectors, and carefully considered the broader societal implications of menstrual health. This manuscript summarizes the presentations and discussions that took place at the 2018 "Menstruation: Science and Society" meeting hosted by GHDB, NICHD.

### Menstruation in young girls: a clinical perspective [^113NHkFG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The ACOG has recommended that the initial visit to an obstetrician-gynecologist for health guidance, screening, and provision of preventive services should take place around age 13–15. At this visit, clinicians can provide guidance to young girls and their parents on adolescent physical development based on data that define parameters for normal pubertal development, menarche, and menstrual cyclicity, and address menstrual hygiene and emerging adolescent concerns. Adolescent menstrual cycles are initially variable, but this variability does not imply that there are no useful parameters for menstrual cyclicity. Data indicate that cycles typically range from 21 to 45 days, even in the first few gynecologic years. Individuals with cycles that vary widely from this norm may have significant pathology, most commonly hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovary syndrome. Controversy now exists regarding the lower limits for the onset of pubertal development in girls; data suggest that pubertal growth may be occurring earlier than had previously been described. The age of menarche has remained constant. Clinicians can furnish information about menstrual hygiene and menstrual protection and provide parental and teen guidance with printed patient education materials and suggested Web-based sources of information. The provision of anticipatory guidance and information to young girls and their parents can help ease the transition from childhood through puberty and a healthy adolescence.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 651: menstruation in girls and adolescents: using the menstrual cycle as a vital sign [^114xA6xa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite variations worldwide and within the U.S. population, median age at menarche has remained relatively stable-between 12 years and 13 years-across well-nourished populations in developed countries. Environmental factors, including socioeconomic conditions, nutrition, and access to preventive health care, may influence the timing and progression of puberty. A number of medical conditions can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, characterized by unpredictable timing and variable amount of flow. Clinicians should educate girls and their caretakers (eg, parents or guardians) about what to expect of a first menstrual period and the range for normal cycle length of subsequent menses. Identification of abnormal menstrual patterns in adolescence may improve early identification of potential health concerns for adulthood. It is important for clinicians to have an understanding of the menstrual patterns of adolescent girls, the ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal menstruation, and the skill to know how to evaluate the adolescent girl patient. By including an evaluation of the menstrual cycle as an additional vital sign, clinicians reinforce its importance in assessing overall health status for patients and caretakers.

I. Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, "health" is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". For women, menstrual health is an integral part of overall health because, between menarche and menopause, most women menstruate and menstruation can have a significant impact on the physical, mental, and social well-being. Normal menstruation is currently defined as cyclic bleeding that occurs from the uterine corpus between menarche and menopause. It can be described in terms of 4 simple domains: how frequently the woman has episodes of bleeding, the regularity or predictability of these episodes, the duration of bleeding episodes, and the volume or heaviness of bleeding. Not all women experience "normal" menstrual bleeding; up to 30% of women will experience alterations in the volume or pattern of menstrual blood flow, which is defined as the symptom of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), which in turn can be caused by multiple etiologies and sometimes more than 1 etiology at the same time. In addition, many women will have other symptoms such as pain, dysmenorrhea, anxiety, depression, and fatigue associated with their menstrual cycle that require attention for them to achieve early diagnosis of reproductive health issues such as endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder and attain optimal health. In research and in clinical care, a better understanding of what the norms of menstrual health are and how a "lack" of menstrual health affects women's quality of life is needed. Furthermore, for positive health and well-being outcomes, everyone — men and women, as well as clinicians — need to understand menstrual cycles and menstrual health, which can be achieved through menstrual health literacy initiatives and improved health communication.

Menstrual health and menstrual health literacy are extremely broad topics with multiple stakeholders and diverse areas of active investigation and contributors. Adapted from the broader health literacy definition, menstrual health literacy refers to the level of capacity a person has to obtain, process, and understand basic information about menstruation so they can make appropriate health decisions. This section of the manuscript summarizes the presentations and discussion that took place related to menstrual health and menstrual health literacy at the 2018 "Menstruation: Science and Society" meeting hosted by the GHDB of the NICHD. We summarize only areas of menstrual health and literacy that were part of the presentations and active discussions at the NICHD GHDB meeting, which were largely focused on the bleeding aspect of menstrual health.

### Timing and determinants of age at menarche in low-income and middle-income countries [^114LzwAF]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

One study based in Uganda triangulated the information obtained from the DHS and concluded that the DHS were very close to other studies on settings similar to the one being studied. The author went as far as saying that the quality of these data in LMICs might even be better than in HICs as the event is often of great cultural significance and therefore more likely to be remembered.

The way in which menarche information is collected may also affect estimates. The readiness to report age at menarche may be culturally-dependent, with some girls being reluctant to discuss this information in a face-to-face interview. The words "menstruation" and "menarche" may not be familiar and their meaning not known for some girls and as such it is recommended that questions aiming to measure age at menarche are worded in such a way so as to ensure participants understand. The DHS, however, does this with its simple survey wording - "How old were you when you had your first menstrual period?" - although there is some variation across surveys.

Conversation starters

Asking a patient when their last menstrual period was is fairly common practice to gauge regularity and risk of pregnancy. It should not be assumed that because a patient does not bring up their menstrual cycle it is not negatively affecting their life. For example, premenstrual dysphoric symptoms affect 75%–90% of womenand are often seen as normal and something that people who menstruate just cope with. However, many of the symptoms can be treated with hormonal contraceptive options, anti-inflammatory medications or even just general counselling from a clinician. Despite this, menstrual history-taking varies among primary care clinicians and is often incomplete. Detailed history-taking can help assess how a patient's menstrual cycle is affecting their life. Here are several such questions that you can ask any menstruating patient to assess whether they have any symptoms that you can help treat (table 2).

Table 2
Menstrual health conversation starters during clinical encounters

With these simple conversation starters, it is possible to identify patients with menstrual concerns that may not have otherwise been reported. Each of these prompts could segue into an opportunity for counselling and/or medical treatment that can easily be provided and improve the patient's quality of life. These questions can be incorporated as part of wellness visits and as needed for related problem visits. Use the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics table to guide normal and abnormal menstrual symptoms to guide clinical decision-making(figure 1).

Figure 1

Consider having patients complete a questionnaire regarding their menstrual health as it may assist provide privacy and avoid embarrassment around this sensitive topic. Family medicine clinicians should continue to emphasise the normalcy of these issues with patients, reassure them that these conversations are appropriate and necessary and that their clinician is a readily available resource for questions surrounding all these issues.

V. Current and future pathways

Moving forward, there is much left to be done, including addressing the menstruation-related issues faced by all those who menstruate, such as transmasculine and other populations; menstrual barriers faced in workplace contexts; recognition that more evidence is needed on vaginal bleeding across the life course, including the implications for the provision of water, sanitation, supplies, and access to healthcare and information; improved engagement of healthcare workers on the issue of menstruation in low- and middle-income countries in particular; the important intersection of menstruation and family planning; and improved measures for monitoring and assessing the impact of menstruation-focused interventions along with cost-effectiveness studies. Funding support has thus far been limited for addressing this broad spectrum of issues and for essential intervention and measures-related work that are needed to demonstrate critical associations between menstruation and population health more broadly. There is an urgent need for a strong funding stream to assure this impactful work can be done.

### Timing and determinants of age at menarche in low-income and middle-income countries [^115smwSd]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Beyond the results obtained in the statistical analysis, this study has highlighted the dearth of information around timing of menarche in LMICs. The lack of studies around the DHS signifies the lack of interest or lack of knowledge that such data exist. Our informal discussions showed an overall surprise, firstly, that menarche has not been included more systematically and, second, that where it has been included, there is low interest in analysing it. We can only speculate that this might be derived from a lack of trust in the data and also a lack of forward thinking when approaching health in a life-course perspective.

Overall, the data mapping exercise showed an absence of forward planning when designing longitudinal surveys. The issues around ageing processes in LMICs are still poorly understood, and we should rely on a wider range of reproductive health experiences when setting out the health issues that might develop in the future. Given the importance of studying the life-course consequences of age at menarche, longitudinal studies would benefit from including menarche as a survey question. In addition, as we put much more emphasis on menstrual hygiene and school dropouts and the interaction with adolescent mental health, we need to better understand how early interventions need to start and which groups need to be targeted in particular. We would urge any future longitudinal data collection to consider its inclusion.

### Disorders of menstruation in adolescent girls [^1161GYd1]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Abnormal menstruation in adolescent girls can cause psychological and physical strain from excess, unpredictable, painful, or even absent bleeding. Care providers who understand what is normal and what is concerning can educate and often reassure the young woman and her family. When there is an abnormal or concerning scenario, they can initiate investigations and/or treatment in an expedient fashion to limit psychosocial and/or physical morbidity. This article provides pediatricians, family doctors, nurse practitioners, and adult gynecologists with the knowledge and understanding of the common complaints, differential diagnoses, and treatment strategies.

### Discussing menstrual health in family medicine [^1171Jo8j]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Menstrual health

Menstrual health is a general biological marker for many cisgender women, transgender men and non-binary people. Despite more than half of the population being people who menstruate, stigma, lack of conversation and pressing social needs around menstrual health persists throughout medicine. Discussions around menstruation and menstrual management can be difficult for individuals, whether it is with friends or family, or in the healthcare setting. Patients who have never discussed menstruation with a clinician may not know what is healthy, assume that an abnormal experience is normal and may endure periods that negatively affect their life, career or well-being. Menstruation plays a vital role in overall well-being and contributes significantly to an individual's quality of life. Given their scope of care, family medicine clinicians are poised to identify red-flag menstrual symptoms in their routine visits with patients, reducing time to diagnosis of menstrual disorders. We urge family medicine clinicians to have renewed conversations surrounding menstrual health with their patients. The purpose of this report is to supply a brief overview of the importance of menstrual communication in primary care and serve as a resource to enhance menstrual communication between patient and clinician, with the ultimate goal of decreasing menstrual stigma and promoting improved menstrual health and experiences for patients.

Menstrual health is a nuanced topic that can vary greatly from person to person and region to region. There are differences in menstrual health and wellness measures and norms between high-income countries (HIC) and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper focuses on menstrual health in HIC specifically. This is not to say that the points described do not apply to LMIC, but to acknowledge that the topic of menstrual health in these areas is greater than the scope of this singular work.

### Menstrual health education: school health curriculum topics by grade level recommended by specialized medical professionals in menstrual health clinics [^111u8SGw]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Evidence-based menstrual health education is not mandated in any US state or territory. Aspects of normal and abnormal menstruation impact quality of life and educational engagement, but many youths are not prepared to know when to seek medical help. We sought to determine which topics should be included in a third- through eighth-grade school-based menstrual health curriculum.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of medical professionals who care for patients with menstrual problems. We asked participants to indicate the top 3 menstrual health topics by grade, and we compared the most common responses by year. We also solicited general comments about the curriculum content.

Results

Surveys from 55 medical professionals met the criteria for analysis. The topics selected most frequently were normal and abnormal menstruation, reproductive anatomy, puberty timeline, and menstrual products. Most recommended the topics of puberty timeline (38, 69.1%) and reproductive anatomy (34, 61.8%) for third grade, introducing normal menstruation (31, 56.4%) and menstrual products (24, 46.3%) in fourth grade, and abnormal menstruation (27, 49.1%) in sixth grade. More complex topics, such as world cultures around menstruation (14, 25.5%) and period poverty (11, 20.0%), were preferred for eighth grade. Many providers emphasized the importance of teaching normal vs abnormal menstruation in a school health curriculum.

Conclusion

Medical professionals provided recommendations for a school-based menstrual health curriculum that introduces topics at developmentally appropriate ages from a medical perspective, teaches basic menstrual symptom management, and instructs on warning signs for abnormal menstruation.

### Managing menstruation for medically complex paediatric patients [^115wygzt]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Physicians who care for children and adolescents need evidence-based information about how to manage menses for medically complicated patients. The use of many hormonal medications for menstrual management is considered 'off-label' because many of these medications have indications only for contraception. A growing body of evidence supports the use of particular medications or strategies for a wide variety of medical conditions, but this information has been slow to reach all paediatric patients, perhaps in part because of the off-label nature of prescribing. Specialists skilled in hormone management are in short supply and often not immediately available for consultation, and they may also be inexperienced prescribing for medically complex paediatric patients. Misconceptions about the necessity of menstruation or concerns regarding use of contraceptives in young patients may also limit the use of medically indicated off-label hormonal regimens. This review will outline current patient-centred strategies to inform physicians' choices about when and how to intervene medically to improve quality of life for medically complex girls with problematic periods-whether by making periods more predictable, preventing ovulation, reducing pain or eliminating menses altogether.

III. Significant conceptual, practical, or technical challenges in the field of menstrual health research and menstrual health literacy

The progress in the field of menstrual health outlined previously is remarkable given the multiple challenges and obstacles in the field of menstruation science. Menstruation is a physiological process that is experienced almost universally across cultures from the ages of menarche to menopause. What makes menstrual health and menstrual health literacy challenging to study is that for many, it is a normal process that is not associated with any distress or disability, but for some it can be associated with a significantly negative impact on the quality of life. Collecting data on a nearly universal process will require collaboration across the spectrum of disciplines and careful consideration of "who" to collect data from, "what" data elements to collect, and "how" to best collect data. Furthermore, the normalization of women's pain and stigma surrounding menstrual bleeding and reproductive health represent significant barriers to women's care seeking, diagnosis, and ability to conduct research in this area. Menstrual health and menstrual health literacy research is further complicated by a lack of standardization of tools and access to those tools, the multiple different etiologies of HMB, the multidimensional symptom complex surrounding bleeding, lack of clear diagnostic tests for reproductive health disorders that affect menstrual health, suboptimal norms for menstrual health and bleeding across the life span, and insufficient information related to cultural perceptions related to menstrual bleeding and health.

### Discussing menstrual health in family medicine [^115nXxyR]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Menstrual health is a vital part of primary care for menstruating patients. It is important for clinicians to have these conversations with patients. These conversations may be uncomfortable for both clinicians and patients due to societal stigma on menstruation. We encourage clinicians to work to fight this stigma and build strong, and long-lasting relationships with their patients so conversations can be as comfortable as possible for both parties. It is important to recognise, and acknowledge, that family physicians do not have a lot of time to discuss everything they would ideally like to discuss with patients during a single session. Thus, the purpose of this work is to bring heightened awareness to menstrual health in primary care. Our synthesis is simply a starting place for downstream conversation and investigation into menstrual health and wellness in clinic practice. Clinicians must be educated on normal menstruation and trained in identifying their own implicit biases, in what they perceive as 'normal', so they do not brush off any patient's menstruation-related concern as normal. We also recognise that having access to a primary care clinician, let alone one with whom you can develop a strong relationship, is a privilege that many people do not have. Those heavily impacted by the social determinants of health are less likely to be able to have these conversations. Moreover, there are also many different cultural understandings of menstruation and menstrual care, as well as limited trust in the healthcare systems based on current and past influences of racism, sexism and the intersections that impact the physician–patient relationship. While this paper focuses on conversations in HIC between clinicians and patients, future work should examine different approaches or practices that may be needed in LMIC where topics such as menstruation-related violence and less access to information may be more prevalent. Family medicine clinicians can work closely with the communities they care for, building trust, reducing stigma and providing culturally sensitive care. We call on family medicine clinicians to bring menstrual health into the focus of primary care visits for the holistic wellness of all menstruators.

### Mexican adolescents' experience of menarche and attitudes toward menstruation: role of communication between mothers and daughters [^117X72C8]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

First, to explore the kind of information that Mexican mothers give their daughters about menstruation before their menarche, and to study the impact of this communication on how prepared the daughters felt when they experienced their menarche. Second, to investigate the influence of the menarcheal experience on attitudes toward menstruation.

Design

Cross-sectional survey.

Settings

Sample of adolescents attending 3 different public schools.

Participants

405 Mexican postmenarcheal adolescents, aged 12–15 years.

Intervention

Participants answered a questionnaire that had 3 parts: (a) General data, (b) topics related to menses that participants had discussed with their mothers prior to menarche, and (c) menarcheal experience. They also answered a questionnaire about menstrual attitudes.

Results

Although most of the participants knew what they should do when they experienced their menarche, only 39% stated they had felt prepared to start menstruating. Regarding menstrual attitudes, adolescents scored highest on Negative Feelings and Secrecy rather than on Positive Feelings. Participants who had previously discussed the emotional aspects of menses with their mothers were more likely to claim they had felt prepared to start menstruating when they got their first period (OR = 3.45). The fact that adolescents felt prepared to start menstruating predicted positive attitudes toward menstruation (β = .19)

Conclusions

Discussing the emotional aspects of menses prior to menarche is crucial to being prepared for menarche, and to holding positive attitudes toward menstruation. Information on biological knowledge and practical aspects of menses needs to be supplemented with emotional issues.

Earlier than 2004–2005

Before 2005, multiple efforts were underway exploring or addressing menstruation within global health. The population of interest included adult women of reproductive age, and in high-income countries, an interest in the declining age of menarche among girls. Interventions addressing adult women's menstruation-related needs were primarily within the clinical realm, such as a focus on reproductive health and disorders, and the promotion of family planning. Although the latter did not address menstruation as a life course issue, there was attention to the challenges of unscheduled, breakthrough bleeding among other contributors to contraceptive discontinuation. There also existed a rich literature on menstruation within the social sciences, primarily derived from anthropologists documenting menstrual traditions and rituals, and its relationship to girls' and women's roles within society. In the 1980s and 1990s, in high-income countries in particular, researchers explored girls' maturation experiences, examining the psychological effects of menarche, and the associations of early menarche with girls' engagement in risky behaviors, such as increased vulnerability to early sexual initiation, depression, and substance use. Overall, the focus in high-income countries remained on the individual and the clinical aspects of menstruation.

In contrast, in low- and middle-income countries, there began to emerge a public health lens on menstruation. Alongside the family planning agenda, there were burgeoning efforts within the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) field to address menstruation as a challenge faced by girls in school. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) hosted a roundtable event in Oxford aimed at bringing attention to "menstrual hygiene management" (MHM), a newly coined concept focused on addressing menstrual management within WASH, and the Rockefeller Foundation supported a series of case studies on sexual maturation in schools in Africa. In humanitarian contexts, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recognized the provision of sanitary pads to refugees as part of one of its core mandates, providing important recognition of menstruation as a key response aspect.

2019 onward

Already in 2019, the evidence base and action are growing, with new publications examining what is known about MHM among populations with disabilities, proposed revisions to the MHM definition to broaden the concept and its measurement beyond the original WASH origins, additional systematic reviews, and ongoing menstrual equity campaigns, global advocacy, and intervention trials. In an effort to move forward the existing menstruation measurement–related challenges, including the lack of uptake among other key sectors, a "Monitoring Menstruation" meeting was hosted by the Columbia University in March 2019 with support from the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council that brought together key global monitoring and measurement experts from WASH, gender, education, and health (sexual and reproductive, psychosocial) to review and find areas of alignment between the priority outcome and impact measures of these sectoral areas with the progress being made on menstruation. Importantly, USAID provided new funding to explore and pilot interventions addressing menstruation and women's economic empowerment. However, overall, resources still remain limited globally to support systematic coverage of all menstruation components, including access to information, water and sanitation infrastructure, supplies, and related clinical aspects, such as engagement with healthcare workers well trained on regular and irregular bleeding.

### Menstruation: science and society [^113hwfiH]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Twenty-five years have passed since the National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandated that women and minorities be included in all government-funded clinical studies unless their exclusion could be justified. Clearly, this policy has led to numerous women's health research programs. However, women and women's health concerns continue to be underrepresented in research. Most recently, the 2019–2023 Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women's Health Research was initiated to improve the health of women by advancing rigorous research relevant to advancing women's health, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Despite focused initiatives such as these, diagnostic development for improving women's reproductive health has been hampered by a lack of understanding of basic uterine and menstrual physiology. A PubMed search of the term "menstruation" yielded less the 1000 publications between 1941 and 1950, followed by a peak of more than 6000 publications between 1971 and 1980 (note: Our Bodies, Ourselves, a book addressing women's health topics, including menstruation and birth control, was published in 1973), and then a stable trough with less the 4000 publications per decade over the past 3 decades spanning 1991 through 2019 (Figure 1, A). By contrast, a PubMed search of the term "menstrual blood" yielded 1 publication during 1941–1950, followed by a steady increase over time to more than 400 publications in the last decade (Figure 1, B). For reference, PubMed searches of "peripheral blood" and "semen" yielded almost 100,000 and 15,000 publications, respectively, over the past decade.

### Menstruation: choosing whether… and when [^114Cckht]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

For many women in the United States, menstruation is a major health concern because menstrual disorders and other conditions that may be aggravated during menses (e.g., migraine headaches, epilepsy) carry substantial morbidity. Women today menstruate nearly 3 times as often as in primitive societies, and evidence suggests that frequent, repetitive menstrual cycles may increase health risks. Because the conventional 21/7 combination oral contraceptive (OC) regimen provides only limited relief for women with menstrual disorders, alternative OC regimens that reduce menstrual frequency have been proposed. A new OC formulation specifically designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to 4 times per year is currently under investigation. Most women welcome less frequent menses or even amenorrhea. Women who may derive particular benefit from reduced menstrual frequency include not only those with medical conditions directly caused or aggravated by menses, but also those serving in the military, female athletes, mentally-retarded women with menstrual hygiene problems, young teens, and perimenopausal women.

### Menstruation and the menopausal transition [^116Hidtd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

This paper characterizes changes in menstrual bleeding during perimenopause, including bleeding changes that represent markers of the menopausal transition. Recent results from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation and other cohort studies are reviewed. Emerging data describing subpopulation differences in the transition experience are highlighted. When treating women in the midlife, clinicians should pay careful attention to medical factors, including both conditions and treatments, that may increase menstrual blood loss or alter menstrual cycle characteristics sufficiently to obscure the onset of the menopausal transition or the final menstrual period.

Increased variability in menstrual cycle length marks the onset of the menopausal transition, with the likelihood of long cycles increasing as women approach menopause. This article describes the STRAW+10 bleeding criteria for recognizing onset of the early and late menopausal transition, as well as the specific bleeding changes a woman may experience during this life stage, including how women's bleeding experiences differ. The high probability of episodes of excessive and prolonged bleeding as women approach their final menstrual period is documented, as is the continuing probability of ovulation as women reach their final menstrual period.

Data to inform "norms" that hold across populations and span from menarche to menopause

Generation of standard terminologies related to norms for uterine bleeding among adult women represents significant progress in the field of menstrual health, and there has been significant progress especially in describing symptom expectations in the later reproductive life stages and during the menopausal transition. To ensure that menstrual bleeding norms represent bleeding patterns and other menstrual health symptoms across a racially and ethnically diverse and contemporary population (relative to comorbid conditions and body mass index) of women of all ages, further research is needed. Prospective longitudinal cohort data on menstrual bleeding, menstrual symptoms, and reproductive health diagnoses could fill this critical gap.

Developments in mHealth could also be used to inform norms and measure the personal impact menstruation and menstrual symptoms have on women across the life cycle. For population-based data outside of clinical care, data collected from mHealth and mobile device apps are starting to enable the analyses of population-level longitudinal menstrual symptom and cycle data. In addition, these mHealth data could facilitate investigation into cultural differences, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. By partnering with mHealth and app platforms, researchers, clinicians, and industry could generate data collection mechanisms and assist in generating research programs and interventions that could aid women in identifying when they are having a problem and address stigma and perceptions related to menstrual disorders, delays in diagnosis of reproductive health disorders, and delays in care seeking.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^113gcCPQ]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

STRAW + 10 executive summary — updates to reproductive aging staging criteria emphasize hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian changes before and after the final menstrual period, evaluation of menstrual, endocrine, and ovarian markers including antimüllerian hormone, inhibin-B, follicle-stimulating hormone, and antral follicle count, with modifications adopted by consensus. It provided bleeding criteria for the early and late menopausal transition, recommended modifications to criteria for the late reproductive stage (Stage −3) and the postmenopause stage (Stage +1), provided information on the duration of the late transition (Stage −1) and early postmenopause (Stage +1), and recommended application regardless of women's age, ethnicity, body size, or lifestyle characteristics. STRAW + 10 provides a more comprehensive basis for assessing reproductive aging in research and clinical contexts, and application of the STRAW + 10 staging system should improve comparability of studies of midlife women and facilitate clinical decision making, while important knowledge gaps remain and seven research priorities are identified.

### Adolescent gynecology [^111xpCLb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Given new developments in the field of adolescent reproductive health, this review focuses on highlighting new guidelines and practice patterns in evaluation and management of adolescent gynecologic problems. First, understanding the proper techniques for the initial examination is key to establishing a long-term relationship with this age group. Reservations about the first gynecologic examination are common, and the practitioner's goal is foremost to make the patient as comfortable as possible. Preventive health in this patient population is key, and practitioners should become comfortable with providing education about topics as diverse as sexuality, eating disorders, and dating violence. Furthermore, the frequency with which teenagers report sexual activity and the high unintended pregnancy rate in this age group makes counseling regarding effective contraception essential. Additionally, practitioners are encouraged to take the opportunity to discuss the availability of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine with adolescents. In 2007, adolescents were designated as a special population, given the frequency with which they acquire and clear mild HPV-related cervical dysplasia. More conservative treatment in this population is generally favored. During their transition through puberty, disorders of menstruation become the most common complaint requiring the attention of the gynecologist. Most commonly, anovulation serves as the cause behind such abnormal bleeding. Polycystic ovarian syndrome can develop in early puberty and carry its consequences into adulthood. Infertility, diabetes, and hirsutism mark the most important components of the syndrome and require age-appropriate management. Finally, the consequences of endometriosis on the future fertility of adolescents have brought early intervention to light. Recognition and prompt treatment are advocated to prevent the future implications of this disease.

### Early puberty in 11-year-old girls: millennium cohort study findings [^112tJzQn]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In a large contemporary UK setting we found that 9.5% of girls aged 11 years had started menstruation as reported by their mothers. Girls from socioeconomically disadvantaged families and those from certain — Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black African — but not all ethnic minority groups were most likely to have begun menstruating. We found that for girls in the poorest two quintiles of the income distribution inequalities were roughly halved on adjustment for markers of adiposity and psychosocial factors but differences remained unexplained in final models. Because of the relatively advantaged position of families in the Indian group, our models did not attenuate the increased odds of early menstruation for these girls. In contrast, material disadvantage appeared to reduce the odds of early menstruation by about a half for Pakistani girls, and a combination of material disadvantage and higher adiposity among girls in the Bangladeshi and black African groups reduced the odds by about a third.

Our findings are comparable with data from the 1990 UK reference values which showed that 11.8% of girls had begun menstruation prior to leaving primary school, and this is consistent with the overall picture of no further declines in the timing of puberty in high income country settings. There are important differences to note here though, as the Ten Towns study found no differences according to social position or ethnicity. However their marker of social position was crude and different from ours (manual vs non-manual occupational class), and they used aggregate ethnic minority groupings, 'black' and 'South Asian', which likely obscured important differences. Average age estimates for menstruation in low and middle income countries which may have some relevance for ethnic minority groups included in the current study are largely historical and limited in availability.

Box
Definition of MHM (JMP, 2012)

During this period, additional donors began to support projects related to MHM. The Canadian Government provided funding to UNICEF and the UN Girls Education Initiative to partner with Emory University on a 14-country WinS for Girls project, which focused on conducting formative MHM research and developing intervention packages addressing MHM in schools. The UK government supported research on MHM in emergencies, providing funds to the International Federation of the Red Cross to assess beneficiary preferences around the types of menstrual products (disposable vs reusable) in differing emergency contexts. A new platform arose for sharing learning with the launching of an annual virtual conference co-organized by the UNICEF and Columbia University showcasing research, practice, and policy on MHM in schools. Funding from the Canadian government also enabled the creation of the "MHM in Ten" agenda led by the UNICEF and Columbia University, which brought together WASH, education, SRH, gender, and adolescent health experts to develop a 10-year agenda (2014–2024) aimed at transforming schools for menstruating girls. Additional social entrepreneurs focused on developing affordable menstrual products, and advocacy campaigns grew around "breaking the silence" on menstruation, including support for WASH United from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other donors to launch an annual global Menstrual Hygiene Day on May 28.

In addition, new publications began to call attention to the overdue need to explore additional ways in which menstruation affects girls' lives, such as the need for data on the average age of menarche in countries, the potential for menarche to be a window of opportunity for engaging girls, their parents or caregivers, and teachers on health as a step toward subsequent conversations on SRH, including family planning, and for women, their MHM experiences in the workplace. A study conducted in India explored associations between the use and management of menstrual cloths and disposal pads and reproductive tract infections. The first resource guidance on MHM, Menstrual Hygiene Matters, was published with support from the UK government (DFID), recommending approaches for addressing MHM in development and emergency contexts, and UNESCO, with support from Procter & Gamble, published a puberty policy document including attention to menstruation and MHM as a key component of puberty and comprehensive sexuality education. There also emerged a stronger articulation of menstruation as an issue of health and human rights.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^116b3kA5]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Intersexuality care — communication and parent education centers on establishing ongoing dialogue and tailored information for families. Providers must set an expectation as soon as possible for ongoing, open communication between all parties, and providers can help parents and individuals tolerate diagnostic uncertainty while providing developmentally appropriate information on issues of sex, menstruation, fertility, the need for hormone treatment (adrenal/sex), bone health, and cancer risk. Parents also play a critical role in educating their children and may be the first people to disclose health information to their child, and providers should prepare parents to educate their child and members of their support system about the intersex diagnosis and treatment history. HCPs should assist parents in developing strategies specific to their child's developmental stage that address their psychosocial or cultural concerns and values, and supportive family behaviors predicted greater self-esteem and better health outcomes in individuals.

### Menstruation in girls and adolescents: using the menstrual cycle as a vital sign [^113XF4eq]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Young patients and their parents often are unsure about what represents normal menstrual patterns, and clinicians also may be unsure about normal ranges for menstrual cycle length and amount and duration of flow through adolescence. It is important to be able to educate young patients and their parents regarding what to expect of a first period and about the range for normal cycle length of subsequent menses. It is equally important for clinicians to have an understanding of bleeding patterns in girls and adolescents, the ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal menstruation, and the skill to know how to evaluate young patients' conditions appropriately. Using the menstrual cycle as an additional vital sign adds a powerful tool to the assessment of normal development and the exclusion of pathological conditions.

### Adolescent menstrual health must go beyond pads [^111GBRUi]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Menstruation and the menstrual cycle affect female health and wellbeing from menarche, the first menstrual period, to menopause. Adolescent girls and women worldwide consistently report negative experiences with menstruation, including missed or delayed diagnosis of menstrual disorders. These issues have far reaching consequences for their wellbeing, education, livelihood opportunities, empowerment, and overall health. Investment in menstrual health (box 1) during adolescence is increasingly recognised as a pathway to mitigate these consequences and address gender inequality. This was emphasised in 2022 when the World Health Organization declared menstrual health as a health and human rights issue and not solely a hygiene issue. The emerging concept of menstrual justice highlights how harmful power structures and social norms result in menstrual related discrimination in many spheres of life that impede menstrual health.

Box 1
Main components of menstrual health

Menstrual health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social wellbeing, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in relation to the menstrual cycle. Achieving menstrual health implies that women, girls, and all other people who experience a menstrual cycle can

Access accurate, timely, age appropriate information
Care for their bodies during menstruation, including access to water and sanitation facilities and menstrual materials
Access timely diagnosis, treatment, and care for menstrual related discomforts and disorders
Experience a positive and respectful environment
Decide whether and how to participate in all spheres of life during all phases of the menstrual cycle

Despite increased attention, insufficient data are available on adolescent girls' menstrual health across countries. The absence of data on girls' multidimensional requirements for menstrual health renders the challenges they experience invisible. Partly because of this, the media, donors, governments, and implementers have concentrated on providing menstrual pads as a "quick fix", tangible, and easily measurable solution. Better data from well resourced rigorous research would inform the development of more comprehensive, impactful, and cost effective interventions. Current gaps must be addressed by increasing the visibility of menstrual health in monitoring efforts, research, and the development and implementation of contextually grounded interventions. This would enable a move away from a narrow focus on the provision of pads to address the complexity of adolescent girls' menstrual health needs.

### The red thread: stakeholder perspectives on menstrual health and hygiene in Ghana [^116gJrEb]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Menstrual education and awareness

Many mothers felt uncomfortable discussing their menstrual experiences, with some parents believing it is too personal or 'dirty' to share beyond immediate family members like a husband or children. The discomfort is compounded by cultural norms and financial concerns, particularly when women struggle to afford pads. However, some parents do share menstrual information with their husbands to manage family planning and intimate relations. The negative stigma surrounding menstruation can also lead to poor hygiene practices, as described in one case of menstrual odour. These quotes summarise the parents' responses.

When people are having their menstruation, they are not comfortable speaking about it, and you can see they're complaining about their abdomen, and some too are complaining about money to buy their pads.

Menstruation is a shyness thing, so when people are menstruating the society, the way they will speak about it they and cannot also talk to people about it.

As a woman, you can't discuss issues of menstruation with your family. It is a matter of dirt, and no one needs to know about it; you must not tell anyone.

The majority of parents discussed a mix of biological, cultural and spiritual understandings of menstruation. Many view menstruation as a natural, God-given process, where 'bad blood' is discharged from the body to cleanse and prepare a woman's womb. Menstruation marks a significant transition from childhood to womanhood, signalling a girl's entrance into adolescence. Alongside the physical aspects, there is an emphasis on hygiene and teaching girls how to care for themselves during this time. Menstruation is also tied to family traditions, with many believing it has been a part of life for generations, passed down from ancestors. The following quotes reflect the responses of parents.

Our mothers, women or siblings, women, every new month, bad blood is discharged from them, which is a natural thing set down by God.

Is a time when a girl becomes an adolescent and they reach some certain age and when they reach that age blood comes from them.

"What I understand is gbototsitsi" that's the bad blood that women have withing them comes out for them to be clean and prepared their wombs.

If I hear the word Menstruation, what comes into my mind is that, at that time, what are the things I should do in other not to get pregnant during my period.

2012–2015

Over the next few years, menstruation gained traction as a public health issue for girls in particular. Although in high-income countries it remained within the clinical realm for girls and women, in low- and middle-income countries, research documentation of the MHM barriers faced by girls continued, and pilot trials began to be funded, primarily by the UK Government Medical Research Council, exploring MHM interventions for adolescent girls in school. A pilot trial in Kenya included, for example, the provision of sanitary pads, menstrual cups, and reproductive health information, examining the impact on the rates of sexually transmitted infections and on reproductive tract infections (BV), unintended pregnancy, and school attendance and performance. A case-control study in India examined women's vulnerability to reproductive tract infections in relation to the menstrual cloths or products they used, with the sample drawn from hospitals. Systematic reviews analyzed, for example, the psychosocial and educational effects of addressing menstruation, and a small number of studies explored the impact of early menarche on rates of infection with herpes simplex virus and HIV and AIDS. These growing efforts, particularly those emerging from the water and sanitation arena, contributed to a decision to include MHM in the lobbying related to the new sustainable development goals (SDGs), with the aim of having targets and indicators addressing MHM included in the SDGs. This led to the development of a formal definition for MHM (Box).

### Menstruation: science and society [^114z2TRS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Women's health concerns are generally underrepresented in basic and translational research, but reproductive health in particular has been hampered by a lack of understanding of basic uterine and menstrual physiology. Menstrual health is an integral part of overall health because between menarche and menopause, most women menstruate. Yet for tens of millions of women around the world, menstruation regularly and often catastrophically disrupts their physical, mental, and social well-being. Enhancing our understanding of the underlying phenomena involved in menstruation, abnormal uterine bleeding, and other menstruation-related disorders will move us closer to the goal of personalized care. Furthermore, a deeper mechanistic understanding of menstruation — a fast, scarless healing process in healthy individuals — will likely yield insights into a myriad of other diseases involving regulation of vascular function locally and systemically. We also recognize that many women now delay pregnancy and that there is an increasing desire for fertility and uterine preservation. In September 2018, the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened a 2-day meeting, "Menstruation: Science and Society" with an aim to "identify gaps and opportunities in menstruation science and to raise awareness of the need for more research in this field". Experts in fields ranging from the evolutionary role of menstruation to basic endometrial biology (including omic analysis of the endometrium, stem cells and tissue engineering of the endometrium, endometrial microbiome, and abnormal uterine bleeding and fibroids) and translational medicine (imaging and sampling modalities, patient-focused analysis of menstrual disorders including abnormal uterine bleeding, smart technologies or applications and mobile health platforms) to societal challenges in health literacy and dissemination frameworks across different economic and cultural landscapes shared current state-of-the-art and future vision, incorporating the patient voice at the launch of the meeting. Here, we provide an enhanced meeting report with extensive up-to-date (as of submission) context, capturing the spectrum from how the basic processes of menstruation commence in response to progesterone withdrawal, through the role of tissue-resident and circulating stem and progenitor cells in monthly regeneration — and current gaps in knowledge on how dysregulation leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and other menstruation-related disorders such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, and fibroids — to the clinical challenges in diagnostics, treatment, and patient and societal education. We conclude with an overview of how the global agenda concerning menstruation, and specifically menstrual health and hygiene, are gaining momentum, ranging from increasing investment in addressing menstruation-related barriers facing girls in schools in low- to middle-income countries to the more recent "menstrual equity" and "period poverty" movements spreading across high-income countries.

### Reproductive health counseling in adolescent women with epilepsy: a single-center study [^116hrLfK]. Pediatric Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Counseling adolescent women with epilepsy (WWE) about reproductive health (contraception, sexual activity, and menstruation) is important given the teratogenicity of many antiseizure medications and high rates of contraception failure. Only a third of adolescent WWE report discussing contraception with their epileptologists, demonstrating a significant gap in counseling.

Methods

We assessed factors associated with reproductive health counseling by pediatric neurologists via a retrospective chart review of adolescent (aged 12–18 years) WWE seen at a pediatric neurology clinic from 2018 to 2020.

Results

We analyzed 219 visits among 89 unique WWE. There were 23 documented discussions on contraception (11% of visits), 8 on sexual activity (4%), and 127 on menstruation (58%). When contraception was discussed, sexual activity and menstruation were more frequently discussed. Female providers were more likely to document a discussion of menstruation (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = [1.6, 6.4]). WWE who were older at the time of visit or who had their first seizure at an older age were more likely to have documented discussions of contraception and sexual activity. Neither details of treatment regimen nor epilepsy type was associated with documentation of counseling.

Conclusions

A minority of adolescent WWE have documented reproductive health discussions, demonstrating a need for quality improvement projects to address this gap in care.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^1131ovQ4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

The purpose of this document is to review currently available management options, general principles, and counseling approaches for reproductive-aged patients requesting menstrual suppression. It includes considerations for unique populations, including adolescents, patients with physical or cognitive disabilities or both, and those with limited access to health care. Gynecologists should be familiar with the use of hormonal therapy for menstrual suppression (including combined oral contraceptive pills, combined hormonal patches, vaginal rings, progestin-only pills, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, and the etonogestrel implant). Approaches to counseling should be individualized based on patient preferences and goals, average treatment effectiveness, and contraindications or risk factors for adverse events. Counseling regarding the choice of hormonal medication for menstrual suppression should be approached with the utmost respect for patient autonomy and be free of coercion. Complete amenorrhea may be difficult to achieve; thus, obstetrician-gynecologists and other clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers, if applicable, about realistic expectations.

VI. Conclusion

Each year, 4.5 million women in the United States experience at least 1 gynecologic health problem, and many of these problems are related to menstrual health. Although significant progress has been made in menstrual health research in terms of emphasizing patient experience, standardizing terminologies related to menstrual bleeding, and use of PROMs for menstrual disorders, more work and research are needed to standardize data collection, generate longitudinal data on contemporary norms of menstrual bleeding and related symptoms, and optimize use of new technologies and educational interventions. Health communication strategies that are accessible to groups with low literacy and address potential stigma associated with menstruation will help to address barriers as well. Increasing the evidence base on menstrual health and menstrual health literacy will aid in the evolution of contemporary clinical care that meets the unique needs of women. Bringing women and advocacy groups to the table and bringing data collection and information directly to women through innovative technologies, smartphone apps, and mHealth has the potential to move the field of menstruation science away from treating problems and toward optimizing women's overall health, and more specifically menstrual health. Continuing the recent momentum on patient-focused menstrual health research to sustain progress in the field of menstrual health, literacy, and communication has the potential to have a substantial impact on the lives of women.

### Prepregnancy counseling: committee opinion no. 762 [^115qZgaL]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — infertility evaluation and ovulation timing — states that an ovulatory woman younger than 35 years without a clearly identifiable risk factor for infertility should be expeditiously evaluated if not pregnant after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, whereas a woman who is 35 years and older should be evaluated after 6 months, with strong consideration for evaluation and treatment upon presentation for anovulatory women or those with a clearly identifiable risk factor. Referral to a fertility specialist for males and females may be considered at any point if the infertility etiology, indicated treatment, or attempted treatment failures exceeds the expertise of the obstetrician–gynecologist. Monthly ovulation is likely with regular and predictable menses with no greater than 2–3-day variance within a range of 25–35 days; cycles every 26–28 days are likely ovulatory, whereas cycles of 25, 34, 26, then 35 days are likely not ovulatory. Patients desiring pregnancy should be counseled that the fertile window is intercourse in the 3–4 days before ovulation and that intercourse every 1–2 days yields the highest pregnancy rates, and although patients may inquire about ovulation predictor kits or electronic apps, these tools vary in quality and data on usefulness are limited.

### Menstruation: science and society [^113wf6Lz]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Women's health concerns are generally underrepresented in basic and translational research, but reproductive health in particular has been hampered by a lack of understanding of basic uterine and menstrual physiology. Menstrual health is an integral part of overall health because between menarche and menopause, most women menstruate. Yet for tens of millions of women around the world, menstruation regularly and often catastrophically disrupts their physical, mental, and social well-being. Enhancing our understanding of the underlying phenomena involved in menstruation, abnormal uterine bleeding, and other menstruation-related disorders will move us closer to the goal of personalized care. Furthermore, a deeper mechanistic understanding of menstruation-a fast, scarless healing process in healthy individuals-will likely yield insights into a myriad of other diseases involving regulation of vascular function locally and systemically. We also recognize that many women now delay pregnancy and that there is an increasing desire for fertility and uterine preservation. In September 2018, the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened a 2-day meeting, "Menstruation: Science and Society" with an aim to "identify gaps and opportunities in menstruation science and to raise awareness of the need for more research in this field". Experts in fields ranging from the evolutionary role of menstruation to basic endometrial biology (including omic analysis of the endometrium, stem cells and tissue engineering of the endometrium, endometrial microbiome, and abnormal uterine bleeding and fibroids) and translational medicine (imaging and sampling modalities, patient-focused analysis of menstrual disorders including abnormal uterine bleeding, smart technologies or applications and mobile health platforms) to societal challenges in health literacy and dissemination frameworks across different economic and cultural landscapes shared current state-of-the-art and future vision, incorporating the patient voice at the launch of the meeting. Here, we provide an enhanced meeting report with extensive up-to-date (as of submission) context, capturing the spectrum from how the basic processes of menstruation commence in response to progesterone withdrawal, through the role of tissue-resident and circulating stem and progenitor cells in monthly regeneration-and current gaps in knowledge on how dysregulation leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and other menstruation-related disorders such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, and fibroids-to the clinical challenges in diagnostics, treatment, and patient and societal education. We conclude with an overview of how the global agenda concerning menstruation, and specifically menstrual health and hygiene, are gaining momentum, ranging from increasing investment in addressing menstruation-related barriers facing girls in schools in low- to middle-income countries to the more recent "menstrual equity" and "period poverty" movements spreading across high-income countries.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^113nFmNV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation poses unique challenges for women of reproductive age. Clinicians prescribing anticoagulants must counsel patients on issues ranging from menstruation and the possibility of developing a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst to teratogenic risks and safety with breastfeeding. Abnormal uterine bleeding affects up to 70% of young women who are treated with anticoagulation. As such, thoughtful clinical guidance is required to avoid having young women who are troubled by their menses, dose reduce, or prematurely discontinue their anticoagulation, leaving them at increased risk of recurrent thrombosis. Informed by a review of the medical literature, we present current recommendations for assisting patients requiring anticoagulation with menstrual management, prevention of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, and avoiding unintended pregnancy. The subdermal implant may be considered a first-line option for those requiring anticoagulation, given its superior contraceptive effectiveness and ability to reliably reduce risk of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. All progestin-only formulations-such as the subdermal implant, intrauterine device, injection, or pills-are generally preferred over combined hormonal pills, patch, or ring. Tranexamic acid, and in rare cases endometrial ablation, may also be useful in managing menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. During pregnancy, enoxaparin remains the preferred anticoagulant and warfarin is contraindicated. Breastfeeding women may use warfarin, but direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended given their limited safety data. This practical guide for clinicians is designed to inform discussions of risks and benefits of anticoagulation therapy for women of reproductive age.

### Beyond menstrual hygiene: addressing vaginal bleeding throughout the life course in low and middle-income countries [^115eEvgH]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Girls and women experience numerous types of vaginal bleeding. These include healthy reproductive processes, such as menstruation and bleeding after childbirth, but also bleeding related to health conditions, such as fibroids or cancer. In most societies, the management of menstruation is handled covertly, something girls are often instructed about at menarche. The management of other vaginal bleeding is often similarly discreet, although behaviours are not well documented. In many societies, cultural taboos frequently hinder open discussion around vaginal bleeding, restricting information and early access to healthcare. Additionally, the limited availability of clean, accessible water and sanitation facilities in many low and middle-income countries augments the challenges girls and women face in conducting daily activities while managing vaginal bleeding, including participating in school or work, going to the market or fetching water. This paper aims to highlight the key vaginal bleeding experiences throughout a woman's life course and the intersection of these bleeding experiences with their access to adequate water and sanitation facilities, information and education sources, and supplies. The aim is to address the silence around girls and women's vaginal bleeding and their related social, physical and clinical management needs across the life course; and highlight critical gaps that require attention in research, practice and policy around this neglected topic of health and gender equality.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^1117ZBmJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^116xD4wk]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

Late menopausal transition (Stage −1) — amenorrhea of 60 days or longer marks this stage, and quantitative criteria include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw, approximating more than 40 IU/L in previously used urine-based standards. Based on menstrual calendar and hormonal changes, this stage is estimated to last, on average, 1 to 3 years, and symptoms, most notably vasomotor symptoms, are likely to occur. Researchers and clinicians should carefully evaluate the appropriate FSH value depending on the assay used.

### Is the current cut point for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) correct for diagnosing diabetes mellitus in premenopausal women? Evidence to inform discussion [^11618jvB]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Glycated haemoglobin is considered as an overall measure of average blood glucose levels over the previous 120 days. However, the reference range for HbA1c was based on a small study conducted on 205 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 124 controls without diabetes, without reporting of the number of male and female study participants.

In premenopausal women, the HbA1c has been reported as lower than men of the same age. This may be due to menstruation and hence shorter erythrocyte survival which results in shorter exposure of haemoglobin to glucose compared with individuals who do not menstruate. Given that the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is also based on HbA1c, the use of a non-specific reference range and cut point for diabetes mellitus for premenopausal women could potentially lead to underdiagnosis of diabetes mellitus in women and missed opportunities for intervention. Therefore, we investigated whether there is a difference in distribution of HbA1c in premenopausal women versus men of the same age by comparing HbA1c values in men and women across multiple sites in the UK. We also estimated the number of women who could be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus using this new reference range.

### Age at menarche, reactions to menarche and attitudes towards menstruation among Mexican adolescent girls [^114SVy7z]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relationships between menarcheal timing and both menarcheal experience and attitudes toward menstruation in Mexican girls.

Design

Cross-sectional survey.

Settings

Sample of adolescents attending 10 different public schools.

Participants

Mexican postmenarcheal adolescents, aged 11–16 years.

Intervention

Participants answered 1 questionnaire about menarcheal experience and another about attitudes towards menstruation.

Results

Early maturers (menarche before 11 years) were more likely than average (menarche at 11 or 12 years) or late maturers (menarche at 13 or more years) to state they had not known what they should do at the moment they got their first period (P < .01), that they had not felt prepared to start menstruating (P < .05), and that they thought they must keep secret the fact of already having had their first period (P < .05). Concerning their emotional reactions to menarche, early maturers were the most likely to have felt scared (P < .05), worried (P < .05) and sad (P < .05) and were the least likely to have felt calm (P < .05). They were also the most likely to show current secretive attitudes towards menstruation (P < .01). Finally, late maturers showed more positive attitudes toward menstruation than their peers (P < .01).

Conclusions

These results could be useful for developing resources to help early maturing girls manage menstruation. Since these girls have limited or in some cases no time for preparation, they need special support.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^112LLoQR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

To understand rates of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) experienced by women of reproductive age on anticoagulation, we searched PubMed and EMBASE using the following key terms: "reproductive health" OR "childbearing age" OR "reproductive age" OR "menstrual cycle" OR menstruat* OR menstrual* OR "heavy menstrual bleeding" OR "Menstruation Disturbances" OR "uterine hemorrhage" OR "vaginal bleeding" OR menorrhagia OR "breakthrough bleeding" OR "spotting" OR "dysfunctional uterine bleeding" OR "ovarian cysts" OR "ovarian cyst" AND (Anticoagulants OR anticoagulant* OR anticoagulat*). We selected articles that included observational and comparative studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, reviews, and practice guidelines. With the goal of identifying current literature, search dates were restricted to the prior decade (2011–2021), which aligns with the initial US Food and Drug Administration approval of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants. From 204 records screened, 20 articles were included in this review (see Supplementary Material).

We also draw on the IBM Micromedex and LactMed databases for clinical data regarding drug safety and adverse events of six commonly used anticoagulants: apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, enoxaparin, and warfarin. We will refer to both the anti-Xa inhibitors (i.e. apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (i.e. dabigatran) as direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). By summarizing key information from these resources and select society guidelines, we have created a practical reference to guide clinical discussions with women of reproductive age regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation.

### Menstruation: science and society [^114Y5XUo]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although awareness of the importance of patient experience with menstrual bleeding and menstrual symptoms has increased in research and clinical care, sustained reliance on "objective" laboratory measures for outcomes related to menstrual health represents an additional conceptual barrier to progress in this area. To provide an AUB-specific example, traditionally in research, bleeding was measured by volume of menstrual blood lost (> 80 mL) as measured by the collection of used sanitary products and quantified using the alkaline hematin method. However, research has highlighted that most women who seek treatment for HMB do not meet the objective mean blood loss criteria for heavy bleeding and clinical care objectively measured blood loss is not feasible. As a result of these studies and others, NICE, the National Health Services (NHS) in the United Kingdom, stated in 2018 that "From the woman's point of view objective reduction in mean blood loss are poor indicators of treatment effectiveness for heavy menstrual bleeding". This lack of consistency between what has been prioritized as a measurement for research and what women prioritize in terms of desired outcomes represents a current obstacle for high-quality research and synergy between research on HMB, clinical care, and patient-centered care delivery.

IV. Critical gaps in menstrual health literacy, advocacy, or communication and how they can be addressed to optimize women's menstrual health

Conceptual, practical, and technical challenges related to research on menstrual health and menstrual health literacy and communication have led to several critical gaps in the evidence base in this area. During the meeting, several gaps in the evidence base and opportunities to improve women's health by addressing these gaps with high-quality research were discussed.

### Is early age at menarche a risk factor for endometriosis? A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies [^1119ANWq]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Discuss: You can discuss this article with its authors and with other ASRM members at

Endometriosis is characterized by benign proliferation of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma in the peritoneal cavity, resulting in inflammation and scarring, often leading to pelvic pain and infertility. It affects 6%–10% of women of reproductive age.

The anatomical distribution of endometriotic implantsand higher prevalence of the disease in women with obstructive Müllerian anomalies support Sampson's theory of retrograde menstruation as the chief causal mechanism. However, other factors, such as the frequency and volume of menstrual reflux, probably modify the risk. Accordingly, menstrual cycle characteristics (such as age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycle length, and heavy menstruation), which reflect the frequency of exposure to menstruation or volume of menstrual reflux, might be expected to influence endometriosis risk.

Early age at menarche, often defined as ≤ 11 years old, might increase a woman's exposure to menstruation during her reproductive lifetime and consequently increase the risk of endometriosis. A number of studies, commonly using case-control designs, have examined the relationship between early age at menarche and endometriosis, with varying conclusions. No specific attempt has been made to review systematically the literature on this possible association.

This systematic review evaluates the association of early age at menarche and risk of endometriosis and combines results of previously published studies in a meta-analysis.

### Beyond menstrual hygiene: addressing vaginal bleeding throughout the life course in low and middle-income countries [^115T13zi]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention to women and girls' health risks and outcomes beyond the reproductive years is increasing, with life course approaches emphasising that health is dynamic and cumulative, and influenced by genetic, biological, behavioural, social and economic contexts. This paper assesses the range of vaginal bleeding episodes ('episodes' herein used to represent episodic vaginal bleeding, including both menstrual and due to other causes) that girls and women may experience during the life course, and their associated needs for information, supplies water and sanitation. Based on the recent, growing knowledge base of the challenges women and girls in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) face during menstruation due to these needs being largely unmet, this paper hypothesises that the evidence to date represents the 'tip of an iceberg'. A life course approach is required, one that looks at vaginal bleeding including and beyond menstruation, to comprehensively address the critical needs of girls and women for information, supplies, water and sanitation in LMICs.

Throughout the life course, girls and women experience numerous episodes of vaginal bleeding, many of which remain hidden due to misinformation, fear, embarrassment, shame and taboo. This features the more widely known bleeding experience of monthly menstruation, as well as other less discussed bleeding episodes, including those related to pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum, miscarriage, cancers and endometriosis (see table 1). To navigate these experiences, girls and women require factual and supportive information that enables them to differentiate between healthy and abnormal bleeding, to understand and take care of their bodies or those of dependents who may require assisted care, and to seek health advice appropriately. To manage vaginal bleeding hygienically and with dignity requires adequate (clean, safe, private, affordable and accessible at any time) water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities, and supplies (ie, soap, sanitary products, basins). Basic essentials required to manage menstrual needs have only recently been characterised (see box 1). The ways in which women and girls manage these bleeding experiences can vary greatly depending on factors associated with the bleeding itself, their particular life course trajectory (age, agency, previous life experiences) and the broader physical and social environments in which they operate. For women living in LMICs, support and WASH services are particularly lacking.

### The correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112W52K1]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Menstruation serves as an indicator of women's reproductive well-being and plays a pivotal role in their fertility; nevertheless, there remains an ongoing debate regarding the epidemiological evidence linking menstrual characteristics as well as fertility.

Objective

To explore the correlation between menstrual characteristics and fertility in women of reproductive age.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane libraries to identify research articles published up until February 9, 2024.

Study Selection and Synthesis

We included all studies in which the relationship between menstrual characteristics and pregnancy rates among women of reproductive age was investigated. We excluded studies involving the administration of oral contraceptives, the application of assisted reproductive technologies, and individuals with a documented history of infertility or partners with a known history of infertility.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical pregnancy and miscarriage.

Result(S)

This meta-analysis was composed of nine studies involving a total of 399,966 women, and the evidential quality derived from these studies was deemed to be high with a low risk of bias. Compared with a normal menstrual cycle length (25–32 days), the impact of a short (< 25 days) or long (> 32 days) menstrual cycle on a woman's pregnancy was relatively insignificant ([odds ratio {OR}, 0.81; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.65–1.01; I², 68%] [OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.75–1.06; I², 60%], respectively); however, a change in cycle length may increase the risk of miscarriage ([relative risk, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11–3.15; I², 0] [relative risk, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.07, 2.57; I², 43%], respectively). In comparison to women experiencing menarche at a typical age (12–14 years), those with a late age at menarche (> 14 years) exhibited a decreased likelihood of pregnancy (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.91–0.93; I², 0%); and compared with women experiencing a normal duration of menstrual bleeding (4–7 days), those with a short duration of menstrual bleeding (< 4 days) exhibited reduced fertility potential (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84–0.88; I², 29%).

Conclusion(S)

Short and long menstrual cycle lengths may elevate women's susceptibility to spontaneous abortion, whereas late age at menarche as well as short duration of menstrual bleeding appear to be linked to diminished fertility among women of reproductive age.

### International evidence-based recommendations for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents [^116nQGHZ]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This manuscript summarizes specific adolescent recommendations from the 2023 International Evidence-based PCOS Guideline. The Guideline was a result of extensive international engagement and robust methodological evidence-based processes and was independently reviewed. This manuscript provides healthcare professionals, adolescents, and their families with the most recent evidence-based recommendations to improve health outcomes. There are fewer recommendations for adolescents than for adult women highlighting the limited number of adolescent PCOS studies and emphasizing the need for further research.

Adolescent PCOS diagnosis has always been challenging as normal physiological changes overlap with adult PCOS diagnostic criteria resulting in delayed and underdiagnosis as well as potential overdiagnosis. While evidence supports the use of PCOM and AMH levels for the diagnosis of PCOS in adults, PCOM or AMH should not be used for diagnosis in adolescents to minimize the risk of overdiagnosis. PCOM or AMH can be used at approximately 8 years postmenarche when the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is mature and evidence-based criteria for PCOM are available.

For adolescent PCOS diagnosis, the Guideline recommends the combination of menstrual irregularities defined according to the time postmenarche and clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism following the exclusion of other disorders. The use of these well-defined criteria for PCOS diagnosis during adolescence will promote accurate and timely diagnosis during this life stage. This approach will allow the detection of adolescents at considerable risk of weight gain and diabetes by establishing early screening with the management of long-term metabolic risks and enabling the optimization of long-term fertility outcomes. As delayed diagnosis has been reported in adolescents, adolescents with either menstrual irregularities or clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism can be considered "at risk" for PCOS. This tactic addresses concerns of inappropriately labeling an adolescent with a PCOS diagnosis while avoiding delayed diagnosis when appropriate follow-up is in place.

### Menstrual health and hygiene among adolescents in the United States [^113gYdrj]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Menstrual health in adolescents has been understudied in the United States. We aimed to assess patient and provider perspectives surrounding menstrual health management and screening.

Design

Our mixed-methods approach consisted of provider surveys, patient surveys, and patient interviews.

Setting

Participants were recruited from a pediatric gynecology practice or an adolescent medicine clinic at an urban tertiary academic center.

Participants

Providers were pediatrics faculty or residents. Patients aged 13–24 years were eligible.

Intervention

Participants completed an anonymous survey or semi-structured interview about their experiences with menstrual health.

Main Outcome Measures

Descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis were used for quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Convergent parallel analysis elucidated key findings in both data sets.

Results

The provider survey response rate was 65% (69/106); 15% (9/69) of providers consistently asked patients about menstrual products, whereas 44% (27/68) were concerned patients could not afford products. The patient survey response rate was 85% (101/119); 19% (19/101) of respondents reported menstrual hygiene insecurity, 55% (55/101) missed commitments during menses, and 45% (45/101) discussed menstrual products with providers. Fifteen patients were invited for qualitative interviews; 10 were conducted, and thematic saturation occurred. Interviews highlighted the importance of comprehensive early menstrual health education and providers' role in menstrual management.

Conclusion

Adolescence is a crucial point of entry into health care. Because taboos surrounding menstruation could limit access to health care, menstrual health education must be emphasized. Menstrual health education is provided piecemeal by parents, schools, and providers. Current practice should be reevaluated to consider comprehensive educational approaches in which health care leads.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — migraine in women of childbearing age highlights that migraine prevalence in women increases after menarche and peaks before menopause, affecting up to 25% of individuals of childbearing age; migraine might change throughout the menstrual cycle in severity, most bothersome symptoms (MBS), and frequency, with pure menstrual migraine defined as occurring exclusively on day 1 ± 2 [days, -2 to + 3] of menstruation in at least two out of three menstrual cycles and at no other times of the cycle, and menstrually related migraine defined as occurring exclusively on day 1 ± 2 [days, -2 to +3] of menstruation in at least two of three menstrual cycles and additionally at other times of the cycle, which might require different treatment approaches; studies have found significant relationships between migraine and placental abruption, preeclampsia, and stroke during pregnancy, and given the high prevalence and increased risk of adverse outcomes related to migraine in individuals of childbearing age, discussion regarding contraception and early treatment to reduce the burden of disease while minimizing teratogenic effects should be considered; with the emergence of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors (both monoclonal antibodies [mAb] and -gepants) and neuromodulation, little is known regarding their safety in pregnancy and lactation.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^114HkjwM]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Adolescents 'at risk' of PCOS

A practice point for this section is that, for adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet the diagnostic criteria, the 'at risk' of PCOS label could be considered and reassessment is advised at or before full reproductive maturity. This timing is at 3 years post menarche in relation to menstrual cycle irregularity and at 8 years post menarche in relation to the use of pelvic ultrasound to identify a polycystic ovarian morphology, as described in the ultrasound section. The timing of reassessment in relation to menstrual cycles was based on physiological maturation of the hypothalamic–pituitary ovarian axis and the likelihood of having ovulatory cycles matching those of women in reproductive age. Reassessment is particularly important for adolescent girls with persisting PCOS features and those with significant weight gain in adolescence and should occur after hormonal therapy washout of at least 3 months if this therapy has been commenced (whilst ensuring contraceptive needs are met). This recommendation is based on the need to address isolated symptoms, such as irregular menstrual cycles or clinical hyperandrogenism, where the diagnosis of PCOS remains unclear as pelvic ultrasound is not recommended at this life stage. PCOS cannot be diagnosed during adolescence unless both irregular menstrual cycles or hyperandrogenism are present. It was recommended that these adolescents be made aware of their 'at risk' status for PCOS and that future re-evaluation may be needed if both features persist beyond 3 years post menarche. This recommendation emerged from published evidence as well as from strong and consistent feedback from women with PCOS, who had a poor diagnostic experience and often failed to be diagnosed during adolescence, remaining unaware of this potential diagnosis until seeking treatment for infertility (see Section 1.1 in the Technical Report). Adult physicians and reproductive endocrinologists also expressed significant concern over delayed diagnosis. All GDGs highlighted the need to acknowledge 'risk' yet avoid over-diagnosis or premature labelling. Another practice point for this section is that, in adolescents with irregular menstrual cycles and 'at risk', the value and optimal timing of assessment and diagnosis of PCOS should be discussed with the adolescent and their families, considering all diagnostic challenges at this life stage as well as psychosocial and cultural factors.

### Rates of menstrual history-taking and counseling with anticancer treatments are low: people who menstruate deserve gender-specific cancer care [^114kMQRd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chemotherapy predisposes people who menstruate to abnormal uterine bleeding that can be life-threatening and may also damage ovaries, resulting in premature menopause. The purpose of this study was to explore the incidence of menstrual history documentation and counseling before, during, and after cancer treatment.

Patients and Methods

The medical charts of 137 consecutive females (self-reported) aged 18 to 49 years receiving anticancer treatment at a major tertiary metropolitan hospital in Australia between 2017 and 2020 were reviewed. Data collected included primary diagnosis, stage of cancer, treatment(s) received, rates of remission or progression, documentation of involvement of a specialist gynecologist, reproductive history, menstrual disturbances, menstruation counseling or intervention offered, and diagnosis of early ovarian failure.

Results

Only 16.1% of patients had their menstrual history documented at the initial consult, and 49.6% had their menstrual history documented at a subsequent consult with their treating oncologist or hematologist. Most (82.4%) patients with a menstrual history documented experienced menstrual disturbance posttreatment, most commonly amenorrhea (48.0%), followed by menopause or menopause symptoms (20.6%), irregular menstrual bleeding (16.7%), menorrhagia (13.7%), dysmenorrhea (3.9%), and iron deficiency from bleeding (2.9%). Menopause/Menopausal symptoms and iron deficiency were more likely to be treated than other disturbances.

Conclusions

Menstruation disturbance is a common side effect of cancer treatment. Menstrual care should be integral to cancer care for people who menstruate, and higher engagement could be achieved through education of medical and allied health staff, information technology systems automating prompts and referral pathways, regular audits to ensure compliance, better alliances between cancer and fertility specialists, and the creation of accessible patient information to promote awareness and facilitate discussion.

### Measure do not guess: a call to action to end assumed and estimated menstrual cycle phases in research [^111vF6ds]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The solution

The way to establish menstrual cycle phases in research (ie, laboratory and field-based studies) is clear: in addition to noting regular bleeding, investigators need to measure ovulation and progesterone, noting that the ideal frequency and modality of these measurements are still to be determined. Studies using this approach date back to the early 2000sand guidance on this approach has been produced several times within the last 5 years. Although this approach may be challenging in field-based studies, it is certainly not impossible.

3A. Menstruation and abnormal uterine bleeding

Hilary O.D. Critchley, MD; Jacqueline A. Maybin, PhD

I. The impact of menstrual bleeding complaints

Understanding the mechanisms underpinning the pivotal human event of menstruation is critical to our understanding of AUB. AUB, which includes the symptom of HMB, is a chronic complaint that affects the quality of life and well-being of 1 in 4 women of reproductive age (Figure 4). Previously, women experienced menstruation approximately 40 times owing to pregnancy and lactation amenorrhea, whereas in developed economies today, women can expect up to 400 menses in their lifetime. Therefore, AUB is becoming more common and problematic for women and society. In contemporary society, women are delaying having children for a variety of reasons such as personal choice, prioritization of career, and other factors that impose a delay in childbearing. Therefore, these women wish to preserve their uterus alongside their fertility. As a consequence, surgical options are not always appropriate because these end fertility and may also involve higher risks than medical management alternatives. In a recent systematic review relevant to the United States, it was conservatively estimated that annual direct and indirect economic costs of menstrual bleeding complaints were in the order of $1 billion and $12 billion, respectively. Leiomyoma (uterine fibroids) are common, present in 70% to 80% of women by the age of 50 years, and associated with AUB or HMB. Among women in their 30s and 40s, leiomyomas are often the underlying cause of AUB, anemia, and iron deficiency anemia. When the presence of uterine fibroids is considered along with complaints of AUB, the annual estimated direct costs of this complaint in the United States, when surgery, hospital attendances, outpatient visits, and prescribed medications are taken into account, are as high as $4.1 billion to $9.4 billion. Furthermore, lost work hours resulted in costs ranging from $1.55 billion to $17.2 billion.

### Reproductive health needs of adolescent and young adult women with pediatric rheumatic diseases [^112n6KCW]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Some AYAs and parents wanted the opportunity to have a thorough annual discussion wherein healthcare providers prompted reproductive health concerns that families should consider. One high school participant wanted providers to "confirm that I still understand what's going on because now I am older [than 8 years old when I was diagnosed] and can think about [pregnancy] more and know the actual side effects instead of just like, 'by the way, don't do this in the future'. Participants suggested this discussion be built into the electronic medical record system. Across all formats, the ultimate goal of education was normalization: " Patients have questions, but they don't want to ask them. So let's more normalize at a young age and you know when that time comes, you know, we're more open to talk about it " (conference group participant).
2 Altered discussion around sex and intimacy: Across groups, participants commented on the communication dynamics between AYAs, parents, and healthcare providers when discussing reproductive health concerns. Participants viewed decisions around reproductive health, such as taking contraception or having sex, as inextricably tied to AYAs' ability to manage their symptoms and maintain their health. As a result, participants agreed that parents/guardians should be included within some of this discussion, but opinions varied on how parent involvement should be implemented.

In the first cohort, AYAs' families had grown accustomed to speaking openly about sexual activity, menstrual periods, and contraception use, both within and outside of healthcare visits, and therefore AYAs erred on the side of openness and honesty with family members (e.g. mother, father, grandmother). One high school participant stated, "It makes [sex] more a public thing, [rather] than a private matter between two people". First cohort participants noted closer family relationships may have developed after overcoming a difficult rheumatic disease course and/or needing to collaborate to obtain sufficient health-related information.

Both AYAs and parents acknowledged that some discussions did not come naturally, " because, you know, it's still your [parent], you're still young, it's still weird". For example, several high school participants reported their fathers accompanied them to their healthcare appointments. Despite these participants' preferences to discuss reproductive health issues in the presence of female guardians, they ultimately deferred to their fathers because of availability:

### Prevalence and impact of dysmenorrhea among university students in Ireland [^1151fKyS]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Consultation rates were relatively high in the current sample but still suboptimal given the symptom burden reported. This is consistent with previous research. Low consultation rates may also explain the low prevalence of secondary dysmenorrhea in this sample (5.4%); it is likely that some respondents classed in this study as having PD may have had undiagnosed gynecological conditions such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids. This may also partly explain why some participants reported unusually short durations between periods. Low healthcare consultation rates may be in part due to enduring stigma surrounding menstruation and a lack of education resulting in poor menstrual health literacy and reduced help seeking. It may also be due to the enduring and harmful idea that menstrual pain is something that must be tolerated as "part of being a woman". Consequently, many people who menstruate choose menstrual pain management strategies without consulting a medical professional, which may result in unnecessary pain and suffering. This is evident from the data, whereby many participants relied on less effective pain management strategies over those supported by evidence. For example, paracetamol was the most commonly used analgesic despite limited scientific evidence of clinical effectiveness for menstrual pain; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the first-line treatment for menstrual pain, were less commonly used despite similar cost and ready availability in Ireland. This is in line with previous research, including a recent meta-analysis, which reported paracetamol to be the most widely used analgesic despite more than 50% of respondents reporting that it was not always effective for managing their pain. Varying perceived effectiveness ratings in this sample may indicate that what works for one individual may not work for another, particularly regarding nonpharmacological strategies. However, this may reflect that some young people who menstruate lack the necessary knowledge to allow them to self-manage menstrual pain effectively and may endure severe and debilitating symptoms without seeking medical attention and pain management support. Health education measures are needed to promote menstrual health literacy among young people and reduce stigma around menstruation. Comprehensive school- and community-based menstrual health education initiatives that are evidence-based, accessible, and inclusive can serve to increase health literacy, which in turn has positive impacts on understanding, agency and self-management, and appropriate help-seeking behavior. To reduce stigma, educational initiatives should aim to normalize discussion of menstrual health issues by including boys and men in the conversation. Providing this education to children at a younger age (i.e. primary school age) may also promote healthy physical and emotional development into adolescence and adulthood.

### Sexual and reproductive health education for patients with myelomeningocele [^113qT9p4]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the sexual and reproductive health education received by patients with myelomeningocele, the most severe form of spina bifida.

Method

A survey designed to assess the sexual and reproductive health education given by a healthcare provider to patients with myelomeningocele was offered to all English-speaking patients aged 12years or older with a myelomeningocele clinic visit.

Results

In total, 67 surveys were completed. Menstruation and menstrual management were discussed at a rate of 85% in females. Few patients had discussions with a provider about fertility (42%), sexuality (37%), risk of sexually transmitted infections (45%), or had a relationship with a reproductive healthcare provider (54%). Differences by sex were observed for contraceptive education. The rate of discussions increased with age. A total of 67% of female patients and 33% of male patients requested a referral to a reproductive healthcare provider.

Interpretation

Sexual and reproductive health education is part of comprehensive care for all patients and those with disabilities should not be excluded. The lack of consistent education received by patients supports the need for increased attention to this topic. We encourage multidisciplinary myelomeningocele clinics to establish a process for delivering complete and patient-specific sexual and reproductive health education.

Table 1
Priority menstrual health and hygiene indicators

While this initial list of indicators begins to tackle gaps in understanding of the benefits of investing in menstrual health, a broader range of indicators is needed to build a robust evidence base. Linking these measures to evidence of their association with broader health and social outcomes such as menstrual health over the life course or academic success could yield further insight and spur investment. Additionally, it would increase attention to the diverse domains and interventions needed to improve menstrual health related health, education, social and economic outcomes.

### The normal menstrual cycle [^11611Ehq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The normal ovulatory menstrual cycle requires the presence of a mature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and highly coordinated hormonal feedback loops. Consisting of three phases (follicular, ovulatory, and luteal), the normal menstrual cycle results in the formation of a mature follicle and release of an oocyte during each cycle, with menses occurring in the absence of fertilization. While adolescents may initially experience anovulatory cycles following menarche, the vast majority of cycles will be fairly regular, lasting 21 to 45 days in length with an average of three to seven days of bleeding. Absence of menarche by age 15, absence of menses for three consecutive months, and menses lasting eight days or longer with or without associated heavy bleeding are among the menstrual abnormalities that warrant further evaluation. Obtaining the menstrual history in adolescents with the knowledge of expected menstrual patterns allows the pediatric practitioner to provide appropriate counseling and education to adolescents and their families, and to identify menstrual abnormalities when they arise. Treating the menstrual cycle as a "vital sign" highlights the importance of normal menses as an indicator of an individual's overall health and enables timely identification of any concerning findings.

If CHCs are started within the first 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, no additional contraceptive protection is needed. If CHCs are started > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g., condoms) for the next 7 days.

### Beyond menstrual hygiene: addressing vaginal bleeding throughout the life course in low and middle-income countries [^11455e9V]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Ongoing secrecy around vaginal bleeding

Though international development priorities have, to some extent, targeted adolescence and reproductive health related to childbearing, there is a marked silence around vaginal bleeding that girls and women experience over 40–50 years of the life course. This silence hinders attention to the significant information, and WASH-related needs that they face to manage bleeding, and may hinder the seeking out of healthcare as needed.

More specifically, recent studies in India highlighted the 'sanitation-related psychosocial stress' girls and women experience around their sanitation needs (ie, urination, defecation, menstruation). While episodes of vaginal bleeding beyond menstruation are not noted, menstruation-related behaviours were considered the most stressful for women. Such stress may be exacerbated by a lack of adequate management guidance, particularly for bleeding episodes that are not openly discussed. For example, it is likely that many girls in low-income contexts are inadequately informed about irregular monthly bleeding, or that women feel inadequately informed about how to manage heavy bleeding and discomfort from fibroids or endometriosis. Given the density of obstetricians across low-income countries ranges from 0.042 to 12.5 per 100 000, with many healthcare workers who may not have quality training in reproductive health conditions and illnesses, girls and women may struggle to access healthcare to understand what is happening in their bodies and to receive treatment for their conditions, and to openly discuss an increased need for hygienic toilet facilities and supplies.

V. Additional future directions in menstrual health research

Transforming comparative effectiveness research by incorporating patient-reported outcome measures into electronic health records

Looking to the future, standardizing and harnessing the potential of patient-based outcomes assessment could transform comparative effectiveness research. Emerging technology developments may be paving the way to have PROM collection integrated into electronic health records, which would promote patient-centered comparative effectiveness research. Researchers, policy makers, and professional societies are currently working out best practices for integrating PROMs and electronic health records. This integration could mean substantially greater capabilities for patient-relevant comparative effectiveness research and health services research, which often relies on electronic health record or administrative datasets that rarely incorporated patient-reported data elements, particularly on reproductive health problems that affect the quality of life.

Incorporating PROM collection into clinical care encounters may represent major opportunities to evaluate processes of healthcare delivery. Future research opportunities include assessing whether or not incorporating PROMs into electronic health records and clinical encounters for menstrual health disorders can improve physician-patient interactions and be used to monitor patient symptoms or progress over time. On the population level, incorporating PROMs into clinical care can assist with clinical care quality assessment and population surveillance. For example, in the UK NHS, PROMs are collected before and after certain surgical interventions to determine the quality of care delivery and to facilitate counseling for patients on what to anticipate in terms of the personal impact of the surgery.

Partnerships across diverse disciplines and stakeholder groups

Innovative solutions to address comprehensive menstrual health across the life span will require collaboration across scientific disciplines, social science disciplines, and involvement of patient- and person-facing organization to ensure the relevance and success of these solutions for addressing the needs of the population. Menstrual health research in the future could be enhanced by developing collaborative interdisciplinary teams to investigate comprehensive menstrual health premenarche to menopause. In addition, including patient-facing groups in study design and beta testing of programs from the beginning and partnering with patient groups and advocacy groups to create and disseminate communication platforms and menstrual health educational initiatives could enhance the fields of menstrual health, menstrual health literacy, and menstrual health communication.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 747: gynecologic issues in children and adolescent cancer patients and survivors [^115C9Yn3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of cancer in females younger than 20 years is rare, with the incidence of 17 cases per 100,000 individuals per year in the United States. Although advancements in cancer therapy have dramatically improved childhood cancer survival, gynecologists should be aware of the increased risk of adverse reproductive health effects from each type of therapy. Cancer and its treatment may have immediate or delayed adverse effects on reproductive health. Gynecologists may be consulted for the following issues: pubertal concerns; menstrual irregularities; heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia; sexuality; contraception; ovarian function, including fertility preservation; breast and cervical cancer screening; hormone therapy; and graft-versus-host disease. Approximately 75% of pediatric cancer survivors experience at least one late effect on their health or quality of life. Vigilance in screening and observation on behalf of the health care provider with respect to menstrual irregularities, weight changes, sexual health, growth abnormalities, and bone density are important. In addition to pretreatment fertility conservation counseling, sexually active young women should be thoroughly educated about the risks of becoming pregnant during cancer treatment and strongly encouraged to use effective contraception; contraceptive choices should be discussed with the oncology team. A multidisciplinary approach to cancer survival care is encouraged. This Committee Opinion has been updated to include current data on sexuality and contraception, sexual dysfunction, risk of graft-versus-host disease after stem cell transplant, and updated references and recommendations for fertility preservation.

### Menstrual health as a part of preventive health care [^114Puspw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Menstrual health assessment facilitates identification of pathologic conditions (eg, abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis), offers the opportunity to educate women on what menstrual symptoms may be normal or abnormal, and provides the opportunity to initiate treatment for women who are suffering because of problems with menstrual bleeding or associated symptoms.

However, cancer and its treatment may have immediate or delayed adverse effects on reproductive health. Gynecologists should be prepared to manage gynecologic concerns in young cancer patients and survivors before, during, and after their treatment. Gynecologists may be consulted regarding pubertal concerns; heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia; sexuality; contraception; ovarian function, including fertility preservation; and breast and cervical cancer screening. The science of fertility preservation is a rapidly evolving field; therefore, a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist is recommended to explore the full range of available options.

### Adolescent menstrual health must go beyond pads [^1176TLuB]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Narrow focus offers limited support for adolescent girls

Despite the many components essential for achieving menstrual health, the narrow focus on menstrual pads has persisted, partly because the products are easily measurable and messaging is simple. Data from the menstrual health and hygiene funding tracker indicate that 30 out of 31 investments of at least $1m focused on provision of menstrual products, along with 27 out of 28 government efforts. Yet pad programmes raise numerous issues around sustainable provision over time, supply chain challenges, girls' right to make informed choices about the products they use, and disposal and waste management.

The focus on pads is often reinforced by media and advocacy campaigns and the fact that governments can show "action" when pad programmes are launched. Although these programmes can raise awareness about menstrual health and menstrual stigma, channelling limited resources towards the provision and distribution of pads ignores the potential to achieve greater impact through structural interventions addressing the broader requirements for menstrual health. Such interventions would lead to sustained improvements in quality of life, from menarche to menopause.

### Menstruation myths scale: a scale development study [^116aKYiH]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The present study constitutes the initial psychometric evaluation of the MMS. This study, conducted with 330 women, examined demographic characteristics, menstrual beliefs, and practices of Turkish individuals. The average age of participants was 27.6 years, with a majority holding a bachelor's degree (58%) and nearly half (47%) being employed. Most participants (95%) were currently menstruating, and 77% had received education about menstruation. Sanitary pads were the most commonly used menstrual product (85%). The study also explored menstrual myths, revealing that almost 39% of women strongly agreed that women should sleep separately from their spouses during menstruation, while other prevalent myths included restrictions on bathing (38%), body hair removal (32%), and entering religious spaces (31%). Menstruation is a natural biological process; however, cultural beliefs and taboos surrounding it continue to shape women's experiences and behaviors worldwide. Many women avoid discussions of menstruation in the presence of men. This aligns with findings from previous studies indicating that menstruation is often associated with shame, secrecy, and stigma. Such taboos may contribute to limited menstrual health awareness and reinforce societal restrictions on women. In a study by Sakar et al.42.5% of university students agreed that menstruation should be kept secret, reflecting a broader cultural perception of menstruation as something to be concealed. Furthermore, restrictions on religious and household activities during menstruation remain prevalent. The majority of women in a study by Dündar and Aksu adhered to the belief that they should not read the Koran during menstruation, and nearly half refrained from touching pickles, a common superstition in some cultures. Similar findings have been reported in studies conducted in Turkey, Egypt, and South Asia, where menstrual taboos limit women's participation in religious and domestic activities.

### Adolescent menstrual health must go beyond pads [^111jagmp]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Investing in menstrual health would also tackle persistent gender inequities by challenging pervasive, harmful social norms that limit girls' mobility, educational opportunities, future workforce participation, and bodily agency. The benefits of interventions in health, education, and beyond could lead to long term benefits across a wide range of social outcomes in girls' lives.

Past investments in HIV/AIDS and family planning have shown the value of focusing on broader health outcomes and structural and environmental approaches rather than just product distribution. A comprehensive approach that includes balanced, targeted support across relevant sectors, and the integration of menstrual health into sexual and reproductive health policies to promote access to information, resources, services, and products will yield far reaching benefits, addressing critical health issues for adolescents and women throughout their lives. Designated government leadership is vital to develop domestic financing for menstrual health. Moreover, establishing accountability mechanisms to track progress across sectors using good quality data, including the new menstrual health and hygiene indicators as a starting point, will substantially advance the menstrual health agenda. More consistent and long term political and financial investment will also foster more robust research initiatives to better understand menstruation related health issues and determine comprehensive and cost effective interventions beyond the distribution of menstrual pads.

Key messages
Investment in menstrual health in low resource contexts can address gender inequality and social challenges for school aged girls
Inadequate data on the state of menstrual health across these countries hinder meaningful action
Instead response focuses on mass provision of menstrual pads as a tangible, easily measurable solution
Improved evidence, derived from well resourced research and evaluation of interventions, would support budget allocation and expand the design of more comprehensive interventions

### Infertility in women… [^113n3MLd]. opa.hhs.gov (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to understand what happens to the body during puberty and a woman's menstrual cycle, how a woman's reproductive system works, and how overall health and wellness are connected to fertility and the reproductive system. Understanding the body and the biology of reproduction can inform decisions about preventing pregnancy and deciding whether and when to become pregnant. The next sections describe the basics of puberty, the menstrual cycle, what it means to have fertility awareness and use fertility awareness-based methods of family planning, and infertility in women and men. Puberty Puberty is the time in life when a child reaches sexual maturity. This means that the hormone levels in the body — estrogen and progesterone in girls and testosterone in boys — increase and cause physical and emotional changes to occur. Puberty usually happens between ages 8 and 13 for girls and ages 10 and 15 for boys, and the process affects boys and girls differently.

When girls reach puberty, they typically start their menstrual cycle. Menstrual Cycle The menstrual cycle refers to the monthly process that happens in a woman's body to prepare for a possible pregnancy. It includes the release of an egg from the ovaries, changes in the cervix and thickening of the uterine wall, several hormonal changes, and shedding of the thickened uterine wall through bleeding. Hormonal fluctuations drive the changes that occur during the menstrual cycle. If pregnancy does not occur, the body sheds the extra lining of the uterus. The blood and tissue leave the uterus through the cervix and exit the body through the vagina. The length of the menstrual cycle is the number of days starting from the first day when bleeding begins until the first day of the next month when bleeding begins again.

### Puberty: early and delayed… [^112RhRFK]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

What is puberty. Puberty is when a child starts to mature into an adult. Hormones cause the body to change during puberty. Normal puberty starts in the brain. The brain tells the ovaries and testicles to make estrogen and testosterone. The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys. They make testosterone-like hormones. When does puberty normally start. For girls, breasts normally start to grow between eight and 13 years of age. Body odor, a growth spurt, pubic and underarm hair are other signs of puberty in girls. A girl's first menstrual period usually happens about 2. 5 years after the breasts start to grow. On average, girls have their first period at 12 or 13 years of age. For boys, the testicles start to grow between nine and 14 years of age. Body odor, a growth spurt, pubic and underarm hair, voice changes, and facial hair follow. When should puberty cause concerns.

Girls should see the doctor if they have: Signs of puberty before eight years of age No signs of puberty by 13 years of age No menstrual period by 15 years of age Puberty that starts but then stops Boys should see the doctor if they have: Signs of puberty before nine years of age No signs of puberty by 14 years of age Puberty that starts but then stops. What causes early puberty. Early puberty is usually just normal puberty that starts too early. This is more common in girls. In boys, early puberty is more likely to be caused by a health problem. If a child gets body odor, pubic hair, or underarm hair, without growth of the breasts or testicles, it is usually because the adrenal glands release hormones too early. This is called premature adrenarche. It is common, especially in girls. These hormones do not cause early menstruation in girls. What causes delayed puberty.

Most children with delayed puberty, especially boys, are "late bloomers" and otherwise healthy. This is called constitutional delay of growth and puberty. Usually, at least one parent was also a late bloomer. Some health problems and being underweight can cause delayed puberty. Less commonly, a problem with hormones causes it.

### Menstrual disorders… [^1135d9aZ]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the major milestones during pubertal development in females is menarche. Although most adolescent women pass through this transition with relative ease, menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and dysmenorrhea are common complaints that present to the primary care physician. The median age of menarche in this country, according to the National Health Examination Survey, is 12. 77 years, with African-American females reaching menarche a few months before Caucasian females. Although almost 90% of females have achieved menarche by the time they reach Tanner stage 4 breast and pubic hair development, there is a mean of slightly more than 2 years between the onset of breast development and menarche. The normal menstrual cycle lasts between 21 and 35 days, with fewer than 0. 5% of women having cycles shorter than 21 days and fewer than 1% having cycles lasting more than 35 days.

Trends and Patterns in Menarche in the United States: 1995 through 2013–2017Posted on by Questions for Gladys Martinez, Health Statistician and Lead Author of "Trends and Patterns in Menarche in the United States: 1995 through 2013–2017". Q: Can you explain what menarche is.: Menarche refers to the first menstrual period. GM Q: Why did you decide to do a report on this topic.: We decided to do a report on this topic because menarche is a biological milestone of the start of the period in which women can potentially get pregnant and because early menarche is associated with greater risk of health problems such as breast cancer, liver disease, etc. GM. Q: How did you obtain this data for this report.: Data for this report came from a national sample of U. S. women aged 15–44 who were interviewed in person in 2013–2017. GM Q: Is this the first report on age of first menstrual period. Is there any trend data that goes back further than 1995.: GM This is the first report on age at menarche. We do not have published data before 1995, however there is data available on the mean age of menarche in previous National Survey of Family Growth reports. This is the first full report on age at menarche and the first to use this methodology to look at the probability of age at menarche by each age. Q: What is the take home message for this report.: Age at menarche has decreased in the U. S. since 1995. A higher proportion of young girls are experiencing menarche now than in earlier time periods. Girls from higher socioeconomic status and those that lived with both parents by age 14 were less likely to experience menarche at an early age. On average, the older the age at menarche, the older her age at first sexual intercourse. GM Posted on by Categories National Survey of Family Growth.
