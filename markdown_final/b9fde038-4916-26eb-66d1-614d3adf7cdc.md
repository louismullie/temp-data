## Question

Example 6. Try to find the equations of all ellipses with foci at (± 3,0), and write down the conditions under which the equation can represent a hyperbola with the same foci as the ellipse.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the equations of all ellipses with foci at (± 3, 0) and the conditions under which an equation with the same foci could represent a hyperbola instead of an ellipse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric definition of an ellipse in terms of the sum of distances to the foci. Then, I should translate that into a Cartesian equation and identify the key parameters. Next, I will consider the family of ellipses parameterized by the semi-major axis and write the general equation. After that, I need to check the analogous definition for a hyperbola and derive its Cartesian form with the same foci. Finally, I will compare the two families and state the precise conditions that distinguish hyperbola from ellipse when the foci are fixed at (± 3, 0).

> Let me first confirm the ellipse definition and the given foci. An ellipse is the locus of points for which the sum of distances to two fixed foci is constant, and here the foci are at (−3, 0) and (3, 0), so the focal distance c is 3 and the center is at the origin, which simplifies the algebra considerably.

> I will now translate the definition into an equation. For any point (x, y), the sum of distances to the foci equals 2a, where a is the semi-major axis, so √[(x + 3)² + y²] + √[(x − 3)² + y²] = 2a. Squaring both sides and simplifying leads to the standard form x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, with the relationship c² = a² − b², which means b² = a² − 9 for this setup, and I should double-check that b² remains positive, which requires a > 3 for a real ellipse.

> Wait, let me verify the parameter constraints. Since b² = a² − 9 must be positive, the semi-major axis a must be strictly greater than 3, and as a grows, the ellipse becomes larger and more circular, approaching a circle in the limit as a → ∞, though in practice we just say a > 3 defines the family of ellipses with these foci.

> Next, I should review the hyperbola case with the same foci. A hyperbola is the locus of points for which the absolute difference of distances to the two foci is constant, so |√[(x + 3)² + y²] − √[(x − 3)² + y²]| = 2a, where now a is the distance from center to vertex and must be less than c = 3. Squaring and simplifying yields x²/a² − y²/b² = 1, with c² = a² + b², so b² = 9 − a², and I need to ensure b² is positive, which restricts a to be less than 3.

> Hold on, I should verify the distinction clearly. For the same focal distance c = 3, ellipses require a > 3 and b² = a² − 9, whereas hyperbolas require a < 3 and b² = 9 − a²; the critical boundary a = 3 corresponds to the degenerate case of two coincident lines along the x-axis, which is neither an ellipse nor a hyperbola, so I should explicitly exclude a = 3 from both families.

> Let me synthesize the final answer. All ellipses with foci at (± 3, 0) are given by x²/a² + y²/(a² − 9) = 1 for a > 3, and an equation with the same foci represents a hyperbola when it takes the form x²/a² − y²/(9 − a²) = 1 for 0 < a < 3; the key condition distinguishing the hyperbola case is that the y² term is subtracted and the denominator under y² is positive, which requires a < 3, while the ellipse case has a positive y² term and requires a > 3.

---

The equations of all ellipses with foci at (± 3, 0) are given by ([x²/a²] + [y²/b²] = 1), where (a > 3) and (b² = a² − 9). For a hyperbola with the same foci, the equation is ([x²/a²] − [y²/b²] = 1), where (0 < a < 3) and (b² = 9 − a²). The key condition is the sign of the y² term: positive for ellipses, negative for hyperbolas, which reflects the difference in the distance-sum versus distance-difference definitions of these conics.

## Equations of ellipses with foci at (± 3, 0)

### General form of an ellipse

The standard form of an ellipse centered at the origin with foci on the x-axis is:

[x²/a²] + [y²/b²] = 1

where:

- (a) is the semi-major axis length (half the distance between the vertices),
- (b) is the semi-minor axis length,
- The foci are located at (± c, 0), where c² = a² − b².

---

### Specific conditions for foci at (± 3, 0)

Given that the foci are at (± 3, 0), we have c = 3. Therefore:

c² = a² − b² ⇒ 9 = a² − b² ⇒ b² = a² − 9

Since b² must be positive, (a² > 9), which implies (a > 3).

---

### Family of ellipses

Substituting (b² = a² − 9) into the standard form, the equations of all ellipses with foci at (± 3, 0) are:

[x²/a²] + [y²/(a² − 9)] = 1 where a > 3

---

### Examples

- **For (a = 4)**: ([x²/16] + [y²/7] = 1)
- **For (a = 5)**: ([x²/25] + [y²/16] = 1)
- **For (a = 6)**: ([x²/36] + [y²/27] = 1)

---

## Conditions for a hyperbola with the same foci

### General form of a hyperbola

The standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin with foci on the x-axis is:

[x²/a²] − [y²/b²] = 1

where:

- (a) is the distance from the center to each vertex,
- (b) is related to the conjugate axis,
- The foci are at (± c, 0), where c² = a² + b².

---

### Specific conditions for foci at ((± 3, 0))

Given (c = 3), we have:

c² = a² + b² ⇒ 9 = a² + b² ⇒ b² = 9 − a²

Since b² must be positive, (a² < 9), which implies (0 < a < 3).

---

### Family of hyperbolas

Thus, the equations of all hyperbolas with foci at ((± 3, 0)) are:

[x²/a²] − [y²/(9 − a²)] = 1 where 0 < a < 3

---

### Examples

- **For (a = 1)**: ([x²/1] − [y²/8] = 1)
- **For (a = 2)**: ([x²/4] − [y²/5] = 1)
- **For (a = 2.5)**: ([x²/6.25] − [y²/2.75] = 1)

---

## Summary of conditions

| **Conic section** | **Equation** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|-|
| Ellipse | ([x²/a²] + [y²/(a² − 9)] = 1) | (a > 3) |
| Hyperbola | ([x²/a²] − [y²/(9 − a²)] = 1) | (0 < a < 3) |

---

## Geometric interpretation

Ellipses and hyperbolas are both defined by their foci, but they differ in how distances to the foci relate. For ellipses, the sum of distances to the foci is constant, while for hyperbolas, the absolute difference of distances to the foci is constant. This fundamental difference explains why ellipses are closed curves and hyperbolas are open curves, even when they share the same foci.

---

## Conclusion

- **Ellipses**: ([x²/a²] + [y²/(a² − 9)] = 1) with (a > 3).
- **Hyperbolas**: ([x²/a²] − [y²/(9 − a²)] = 1) with (0 < a < 3).

The key distinction is the sign of the (y²) term and the range of (a), which reflect the different geometric definitions of ellipses and hyperbolas.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

Aperture referral including blur patches and the effective corneal patch

A pencil of light, from an object, is restricted by an aperture within the system, such as the pupil. The restricted pencil of rays will form a blur patch at the retina and, similarly, of all the rays incident on the cornea, those that reach the retina are also restricted by the aperture, but referred upstream to the cornea (figure 3). This effective corneal patch has implications for corneal surgery, such as refractive surgery, corneal inlays and optic zones for contact lenses. In addition, pinhole apertures are available for surgical insertion as a corneal inlay, or a pinhole IOL at the iridial plane. In the presence of two apertures, that is, pinhole and pupil, one takes the role of the restricting aperture.

The retinal blur patch, effective corneal patch, projective field and field of view are all related through a common aperture, usually the pupil. An aperture at some longitudinal position within the optical system may have the effect of restricting the pencil of rays. Elliptical apertures are considered in this study, a circle being a special case of an ellipse. This restricted pencil can be traced upstream or downstream and its shape, size, orientation and transverse position at a referred plane will be determined by both the geometry of the aperture and the refractive elements upstream or downstream of the aperture. The position, both longitudinally and transversely, of an object referred downstream or an image referred upstream will also have an influence on the geometry of the referred aperture.

The general equation for aperture referral is, whereis the generalised radius of the elliptical aperture andis the generalised radius of the referred aperture. R defines the geometry of an ellipse described by its major a and minor b semidiameters. A circular aperture is a special case of the elliptical aperture where. M is a generalised linear magnification matrix that may be asymmetric and that depends on the system, longitudinal position of the aperture, object or image position and direction of referral, that is, upstream or downstream.is defined for all finite ellipses, including degenerate ellipses, that is, point and line segments (or foci). The referred aperture may be rotated and/or reflected and magnified by different amounts along the diameters.

### Magnetization transfer and frequency distribution effects in the SSFP ellipse [^113c4CkU]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the definition of M E, we have included the decay of transverse magnetization at TE via theterm, but off‐resonance in the same time period is incorporated into Equation 7 so that M E remains a real quantity. Equation 7 also contains the B 1 + RF phase term ϕ RF, which was neglected earlier for simplicity. 7

This equation has the same form as the elliptical expression of Xiang and Hoff, where M E is the geometric solution, which is close to the geometric center of the ellipse. 6 a, combined with M E, determines the ellipse size, and is purely affected by T 2 and no MT parameters. b describes how flattened the ellipse is. In contrast to PLANET where M 0, T 1, and T 2 can be algebraically calculated from M E, a, and b, it is not possible to extract M 0 f, T 1 f, f b, and k bf from a single ellipse, principally because only two of the ellipse parameters (M E and b) depend on MT. However, by acquiring multiple ellipses with different MT weightings, it is possible to recover the MT parameters.

Then, r x and r y can be introduced into the definition of an ellipse in cartesian coordinates,

This results in the following expression, which was simplified with the definition of f from equations (2):

This quadratic equation gives two analytic solutions of the front and rear crossings of d with the ellipse as a function of the parameters b, c from equation (7), f from equation (2) and Δ:

The solution with the positive sign in front of the root is the 'front' solution (d 1) and the one with the negative sign the 'rear' solution (d 2). The speed V Δ (t) of the ellipse at the position defined by the angle Δ is derived from the self-similar expansion of the ellipse, which implies a constant half width λ. The assumption of self-similar expansion means that the shape of the ejection must not change in time, so the ratio between speeds and distances for all points along the ellipse must be constant:

Further, the time when d 1 (t) is equal to the heliocentric distance of the planet or the in situ observer gives the arrival time of the ellipse at the in situ location, and the speed V Δ (t) at this time the arrival speed.

Visualizing a self-similar propagating ellipse

Figure 5a shows the geometry of an ellipse under the assumptions described above. The R (t) of the ellipse apex (the point of the ellipse farthest from the Sun along the ellipse central direction) is given by DBM. In this section, we derive equations for the ellipse semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b as a function of R (t), the inverse aspect ratio f and the half width λ. We use f = b/a rather than a r = a/b because it simplifies the following calculation. The equations

follow from the definition of f and the definition of angle β, which is the angle between the semi-major axis a and the normal to the tangent at point T (Fig. 5a). The location of T is the point of tangency on the ellipse for a line originating at the Sun. It can be easily seen that β = λ by checking the sum of the angles of the small orange triangle in Fig. 5a in relation to a larger triangle (not highlighted) containing the angles λ and η. The polar angle of the ellipse θ is given by a relationship from general ellipse geometry between β and θ. It is important to emphasize that we further construct the ellipse based on this particular value of θ, for which a line with distance r connects the ellipse center C to point T. Combining equation (2) gives a relationship for the polar angle θ based on known parameters,

From the law of sines on the large orange-shaded triangle in Fig. 5a we derive:

Angle α follows from the angles of the orange-shaded triangle, and distance r from the definition of an ellipse in polar coordinates:

The last equation can be rewritten with the definition of f as

Introducing α from equation (5) and the last equation for r into equation (4) then eliminates the unknowns (α, r) and expresses b in function of known variables:

Equations (7) are the final description of the ellipse parameters. The minor axis b of the ellipse depends on all known variables (R (t), f, λ) through θ and ω, from equations (3) and (6). The major axis a then simply follows from the definition of f in equations (2). The heliocentric distance of the centre of the ellipse is parameter c (Fig. 5b), closing the model equations necessary for visualizing the ellipse.

### Magnetization transfer and frequency distribution effects in the SSFP ellipse [^117CT8Wu]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Model fitting

The following assumes multiple ellipses labeled i = 1… m acquired with phase increments j = 1… n. Each ellipse has a different α i or T RFi to change the MT weighting. Fitting proceeds in two steps. We first calculate the ellipse parameters for each ellipse separately, resulting in m values each of M Ei, a i and b i. In the second step, the MT parameters are found from the ellipse parameters.

PLANET calculates M E, a, and b algebraically for a single ellipse, but is difficult to use in the region near the Ernst angle because of a sign change in the formula for b. 7 At 3T and above, due to B 1 + inhomogeneity, it cannot be guaranteed that α will be above the Ernst angle in all voxels. Also, although numerous algebraic ellipse methods exist, they have been developed for the general case where no a priori information is available, 14, 15 but here the ellipse must be vertical (b < 2 a /(1 + a 2)) and must not contain the origin. 6 Hence in preference, we used a bounded nonlinear least‐squares fit of Equation 7 to find M E, a, and b for each ellipse, implemented in our freely available toolbox. 16 The cost function waswhere s j is the acquired complex‐valued SSFP data for ϕ j and m j is the corresponding value calculated from Equation 7. The bounds were 0 < a < exp (− TR /5000), 0 < b < 1, −2 π < ψ < 2 π, and −2 π < ϕ RF < 2 π, and we forced the ellipse to remain vertical. The initial guess for M E was |∑ s j / n |, while a and b were calculated assuming T 1 f / T 2 f = 1000/50 ms for the specified TR and α. The initial guesses for the tightly coupled ψ and ϕ RF were more complex. Three guesses for ψ (− π, 0, + π) were tried, and for each ϕ RF was set to the phase of the complex mean of the data minus the guess for ψ. The guess with the lowest root‐mean‐square residual to the data was used as the initial guess for the full nonlinear least squares algorithm. A Huber Loss function was applied to the residuals to suppress the influence of outliers. 17

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^116VTxRM]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Simulations with Simplified Lesion Geometries and Growth Fields

Figure 2 illustrates a hierarchy of simplified, simulated lesion geometries and growths whose rows are arranged according to focality and whose columns are arranged according to a subjective complexity of lesion geometry and growth pattern. All lesions of Figure 2 were constructed to correspond to Δ t = 1 year follow-up intervals to have equal baseline areas of A (t b) = 6 mm 2 and to have equal length-type growth rates of Λ = 0.1 mm/year, the latter of which approximately corresponds to the reported mean of the 1-year perimeter adjusted growth rates of the AREDS dataset. Mathematical specifications of the lesion geometries and growth fields are given in Appendix 5. Using the terminology of Table 1, configurations 1 through 3 represent a progression of geometric complexity, moving from a circle (configuration 1) to an ellipse (configuration 2) to a notched shape (configuration 3). Relevant to growth rate estimation, configurations 1 and 2 both are convex shapes, and therefore isotropic growth never results in intrafocus merging (Appendix 3); however, configuration 2 is noncircular (i.e. has a circularity index of < 1), and therefore results in errors when assessed using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 2). Configuration 3 has a nonconvex geometry, and therefore, lesion growth can lead to intrafocus merging, which has the effect of censoring GA growth, making growth estimation ill-posed for any metric (Appendix 3). Compared with configurations 1 through 3, configuration 4 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, which causes the baseline circular lesion to grow into a more complex, nonconvex geometry. In the second row, although the baseline lesion shapes are all circular, bifocality results in estimation errors when using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 3). Configurations 5 and 6 correspond to different distributions of lesion area between the foci. Configuration 7 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, constructed so that the lesion growth rate of each lesion focus is constant, but with the rate of the top left lesion being half that of the bottom right lesion. Finally, unlike configurations 5 through 7, configuration 8 involves merging of the 2 lesion foci (i.e. interfoci merging). Evaluations of metric accuracy were performed by scaling the growth fields (but not the baseline lesion geometries) so as to vary Λ through a range of 0.05 to 0.7 mm/year (Appendix 5).

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^113BZBkJ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered polarization singularity sheet

The process for engineering 2D phase-singularity sheets is also directly applicable to engineering 2D polarization singularity sheets. A detailed review of the connection between phase and polarization singularities is provided by Ruchi et al. Polarization singularities can take multiple forms, but here we focus on C -point singularities in which the polarization azimuth Ψ (in a paraxial field, with negligible E z contribution) is singular. Ψ is the angle that the major axis of the polarization ellipse makes with the transverse x -direction (Supplementary Fig. 10). Together with the ellipticity angle θ, which determines the eccentricity and handedness of the ellipse, the pair (Ψ, θ) parameterizes the space of fully polarized light. To deploy phase gradient maximization, we need to identify a complex scalar field σ such that arg(σ) ∝ Ψ. This complex field will exhibit the same geometries in Fig. 1. Maximizing the phase gradient of σ then maximizes the azimuth gradient and produces polarization singularities. One such field is σ = | E x | 2 − | E y | 2 + 2 i ·Re(E x E y *) for which arg(σ) = 2Ψ. This can be written as σ = s 1 + is 2 using the Stokes polarization parameters, which comprise four experimentally measurable intensities that parametrize the full space of polarized (and partially polarized) light. They are defined in Eqs. (4)–(7) using the left-handed convention.where I j refers to the intensity of the polarization component projected in the j direction. For fully polarized light, s 0 2 = s 1 2 + s 2 2 + s 3 2, which allows all polarization states to be assigned a unique point on a sphere in (s 1, s 2, s 3) space — the Poincaré sphere (Supplementary Fig. 10). Lines of constant Ψ are longitudes on the sphere. Just as globe longitudes intersect at the poles so that the longitudinal coordinate is undefined there, Ψ is singular at the Poincaré sphere poles at which circularly polarized light resides. There, s 1 and s 2 go to zero, in analogy to the vanishing of the real and imaginary parts of a scalar complex field at a phase singularity. It is noteworthy, however, that the overall field intensity at the polarization singularity can be non-zero, because s 3 may not vanish.

### Neural variability and sampling-based probabilistic representations in the visual cortex [^1166EtWj]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Changes in image contrast lead to corresponding changes in the inferred level of contrast,(Figure 2 A). A low-contrast image provides less evidence about the exact content of the image, so inferences rely predominantly on prior expectations. In the extreme case of a blank stimulus, approaches zero (Figure 2 A, light gray), so inferences about the basis function activations that neurons represent are unconstrained by the image (Equation 1 is constant with respect to the activations), and thus the posterior becomes entirely determined by the prior. In other words, spontaneous activity, as a special case of evoked activity recorded in response to a blank stimulus, represents samples from the prior (Figure 2 B).

For higher contrast levels, the inferred level ofalso grows (Figure 2 A, dark gray and black), so that the input image increasingly constrains the posterior of basis-function activations, which thus increasingly deviates from the prior (Figures 2 C and 2D). This deviation has two major aspects. First, the mean of the posterior becomes different from the prior mean, and will be specific to the particular image that gave rise to it. This implies that signal variability, the variability of the mean response across different stimuli, grows with contrast (Figures 2 B–2D, insets on top). Second, the observation of a high-contrast image reduces uncertainty (on average) about basis function activations relative to the prior. Thus, the (co)variance of individual posteriors will be smaller than that of the prior, implying that noise (co)variances, the across-trial variability of neural responses to the same stimulus, must decrease with increasing contrast (e.g. red covariance ellipses across Figures 2 B–2D; see also Figures 3, 4 A, 4B, and 5 C). As opposed to the mean of the posterior (cf. Figure S2), its covariance does not show a strong dependence on the detailed content of the stimulus beyond its overall contrast (red versus green versus blue covariance ellipses within Figures 2 B–2D; see also Figures 4 C–4E). This is intuitive; for example, changing the orientation of a grating, as opposed to its contrast, does not influence our uncertainty about it.

### Investigation of the influence of bdrift on the performance of the PLANET method and an algorithm for drift correction [^111FoDx8]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The frequency drift is modeled as, where Δ f drift (t) is the time‐dependent frequency drift during PLANET acquisition and is equal to γ Δ B 0 (t), where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio equal to 42.58 MHz/T. Then Equation 2 becomes

The first part of Equation 3 multiplied by the first exponential represents the elliptical equation in Equation 2, but with a modified time‐dependent RF phase‐increment scheme: This corresponds to a drift‐dependent displacement of all data points along the ellipse as illustrated in Figure 1 B. Note that if only this effect of drift is taken into account, the data points remain on the "nondrifted" ellipse (i.e. the ellipse fitted to the data points not influenced by drift).

There is, however, another effect of the drift, caused by the last exponential factor in Equation 3. Using this factor, drift leads to an additional rotation of the data points around the origin, as illustrated in Figure 1 C, D. As drift is time‐dependent, the rotation angle differs per data point.

These two effects together relocate the data points in the complex plane away from the nondrifted ellipse and result in a nonelliptical distribution of the points. Ignoring the effects of B 0 drift, fitting an ellipse to the drifted data points (i.e. data points relocated by drift from their nondrifted positions) would lead to different fit results compared with the fit for the nondrifted case (Figure 1 E). After performing PLANET postprocessing, 12 this would result in errors in the parameter estimates.

We propose a drift correction method that aims to relocate each data point back to the position in the complex plane that it would have in the case without drift.

Step 3. Analytical solution for parameters.

Parametersof the parametric form of the ellipse in Equation [4] are related to the geometric characteristicsfrom the Cartesian form of ellipse in Equation [8] through a system of nonlinear equations (23):

We have solved this system for parametersanalytically. The results are presented in the Appendix. The T 1 and T 2 estimates can be found from parameters a and b using the following equations:

Additional Step 4. Estimation of the local off‐resonance.

The rotation angle in Equation [7] includes the local off‐resonanceand RF phase offset, which cannot be separated from Equation [5]. For simplicity, the chemical shift is ignored and the additional phase errors due to eddy current effects and B 0 drift are assumed to be negligible:

The off‐resonance, however, can be estimated from the locations of the data points with different RF phase increment settingson the vertical ellipse: the precession angleduring each TR depends only on the RF phase incrementand the local off‐resonance, and not on the RF phase offset:

Table 1
NRMSD of TF s on an elliptic cross section between different M and M = 1,024

An attenuation map was needed to determine the attenuation coefficient μ in different locations of the image volume. In order to simplify the process, we considered the μ to be homogeneous and equal to 0.151 cm –1 (= μ of 140 keV photon travelling in water) inside the regions of the objects scanned. In this scheme, only the contour information of the objects was required.

An application program was developed for defining top view and side view 2-D contours of animals on the optical photos that standardly are taken before U-SPECT acquisition, e.g. for the purpose of VOI selection and activity localization. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the three optical photos are displayed on the graphical user interface of the software, with a closed Bézier spline curve lying on top of each. The curves are initialized with standard shapes and can be deformed to fit animal outlines by dragging several anchor points. After proper 2-D contours were made, the software measured the width p and height q of the animal on the top view and side view contours, respectively, in each position of those transverse slices (Fig. 2 b). Then it created an ellipse of which the horizontal and vertical axes were equal to p and q, respectively, determined by the following equation:All those ordered ellipses were stacked together to form a 3-D contour of the object (Fig. 2 c).

### Modularity and stability in ecological communities [^116Hgcck]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

New case: α = 1/2 (equally sized subsystems)

When the two subsystems have the same size (α = 1/2), we find (Supplementary Information) that the eigenvalues of B are approximately uniformly distributed in the ellipse in the complex plane with centre in (− μ w, 0), horizontal semi-axis

and vertical semi-axis

Note that this would also be the limiting distribution for the eigenvalues of the unstructured matrixwith − μ w on the diagonal, and off-diagonal elements sampled independently in pairs from the bivariate normal distribution with means (0, 0) T, a correlation that is a weighted average of the correlations in B.

and a variance that is the arithmetic mean of the variances in B,

In this case, it is convenient to express these values in terms of μ, σ 2, ρ, C and Q, because this makes the role of modularity in modulating the stability much clearer:

From the two equations above, it is clear that (a) for μ = 0, modularity has no effect on the spectrum, while for μ ≠0 the sign of μ does not affect the spectrum; (b) modular and bipartite structures have the same effect: the eigenvalues of B will be approximately the same, when we have Q = q or Q = − q; (c) the effect of modularity is going to be more marked for large C or | μ |; and (d) the radius of B is always lower or equal than that we would find by setting Q = 0.

Summarizing, for α = 1/2, the eigenvalues of B are contained in an ellipse whose horizontal semi-axis is always smaller or equal than that found for the corresponding unstructured matrix. This explains the stabilizing effect of a modular structure (Q < 0) we observed for μ < 0, as in that case the rightmost eigenvalue of M is the rightmost eigenvalue of B.

### An optical neural chip for implementing complex-valued neural network [^113a2ua6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In the binary classification, the decision boundary partitions the underlying vector space into two regions, one for each class. The decision boundaries of the simulated real-valued model, the complex-valued model and the on-chip implemented complex model when classifying the Circle and the Spiral are shown in Fig. 5b, c, respectively. As shown, the decision boundaries of the real model are formed by straight lines, while the decision boundaries of the complex model are nonlinear curves that perfectly match the entangled shape of the datasets. The complex model is also appreciably superior in classification accuracy. The complex model achieves simulated accuracy of 100% on both datasets, far exceeding the 55% (on Circle) and 89% (on Spiral) achieved by the real model. In chip implementation, we scan both inputs x 1 and x 2 from −1 to 1 by a step size of 0.1. A total 441 input sets are tested. In experiment results, the black wires are our expected decision boundaries while the white wires are experimental ones, from which we can easily figure out which points are incorrectly classified. The chip testing accuracies are 98% for the Circle and 95% for the Spiral. The theoretical decision boundaries of the complex model are smooth, while the visualized resolution is reduced by the input interval in experiment.

The theoretical decision boundaries can be derived. Suppose we have a single layer with two neurons, the outputs of the real model arewhere the w 11,12,21,22 and b 1,2 are real-valued, x 1,2 are real inputs and y 1,2 are the outputs. The decision boundary is derived by solving the equation || y 1 || = || y 2 ||. Therefore, the decision surface is formed by two straight lines:

In the complex model, we replace the weight matrices by w jk = p jk + iq jk, and b j = m j + in j, where j, k = 1, 2. By solving || y 1 || = || y 2 ||, a nonlinear decision boundary is formed bywhich can be simplified to a binary quadratic equation:

Equation (5) can form various curves, such as parabola, circle, ellipse, and hyperbola, with different parameters A–F, which can be learned from training data. For nonlinear dataset, the complex-valued network shows strong learning capability, by forming nonlinear decision boundaries and achieving high classification accuracy.

### Super-resolution imaging of fluorescent dipoles via polarized structured illumination microscopy [^116sV8zu]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Structured illumination in spatio-angular hyperspace

To provide a universal framework to model polarization in microscopy including SIM, we interpret the specimen in spatio-angular hyperspace, or x – y – α coordinates, by stretching the dipoles over an additional dimension of orientation. In spatio-angular hyperspace, the dipoles are uniformly excited by circularly polarized light in the angular dimension. In contrast, the dipoles are structurally illuminated by linearly polarized light: the dipoles parallel to the polarization have the highest absorption efficiency, while the dipoles perpendicular to the polarization are not excited at all. Figure 1b illustrates the dipoles in the x – α section of spatio-angular hyperspace. Under linearly polarized excitation (horizontal, 0°), the parallel dipoles (0°) absorb photons most efficiently, while the perpendicular dipoles (90°) absorb no photons.

Furthermore, we explore the mathematical relationship between polarized excitation and structured illumination. The quantitative relationship between the absorption efficiency and dipole orientation is a cosine-squared or sinusoidal function, analogous to spatially structured illumination (Eq. (1)). The Fourier transform of the sinusoidal function contains three harmonics (zeroth, +first, and −first), which can be solved separately by changing the excitation polarization (or changing the phase of the angular structured illumination). From the perspective of Fourier space, we can conclude that PM enables measurement of the dipole orientation by observing additional angular harmonics of the dipole orientation information. Three or more polarized excitations are required to solve the three harmonics, which is consistent with the perspective of fitting the dipole orientation based on its polarization response.

Here, we useto indicate the angular illumination frequency vectorwith the same format as the structured spatial illumination. I θ,φ (r) denotes the structured illumination on spatial dimensions with the stripe direction θ and the phase φ, F θ (α) denotes the absorption efficiency of the fluorescent dipole with orientation α under excitation polarization of θ, D denotes the detected SIM image, and S p (r, α) denotes the specimen in spatio-angular hyperspace. The k θ vector describes the periodicity of the stripes, and its direction is normal to the stripes.

### The effect of realistic geometries on the susceptibility-weighted MR signal in white matter [^1129qsKS]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

Microstructure Model

We modeled several geometries, including idealized cylinders with circular cross‐sections, elliptic cylinders with elliptical cross‐sections, and hyperrealistic geometries based on EM.

For a proof‐of‐principle examination of the role of shape, we performed field perturbations corresponding to a single axon with elliptical cross section and increasing eccentricities, 0, 0.66, 0.80, and 0.87, corresponding to minor‐to‐major axis ratios of 1, 4/3, 5/3, and 2, respectively. Changes to eccentricity were made without change to myelin or intra‐/extra‐axonal areas to conserve g‐ratio, which was set to 0.7 27. In circular axons, the g‐ratio is the ratio of the inner radius to the outer radius, while for noncircular axonswith intra‐axonal and total axonal areasand A t. The effect of rotation on the ellipse with respect to H is also examined (Fig. 3 e, f). Simulations were performed on a 500 × 500 array, spanning 3 × 3 μm 2, with H defined orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the fiber.

Figure 3
(a – c) Field perturbations of elliptical geometries of increasing eccentricity starting from 0 or a circle. (d – f) The effect of in‐plane rotations about the applied field. (g, h) The simulated signal magnitude and phase corresponding to panels a–f.

Packed axons were generated on a 4454 × 4454 array, spanning 37 × 37 μm 2 by random close packing of circles (n = 1434). Circle/axon sizes followed a Gamma distribution (α = 5.7) about a mean radius of 0.46 μm to match EM data (n = 602 axons). The packing algorithm was developed in‐house and is described in the Supporting Information. Results of the packing are shown in Supporting Figure S1. The packed axons were also warped to create a second geometry of packed ellipses using an algorithm package, twirl1.m 28 (parameters: a = 1.5; b = 0.8; c = 2.0; d = 1/400). This warping transformation conserves the g‐ratio and fiber density (Fig. 4a, b).

### Magnetization transfer and frequency distribution effects in the SSFP ellipse [^116rdZAR]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To demonstrate that quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) parameters can be extracted from steady-state free-precession (SSFP) data with no external T 1 map or banding artifacts.

Methods

SSFP images with multiple MT weightings were acquired and qMT parameters fitted with a two-stage elliptical signal model.

Results

Monte Carlo simulations and data from a 3T scanner indicated that most qMT parameters could be recovered with reasonable accuracy. Systematic deviations from theory were observed in white matter, consistent with previous literature on frequency distribution effects.

Conclusions

qMT parameters can be extracted from SSFP data alone, in a manner robust to banding artifacts, despite several confounds.

### Transceive phase mapping using the PLANET method and its application for conductivity mapping in the brain [^113HNdb6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Estimation of the transceive phase ϕ ± with bSSFP and PLANET

2.2.1 bSSFP

As shown in Figure 1 B, bSSFP signal phase appears almost constant within the pass‐band region and shifts vertically by a quantity corresponding to ϕ ± value. Thus, the transceive phase is generally approximated by the phase of bSSFP signal (whereas all other phase contributions in bSSFP phase image[Equation A1] are normally neglected).

2.2.2 PLANET

PLANET applies a linear least squares fit, specific to ellipses, in the complex plane to steady state phase‐cycled bSSFP data using the signal model defined in Equation 1. 48 This model assumes a Lorentzian single‐component relaxation model. To fit the ellipse coefficients in PLANET, at least N = 6 dynamics with different RF phase increments are required. 48 The PLANET method reconstructs T 1, T 2, a banding‐free image, B 0 ‐related off‐resonances (Δf 0) and ϕ ± from the shape and rotation of the ellipse (Figure 1 C).

When B 0 drift is assumed negligible and when eddy‐current effects are compensated for, the terms ϕ drift and ϕ eddy drop out from the rotation angle Ω in Equation A5, yielding:

Both Ω and Δf 0 in Equation 2 can be independently estimated from the fitting procedure (see steps 2 and 4 in reference 48). Hence, PLANET‐based transceive phase can be obtained by subtracting these two terms.

### Pointwise error estimates in localization microscopy [^115yxkLa]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

So far, we have looked at averages, but the full distribution of errors is also interesting. In particular, most(but not all) recent statistical models of SPT data assume Gaussian errors, although this assumption has not been tested. If the Laplace approximation (equation (6)) was exact, the errors normalized by the estimated RMSE would be Gaussian with unit variance, and produce a straight line in the Gaussian probability plot in Fig. 2f. The MLE results only agree partly with the reference unit normal, consistent with a sub-population of fits with underestimated precision, but the MAP results show good agreement.

We also generalized the approach to an asymmetric Gaussian spot model (see Methods), which performs better than the symmetric one with increased motion blur, as seen in Fig. 3. Both priors also improve localization errors and convergence rates compared to the MLE fits (Supplementary Note 4). However, the asymmetric prior is less robust w.r.t. its parameterization (Supplementary Note 3). The combination of long exposure and high spot intensity also remains difficult in either case, but this can often be avoided experimentally, for example by decreasing the exposure time.

A possible further development is to improve the Gaussian localization model, perhaps using an experimentally derived PSF model. To explore this, we experimented with data using a Gaussian spot model for both PSF simulation and localization (Supplementary Note 5). We see only modest improvements, however, and as experimentally derived PSFs are instrument-specific, we do not pursue this further.

Overall, these results show that pointwise precision estimates using the Laplace approximation works well in a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions, if aided by some basic information about PSF shape and background. In this case, we see good support for the assumption of Gaussian-distributed localization errors.

### Cell morphology and nucleoid dynamics in dividing deinococcus radiodurans [^117XeUoz]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To determine the extent of BADA (green) vs. Nile Red (red) staining in Phase 1 cells, the perimeter of each cell was measured by fitting an ellipse to the Nile Red-labelled cell membrane. The fraction of cell wall labelled with BADA was then determined by measuring the two angles as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2b. The perimeter of Nile Red-only-stained membranes (without any BADA labelling) for an angle α is retrieved from the equation (1). The BADA-labelled perimeter was then determined by computing the lengths of the two sections of cell wall devoid of BADA labelling and subtracting them from the whole perimeter of the ellipse. To determine the volume of nucleoids, Z -stacks of the Syto9 fluorescence signal corresponding to the nucleoids were deconvoluted in Volocity using seven iterative cycles and a calculated point spread function (PSF) (488 nm/520 nm). Cropped images in which the fluorescence signal was homogeneous throughout the full field of view were then exported to the Imaris (Bitplane) software, where 3D objects corresponding to the nucleoids were created based on the automatic thresholding of the fluorescence signal. The volumes of these objects were then extracted for further analysis. The same procedure and settings in Imaris were used to extract nucleoid volumes from all our samples, including E. coli nucleoids.

To evaluate the distribution of oriC and ter foci, Z -stacks of the GFP signal were iteratively deconvoluted using a calculated PSF (488 nm/520 nm) in Volocity. In the case of ter, Z -projections for each channel were concatenated into multi-channel stacks. In the case of oriC, the same multi-channel stacks were assembled, but we also verified that fluorescent foci were not lost by the Z -projection. Fluorescent foci were manually marked in ImageJ to extract their xy coordinates as well as the dimensions and phase of the cells in which they were found. The number of foci and their distribution were then automatically determined with respect to the average cell dimension of D. radiodurans cells at each phase of the cell cycle derived from PAINT imaging.

### Recommendations on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [^113MjVgA]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular mass (LVM) by linear (M‑mode) dimensions — method and key limitations — is described as modeling the left ventricle as a prolate ellipse with a major/minor axis ratio of 2: 1 and converting the myocardial shell volume to mass using the specific gravity of myocardium (1.05 g/ml). There are four principal limitations in the calculation of LVM using linear methods: the "Cube" formula is not accurate when the 2: 1 axis ratio requirement is not met, cubing primary measurements magnifies small errors, these measurements are insensitive to small changes in mass, and they are highly dependent on imaging quality and observer expertise.

### Pointwise error estimates in localization microscopy [^113Fa9JJ]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Laplace approximation

An alternative way to approximate the uncertainty of the fit parameters is to Taylor expand the likelihood around the maximum-likelihood parameters θ * to second order, that is

The first-order term is 0, since θ * is a local maximum. This approximates the likelihood by a Gaussian with covariance matrix given by the inverse Hessian, that is, Σ = [∂ 2 ln L / ∂θ 2] −1. In a Bayesian setting, this expresses the (approximate) posterior uncertainty about the fit parameters. The estimated uncertainties (posterior variances) are given by the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix, for example. We compute the Hessian numerically using Matlab's built-in optimization routines, and use the log of the scale parameters b, N, σ for fitting, since they are likely to have a more Gaussian-like posterior.

Prior distributions

For MAP localizations in the main text, we used weak normal priors with standard deviation ln(30) centred on the true value for the log background intensity. For the spot width, we define σ = σ 0 (1+Δ σ), where σ 0 = 0.21 λ /NA is the width of a focused spot, and put exponential priors with mean value one on Δ σ. For asymmetric Gaussian spots with two principal widths, we define analogous excess widths Δ σ 1,2 and use independent exponential priors with mean value 1/2. Other parameters were left with flat priors (for details, see Supplementary Note 3).

### Computational methods for the estimation of ideal current patterns in realistic human models [^112DD5nU]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To introduce a method for the estimation of the ideal current patterns (ICP) that yield optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for realistic heterogeneous tissue models in MRI.

Theory and Methods

The ICP were calculated for different surfaces that resembled typical radiofrequency (RF) coil formers. We constructed numerical electromagnetic (EM) bases to accurately represent EM fields generated by RF current sources located on the current-bearing surfaces. Using these fields as excitations, we solved the volume integral equation and computed the EM fields in the sample. The fields were appropriately weighted to calculate the optimal SNR and the corresponding ICP. We demonstrated how to qualitatively use ICP to guide the design of a coil array to maximize SNR inside a head model.

Results

In agreement with previous analytic work, ICP formed large distributed loops for voxels in the middle of the sample and alternated between a single loop and a figure-eight shape for a voxel 3-cm deep in the sample's cortex. For the latter voxel, a surface quadrature loop array inspired by the shape of the ICP reached 87.5% of the optimal SNR at 3T, whereas a single loop placed above the voxel reached only 55.7% of the optimal SNR. At 7T, the performance of the two designs decreased to 79.7% and 49.8%, respectively, suggesting that loops could be suboptimal at ultra-high field MRI.

Conclusion

ICP can be calculated for human tissue models, potentially guiding the design of application-specific RF coil arrays.

### Mean-field theory of random close packings of axisymmetric particles [^114hgXn6]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal random packing of non-spherical particles is an open problem with great significance in a broad range of scientific and engineering fields. So far, this search has been performed only empirically on a case-by-case basis, in particular, for shapes like dimers, spherocylinders and ellipsoids of revolution. Here we present a mean-field formalism to estimate the packing density of axisymmetric non-spherical particles. We derive an analytic continuation from the sphere that provides a phase diagram predicting that, for the same coordination number, the density of monodisperse random packings follows the sequence of increasing packing fractions: spheres < oblate ellipsoids < prolate ellipsoids < dimers < spherocylinders. We find the maximal packing densities of 73.1% for spherocylinders and 70.7% for dimers, in good agreement with the largest densities found in simulations. Moreover, we find a packing density of 73.6% for lens-shaped particles, representing the densest random packing of the axisymmetric objects studied so far.

### Exploiting the tunability of stimulated emission depletion microscopy for super-resolution imaging of nuclear structures [^115A8tmR]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Simulations and data analysis

Simulated STED image stacks of nuclear foci were generated using MATLAB. The object consisted in a variable number of point-like emitters distributed randomly inside a circular area with a diameter of 16 μm. Each stack consisted of a number n of 512 × 512 frames with a pixel size of 40 nm. The maximum total number of photons detected from a single pixel position in one frame of the stack was set to S max = 30 unless specified otherwise. For each frame j of the stack, the object was convolved with the theoretical PSF of a STED microscope described by Eq. (3) setting t = j −1 and T = n −1. The maximum value of the STED saturation level I max / I sat was set as specified and the obtained image was corrupted by Poisson noise. The waist of the confocal PSF was always set to w c = 200 nm, unless otherwise stated. The large foci (Supplementary Fig. 5b) were simulated substituting each point-like emitter with a 10 pixels-sized structure. The unresolved foci (Supplementary Fig. 5c) were simulated by increasing the density of foci and using a larger confocal PSF (w c = 400 nm). In order to simulate the effect of STED-induced background, a doughnut-shaped excitation PSF was added to the model. The maximum number of STED-induced background photons detected from a single pixel position in one frame of the stack was set to a percentage B max of the maximum signal S max = 40. In these simulations, the excitation power was either kept constant (data reported on Supplementary Fig. 9) or modulated as an exponentially decaying function with time-constant τ exc = n /2.

The analysis of size was performed on rectangular ROIs extracted from experimental M-STED stacks of transcription foci acquired at different values of P max. For each ROI, a SPLIT image was obtained by setting the positions of the phasors P in and P out in order to achieve the maximum possible separation of foci in the image. The apparent size Σ of the foci in the SPLIT image was quantified by means of an algorithm based on image correlation spectroscopy that maps the size of the structures in an image. For each SPLIT image, the relative size of the effective PSF with respect to confocal, w / w c, was estimated starting from the value of the parameter k, obtained from a fit of the average depletion curve, and the positions of the phasors P in and P out used for processing the image.

### A first-principle mechanism for particulate aggregation and self-assembly in stratified fluids [^116pN8nn]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Next, for general Peclet numbers, we utilize the finite element package COMSOL to calculate steady solutions of these equations of motion. See Supplementary Notes 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 for extended details on this calculation.

Figure 3 depicts the simulations for this method, documenting the toroidal flow structures observed for a range of Peclet numbers. In the top left panel, we document, for the case of a sphere, the maximum flow speed in the equatorial plane as well as the maximum speed overall in the entire domain as a function of the Peclet number. In the equatorial plane, there is an optimal velocity which occurs at a Peclet number slightly bigger than unity. As a benchmark, observe that the slope (here in log-log coordinates) at low Peclet number is(i.e.), which is the exact theoretical scaling in this limit. In the lower left panels, the companion flow structures are observed for four representative Peclet numbers. The background color scheme is assigned by the radial velocity, with negative values corresponding to horizontal velocities directed left. Observe that in all cases, in the equatorial plane, the velocities are directed to attract nearby fluid particles towards the sphere. In the right panels of Fig. 3 we show the analogous plots for spheroids of different aspect ratios. In the top, we show the max speed in the equatorial plane and global max speed as a function of aspect ratio, whereas in the bottom, we document the toroidal flow structures for four representative aspect ratios. In all cases, we observe a monotonic increase in the max equatorial speed as the horizontal disc radius increases.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Simulations

Figure 1 shows the results of the Monte Carlo simulations for the ellipse parameters. Four histograms are present in each subfigure, one for each of the simulated ellipses, and the true values are shown by dotted lines. Parameters M E, a, and b all have very low bias of less than 1% and coefficient of variation (CoV) of less than 2% for all the ellipses. Note that as the parameter a only depends on T 2 and TR, there are only two true values and the histograms for 256 μs and 1024 μs pulse‐lengths overlap.

Figure 1
Results of fitting the ellipse parameters M E, a, b to the Monte Carlo simulations. The parameters for each individual ellipse are shown in the colors given in the legend, and true values are shown with dotted lines

Because the true values of θ 0 and ϕ RF were chosen randomly (to assess the robustness of the method to off‐resonance andeffects), the true value modulus 2 π was subtracted from the fitted value before plotting, and hence the histograms are centered on zero. Again, the fit is excellent with negligible bias and standard deviations of less than 2%. In the case of ϕ RF, a small number (< 1%) of degenerate solutions were found at the + π /− π boundary. As ϕ RF is not a parameter of interest for this study, these fitting failures were considered inconsequential, and hence the range of the histogram is restricted to −2 ∘ to 2 ∘.

Figure 2 shows the results of fitting the MT parameters to the Monte Carlo simulations. The fits for M 0 f, f b, T 1 f and T 2 f showed minimal bias (< 1%) and reasonable CoV (< 4% except for f b which was 8%). k bf shows a skewed distribution, weighted toward higher values, and hence has a CoV of 22% and a bias of 4%.

Figure 2
Results of fitting the qMT parameters to the ellipse parameters. M 0 f, F, T 1 f, andT 2 f show the expected normal distribution, but k bf shows a skewed distribution with a heavy tail toward high values, indicating that this parameter is difficult to fit correctly.

b. Simulation study on calibrating confidence intervals

For our second simulation study we generated 25 overlapping data sets of size 50,000 from design C in Table 3, the degree of overlap consistent with a population of 200,000. For each of various C between 2.0 and 5.0, we used Equation (7) to form confidence intervals for the mixture parameters p 1, p 2, p 3, p 4, μ 1, μ 2, μ 3, μ 4, σ 1, σ 2, σ 3, σ 4. We recorded how many of the mixture parameters were contained in their respective confidence intervals. This was repeated nine more times, and we tabulated how many of the 120 = 12 × 10 confidence intervals contained their targets. Confidence intervals were also formed using Equation (6) for comparative purposes. The above steps were repeated with overlapping data sets consistent with a population of 1,000,000 and with nonoverlapping data sets consistent with an effectively infinite population.

The results are summarized in Table 5. With an effectively infinite population, only 81.7% of the confidence intervals formed using Equation (6) contained their targets at C = 5.0. The confidence intervals formed using Equation (7) contained their targets 95.0% of the time at C = 2.5. The adjustment suggested by Equation (8) appears reasonable: φ = .05 = 50,000/1,000,000 and N rep = 25 yield C φ = 1.315 C 0, which accords with the 95.8% capture of mixture parameters at C = 3.5 ≈ 1.315 × 2.5 with a population of 1,000,000.

### The fast-recycling receptor megalin defines the apical recycling pathway of epithelial cells [^111ra8ub]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Mathematical model of Megalin endosomal itinerary

To represent the endosomal pathway of Megalin in subconfluent MDCK cells (experiment in Fig. 3), the pools of Megalin within PM, SE Rab4, RE TfR and RE Rab11 are denoted X 0, X 1, X 2 and X 3, respectively. For a given experiment, the measure of Megalin (pixel density) within each compartment is denoted x (i, t), i = 0,3, in which t is experimental time. In this model, Megalin transition from a donor to an acceptor compartment is assumed to be proportional to its density within the donor compartment, so that one can write linear differential equations for mass transfer. Corresponding to the cartoon of Fig. 3c are the equations:

The constant coefficients, k 01, k 12, k 23 and k 30 denote transfer rates for sequential movement of Megalin through the compartments, while k 10 and k 20 correspond to short circuits from SE Rab4 and RE TfR back to the PM. The terms on the right, J ij, denote the unidirectional fluxes between compartments. The system is completed with the requirement that over the time course of the experiments, the total Megalin pool of mass, x T, remains constant:

When equation (4) is used to eliminate x (0) from equation (1), the resulting equation is

Equations (2), (3) and (5) are three linear equations with constant coefficients, which describe the model system. For the experiment of Fig. 3, it is assumed that all of the labelled Megalin starts within the PM, that is, for t = 0, x (1) = x (2) = x (3) = 0. Fitting this model to the data of Fig. 3 means solving for best values of the six model coefficients, k ij. For any set of choices of k ij, the model provides predictions for x (1, t), x (2, t) and x (3, t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ T, where the experiment runs for time, T.

3.2.1 Simulation results

Figure 5 A, B shows a schematic example of an ellipse observed in the case of a two‐component model and corresponding frequency distributions used in the simulations. The SNR values, relative errors, and SDs in the T 1, T 2, andestimates are presented in Figure 5 for a two‐component model (Figure 5 C‐E). The errors in the parameters are related to the presence of the second component and are defined as the deviation from the true values of the corresponding parameters of the dominant component. The ellipse of the smaller component interferes with the ellipse of the dominant WM component. The fitting of a single‐component ellipse to the complex sum of the two ellipses results in systematic underestimation of T 1 and T 2 parameters, which depends on the choice of TR and FA, shown in Figure 5. For example, a combination of TR = 10 ms and FA = 20º leads to underestimation of T 1 by approximately 30%, underestimation of T 2 by approximately 35%, and overestimation of ∆f 0 by approximately 10%. However, precision of the parameter estimates stays within the 3% range for this combination of FA and TR.

### Irreversible electroporation: just another form of thermal therapy? [^1137Xdzi]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

with thermal diffusivity α ≈ 0.13 mm 2 /s and 2nd order differential (Laplace) operator ∇ 2 (m −2). Equation (1) has no simple general analytical solution. However, the Gaussian profile defined above may be thought to originate from radial cooling of an "instantaneous line source of heat" (, Equation (1) of page 258) during time period τ = r 0 2 /4α ≈ 1.4 sec, where τ is the time constant for heat conduction. Then, a short IRE pulse at t = 0 has the simple thermal analytical solution to Equation (1) of

Equation (1) is linear in ΔT so ΔT-responses to multiple pulses can be added as follows. We use that the 1st pulse, at t = 0, yields ΔT 1 (r,0) = ΔT 0 F 1 (r,0)σ 1 /σ 0. Just after the 2nd pulse, say 1 sec later, the 1st pulse reduced to ΔT 1 (r,1) = ΔT 0 F 1 (r,1)σ 1 /σ 0. The 2nd pulse gives ΔT 2 (r,1) ≡ΔT 0 F 1 (r,0)σ 2 /σ 0, thus proportional to the response of the 1st pulse at t = 0. Two pulses, at t = 1 sec, thus cause ΔT 2 (r,1) = ΔT 0 [F 1 (r,0)σ 2 /σ 0 + F 1 (r,1)σ 1 /σ 0], that is, including the two responses to the first pulse at the two pulse events. Similarly, three pulses, at t = 2 sec, give ΔT(r,2) = ΔT 0 [F 1 (r,0)σ 3 /σ 0 + F 1 (r,1)σ 2 /σ 0 + F 1 (r,2)σ 1 /σ 0]. Writing this as, using Equation (2) and including pulse rate f (Hz), approximately solves Equation (1) analytically following N consecutive pulses, at t = (N − 1)f −1 sec, as

Estimating Oxygen Consumption Ratefromand R t

Using the Krogh‐Erlang solution (Equation 9) also requires knowledge of the maximum tissue oxygen consumption rate, M 0. Once R t is found, we can derive M 0 from the OEF using the following logic and assumptions. It is important to note that in order for the assumptions of the following equations to be valid, M 0 must be calculated in the normoxic state (i.e. the patient is breathing air). Under this assumption, the SO 2 along the capillary can be calculated using the linear equation:Using Equation (6), which relates mean SO 2 to the OEF, we can create a linear equation of SO 2 along z, the mean SO 2 in the capillary (SO 2 cap, mean) will be equal to the linear Equation (14) at 0.5 L. Therefore, M 0 can be related to OEF using the following steps:which can be rearranged to calculate M 0 :Finally, with M 0 and R t estimated from the OEF and blood volume, the tissue PO 2 (into‐tissue axis) can be calculated. Since the PO 2 along the capillary (P cap) on air and oxygen breathing is known from Step 1, the PO 2 throughout the Krogh cylinder can be calculated for both normoxic and hyperoxic situations (shown in Supporting Information Figure S4).

### Selecting fitted models under epistemic uncertainty using a stochastic process on quantile functions [^115o8v1f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

After n refinement steps, we thus obtain a functiondefined at discrete points:which we extend to the entire interval [0, 1) by linear interpolation; see Fig. 5 d for an illustration. In practice we found that computations (specifically the risk computed by integrating) converge after about eight refinement steps.

This procedure has the important property that once a point is sampled, it does not change on further refinements:which follows from equation (67). Recall now that, as stated above, a process is self-consistent if "for small enough Δ Φ, the probability distribution at a point Φ [does] not depend on the level of refinement". Since equation (70) clearly satisfies that requirement, we see that the process obtained after infinitely many refinement steps is indeed self-consistent. We thus define the hierarchical beta (HB) process as

To complete the definition of, we need to specify how we choose the initial end pointsand. In our implementation, they are drawn from normal distributionswith Φ ∈ {0, 1}, where again c is determined via our proposed calibration procedure; this is simple and convenient, but otherwise arbitrary. We also need to explain how we choose the beta parameters α and β, which is the topic of the next subsection.

Choosing beta distribution parameters

All HB processes are monotone, continuous and self-consistent, but within this class there is still a lot of flexibility: since α and β are chosen independently for each subinterval, we can mouldinto a wide variety of statistical shapes. We use this flexibility to satisfy the two remaining desiderata: a) that realisationstrackover Φ ∈ [0, 1]; and b) that the variability ofbe proportional to. It is the goal of this subsection to give a precise mathematical meaning to those requirements.

Let x 1 ~ Beta(α, β) and x 2 = 1 − x 1. (The density function of a beta distribution is given in (24).) The mean and variance of x 1 areFor a given Φ, it may seem natural to select α and β by matchingtoandto. However both equations are tightly coupled, and we found that numerical solutions were unstable and unsatisfactory; in particular, it is not possible to make the variance large whenapproaches either 0 or 1 (otherwise the distribution of x 1 would exceed [0, 1]).

### Bioelectric impedance vector distribution in peritoneal dialysis patients with different hydration status [^115Aq8VT]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), total body water (TBW) is estimated by functions of body weight, and by equations of bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). These procedures may be biased with abnormal tissue hydration. We validated vector BIA (BIVA) patterns of hydration in CAPD patients, based on direct measurements of resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) (RXc graph) without knowledge of the body weight.

Methods

Cross-sectional study in 200 adult CAPD patients from two groups: 149 patients (77 males and 72 females) without edema (BMI 24.3 kg/m2), and 51 (29 males and 22 females) with pitting edema (BMI 24.6 kg/m2). Single frequency (50 kHz), whole-body impedance vector was measured with both empty and filled peritoneal cavity. Vector distribution was compared with that from 726 healthy subjects, 1116 hemodialysis patients, and 50 nephrotic patients, all with a same BMI. The performance of BIVA was compared with indications of four anthropometry and four conventional BIA equations for TBW.

Results

TBW estimates from anthropometry (Watson, Hume and Weyers, Chertow, and Johansson formulas) were misleading, indicating the same hydration in edema. TBW estimates from BIA equations indicated a 10% excess TBW in edema. BIVA were very sensitive to fluid overload, as both R (by 10%) and Xc (by 40%) were reduced in patients with edema (regardless of peritoneal filling). The vector distribution of individual CAPD patients without edema was superposable to that of the healthy, gender-specific, reference population (50%, 75%, and 95% tolerance ellipses, RXc graph) and close to the hemodialysis, presession distribution. Vectors from patients with edema were displaced downward on the RXc graph, out of the 75% ellipse (88% sensitivity and 87% specificity), and close to vectors from nephrotic patients.

Conclusion

CAPD prescription would keep or bring vectors of patients back into the 75% reference ellipse (border for progression from latent to apparent overhydration across the lower pole) regardless of body weight. Whether CAPD patients with vector within the target ellipse have better outcome needs longitudinal evaluation.

### Optimized molecule detection in localization microscopy with selected false positive probability [^111MHd5u]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Simulations with uniform background and Poisson noise

First, the detection methods are tested in a constant background environment where a single randomly placed spot in Poisson noise is detected as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 10.

In every Monte Carlo run, the spot position is a different real random vector. True Positive (TP) is counted when the detected position is within the tolerated distance offrom the ground true value. True Negative (TN) is counted as a correctly detected background pixel. False positive is a falsely marked detection which is farther than τ TP. False Negative (FN) is missed detection. By repeating the experiment many times (we ran M MC = 5000 Monte Carlo trials), we can expressand. We select values of low signal-to-background ratio a / b = 0.75 (particularly with a = 750 photons and b = 1000 photons) where the differences between the methods are more pronounced. In cases with medium to high a / b ratios, the differences between the methods are smaller. The size of the raw image is 128 × 128 pixels, s.t.d. of PSF is σ = 1 px and the non-maximum suppression box is a 5 × 5 box. All the considered methods use probabilistic thresholding (introduced in "Probabilistic Thresholding and Probability of Detection") to guarantee selected P F P, but we rather use the estimatedin the plots that are occasionally slightly different from the true values. This is the reason why the plot markers are not perfectly aligned. PMF used the precise values of the unknown parameters a, b, σ.

Simulations with varying background and Poisson noise

We assume a parabolic type of background to model a non-uniform illumination similar to the effect of vignettingwhich is coarsely approximated by parabola. We use the parabola model 1/ c 2 (x 2 + y 2) with curvature value c = 10 pixels, which is then mean-shifted to have the same mean as in the case of uniform background (i.e. mean value b = 1000 ph). Supplementary Fig. 16 illustrates such an example signal.

PMF, MF, and no filter methods use local adaptive background estimation. The local adaptive background estimation used local mean implementation (32) in the floating square doughnut-shape kernel (illustrated in Fig. 3 d) of the size 13 × 13 pixels with guard interval 5 × 5.

FIGURE 1
Spheroidal harmonic coordinate system and example harmonics. (a) The coordinate system of the prolate spheroidal harmonics is described. Initially, a reference spheroid is fit to the brain (or sensor array) parameterised by a reference major axis (a) and a reference minor axis (b). Once a reference spheroid is defined, the coordinate of the sensor can be defined in prolate spheroidal coordinates. (b) Illustrative example of both spherical and spheroidal harmonics (order: l = 3, m = 2) on a sphere and spheroid. Importantly, when spherical or spheroidal harmonics are evaluated on a sphere they produce identical results (as the sphere is a spheroid with axes all equal in length). However, when the geometry is spheroidal (right column) we notice that the spherical harmonic model incorrectly predicts most signal to be close to the coordinate system origin and very little along the major axis (left–right direction in this figure).

It is important to note that while the spheroidal harmonics are more mathematically complicated than the spherical harmonics, they are proportional to the spherical harmonics when either the focus is zero, and as such the geometry of the reference object is modelled by a sphere, or the major axis coordinate is much larger than the focal distance. The second scenario occurs when the sensors are far from the brain/scalp (cryogenic MEG systems). When the geometry of the object becomes more spheroidal, the spherical model predicts less signal along the major axis and most signal is predicted close to the coordinate system origin. In contrast, the spheroidal model predicts a more even signal distribution across the major axis dimension. As such, the spheroidal harmonics can be considered a more geometrically adaptive model that can reduce to the spherical case when the geometry of the problem allows this. An example of this property is given in Figure 1b comparing spherical and spheroidal harmonics on spherical and spheroidal geometry.

### Adaptive resetting for informed search strategies and the design of non-equilibrium steady-states [^114xE552]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The final value theorem for Z-transforms states that. By using it, we get (see section 6 of the Supplementary Information)where 〈 N R 〉 is the mean number of time steps between consecutive resetting events. Note that the steady-state in Equation (14) is well defined whenever 〈 N R 〉 is finite, regardless of whether or not the process without resetting has a steady-state. This is a generalization of a well-known result in the theory of standard resetting to state- and time-dependent resetting.

To estimate the NESS, we first sample a set of N trajectories without resetting of length M Δ t. We stress that M should be large enough such that, had we used resetting, the probability of surviving M steps without resetting would be negligible, i.e. Then, we use Equations (12) and (14), and the definition of the Z-transform, to obtainThis estimation results in an unnormalized distribution, which should be normalized. The normalization factor provides an estimate for the mean time between consecutive resetting events, 〈 N R 〉. Equation (15) shows that the estimation of the NESS with resetting, from trajectories without resetting, is done by averaging the histogram of positions over time and trajectories, but reweighing each trajectory, at every time step, by its survival probability.

Prediction and design of non-equilibrium steady-states

The above results can be used to predict and design NESS of spatially-dependent resetting protocols. We demonstrate this using two examples.

It is well known that for free diffusion with a constant resetting rate, a Laplace distributed NESS emerges. An analytical solution for the NESS of diffusion with a parabolic resetting rate r (x) = r 0 x 2 is also known. Interestingly, in both cases, the tails of the NESS decay as, with α = 1 for the constant resetting rate, and α = 2 for the parabolic resetting rate. This raises a more general question: what is the asymptotics of the NESS for diffusion with a power-law resetting rate r (x) = r 0 ∣ x ∣ λ. While there are currently no known closed-form solutions for the NESS with λ ≠ {0, 2}, we can easily estimate the resulting NESS using the procedure described in the previous section.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^115C6AKk]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Flow convergence method (PISA) for quantitation of valvular regurgitation — measurement, interpretation, and pitfalls are outlined as follows: The color frame for PISA measurement should be timed to the instant "corresponding to the maximal jet velocity by CWD". When reporting effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA), "it is best to use the "mean" EROA…; preferably, the RVol should be retained as the most appropriate index". The regurgitant orifice may be nonplanar; it "may be conical rather than flat or planar (180°)… the flow convergence covers more than a hemisphere". If hemispheric geometry is limited by constraint, the operator should attempt to relieve it "by increasing the Va", and "if the constraint persists… the echocardiographer should decide whether a simple correction for the truncation of the flow convergence is possible, and if not, the method should not be reported". Elliptical orifices cause bias: "Application of the standard PISA formula to such an elliptical orifice will lead predictably to flow underestimation", quantified as "For a 3: 1 ellipse… 8% underestimation… a 5: 1 ratio… 17% underestimation, and a 10: 1 ratio… 35% underestimation". Jet direction affects feasibility: "Central jets allow an easy alignment", whereas "eccentric jets may present a challenge". Advanced imaging can help; "Three-dimensional color flow would provide a better assessment… although with additional limitations of lower spatial and temporal resolution". With multiple jets, "the PISA method can be applied to each orifice, with flows and EROA added together; if one lesion is very mild, it can be neglected", and overall, PISA "is the most used method for quantitation of valvular regurgitation in routine clinical practice".

The distribution of the corresponding measurements within the mask are shown in Figure 10 B for the same healthy subject and in Figure 10 C for all subjects. The 2 compartments of water and fat are clearly separated for the proposed Dixon‐cMRF.

Sampson equation considerations describe potential utility and current evidence gaps: A bivariate quadratic equation published by Sampson and colleagues calculates LDL-C from TG and non–HDL-C and yields accurate estimates for samples with a TG level up to 800 mg/dL, although it may underestimate low LDL-C levels. In samples with normal triglyceride levels, it yields similar results to Martin/Hopkins at low LDL-C, but additional data in individuals with low LDL-C are needed before it can be more generally recommended for LDL-C calculation.

### Mapping mechanical stress in curved epithelia of designed size and shape [^114GjMNJ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We finally asked whether the inferred stress was predictive of cell orientation, as previously observed in 2D. We segmented cells in the domes and fitted the shape of each cell to a 2D ellipse on the dome plane (Fig. 4a). We then computed the angle α between the longest axis of the ellipse and the maximum principal stress direction (Fig. 4b) and plotted the distribution of α for domes of high and low eccentricity. Data were binned according to the position of the cell center in the dome (top vs side and major vs minor axis regions, Fig. 4c, d). Both for high and low eccentricity, the angular distributions in the minor axis region (top and side) and in the major axis top region were skewed towards small angles, indicating a predominant alignment between the direction of maximum principal stress and cell elongation. This alignment was not stronger for higher magnitudes of the maximum stress or for increased stress anisotropy (Supplementary Fig. 8). Interestingly, the angular distributions of cells located in the major axis side region were skewed towards high angles. In these regions, maximum stress tended to be normal to the major axis, whereas cells tended to be parallel to it (Fig. 4a, c). These data suggest an additional competing mechanism for cell alignment. We propose that this mechanism might be associated with the cost of cell bending in the regions of highest curvature, as has been proposed for cells adhering on cylindrical wires. If this mechanism dominates, cells will align in the direction of minimal curvature rather than in that of maximum stress to minimize bending. To test this idea, we measured curvature anisotropy across the dome surface, defined as 1- k min / k max, where k min and k max are the minimum and maximum curvatures, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that in regions of relatively low curvature anisotropy (those labeled as minor axis top, minor axis side and major axis top on Fig. 4d), cells tend to align in the direction of maximum stress whereas in those of highest curvature anisotropy (major axis side region) they tend to align in the direction of minimal curvature. Together, these data support that a competition between stretching and bending determines cell orientation on curved surfaces.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Orientation-invariant autoencoders learn robust representations for shape profiling of cells and organelles [^113biZYg]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Prealignment algorithms

Prior works do prealignment in a one or two-stage process, (Supplementary Fig. 1). There is variation in the details, but we use the following procedure. In the first stage, the 'major axis' is computed and aligned to the y-axis. One definition of the 'major axis' is the major axis of the first-order ellipse that has the same second moments as the binary image, which we compute using scikit-image. An alternative definition is the first primary component from a PCA, where the input data are the flattened x-y coordinates of either the image pixels or of evenly-spaced points along the shape outline. Both approaches require a segmentation to compute the angle.

The major-axis alignment only determines orientation up to flips in the x or y-axis, so a second stage updates the final orientation. The approach is to register each cell against a single reference. For some cells, the objects may have a 'natural' orientation (e.g. the outline of Drosophila) which can be used as a reference. But when no orientation is known, a common choice is the mean cell over all images. For each image, we choose the flip that minimises the image cross-correlation with the mean cell. After choosing the flip for each image, the mean cell will be different, so this process is repeated iteratively until the average cross-correlation loss converges, which took fewer than 30 iterations for our datasets.

Fig. 3
An example of a numerical artifact encountered during the dynamics with EOM-CCSD (panels A and B) and their correction with EOM-SCCSD (panels C and D).

Panels A and C show a branching or g h plane for a conical intersection encountered during the simulation of one of the initial conditions. The positive and negative energy difference between the first and second excited states (S 1 and S 2) divided by two (Δ E/2) is shown. The g and h vectors are energy-rescaled and the displacements g and h are in arbitrary units. For CCSD (A), there is an ellipse of degeneracy in the g h plane with unphysical complex-valued energies in the interior of the elliptical boundary; for SCCSD (C), we instead see a single point of degeneracy and no unphysical energies. In CCSD simulations, the wavepacket may approach the intersection too closely and end up in the region with complex-valued energies (the interior of the ellipse in the g h plane). Whenever this happens, we re-run the simulation with SCCSD. Panels B and D show the corresponding potential energy curves for the center of a nuclear trajectory basis function with CCSD (B) and the same trajectory basis function with SCCSD (D). At 71 fs, the CCSD simulation enters the complex-valued region and is terminated (B). The SCCSD simulation, on the other hand, does not encounter any problems (D). The expansion point used in the branching plane calculation is the geometry with the smallest Δ E (as given by SCCSD) in the nonadiabatic event at 71 fs.

### Highly dynamic mechanical transitions in embryonic cell populations during drosophila gastrulation [^1176LBW5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For the results shown in Fig. 2a, a mask was generated for each cell of the mesoderm (along a 16-cell field with its centre in the presumptive ventral midline), from the onset of gastrulation until the initiation of the folding event.

For the results shown in Fig. 2c–g, a mask was generated for a single cell for each time-point from the end of cellularisation until the squamous shape had been acquired. We wanted to analyse the correlation between the Brillouin shift and the length of the apical-basal axis during squamous morphogenesis, using the major and minor axes measurement derived from fitting ellipses with ImageJ/Fiji together with the circularity measurement (Supplementary Fig. 2c; d: 1–3). At the onset of squamous morphogenesis, the apical-basal axis aligns with the major axis of the fitted ellipse, while the perpendicular 'stretching axis' corresponds to the minor axis. As cells adopt an approximately isotropic shape, these axes switch: the major axis becomes the 'stretching axis', and the minor axis becomes the apical-basal axis. We identified this transition by measuring the 'circularity' of the fitted ellipses and divided the process into two phases: Phase 1, from the initiation of squamous morphogenesis until cells reach isotropy, and Phase 2, from isotropy to the completion of morphogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 2d: step 3). The time point at which the fitted ellipses reach maximum circularity marks the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2d: steps 4–5). To track the apical-basal axis in each cell, we combined major axis measurements from Phase 1 (before maximum circularity) with minor axis measurements from Phase 2 (after maximum circularity). Similarly, we measured the stretching axis by combining the minor axis from Phase 1 with the major axis from Phase 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2d: step 6). Finally, we generated time-evolution tables for each cell, capturing the median Brillouin shift alongside shape parameters, including apical-basal and stretching axis lengths (μm).

### An analytic approximation of the feasible space of metabolic networks [^116tLWvz]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Assuming a steady-state condition within a cell, metabolic fluxes satisfy an underdetermined linear system of stoichiometric equations. Characterizing the space of fluxes that satisfy such equations along with given bounds (and possibly additional relevant constraints) is considered of utmost importance for the understanding of cellular metabolism. Extreme values for each individual flux can be computed with linear programming (as flux balance analysis), and their marginal distributions can be approximately computed with Monte Carlo sampling. Here we present an approximate analytic method for the latter task based on expectation propagation equations that does not involve sampling and can achieve much better predictions than other existing analytic methods. The method is iterative, and its computation time is dominated by one matrix inversion per iteration. With respect to sampling, we show through extensive simulation that it has some advantages including computation time, and the ability to efficiently fix empirically estimated distributions of fluxes.

### Super-resolution provided by the arbitrarily strong superlinearity of the blackbody radiation [^1171Kxsn]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Under the above assumptions, energy absorption, heat production, and temperature increase operate locally and linearly, and the notion of psf becomes meaningful for the following analysis. Let us consider a focused beam with a two-dimensional spatial intensity profilesuch as a Gaussian or Airy shape, and an object smaller than the beam section. When located at position, we assume that the object experiences uniform intensitythat produces a proportional temperature increase, with. Thermal detection over a given spectral domaincan be described using the photonic radiance response, and we define the effective response asdefined as the difference:The normalized spatial profile of that response, then appear as a function of the dimensionless excitationparametrized by, andas:This normalized dimensionless responseis a complex non-algebraic function that exhibits a strong superlinearity (Fig. 2 a1, a2) with apparent exponents that only depend on the parameters,… As a consequence, the spatial extension ofas a function ofis contracted compared to, as schematically illustrated on Fig. 2 b. The extent of psf contraction is assessed by the compression factorbetween these two profiles measured from their full width at, which is computed numerically from Eq.

Numerical computations with = 1.5 μm indicate that the thermal radiation psfcan be made 10-fold smaller than the excitation psf (Fig. 2 d).

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^112Ly9uw]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I 0 (ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ 2 ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

### Field theory for recurrent mobility [^116G5GUU]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Numerical calculation of the flux

The definition of the flux as a perimeter (surface) integral isfor the vectorandfor. In both cases, the integral is performed over the perimeter S, is the infinitesimal element of length andis the unit vector normal to the perimeter in each point.

From a numerical perspective, the integrals are calculated aswhere the index i runs over all the cells intersecting the perimeter S, is the unit vector normal to the surface in i andis approximated by the total perimeter of S divided by the number of intersecting cells. The flux as a volume integral of the divergence is calculated aswith the location of cell i in (α, β), as above, the index i runs over the cells in the volume V and dV is the area of the unit cell. The cells without resident commuters, m = 0, do not exhibit outflows and, to avoid inconsistencies, the field is defined as null in them. This implies that they do not contribute to the calculation of the flux or other results. Note that this is different from the classical continuous approaches of field theory in physics (e.g. electric or gravitational fields) where the field is defined everywhere and always contributes to the net flux.

Gravity model

The equation for the flow of commuters between two areas i and j with an exponential deterrence function iswhere k is a constant, m i, j are the populations of origin and destination areas i (j), d ij is the distance between them and d 0 is a characteristic distance. This is the linear version of the Gravity Model, where the output and input flows are proportional to the number of people in the area. The model has only two parameters to fit (k and d 0). The vector field is obtained by summing over the possible destinations and dividing by m i. Ifis the unit vector pointing from i to j, the vector field can be written as

Radiation model

The Radiation Model is inspired by radiation and absorption of particles: for every worker residing in and leaving cell i, the destination (work) cell j is obtained using the probability expressionwhere s ij is the population residing in a circle centered in i, with radius d ij and excluding the populations of i and j. The average flows can be calculated as 〈 T ij 〉 = T i P (i, j), where T i is the empirical total outflow of cell i.

### Body composition analysis with bioelectric impedance in adult Indians with ESRD: comparison with healthy population [^1133BA1f]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Evaluation of body composition provides clinically useful information in several diseases including chronic kidney disease. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) is a simple, cheap, and noninvasive tool for monitoring body composition. We performed BIA in 451 healthy adults and 162 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) values were obtained at 50-kHz frequency using a tetrapolar impedance meter. Body compartments were derived using population-specific regression equations. Phase angles (arctan Xc/R) were calculated and impedance vector distribution was determined using the RXc graph method. Compared to healthy population, ESRD patients had similar post-dialysis resistance with lower reactance and phase angle, indicating decreased soft tissue mass and inadequate ultrafiltration. BIA equations estimated decreased fat mass index and intracellular water, whereas the total body and extracellular water percentages were increased. Sex-specific reference RXc plots with 95, 75, and 50% tolerance ellipses were drawn for the healthy population. A significant difference was noted in the vector positions and 95% confidence ellipses of the two sexes and body mass indices of ≤ 25 and > 25. In conclusion, we present the reference BIA parameters for Indian population. ESRD patients show significant body compartment alterations. The RXc score graph can differentiate ESRD patient from normal controls and can be used to monitor nutrition and hydration status.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111eoLve]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Values and preferences, resource use, and implementation — Using validated eGFR equations improves the accuracy of assessment of true GFR but remains imperfect, and no single equation performs consistently across all populations; the Work Group judged that people with CKD and their healthcare providers would want GFR estimated using the equation providing the greatest accuracy in the population of their geographical region, and there are several valid equations that can reasonably be used in local settings. Each region should have a mechanism for review and selection of equations for implementation by laboratories, and decisions at this level by continental or national organizations are likely to minimize the likelihood that decisions for equation use will be made within small geographical areas governed by local decisions, leading to greater variation in eGFR and uncertainty by people with CKD and healthcare providers. There are likely to be tradeoffs between optimal accuracy in local regions versus uniformity; equations optimized for a specific region can help to ensure that the GFR thresholds for disease definition, classification, and risk estimation have the same implications across regions; however, it would lead to barriers to implementation, as it will not be possible for all regions to conduct a sufficiently large and representative study to evaluate these equations and develop modifications. If not possible, or in the interim, we advise using equations that were developed in populations most similar to the available populations. Resource use includes initial costs such as human resource costs and education for providers, which incurs both direct and indirect costs.

### The linear-quadratic model is an appropriate methodology for determining isoeffective doses at large doses per fraction [^114iZ3Ad]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The tool most commonly used for quantitative predictions of dose/fractionation dependencies in radiotherapy is the mechanistically based linear-quadratic (LQ) model. The LQ formalism is now almost universally used for calculating radiotherapeutic isoeffect doses for different fractionation/protraction schemes. In summary, the LQ model has the following useful properties for predicting isoeffect doses: (1) it is a mechanistic, biologically based model; (2) it has sufficiently few parameters to be practical; (3) most other mechanistic models of cell killing predict the same fractionation dependencies as does the LQ model; (4) it has well-documented predictive properties for fractionation/dose-rate effects in the laboratory; and (5) it is reasonably well validated, experimentally and theoretically, up to about 10 Gy/fraction and would be reasonable for use up to about 18 Gy per fraction. To date, there is no evidence of problems when the LQ model has been applied in the clinic.

### The biologic relevance of daily dose variations in adaptive treatment planning [^115GVeP1]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To explore the biologic relevance of deviations from the intended uniform fractionation scheme.

Methods and Materials

We study the effect of the variance of the dose per fraction on the normalized total dose (NTD), which incorporates the linear-quadratic model of radiation effects. In regions of steep dose gradients, we determine the shift between NTD isodose lines and physical isodose lines. We also look at ways to compensate for dose-variation effects through dose adjustments, without changing the number of fractions.

Results

Simple equations quantify effects of dose variation on the NTD. If the standard deviation of the dose is 10% of the daily dose fraction, the effects on the NTD for a given point in the irradiated area are always less than 1%, independent of the biologic parameters. In adaptive dose-correction schemes, the dose correction should be applied uniformly over the remaining fractions, to minimize the variance. Incomplete repair leads to a coupling of doses delivered on different days, which complicates the issue. Repopulation appears to be insignificant in the context of this study (constant overall treatment time).

Conclusions

A variation of the dose between fractions always leads to a larger biologic effect than does the same total dose delivered with standard uniform fractionation. The increase in NTD is negligible if the standard deviation of the dose is less than 10% of the dose per fraction.

### Hand grip strength variability during serial testing as an entropic biomarker of aging: a poincaréplot analysis [^111iiqoU]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

SD 1 and SD 2 are calculated through formulas that incorporate the standard deviation of the time series. Practically, SD 1 represents the standard deviation (dispersion) of the distances of points from the major axis of the ellipse and indicates the short-term variability of the time series of data. SD 2 represents the standard deviation (dispersion) from the minor axis of the ellipse and indicates the long-term variability of the time series of data.

The formulas for the two parameters are the following :where SD (x n – x n + 1) represents the standard deviation of the time series x n – x n + 1 and SD (x n) the standard deviation of the time series x n.

Another statistical indicator for the analysis of dynamic data evolution is the ratio SD 1 /SD 2, which measures the relative balance between short- and long-term variabilities of the time series of data. For this reason, SD 1 /SD 2 reflects the clarity and linearity of the scatter pattern. For statistical analysis, the area of the fitting ellipse (AFE) has been proposed, which is calculated by the formula AFE = π ∗ SD 1 ∗ SD 2.

The utility of the Poincaré plot is justified by the fact that the initial qualitative analysis of a nonlinear distribution of data, by tracing the ellipse, can be transformed into a quantitative analysis in terms of linear statistics by calculating SD 1 and SD 2.

Applications of Poincaré plot in the analysis of the biological systems dynamics

Because living organisms can be assimilated to open biological systems, various forms of their entropic behaviors have been proposed from the perspective of particular dynamic physiological parameters.

In this regard, the Poincaré plot has proven to be widely applicable in the field of human biology, for scale entropy analysis of complex physiologic time series and for control systems involved in their complex regulation.

Traditionally, Poincaré plots have been used to represent biomedical signals such as heart rate and respiratory pattern variabilities. Most studies of this kind are aimed at studying beat-to-beat heart rate variability in clinical circumstances. In this way, representations of R-R intervals can be extracted from serial electrocardiographic records.

The bivariate segmented Poincaré plot analysis, which is a variant derived from the classic one, is used to study the interactions between beat-to-beat RR intervals and its temporal enclosed systolic blood pressure time series.

### Quantitative FLASH MRI at 3T using a rational approximation of the ernst equation [^116zHbRA]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

From the half-angle substitution of trigonometric terms in the Ernst equation, rational approximations of the flip angle dependence of the FLASH signal can be derived. Even the rational function of the lowest order was in good agreement with the experiment for flip angles up to 20 degrees. Three-dimensional maps of the signal amplitude and longitudinal relaxation rates in human brain were obtained from eight subjects by dual-angle measurements at 3T (nonselective 3D-FLASH, 7 degrees and 20 degrees flip angle, TR = 30 ms, isotropic resolution of 0.95 mm, each 7:09 min). The corresponding estimates of T1 and signal amplitude are simple algebraic expressions and deviated about 1% from the exact solution. They are ill-conditioned to estimate the local flip angle deviation but can be corrected post hoc by division of squared RF maps obtained by independent measurements. Local deviations from the nominal flip angles strongly affected the relaxation estimates and caused considerable blurring of the T1 histograms.

### Accurate localization microscopy by intrinsic aberration calibration [^115tzpr2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Localization accuracy throughout the focal volume

To estimate the accuracy of widefield calibration, we take the values from the local calibration functions, andas the true values. The error at the location of each calibration particle is the residual of the fit of a Zernike model to these values, or, for interpolant models, the value of the interpolant after removal of the calibration particle. For a Zernike model, the errors (Fig. 5) shrink toward the corners of a square field (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12) due to the rapid fluctuation of Zernike polynomials of high order near the periphery of the fitting domain. This corner effect potentially embeds errors in the calibration function, such as interpolation does, and results in a significant deviation of error histograms from normality, with a mean excess kurtosis of 0.66 ± 0.15. Errors from interpolation do not have this trend (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). However, our experimental particles are within a circular subset of the field (Figs. 1 and 6), resulting in error histograms that are closer to normal, with a mean excess kurtosis of 0.34 ± 0.17. These results suggest optimizing accuracy by calibrating an imaging field that encircles the sample by an increasing number of Zernike polynomials.

### Modeling growth kinetics and statistical distribution of oligometastases [^114LNFdY]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The kinetics of development of micrometastases, and especially of small numbers of metastases (oligometastases), was explored by using simple assumptions to develop concepts that may be useful for framing future research. The conclusions depend on the assumptions and hence must be considered speculative. It is assumed that beyond a threshold size for initiation of metastatic spread, which varies widely from tumor to tumor, the rate at which a primary tumor sheds new metastases increases exponentially, in parallel with its exponential growth. This increasing rate of release of new metastatic clonogens from the primary tumor is accompanied by a similar exponential growth of each of the micrometastases newly established at a secondary site. This creates a log-log linear relationship between the volume distribution of metastases and number of metastases, there being one largest metastasis followed by an exponentially expanding number of logarithmically smaller micrometastases. For example, if the micrometastases and the primary tumor grew at the same rate for 6 doublings after initiation of the first metastasis, then the primary tumor would have increased its volume by a factor of 64 (2(6)) and would be shedding metastatic clonogens at 64 times the initial rate. The first metastasis would undergo 6 doublings and contain 64 cells; the succeeding 2 metastases, released as the primary doubled in volume, would undergo 5 doublings and each would contain 32 cells; and so forth down to the 64 most recently developed single-cell metastases. However, the growth rate of metastases is expected to be faster than that of the primary tumor so that the rate of increase in volume of the micrometastases would be faster than the rate of increase in their numbers (through release of new metastases from the primary). Thus, although the log-log linear relationship is maintained, the slope of the volume frequency curve is changed; if the micrometastases grew 5 times faster than the primary, the slope would change by a factor of 5. Removal of the primary tumor as a source of new metastases truncates the expansion in numbers of metastases without affecting the growth rate of existing micrometastases, with the result that the volume-frequency relationship is maintained but the whole curve is shifted to larger volumes as micrometastases grow toward clinical detectability. The development of an oligometastatic distribution requires that the exponential expansion in the number of new metastases be stopped by eliminating the primary tumor soon after the first metastasis is shed. A cell destined to become part of an oligometastatic distribution had just been newly deposited at its metastatic site at the time the primary tumor was removed and must undergo about 30 doublings to become clinically detectable as an overt metastasis (2(30) or 10(9) cells). Thus, the time interval between removal of the primary and subsequent appearance of oligometastases will be toward the upper end of a distribution of "metastasis-free" intervals for its particular class of tumor. The actual time to appearance of a solitary metastasis, or of oligometastases, in any particular patient will depend on the growth rate of the metastases in that individual but will always require about 30 volume doublings. An apparently solitary metastasis appearing synchronously with the primary tumor is unlikely to be solitary because, to do so, it would have to have undergone about 30 doublings without further release of metastatic clonogens from the primary that is, in our model, within 1 doubling in volume of the primary tumor. For the same reason, a synchronous or early appearing oligometastatic distribution is unlikely, but if it were to exist, there would be a steep gradient between the volumes of largest and smallest metastases because the growth rate of the micrometastases to produce synchronous metastases, without having further metastases shed from the primary, would have to be fast (up to 30x) relative to the growth rate of the primary. Conversely, a steep gradient in volumes of successive echelons of metastases reflects fast growth of metastases relative to the primary and favors the possibility of an oligometastatic distribution. This ratio of growth rates of metastases to primary is defined by the slope of the log-log curve for the volume-frequency distribution of metastases, which, in clinical practice, is difficult to determine over a wide range and is, by definition, essentially impossible for oligometastases. However, the volume-frequency relationship, measured over a wide range, is the same as the ratio of the volume of the largest to second-largest metastases in an oligometastatic situation. For example, if the metastasis doubled 5 times faster than the primary, the largest metastasis would be larger by 5 doublings than its closest follower(s), that is, by a factor of 2(5) or 32, equivalent to a 3.2-fold difference in diameter if the metastases were spherical. Alternatively, if an initially solitary and measurable metastasis is subsequently joined by measurable followers, the number of volume doublings separating successive echelons in the series can be determined directly, and the larger the difference (measured in doublings), the greater the probability that there will be a limited, oligometastatic condition (ie, in clinical terms, subsequent metastases will stop appearing after the large leader metastasis and a short succession of followers have been removed at 1 or more operations). In summary, the probability of there being an oligometastatic distribution is increased as the interval between removal of the primary tumor and appearance of metastases lengthens. It is also more likely the faster the metastases are growing relative to the growth rate of the primary tumor before its removal. Effective systemic cytotoxic treatment (eg, chemotherapy, hormonal manipulation, biological agents) given in the perioperative period, or concomitantly with radiation therapy for the primary tumor, would truncate the volume-frequency distribution toward an oligometastatic one by eliminating the smallest, most recently formed "tail-ender" metastases. That process, which only occurs at the threshold volume of the primary at which metastases are first initiated, would not be influenced by whether surgery or radiation therapy was chosen to treat the primary tumor, regardless of the overall duration of radiation therapy. Chemotherapy adjuvant to surgery is not usually indicated in the curative treatment of solitary or oligometastases because they represent a truncated distribution with few or no stragglers. If subclinical stragglers exist, they would usually be relatively large and, even though subclinical, too large to be cured by chemotherapy. Exceptions would be early rapidly growing oligometastases, especially from a slowly growing primary, or solitary metastases from an unknown primary where second echelon metastases, if they exist, may still be small. Otherwise chemotherapy could be postponed and used for palliative growth restraint of unusually large and/or numerous stragglers.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^114DsCEp]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Spin dephasing under nonlinear gradients: implications for imaging and field mapping [^1171KZF1]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This work examines the prototypical MR echo that would be expected for a voxel of spins evolving in a strong nonlinear field, specifically focusing on the quadratic z(2) - ½(x(2) + y(2)) field. Dephasing under nonlinear gradients is increasingly relevant given the growing interest in nonlinear imaging, and here, we report several notable differences from the linear case. Most notably, in addition to signal loss, intravoxel dephasing under gradients creating a wide and asymmetric frequency distribution across the voxel can cause skewed and nonlinear phase evolution. After presenting the qualitative and analytical origins of this difference, we experimentally demonstrate that neglecting these dynamics can lead to significant errors in sequences that assume phase evolution is proportional to voxel frequency, such as those used for field mapping. Finally, simplifying approximations to the signal equations are presented, which not only provide more intuitive forms of the exact expression but also result in simple rules to predict key features of the nonlinear evolution.

### A rational approach to the clinical use of cumulative effective dose estimates [^111959Uq]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This article will address ongoing efforts to track cumulative dose estimates of patient radiation exposure that have the potential to transform radiation protection research.

Conclusion

There is no clear consensus on how to use this information clinically. A rational consideration of this question reveals that until the linear no-threshold model is supplanted, cumulative dose estimates are of little clinical relevance and never constitute a logical reason to avoid an imaging evaluation that is otherwise medically indicated.

Figure 4. Mean Change from Baseline in Individual Serial FEV (mL) Assessments after 12 Weeks of Treatment – Trial 2

Subjects in both Trials 1 and 2 receiving fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 100 mcg once daily had a greater improvement from baseline in percentage of 24-hour periods without need of beta2-agonist rescue medication use than subjects receiving placebo.

Clinical Trial with Fluticasone Furoate ELLIPTA 200 mcg: Trial 3 (NCT01431950) was a 24-week trial that evaluated the relative efficacy of fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 100 mcg and fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 200 mcg on lung function in subjects with asthma. Of the 219 subjects, 68% were female and 87% were Caucasian. The mean age was 46 years. The trial included a 4-week run-in period during which the subjects were symptomatic while taking their usual mid- to high-dose ICS therapy (i.e., fluticasone propionate greater than 250 to 1,000 mcg/day or equivalent). If LABA were used prior to screening, their use was discontinued during the run-in. Mean baseline percent predicted FEV1was approximately 68% overall and similar in the 2 treatment groups. Sixteen percent of subjects on fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 100 mcg and 13% of subjects on fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 200 mcg failed to complete the 24-week trial.

### Definitions… [^112BnNTG]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

The next section of the General Instructions provides brief definitions of a number of words used in the rules. These are:

- Bilateral
- Clinical Diagnosis
- Contiguous tumor
- Focal
- Foci
- Focus
- Laterality
- Most representative specimen
- Multiple primaries
- Overlapping tumor
- Paired organ/site
- Recurrence
- Single primary
- Unilateral Read and understand these definitions, as they apply to all sets of rules. Two word groups merit special attention at this point; the rest should be reviewed when the registrar encounters them. Focal
- Foci
- Focus Unlike the equivalent terms listed in the previous section, these words are not interchangeable.
- Focal means limited to one specific area and may be either microscopic or macroscopic. Focal is an adjective and is not a synonym for focus.
- Focus is a pathologic term describing cells that can be seen only microscopically.

The cells stand out from surrounding tissue based on their appearance, special stains, or other testing.
- Foci is the plural of focus and implies only microscopic visualization of the tumor cells.
- A new occurrence of cancer arising from cells that have nothing to do with the earlier cancer. The use of the term 'recurrence' had some inherent problems. The physicians on the MPH Task Force agreed that they used the word to mean both of these types of recurrence and they had never really known that we were coding literally and making casefinding decisions based on the word. The new rules say:

- Do not use a physician's statement to decide whether the patient has a recurrence of a previous cancer or a new primary.
- Use the multiple primary rules as written unless a pathologist compares the present tumor to the 'original' tumor and states that this tumor is a recurrence of the previous primary.

The 2007 MPH rules take the guesswork out of trying to interpret what a physician means when he/she uses the term. The new rule will be used to determine whether the patient indeed has a recurrent tumor or a new primary. This is a big change for many registrars who follow Commission on Cancer rules as stated in the Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards manual.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^111RqHeY]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular mass (LV mass) quantification in adults by echocardiography — measurement timing, methods, and calculation considerations — includes that measurements should be performed at the end of diastole (the frame before mitral valve closure or the frame in the cardiac cycle in which the ventricular dimension or volume is largest). Methods include M‑mode, two‑dimensional echocardiography (2DE), and three‑dimensional echocardiography (3DE); M‑mode and 2D linear dimensions use geometric formulas to estimate myocardial volume while 3DE can measure it directly, and all methods convert volume to mass using myocardial density (approximately 1.05 g/mL). When using 2D images of the entire ventricle, either the area‑length or truncated ellipsoid technique is used. Proper technique requires wall thickness and LV dimensions be perpendicular to the long axis, and 2D‑guided M‑mode or 2D image measurements are preferred over blind M‑mode imaging. The commonly used formula includes a correction for the 20% overestimation from original M‑mode validation and raises the linear dimensions to the power of 3, so small dimensional errors can significantly affect calculated LV mass; moreover, because direct 2D wall thickness measures may be smaller than M‑mode, LV mass values derived with this formula may not be directly interchangeable. For serial assessment in individual patients, 2D echocardiographic methods have advantages over linear dimensions, whereas for screening or studying large populations, the M‑mode method has advantages because it is simple, quick, and subject to less measurement variability. Because 3DE directly measures myocardial volume, it is an appropriate approach, but it is the consensus of this committee that available 3D echocardiographic LV mass data in normal subjects are not sufficient to recommend normal reference values. In patients with upper septal hypertrophy, linear dimension methods using basal measurements result in overestimation of the true mass.

### Limits on the computational expressivity of non-equilibrium biophysical processes [^112Romk3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The matrix-tree theorem.

A Computing the steady-state occupancy π 1 by summing weights over directed spanning trees. Directed spanning trees are subgraphs containing all graph nodes but no cycles, with edges oriented toward a root node. In each directed spanning tree, the input forces make a positive, negative, or zero contribution to the tree weight. The structural vectorsare shown below each tree; these quantities enter into Equation (3) below. B Schematic illustration of the high-dimensional space of feature vectors ψ (i; θ) and χ (i, F). The depicted arrangement of vectors could solve a binary classification problem.

We define the input multiplicityas the number of edges affected per input variable, which we assume to be the same for each input. To focus on the functional way in which the input driving enters the steady-state probabilities, the driving contributions can be factored out in the algebraic expressions for the numerator and denominator of Equation (1). This has been previously been used to make analytical progress for M = D = 1 in, for example, refs. –. This equivalent formulation of Eq. (1) suggests that steady states of Markov jump processes implement a rational polynomial function of exponentiated input variables. Defining, we rewrite the matrix-tree expression for π i for general D and M We use the multi-index, whereis the set of D input labels and each componentof the multi-index runs over the values, to enumerate themonomials. These monomials y μ (F) in Equation (2) combinatorially depend on the different mixtures μ of input driving, representing a net total μ a of signed contributions from the input force F a, μ b such contributions for F b, and so on for each input. The coefficients, which are functions of the parameters θ, are the sums of weights over all directed spanning trees rooted at node i which have the corresponding mixture μ of signed input contributions. The monomial coefficientsthus represent learnable amplitudes of each polynomial basis function y μ (F). The coefficients in the denominator are defined as. Classification will be successful if, for F ρ drawn from class ρ, the coefficientsand monomials y μ (F ρ) are large for the same μ. In the subsequent sections of the paper and in the Supplementary Information we use the formulation in Equation (2) to show how the classification ability of a non-equilibrium Markov processes may be systematically modulated.

### Association of childhood disadvantage with malnutrition in older ages in India [^1119Zj42]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We used descriptive statistics to illustrate the sample characteristics and study variables of childhood conditions, adulthood conditions and nutrition status of 60 and above population.

Binary logistic regression was used to assess the adjusted association of childhood and adulthood conditions with nutrition status. We ran two models- the outcome variable in Model 1 was underweight and the outcome variable in Model 2 was overweight.

We used the structural equation modelling (SEM) approach, a combination of measurement models, to construct latent variables and structural models to test our hypothetical model. SEM enables the testing of direct and indirect (mediating) effects via path analysis and its combination with measurement models for SES to reduce measurement error. This is crucial while employing complex structural equation modelling to reduce the bias due to measurement error. SEM is an advanced statistical analysis that allows for the analysis of multiple independent and dependent variables. Using SEM, we tested the direct and indirect effect of childhood conditions on nutrition status in old age and the mediating effect of adulthood conditions on the above association. The p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the analyses were conducted using Stata 16.1 (SE) software.

SEM was carried out as per the four-step approach as suggested by Kline. Figure 2 shows the four-step approach for conducting SEM analysis.

A four-step approach for conducting SEM analysis

Model specification

A hypothetical model for the mediating effect of adult conditions on the association between childhood conditions and nutrition status was developed following literature review as shown in Fig. 3. A manifest or observed variable (represented by rectangles) is a variable which can be measured directly. On the other hand, a latent variable (represented by ellipses) is one which can neither be measured directly nor observed but can be inferred from observed variables. For our analysis, we constructed one latent variable (childhood conditions) which was defined by four observed variables- father's education, mother's education, status of childhood wealth and status of childhood health.

Fig. 3
Hypothetical conceptual model for the mediating effect of adult conditions on nutrition in old age. Note: Childhood conditions (represented by an ellipse) is a latent variable and adult conditions and nutrition (represented by rectangles) are observed variables. The model also includes other control variables: age group, sex, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption and level of physical activity), presence of any chronic diseases, presence of any form of ill-treatment/abuse, and monthly per capita expenditure

General principles of biophysical computational models — biophysical computational models can be used for forward simulations of function or inverse identification of system structure and parameters. Forward models are described as useful for sensitivity analyses to evaluate the contribution of normal subject variability to imaging metrics to define a threshold for abnormal and can also predict emergent behavior after parameter changes at the cellular or tissue level. Inverse models are described as useful for deriving information that cannot be measured directly, including distributions of airway or vascular obstruction that produce specific V˙A/Q˙ patterns. Both forward and inverse models can be used to analyze, interpret, and predict.

### Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol [^113j4jjr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The co-primary efficacy variables in both trials were weighted mean FEV1(0 to 4 hours) postdose on Day 168 and change from baseline in trough FEV1on Day 169 (the mean of the FEV1values obtained 23 and 24 hours after the final dose on Day 168). The weighted mean comparison of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination with fluticasone furoate was assessed to evaluate the contribution of vilanterol to fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA. The trough FEV1comparison of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination with vilanterol was assessed to evaluate the contribution of fluticasone furoate to fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA.

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg demonstrated a larger increase in the weighted mean FEV1(0 to 4 hours) relative to placebo and fluticasone furoate 100 mcg at Day 168 (Table 6).

Serial spirometric evaluations were performed predose and up to 4 hours after dosing. Results from Trial 1 at Day 1 and Day 168 are shown in Figure 3. Similar results were seen in Trial 2 (not shown).

### Fluticasone furoate (fluticasone furoate ellipta) [^111XkL6H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints in Trial 2 were change from baseline in trough FEV1at Week 12 and weighted mean FEV1(0–24 hours) at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Trough FEV1was assessed at clinic visits throughout the trial. Weighted mean FEV1(0–24 hours) was recorded at baseline and after the final study dose with serial measurements taken at frequent intervals (at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours post-dose) in a subset of subjects (n = 201).

Fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 100 mcg once daily had greater mean changes from baseline in trough FEV1than placebo throughout the trial. At Week 12 or the last available on-treatment visit prior to Week 12, the mean change from baseline in trough FEV1was greater among subjects receiving fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 100 mcg once daily than among those receiving placebo (mean treatment difference 136 mL; 95% CI: 51, 222).

Lung function improvements were sustained over the 24-hour period following the final dose of fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 100 mcg (Figure 4). Compared with placebo, at Week 12 the change from baseline in weighted mean FEV1was significantly greater for fluticasone furoate ELLIPTA 100 mcg (mean treatment difference 186 mL; 95% CI: 62, 310).

### The receptor kinase SRF3 coordinates iron-level and flagellin dependent defense and growth responses in plants [^112E3zbN]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

SRF3 resides in the plasmodesmata and bulk plasma membrane regions where its level is decreased under low iron conditions

During the analysis of SRF3 expression, we had noticed its enrichment at the PM with an apical-basal localization in punctate foci but also along the entire PM, referred to as bulk PM (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). We tested the role of its extracellular domain and kinase domain for specifying its heterogenous distribution by calculating the standard deviation of the mean intensity (SDMI) along the apical-basal side of PM. In standard conditions, we found that compared to the WT version, SRF3 ΔExtraC and SRF3 KD showed a strong and slight decrease of the SDMI, respectively, while the removal of the kinase domain (SRF3 ΔKinase) did not lead to any changes (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6b). A similar trend was observed when looking at the apical-basal polarity (Fig. 3a). This indicates that the extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient to drive SRF3 into the PM-associated foci and might suggest a direct role of the kinase domain in its partitioning. Upon low iron levels, no changes were observed for SRF3 ΔExtraC and SRF3 KD as well as in the control line, Lti6b while a decrease of SDMI and polarity were observed for SRF3 WT (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 6c). This points to a major role of the extracellular domain and putatively to a lesser extent to the kinase domain in the removal of SRF3 from the foci upon exposure to low iron levels.

### Unusual polarimetric properties for interstellar comet 2I / borisov [^112vTyDB]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Statistical tests

Statistical prediction limits for the observations at significance level (1 − q) × 100% may be expressed aswhere N is the sample size, Y i is the measurement at α i, p = [b, c 1, c 2, α 0] is the parameter vector, and C p the parameter estimates and associated covariance from the fit, J = ∇ p P r (α; p) evaluated atand t n −4 (q /2) is the q /2 percentage point of Student's distribution with n − 4 degrees of freedom. For the asymptotic case n = ∞ we have t (0.05) = 1.645 and t (0.025) = 1.960. To quantify the disagreement between 2I/Borisov and the other comets, we fitted the ensemble cometary data to Eq. (1) using nonlinear least squares minimisation, subtracted the fit from the data and compared the predictive confidence limits (12) on the observations to the Borisov measurements. The result for the R F -filter and I F -filter measurements separately is shown in Fig. 6. Here we considered only data with available observational uncertainties and 0 < α < 60 ∘, yielding sets with N = 393 (R F filter) and N = 113 (I F filter) respectively. We then discarded the 5% of each dataset with the highest uncertainties. Our two R F -filter measurements of 2I/Borisov at α = 27. 5 ∘ and α = 28. 6 ∘ (red points, panel a) lie between P L 05 and P L 10, therefore the probability P that both R F -filter measurements follow the same phase-polarisation behaviour as the other comets is 2.5 × 10 −3 < P R < 10 −2. Our I F -filter measurement of 2I/Borisov at α = 28. 5 ∘ (panel b) lies between the same two predictive contours and therefore P I < 10 −1. Though the R F and I F measurements must be correlated to some degree, in any case.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^111eXWpk]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

These data were then plotted in a Cartesian plane, comparing angle variations (y) to time (x); all the curve of fitting calculated in this way were second order equation and could be expressed as y = ax 2 + bx + c (as expected from literature findings). The average values were used to plot six functions, each representing the angle of a given joint (shoulder, elbow or wrist) according to time under one of the two conditions (FASTER or ERROR).

After checking that fitting coefficients (the "a" in the above reported equation) were normally distributed (Kolgomorov-Smirnov test; p > 0.05), we also plotted the −2, -1 and +1, +2 standard deviation's curves for each joint and condition.

Figure 3 shows the results we obtained. The first line shows shoulder, elbow and wrist angles of children attending first and fifth class under ERROR condition, while the second line shows the same parameters under FASTER condition. Values are given in detail in Table 3.

Validation on real data

To test the above conclusions on real data, we imaged immobilized fluorescent beads, alternating strong and weak excitation as shown in Fig. 4a. We used images under strong excitation conditions to extract an approximate ground truth for testing the precision estimates in the dim images. We estimated the position and precision of spots using the estimation procedures described above with a symmetric spot model, except for changing the background prior to be centred around the mean background (0.7 photons per pixel) seen in dim frames. A drift-corrected ground truth was estimated by linear interpolation between the mean positions obtained from each block of 10 consecutive bright images. In addition, the intensity differs by about a factor 10 between bright and dim frames. Overall, the RMSEs of the ground truth should therefore be approximately 10-fold lower than that of a single dim spot.

Figure 4e shows the resulting comparison between true and estimated precision, with every point corresponding to a single bead. It qualitatively reproduces the behaviour on simulated images in Fig. 2, confirming our conclusion that the Laplace approximation is preferable to the CRLB formula as a precision estimator, and that the good performance of our prior is not limited to that particular set of simulated data.

Estimating diffusion constants

Next, we consider how precision estimates can improve estimates of diffusion constants, arguably the most common analysis of SPT data. Using simulated data, we estimated positions and precisions using the asymmetric MAP-Laplace estimators described above, extracted uninterrupted trajectories with ten steps, and finally estimated diffusion constants using the covariance-based estimators of ref.(see Methods) with and without the use of precision estimates. Figure 5 shows the resulting mean value and 1% quantiles under varying imaging conditions, plotted against the signal-to-noise ratio, which is defined as half the diffusive step-length s.d. divided by the RMSE. The use of estimated precision obviously improves the variability of the diffusion estimates substantially. The covariance-based estimators only use the average precision in each trajectory. We also implemented a maximum-likelihood estimator for the diffusion constantthat makes explicit use of pointwise precisions (see Methods), but found no further improvement (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Clinical Trial with ARNUITY ELLIPTA 200 mcg: Trial 3 (NCT01431950) was a 24-week trial that evaluated the relative efficacy of ARNUITY ELLIPTA 100 mcg and ARNUITY ELLIPTA 200 mcg on lung function in subjects with asthma. Of the 219 subjects, 68% were female and 87% were Caucasian. The mean age was 46 years. The trial included a 4-week run-in period during which the subjects were symptomatic while taking their usual mid- to high-dose ICS therapy (i.e., fluticasone propionate greater than 250 to 1,000 mcg/day or equivalent). If LABA were used prior to screening, their use was discontinued during the run-in. Mean baseline percent predicted FEV1was approximately 68% overall and similar in the 2 treatment groups.
