## Question

Does high dose melatonin cause more sleepiness than low dose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether higher-dose melatonin causes more sleepiness than lower-dose melatonin, and how to interpret that with references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic distinction between chronobiotic and hypnotic effects of melatonin. Then, I should verify dose–response data for sleepiness and sedation across randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine pharmacokinetic considerations that could plausibly increase next-day drowsiness with higher doses. After that, I should review guideline positions and safety signals, including adverse event rates. Finally, I will synthesize a practical answer and highlight timing and formulation nuances that modify risk of daytime sleepiness.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual framework, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating two distinct therapeutic actions. Melatonin has a chronobiotic effect at low doses that aligns circadian rhythms, and a more direct soporific effect at higher doses that can increase sleep propensity; importantly, timing relative to dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) shifts the phase-response curve and thus the clinical effect, so dose and timing are not independent variables [^117WvapF] [^111npaXj].

> Wait, let me verify the dose–response for sleepiness and sedation from higher-quality evidence. A systematic review focused on high-dose melatonin (≥ 10 mg) found a higher risk of adverse events including drowsiness, headache, and dizziness compared with placebo, with a rate ratio around 1.40 for adverse events, which supports a dose-related increase in sleepiness at higher exposures [^115GkfTN]. In contrast, a Cochrane review of melatonin for shift workers using 1–10 mg did not find a dose–response effect on sleep outcomes, suggesting that within that 1–10 mg range, higher doses did not consistently outperform lower doses for sleep length or latency, which tempers the idea of a linear hypnotic dose–response across all contexts [^114G6X9i].

> I should double-check pharmacokinetic plausibility, because higher doses could prolong exposure and spill into the next day. In older adults, 3 mg produced supraphysiological plasma levels persisting into daylight hours and induced hypothermia, which can itself promote sleepiness; this pharmacokinetic tail raises a biologically plausible mechanism for next-day drowsiness with higher doses, especially when clearance is slower or timing is suboptimal [^115Vg1nV]. In ICU cohorts, 10 mg immediate-release dosing has been associated with elevated morning concentrations and potential "hangover", reinforcing the concern that higher doses can yield daytime melatonin levels that may impair alertness or counteract circadian alignment if mistimed [^116GoUUF] [^113zKhcQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance without checking guideline positions. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against melatonin for primary insomnia due to weak efficacy, and European guidance advises avoiding fast-release melatonin for insomnia without circadian factors, reflecting limited benefit and potential next-day effects at conventional doses; these positions indirectly caution that escalating dose does not reliably translate into clinically meaningful improvements in sleepiness or sleep quality in typical insomnia presentations [^114bcEeT] [^113n9rBs]. For circadian indications, AASM supports strategically timed, often lower-dose melatonin, underscoring that timing and intent (chronobiotic vs hypnotic) drive outcomes more than sheer dose escalation [^115Atcni] [^111npaXj].

> I need to check pediatric and neurodevelopmental data, because clinicians often ask whether higher doses are "more sedating" in children. In children with neurodevelopmental disorders, melatonin improved sleep onset latency and total sleep time with low starting doses, and many children responded to 0.5–1 mg; higher doses were sometimes used, but there was no clear dose–response advantage for sedation, and adverse events were generally mild and not clearly dose related in the RCTs, though non-serious adverse events were more frequent than placebo in some pediatric meta-analyses [^113rTn6s] [^116t7zYB] [^112ZcW42]. This suggests that, in pediatrics, escalation beyond 3–6 mg rarely adds hypnotic benefit and may increase morning sleepiness without clear gains [^1144XMvG].

> Next, I should review condition-specific contexts where higher doses are used, to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. In REM sleep behavior disorder, immediate-release melatonin is recommended starting at 3 mg with titration up to 15 mg; morning sleepiness is a recognized adverse effect, indicating that higher doses can indeed increase next-day drowsiness even when they help nocturnal behaviors, so clinicians should titrate to the lowest effective dose and monitor morning sedation [^111WujVZ] [^116dWWNL] [^116sm4oV]. In ICU settings, higher nightly doses have been linked to supraphysiologic morning levels and potential "hangover", prompting interest in 1–2 mg immediate-release or physiologic dosing strategies to minimize daytime exposure and circadian disruption [^116GoUUF] [^113zKhcQ].

> But wait, what if the user's real question is practical: what dose minimizes next-day sleepiness while still helping sleep? Let me reconsider the balance of evidence. For circadian phase disorders, low-dose melatonin (0.3–1 mg) given several hours before DLMO is more likely to advance rhythms without causing morning drowsiness, whereas higher doses given late may blunt or delay phase advances and leave residual daytime melatonin that can promote sleepiness; for direct hypnotic effect when needed, 2–5 mg timed 30–60 minutes before bedtime is reasonable, with careful attention to formulation and individual clearance, and doses above 10 mg rarely add benefit and may increase adverse effects including drowsiness [^117WvapF] [^111npaXj] [^115GkfTN]. Prolonged-release 2 mg has modest evidence for sleep efficiency in older adults, but its extended release profile can extend exposure into the morning, so clinicians should monitor for next-day sedation and consider immediate-release formulations if morning sleepiness emerges [^1178mumb] [^11395E55].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, higher-dose melatonin, particularly ≥ 10 mg, is associated with a higher risk of drowsiness and related adverse effects than lower doses, and pharmacokinetic data show that higher doses can yield morning supraphysiological levels that plausibly cause next-day sleepiness. However, within the 1–5 mg range, the relationship between dose and sleepiness is inconsistent across studies, and clinical benefits on sleep latency or total sleep time plateau without a clear dose–response for sedation, so escalation beyond 5–10 mg seldom helps and may increase morning impairment [^115GkfTN] [^115Vg1nV] [^114G6X9i] [^114q2Cuw]. Clinically, I would start low (0.5–3 mg), time the dose appropriately to the intended effect (chronobiotic vs hypnotic), and titrate cautiously while screening for morning drowsiness, preferring lower, well-timed doses to mitigate daytime sleepiness risk [^117WvapF] [^111npaXj].

---

High-dose melatonin does not consistently increase sleepiness compared to low-dose; both can cause drowsiness, but the risk is **dose-related** and higher with larger amounts [^115GkfTN]. Low doses (0.5–3 mg) are usually sufficient for sleep onset and circadian effects [^116As1Qu], whereas higher doses (≥ 10 mg) may cause more next-day drowsiness, especially if mistimed or in sensitive individuals [^115GkfTN]. Clinical guidelines recommend starting with low doses and titrating cautiously to minimize daytime sleepiness and other adverse effects [^116o6SY5].

## Pharmacological mechanisms underlying melatonin-induced sleepiness

Melatonin acts on MT1 and MT2 receptors to **regulate circadian rhythms and sleep propensity** [^113eiGyB] [^11174LoH]. Low doses (0.5–3 mg) mimic physiologic levels and support circadian alignment, whereas higher doses (≥ 10 mg) can cause supraphysiologic peaks that may increase sedation and next-day drowsiness, particularly if mistimed [^116As1Qu] [^116GoUUF] [^115GkfTN] [^117TYShh].

---

## Clinical evidence on dose-dependent sleepiness

### Low-dose melatonin (0.5–3 mg)

- **Circadian effects**: Low doses are effective for circadian alignment and sleep onset without significant next-day drowsiness [^111ixBqP] [^116As1Qu].
- **Safety**: Low doses are generally well tolerated, with minimal daytime sleepiness when properly timed [^116d9euT].
- **Guidelines**: Recommended for circadian disorders and as initial therapy for sleep onset difficulties [^115Atcni].

---

### High-dose melatonin (≥ 10 mg)

- **Sedation**: Higher doses can increase sedation and next-day drowsiness, especially if taken late or in sensitive individuals [^1131meH5] [^115GkfTN].
- **Adverse effects**: More frequent drowsiness, headache, and dizziness are reported with higher doses [^115GkfTN].
- **Limited benefit**: Higher doses do not consistently improve sleep outcomes over lower doses and may increase adverse effects [^114G6X9i] [^115GkfTN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize starting with low doses (0.5–3 mg) and titrating cautiously to balance efficacy and tolerability [^116o6SY5]. For circadian disorders, low-dose, well-timed melatonin is preferred; higher doses are reserved for specific indications and require careful monitoring for daytime sleepiness [^117TYShh] [^115GkfTN].

---

## Individual patient factors influencing melatonin-induced sleepiness

Several factors modulate susceptibility to melatonin-related drowsiness:

| **Factor** | **Influence on sleepiness** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults may experience more pronounced drowsiness due to altered pharmacokinetics [^notfound] |
| Metabolism | Slow metabolizers may have prolonged melatonin exposure, increasing drowsiness risk [^114aTEzz] |
| Comorbidities | Neurological or psychiatric conditions may heighten sensitivity to melatonin-induced sedation [^notfound] |
| Concomitant medications | Sedatives, hypnotics, or CYP1A2 inhibitors can amplify melatonin's sedative effects [^notfound] |

---

## Summary of evidence

Low-dose melatonin (0.5–3 mg) is effective for sleep onset and circadian alignment with minimal next-day drowsiness, whereas high-dose melatonin (≥ 10 mg) may increase sedation and next-day sleepiness without consistent added benefit. Clinicians should start low, time doses appropriately, and monitor for daytime impairment, especially in older adults, slow metabolizers, or those on interacting medications [^111npaXj] [^115GkfTN].

---

High-dose melatonin can cause more sleepiness than low-dose, but the effect is **not linear** and depends on timing, individual factors, and formulation. Low doses are generally sufficient and better tolerated; reserve higher doses for select cases and monitor for daytime drowsiness [^115GkfTN].

Melatonin is known to be effective in improving sleep in pediatric patients affected by neurological and psychiatric conditions. However, no guidelines exist advising the most effective treatment schedule. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify the dose, time of administration and treatment duration associated with the maximal treatment efficacy. The systematic search, conducted across multiple databases following PRISMA guidelines and including studies published up to April 30, 2024, yielded 21 studies. Mean differences in sleep-related variables between the treatment and the placebo group were considered as study outcomes. Dose-response curves and meta-regression models were fitted to test the effect of treatment-related parameters. Melatonin significantly reduced Sleep onset latency and increased Sleep efficiency and Total sleep time. Sleep onset latency reduction was associated with an advancement in the time between administration with respect to bedtime, while increased Sleep efficiency and Total sleep time with longer treatment durations. Melatonin reached the maximal efficacy between 2 and 4 mg/day. Our results suggest a dose and time of administration that may enhance melatonin's sleep promoting effects (2–4 mg, 3 h before bedtime) and, if replicated by large clinical trials, could guide clinical practice in managing sleep disturbances in children experiencing neuropsychiatric conditions.

Melatonin — safety profile and long-term data indicate formulation variability and generally few serious harms. "Melatonin is considered a dietary supplement, and is therefore not subject to the scrutiny afforded to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications", and "Formulations that are United States Pharmacopeial Convention Verified can be considered most reliable in this regard". CRSWD-specific harms are limited, and "In general, melatonin is associated with a lack of reported serious adverse effects". A National Academy of Sciences review "stated that short-term use of ≤ 10 mg/daily (higher than typical chronobiotic doses) appears to be safe in healthy adults", with additional cautions including that "caution is advised when prescribing to patients taking warfarin" and that "A recent publication described impairment in glucose tolerance among healthy women subsequent to acute melatonin administration". Controlled data show that a randomized trial of a "28-day treatment with 10 mg melatonin… revealed no group differences with respect to adverse effects", and a meta-analysis of controlled trials "(n = 10 studies, over 800 subjects) used for ≤ 3 months" reported "few reports of adverse events". Pediatric and neurodevelopmental data include DSWPD with ADHD where melatonin "doses up to 10 mg (mean follow-up time of approximately 4 years) detected no serious adverse events… and 65% of participants continued to use the medication", and subjects with neurodevelopmental disabilities comorbid with DSWPD who received controlled-release melatonin "(max dose 15 mg) up to 3.8 years similarly described no adverse events".

Light and melatonin in CRSWDs — timing principles state that light is timed by phase response curves (PRCs), with light in the evening before the core body temperature minimum (CBTmin) producing phase delays and light in the early morning producing phase advances; the human circadian system is most sensitive to short wavelength blue light (~480 nm). The melatonin phase response curve is approximately 180 degrees out of phase with the light PRC, so afternoon/evening dosing shifts rhythms earlier and morning dosing shifts rhythms later; dosing for circadian effects remains unclear, and studies suggest timing is more important than dose, with PRCs for doses above 5 mg not published.

ADHD

Sleep and circadian rhythm abnormalities in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have frequently been reported, as reviewed by Martinez-Cayuelas et al. and Bondopadhyay et al. Daytime and nocturnal activities were increased, and the post-lunch dip in alertness was absent. Melatonin levels in ADHD were higher or delayed as compared to those in healthy controls, as reviewed recently. The delayed sleep–wake phase disorder was frequently reported in patients with ADHD.

A recent systematic review summarized findings from 5 RCTs in ADHD and concluded that exogenous melatonin administration can shorten sleep latencies and increase total sleep durations in ADHD. Most of the studies included in the Rzepka-Migut and Paprocka review used a relatively high dosage, ranging from 3 to 10 mg. Again, considering that the delay in melatonin rhythm may be a target problem in ADHD, it seems necessary to advance the circadian rhythm with a low dose of melatonin. A recent RCT examined the effects of melatonin monotherapy or melatonin with bright light therapy in adult ADHD patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome. In this study, 0.5 mg melatonin for 3 weeks significantly advanced the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) compared to placebo. This study also reported that melatonin supplements may be more useful when used in conjunction with bright light therapy.

### Melatonin for sleep problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders: randomised double masked placebo controlled trial [^116t7zYB]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In children with neurodevelopmental disorders and sleep problems, immediate release melatonin was found to be more effective than placebo in increasing total sleep time and reducing sleep onset latency. In this randomised double masked placebo controlled trial, adverse effects were few, mild in degree, and distributed equally between the two groups with no increase in, or new onset of, epileptic seizures. Total sleep time increased by an average of 23 minutes and sleep onset latency reduced by an average of 38 minutes.

Relation to other studies

Several systematic reviews have aimed to determine the effect of melatonin on sleep parameters (table 9). The inclusion criteria of the systematic reviews vary as do the conclusions regarding the effect of melatonin, from definitive absence of effectto evidence of effect, and emphasising the need for large confirmatory randomised controlled trials.

The trials included within each meta-analysis were heterogeneous in terms of populations of patients and the dose, time, and durations of study treatments. Of methodological concern are the number of small trials, suspicions of outcome reporting biaswithin the trials, and the use of a crossover design, the suitability of which has been questioned because of the impact on the circadian timing system outlasting drug washout periods.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia [^11582SHN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia, through identification and analysis of all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, in March 2013 and again in March 2016, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions, as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results from the included study reports. We obtained additional information from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found six RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (222 participants, four studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study), and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, limited information available). The participants in the trazodone study and almost all participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the evidence was at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting, some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties, and a high risk of selective reporting in one trial that contributed very few participants. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting. We found no evidence that melatonin, at doses up to 10 mg, improved any major sleep outcome over 8 to 10 weeks in patients with AD who were identified as having a sleep disturbance. We were able to synthesize data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (mean difference (MD) 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; N = 184; two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; N = 184; two studies). From single studies, we found no difference between melatonin and placebo groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, or number of night-time awakenings. From two studies, we found no effect of melatonin on cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADL). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. We considered this evidence to be of low quality. There was low-quality evidence that trazodone 50 mg given at night for two weeks improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; N = 30; one study), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; N = 30; one study) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, but it did not affect the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; N = 30; one study), or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; N = 30; one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, cognition, or ADL. No serious adverse effects of trazodone were reported. Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Because the data were from a single, small study and reporting was incomplete, we considered this evidence to be of low quality in general terms. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural, or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects from ramelteon.

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in dementia, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin (up to 10mg) helped sleep problems in patients with moderate to severe dementia due to AD. There was some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in dementia. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.

Adverse Effects of Melatonin

Melatonin is generally regarded as safe and well-tolerated, notably, as compared to other treatment options, especially benzodiazepines or other hypnotics. A recent systematic review identified 37 RCTs in which the most frequently reported adverse events were daytime sleepiness (1.66%), headache (0.74%), other sleep-related adverse events (0.74%), dizziness (0.74%), and hypothermia (0.62%). Very few adverse events being serious or of clinical significance were reported. These included agitation, fatigue, mood swings, nightmares, skin irritation, and palpitations. Most adverse events either resolved spontaneously within a few days with no adjustment for the dosage of melatonin, or immediately after the withdrawal. However, there are very few studies that specifically examine the safety of melatonin use in those aged 65 years or over.

Based on limited evidence, even a large dose of melatonin appears to have a good safety profile. A recent systematic review on RCTs investigating high-dose melatonin (≥ 10 mg) in adults over 30 years of age was included. In total, 79 RCTs were identified with a total of 3861 participants. Overall, only four studies met the pre-specified low risk of bias criteria for meta-analysis. In that small subset, melatonin did not cause a detectable increase in severe adverse events (rate ratio = 0.88 [0.52, 1.50]) or withdrawals due to adverse events (0.93 [0.24, 3.56]), but it did appear to increase the risk of adverse events such as drowsiness, headache, and dizziness (1.40 [1.15, 1.69]). Based on the long-term clinical studies in children, exogenous melatonin was safe and did not associate with delays in growth or puberty, or tolerance. We were unable to identify RCT reports on the prevalence of adverse effects in psychiatric disorders.

### Practice guideline: treatment for insomnia and disrupted sleep behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116o6SY5]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Melatonin use in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — clinician guidance states that clinicians should offer melatonin to children and adolescents with ASD if behavioral strategies have not been helpful and contributing coexisting conditions and use of concomitant medications have been addressed (Level B). For product quality, clinicians offering melatonin for sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with ASD should write a prescription for melatonin or recommend using a high-purity pharmaceutical grade of melatonin when available (Level B). For dosing, clinicians offering melatonin for sleep dysregulation in children and adolescents with ASD should start by initiating a low dose (1–3 mg/d), 30–60 minutes before bedtime, and titrate to effect, not exceeding 10 mg/d (Level B). Safety counseling is also specified: clinicians offering melatonin for sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with ASD should counsel children and adolescents with ASD and sleep disturbance (as appropriate) and their parents regarding potential adverse events of melatonin use and the lack of long-term safety data (Level B).

### Use of melatonin in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical recommendation [^113LRHxX]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Melatonin prescriptions for children and adolescents have increased substantially during the last decade. Existing clinical recommendations focus on melatonin as a treatment for insomnia related to neurodevelopmental disorders. To help guide clinical decision-making, we aimed to construct a recommendation on the use of melatonin in children and adolescents aged 5–20 years with idiopathic chronic insomnia.

Methods

A systematic search for guidelines, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCT) were performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Guidelines International Network, Trip Database, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European Sleep Research Society and Scandinavian Health Authorities databases. A search for adverse events in otherwise healthy children and adolescents was also performed. The latest search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and adverse events was performed on March 18, 2023. The latest search for RCTs was performed on to February 6, 2023. The language was restricted to English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Eligible participants were children and adolescents (5–20 years of age) with idiopathic chronic insomnia, in whom sleep hygiene practices have been inadequate and melatonin was tested. There were no restrictions on dosage, duration of treatment, time of consumption, or release formula. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness, quality of life, all-cause dropouts, and non-serious adverse events. Outcomes were assessed at different time points to assess short-term and long-term effects. Meta-analysis was performed using inverse variance random-effects model and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. If possible, funnel plots would be constructed to investigate publication bias. Heterogeneity was calculated via I 2 statistics. A multidisciplinary guideline panel formulated the recommendation according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The certainty of evidence was considered either high, moderate, low or very low depending on the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias. The evidence-to-decision framework was subsequently used to discuss the feasibility and acceptance of the constructed recommendation alongside the impact on resources and equity. The protocol is registered with the Danish Health Authority.

We included eight RCTs with 419 children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia. Melatonin led to a moderate increase in total sleep time by 30.33 min (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.96–41.70, 4 studies, I² = 0%) and a moderate reduction in sleep latency by 18.03 min (95% CI −26.61 to −9.44, 3 studies, I² = 0%), both as assessed by sleep diary. No other beneficial effects were found. None of the studies provided information on serious adverse events, yet the number of participants experiencing non-serious adverse events was increased (Relative risk 3.44, 95% CI 1.25–9.42, 4 studies, I² = 0%). Funnel plots were not constructed due to the low number of studies. The certainty of evidence was very low on the quality of sleep and low for daytime functioning.

Interpretation

Evidence of very low certainty shows that benefits are limited and unwanted events are likely when melatonin is used to treat otherwise healthy children and adolescents with chronic insomnia. Melatonin should never be the first choice of treatment for this particular population, yet carefully monitored short-term use may be considered if sleep hygiene practices and non-pharmacological interventions have proven inadequate, and only if daytime function is compromised.

### Melatonin therapy to improve nocturnal sleep in critically ill patients: encouraging results from a small randomised controlled trial [^116GoUUF]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Nocturnal sleep quantity in patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation is highly compromised.

- Melatonin therapy may increase nocturnal sleep quantity, but further investigation using continuous polysomnography is necessary to provide sleep quality information.

- A 10-mg dose of melatonin produces supraphysiological morning plasma levels in critical care patients, possibly negating some of the phase-advancing effects of nocturnal administration.

- Immediate-release doses of 1 to 2 mg administered at 9 p.m. might provide suitable nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations whilst minimising the risk of daytime overdose.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^11174LoH]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

When compared to clonazepam, melatonin has a much safer profile with no reports of dependence, along with fewer and milder side effects, which include headache and morning sleepiness. Melatonin has, therefore, been proposed as a preferable treatment for RBD, especially for older patients and/or those who have OSA, neurodegenerative conditions, are at higher risk of experiencing side effects, or are considered refractory to the effects of clonazepam.

Melatonin is a natural hormone that is predominantly synthesized in the pineal gland and promotes sleep propensity across the brain. Endogenous melatonin secretion is tightly regulated by photic cues received by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is the major circadian oscillator. Melatonin secretion reduces with ageing and thus, low dosages (0.3–1 mg) of exogenous melatonin may help to coordinate circadian rhythms when administered in a specifically timed manner. This may be of particular interest to people with PD, who experience circadian dysregulation and have altered peak melatonin concentration levels. The soporific effect of acutely administering higher dosages (2–25 mg) of melatonin at night-time has further been shown to improve sleep efficiency and may help reduce secondary sleep disorders, including RBD, whereby its chronobiotic effect may correct the timing, amount, and quality of REM sleep when administration is timed correctly. There is also indication of melatonin reducing the amount of RWA in patients with RBD. Melatonin has a short (30–50 min) elimination half-life, which lessens 'hang-over' effects the following morning. Due to its short half-life, however, the effectiveness of melatonin might be suboptimal for the majority of REM sleep periods that occur in the second part of the night. A prolonged release formulation that releases melatonin gradually over 8–10 h (Neurim Pharmaceuticals Inc.: Circadin) has, therefore, been proposed for treating RBD.

### Use of melatonin in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical recommendation [^112ZcW42]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, melatonin has a moderate effect on sleep continuity parameters, without having an impact on more personal-perceived outcomes. The use of melatonin should never be first choice of treatment for otherwise healthy children and adolescents with chronic insomnia. However, given the potential negative impact of continuous sleep problems, melatonin may be administered in special cases and only for a short period of time. The limited benefits of melatonin, the likelihood of non-serious adverse events and what may constitute realistic magnitudes of effect has to be discussed prior to initiating treatment.

The strengths of the current review include transparent methods adhering to PRISMA guidelines, Cochrane collaboration and the GRADE approach. The work is based on a pre-specified protocol, formulated by a multidisciplinary guideline panel and pre-registered at the Danish Health Authority. The search is based on a systematic and comprehensive search strategy. Selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment have been done independently by duplicate reviewers. Limitations include restriction to English and Scandinavian languages. This was done to avoid any misinterpretation of results published in another foreign language. It is not known whether there may be additional relevant studies published in other languages. Reviewers were not being blinded during selection of studies, as this was not possible with the current software and since evaluation of the full text was mandated to assess the eligibility of the study for inclusion. Authors of the included studies were not contacted for further information and grey literature was not considered for inclusion. Assessment of title and abstract was only done by one reviewer. Amendments to the pre-registered protocol were inclusion of studies in which sleep hygiene had not been tested prior to initiation of the trial. We were not able to evaluate the frequency of adverse events as initially planned, due to limitations in the reporting of data. Due to lack of data, we were not able to evaluate the pre-specified outcomes following 3–6 months of treatment. Daytime functioning was only assessed using parent-rated questionnaires and not by a clinician as initially pre-specified. The age range in our pre-specified protocol was 5–20 years, whereas the included studies assessed children and adolescents aged 6–19 years. We do however believe that the current evidence is still representative of our pre-specified age range, and thus no amendments in regards to this were made. Our cut-off values used in the subgroup analysis investigating dosage effects (below/above 5 mg) were chosen post-hoc. As such, these cut-off values are based on what data was available in the identified literature, and thus do not per se reflect any clinical, scientific or theoretical reason of choice.

### Melatonin for rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease: a randomised controlled trial [^115wsSvZ]. Movement Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) causes a loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep, leading to dream enactment behaviors that are frequently injurious to patients and their partners. 1 Its prevalence in adults is around 1%, 1 compared to 20% to 50% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). 2, 3

Treatment includes clonazepam or melatonin. 3, 4 Clonazepam is a long‐acting benzodiazepine linked to adverse outcomes, 3, 4 whereas its efficacy for reducing RBD in PD was recently challenged. 5 Melatonin has a safer profile with milder side effects, such as headache and morning sleepiness. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 Melatonin has a 30‐ to 50‐minute elimination half‐life. 10 A prolonged‐release (PR) formulation has thus been recommended for RBD, given that most REM sleep occurs later in the night. 11

However, current guidelines are based on mainly case series and small open‐label studies. 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Only one previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessed the efficacy of 3 mg of melatonin in just 8 subjects with mixed neurological disorders, showing a modest improvement on the clinical global impression (CGI) and REM epochs without atonia. 8 However, another small RCT recently showed that 2 (n = 7) or 6 mg (n = 9) of PR melatonin did not improve CGI versus placebo (n = 9) in subjects with clinically isolated RBD. 17 No RCT has been conducted for RBD in PD. Moreover, there is need of an RBD‐specific outcome that is free from subjective interpretation by study assessors. 4

We set out to assess the efficacy of 4 mg of PR melatonin on RBD severity using patient‐reported diary entries. We hypothesized that melatonin would reduce RBD compared to placebo.

### Melatonin for prevention of delirium in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit: a multiarm multistage adaptive randomized controlled clinical trial (DEMEL) [^114XB7ye]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the dose of melatonin with an optimal pharmacokinetic profile and to test whether this dose reduces the prevalence of delirium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients as compared to placebo.

Methods

DEMEL, a multicenter adaptive phase 2b/3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial included patients at 20 health centers in France from February 1st, 2019 through January 5th, 2021. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either placebo or low (0.3 mg) or high (3 mg) dose melatonin enterally at 9:00 p.m. for 14 consecutive nights or until death or ICU discharge, whichever came first. The interim primary endpoint (activity stage) was the percentage of patients who achieved an optimal melatonin pharmacokinetic profile 24 h after starting study treatment; the final primary endpoint (efficacy phase) was the percentage of patients who experienced delirium between randomization and day 14 (or until death or ICU discharge, whichever came first). Delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU.

Results

We randomized 355 patients and included 334 in the primary analysis. At the preplanned analysis of the activity stage performed in 75 patients, the low-dose melatonin group had the highest rate of optimal pharmacokinetic profiles (12/24, 50%) when compared with the high-dose melatonin group (6/25, 24%) and the placebo group (0/26). Therefore, the Steering Committee recommended that the high-dose melatonin group be discontinued and that the low-dose melatonin group be selected to continue in the efficacy phase along with the placebo group. At the end of the efficacy stage, there was no difference in the final primary outcome of delirium incidence between the low-dose melatonin group and the placebo group: 80/147 (54.4%) vs 85/154 (55.2%), risk ratio, 0.986 [95% CI 0.803 to 1.211]; key secondary outcomes were also similar between groups. These included sleep quality, delirium-free, coma-free, and ventilator-free days at day 28; ICU and hospital length of stay; mortality at day 28, in the ICU, and in hospital; as well as long-term outcomes such as quality of life and postintensive care syndrome at day 90.

Conclusions

This randomized clinical trial found that the low-dose of melatonin (0.3 mg nightly) achieved a better pharmacokinetic profile than the high-dose (3 mg nightly), but did not change the incidence of delirium compared to placebo in mechanically ventilated critically-ill patients.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^111WujVZ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Melatonin for isolated RBD — mechanism, dose, and availability: Melatonin binds to the M1 and M2 receptors, suppressing REM sleep motor tone and normalizing other circadian features of REM sleep. Melatonin dosing in isolated RBD is usually 3 mg taken at bedtime. Melatonin is considered a dietary supplement and is available over the counter in the United States and Canada. Melatonin requires a prescription in the European Union and the United Kingdom.

### Melatonin for prevention of delirium in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit: a multiarm multistage adaptive randomized controlled clinical trial (DEMEL) [^113V2QKM]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations. First, we investigated only two dose regimens of melatonin; an even lower dose could theoretically be of interest to better mimic the normal physiological circadian rhythm of melatonin, as the 0.3 mg nightly dose did not achieve the optimal pharmacologic profile in half of the cases. It remains unclear whether an agonist with greater selectivity for the MT1 receptor, such as ramelteon, may offer superior clinical benefits (particularly through improved effects on sleep-onset difficulties) as compared to melatonin. Second, the intervention was limited to 14 days. Whether longer exposure to melatonin might influence its efficacy needs to be investigated; however, delirium typically occurs within the first days of ICU stay. Third, the overall high use of physical restraints (> 80%) may have affected the intervention's impact on the outcome. Fourth, some delirium assessments were missing, but > 96% of time points were assessed. Fifth, sleep assessments made by patients and nurses are inherently subjective and prone to variability, and may differ significantly from objective measurements of sleep, such as those obtained through polysomnography. In addition, the sample size was calculated based on an estimated 30% incidence of delirium by day 14, derived from available literature and institutional data at the time. However, the actual incidence observed was closer to 50%, similar to that reported in other recent RCTs. A substantial decrease in the number of patients included in the final analysis was also observed and as the study population was limited to mechanically ventilated patients with an expected ICU stay of more than 48 h, the generalizability of our findings to other ICU populations may be limited. Of note, the prespecified selection process based on the pharmacokinetic profile during the activity stage was ultimately consistent with the results observed at the efficacy stage, with numerically higher rates of ICU delirium in the high-dose melatonin group (66.7%) compared to the low-dose (54.4%) and control groups (56.0%). These findings align with those of a recent large RCT evaluating a comparable high dose (4 mg), which also found no effect on the prevention of ICU delirium. Given the large number of secondary outcomes assessed, the results should be interpreted as exploratory. Reported p values are unadjusted and are presented for descriptive purposes, with the aim of generating hypotheses and informing future research. Finally, the long-term follow-up assessing postintensive care syndrome and health-related quality of life did not include cognitive function, which could be altered by melatonin treatment.

### Melatonin for sleep problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders: randomised double masked placebo controlled trial [^113rTn6s]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results for dim light melatonin onset were disappointing. If samples are taken regularly for a 24 hour period the onset should be measurable, whenever it occurs. For practical reasons, however, it is common in paediatric populations to take five swabs before bedtime. It is therefore possible to "miss" an onset that precedes sampling or occurs when sampling has finished. Some of the contamination and high baseline values in the melatonin arm could reflect children who are poor metabolisers and whose concentrations of exogenous melatonin had accumulated during the study; however, it might also reflect that the dose of melatonin was not actually omitted on the two nights as required in the protocol.

Only low doses of melatonin are required to alter the sleep phase in typically developing children, and, in this study, there was support for starting treatment with a low dose of melatonin with 18% of children needing only 0.5 mg melatonin. Although high doses might usefully promote the sedative action of melatonin in some children with neurodevelopmental disorders, this might not be the case for slow metabolisers of melatonin.

Measures of child behaviour and family quality of life tended to favour melatonin but were not significant. There are several possible explanations for this, including the possibility that our measures were not sensitive enough over this time period. We speculate that this might also be because of the relatively minor effect melatonin had on total sleep time across this study.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114RtwdR]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Melatonin for chronic insomnia in adults — The overall quality of evidence was downgraded to very low due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and industry sponsorship, and meta-analysis for adverse events was not possible with no clinically significant differences versus placebo reported. Rebound or withdrawal effects were generally not seen, with one possible exception in which Haimov found a marginally significant difference in sleep efficiency between an active phase of two month, 1 mg sustained-release melatonin and a withdrawal period. The task force concluded there was weak evidence against clinically significant efficacy for sleep onset insomnia, judged benefits to moderately exceed potential harms, and determined that a majority of patients would likely use melatonin compared to no treatment based on its availability and perceived benign profile.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^111TUXob]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria (PICO question)

The population included children and adolescents aged 2–20 years with chronic insomnia due to underlying disorders, and where sleep hygiene practices were inadequate. The diagnosis of chronic insomnia refers to the diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder found in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, version 3 (ICSD-3), which includes repeated difficulties with maintaining — or initiating sleep, or issues with the duration or quality of sleep despite adequate circumstances to obtain sleep. These issues should be present for at least 3 months, at least 3 times a week and result in issues with daytime functioning. In accordance with ICSD-3, insomnia symptoms may be seen both in the presence or absence of an underlying medical–or mental condition. From a clinical point of view, treating insomnia in patients with underlying conditions can be especially challenging due to a complex symptom profile and use of concomitant medications and thus treatment is often warranted in specialised medical facilities. To provide a clinical recommendation for these patients, we here chose to include studies investigating the use of melatonin in children and adolescents who displayed chronic insomnia as a secondary symptom to an underlying condition in accordance with the definition provided by ICSD-3. Patients presenting with idiopathic insomnia or with a sleep disorder, such as sleep-related breathing disorders and sleep-related movement disorders, were not considered for inclusion. Participants with insomnia attributed entirely to autism spectrum disorders or ADHD were also excluded, as melatonin is an approved treatment for these conditions and thus recommendations on the use of melatonin in these patients already exist. Studies on neurodevelopmental disorders were included if the number of participants with autism or ADHD was < 30%. This cut-off was based on expert opinions by the guideline panel, and chosen as it was considered a sufficiently low level by which the population could not be considered to primarily represent either ADHD or autism. The intervention was melatonin, with no restrictions on dosage, treatment length, release formula or time of administration. The comparison was no treatment or treatment with any non-pharmacological intervention. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events, assessed at 2–4 weeks following treatment. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness/sleepiness, quality of life, non-serious adverse events and all-cause dropouts, all assessed at 2–4 weeks following treatment as well as quality of sleep and daytime functioning, assessed after 3–6 months of treatment. Assessment of long-term consequences will be published separately. We did not a priori make any requirements on how outcomes were to be assessed.

### Melatonin therapy to improve nocturnal sleep in critically ill patients: encouraging results from a small randomised controlled trial [^113zKhcQ]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

We also found no association between markers of drug exposure and nocturnal sleep quantity. The soporific and entraining effects of melatonin have been shown to reach a plateau at plasma concentrations lower than those described in our patients. Therefore, having plasma concentrations in excess of the dose-dependent range would not be expected to demonstrate further improvements in sleep efficiency. The ideal dosing schedule of melatonin would produce an appropriate rapid peak plasma concentration while maintaining 'physiological' plasma levels over the nocturnal period. Our patients were unable to receive a modified release formulation, being fed via enteral feeding tubes, and hence we used a relatively large immediate-release formulation to ensure continuous nocturnal exposure. As described by others, the administered dose resulted in some patients with relatively low clearance having potentially 'nocturnal' plasma levels during the late morning. This may have negated some of the potential chronotherapeutic benefits of melatonin. The presence of supraphysiological levels in the morning will have a phase-delaying effect and thereby negate some of the benefits of the phase-advancing effect of the 9 p.m. administration. However, we did not find an inverse correlation between nocturnal sleep markers and melatonin plasma concentration at 8 a.m. as might therefore be expected. Our pharmacokinetic data suggest that immediate-release doses of 1 to 2 mg administered at 9 a.m. might provide suitable nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations whilst minimising the risk of daytime overdose.

### Effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep: a meta-analysis [^115sZ44K]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Exogenous melatonin reportedly induces drowsiness and sleep, and may ameliorate sleep disturbances, including the nocturnal awakenings associated with old age. However, existing studies on the soporific efficacy of melatonin have been highly heterogeneous in regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria, measures to evaluate insomnia, doses of the medication, and routes of administration. We reviewed and analyzed (by meta-analysis) available information on effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep. A MEDLINE search (1980 to December 2003) provided English-language articles, supplemented by personal files maintained by the authors. The analysis used information derived from 17 different studies (involving 284 subjects) that satisfied inclusion criteria. Sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, and sleep efficiency were selected as the outcome measures. The study effect size was taken to be the difference between the response on placebo and the mean response on melatonin for each outcome measured. Melatonin treatment significantly reduced sleep onset latency by 4.0 min (95% CI 2.5, 5.4); increased sleep efficiency by 2.2% (95% CI 0.2, 4.2), and increased total sleep duration by 12.8 min (95% CI 2.9, 22.8). Since 15 of the 17 studies enrolled healthy subjects or people with no relevant medical condition other than insomnia, the analysis was also done including only these 15 studies. The sleep onset results were changed to 3.9 min (95% CI (2.5, 5.4)); sleep efficiency increased to 3.1% (95% CI (0.7, 5.5)); sleep duration increased to 13.7 min (95% CI (3.1, 24.3)).

### Role of melatonin in the management of sleep and circadian disorders in the context of psychiatric illness [^116ZpZzi]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Consideration of Melatonin Usage in the Context of Psychiatric Illness

Sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunctions have been reported in all psychiatric disorders, but specific parameters which point them out differ from disorder to disorder. Knowledge on sleep and circadian parameters in some disorders such as bipolar disorders and neurocognitive disorders is robust, and more fragmentary in others, such as eating disorders. Knowledge on the individual-level dynamic changes in specific parameters over time and in relation to current symptom profiles is very limited.

The abnormalities of sleep and circadian rhythms are an essential therapeutic target for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Commonly used psychoactive agents are not sufficient as such to correct but commonly even worsen problems with circadian rhythm. We consider melatonin and melatonergic compounds to be the most promising existing complementary therapeutic compounds to correct abnormalities of sleep and circadian rhythms. However, the number of well-designed trials to prove the efficacy of melatonin supplementation for the correction of sleep and rhythm dysregulation in psychiatric disorders is too limited to consider melatonin as an evidence-based treatment option. As summarized in this review, fragmentary data provides sufficient support for our proposal that the complementary use of exogenous melatonin in psychiatric disorders warrants well-designed future trials.

To maximize the efficacy of melatonin, it is necessary to check whether the dosage and dosing time of melatonin are used properly according to abnormalities of sleep and circadian rhythms. Our recent meta-analysis study showed that low-dose melatonin (≤ 1 mg) may be more effective at initiating sleep. Low-dosage melatonin such as 0.3 mg and 1 mg showed significant effects on shortening SOL, while relatively high-dosage melatonin such as 2 mg and 5 mg did not show a significant effect on SOL. Meanwhile, high-dosage melatonin 5 mg significantly increased sleep efficiency. As shown in Fig. 1, low-dose melatonin can sufficiently advance the phase of sleep and circadian rhythms as a chronobiotic agent. High-dose melatonin can efficiently show the soporific effects such as improving sleep efficiency and increasing total sleep time.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^116Ypnw4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Melatonin has become a widely used sleeping aid for young individuals currently not included in existing guidelines. The aim was to develop a recommendation on the use of melatonin in children and adolescents aged 2–20 years, with chronic insomnia due to disorders beyond indication.

Methods

We performed a systematic search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomised trials (RCTs) in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Guidelines International Network, Trip Database, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European Sleep Research Society and Scandinavian Health Authorities databases. A separate search for adverse events was also performed. The latest search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and adverse events was performed on March 17, 2023. The latest search for RCTs was performed on to February 6, 2023. The language was restricted to English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Eligible participants were children and adolescents (2–20 years of age) with chronic insomnia due to underlying disorders, in whom sleep hygiene practices have been inadequate and melatonin was tested. Studies exclusively on autism spectrum disorders or attention deficit hyperactive disorder were excluded. There were no restrictions on dosage, duration of treatment, time of consumption or release formula. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events, assessed at 2–4 weeks post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness, quality of life, non-serious adverse events, and all-cause dropouts (assessed at 2–4 weeks post-treatment), plus quality of sleep and daytime functioning (assessed at 3–6 months post-treatment). Pooled estimates were calculated using inverse variance random effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using I 2 statistics. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. A multidisciplinary guideline panel constructed the recommendation using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The certainty of evidence was considered either high, moderate, low or very low depending on the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias. The evidence-to-decision framework was used to discuss the feasibility and acceptance of the constructed recommendation and its impact on resources and equity. The protocol is registered with the Danish Health Authority.

Findings

We identified 13 RCTs, including 403 patients with a wide range of conditions. Melatonin reduced sleep latency by 14.88 min (95% CI 23.42–6.34, 9 studies, I² = 60%) and increased total sleep time by 18.97 min (95% CI 0.37–37.57, 10 studies, I² = 57%). The funnel plot for total sleep time showed no apparent indication of publication bias. No other clinical benefits were found. The number of patients experiencing adverse events was not statistically increased however, safety data was scarce. Certainty of evidence was low.

Interpretation

Low certainty evidence supports a moderate effect of melatonin in treating sleep continuity parameters in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia due to primarily medical disorders beyond indication. The off-label use of melatonin for these patients should never be the first choice of treatment, but may be considered by medical specialists with knowledge of the underlying disorder and if non-pharmacological interventions are inadequate. If treatment with melatonin is initiated, adequate follow-up to evaluate treatment effect and adverse events is essential.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications and sleep [^112nB67U]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sleep problems are common and often increase when initiating pharmacotherapy for ADHD. Stimulants are commonly associated with delayed sleep onset/insomnia although nonstimulants can be associated with daytime sleepiness. There is a wide variability in severity and duration of sleep effects, but most effects are mild and improve over time. Although sleep problems occur in all age groups, preschoolers and adolescents appear to be more vulnerable to adverse effects on sleep than adults and children. Interventions to improve sleep include behavioral therapy, changing dose schedules or formulations, and adding a sleep-promoting agent such as melatonin.

### Melatonin use in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114VAbWn]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Melatonin has wide-ranging effects on the body, including the regulation of circadian rhythm, and potentiation of cellular immune and antioxidant activities. In critically ill patients, endogenous melatonin has been shown to be markedly deranged and reduced. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine if exogenous supplementation of melatonin improves patient-centered outcomes.

Data Sources

We searched five electronic databases.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared melatonin to no melatonin in adults admitted to the ICU were identified.

Data Extraction

We aggregated data as relative risks, mean differences (MDs), and standard mean differences (SMDs) using a random-effects model. Supporting evidence for each effect was evaluated for certainty using the Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach.

Data Synthesis

In total, 32 RCTs (n = 3895 patients) were included. We found that melatonin may reduce delirium (relative risk [RR] 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.89; low certainty), may slightly reduce ICU length of stay (MD -0.57 d; 95% CI, -0.95 to -0.18 d; low certainty), and may improve reported sleep quality (SMD 0.54; 95% CI, 0.01–1.07; low certainty). Melatonin may result in a slight reduction in the frequency of adverse events (low certainty). Evidence was uncertain with regards to the frequency of sleep awakenings, anxiety level, agitation, and post-traumatic stress disorder incidence (all very low certainty), as well as to ICU mortality and post-ICU functional status (both low certainty).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that melatonin administration in the critically ill may improve perceived sleep and reduce delirium, without increasing adverse effects. Certainty of evidence was negatively affected by the risk of bias and inconsistency. Future RCTs should focus on identifying optimal dosing, administration timing, improving measurements of sleep outcomes, and target populations.

### Melatonin treatment for age-related insomnia [^115Vg1nV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Older people typically exhibit poor sleep efficiency and reduced nocturnal plasma melatonin levels. The daytime administration of oral melatonin to younger people, in doses that raise their plasma melatonin levels to the nocturnal range, can accelerate sleep onset. We examined the ability of similar, physiological doses to restore nighttime melatonin levels and sleep efficiency in insomniac subjects over 50 yr old. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects who slept normally (n = 15) or exhibited actigraphically confirmed decreases in sleep efficiency (n = 15) received, in randomized order, a placebo and three melatonin doses (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg) orally 30 min before bedtime for a week. Treatments were separated by 1-wk washout periods. Sleep data were obtained by polysomnography on the last three nights of each treatment period. The physiologic melatonin dose (0.3 mg) restored sleep efficiency (P < 0.0001), acting principally in the midthird of the night; it also elevated plasma melatonin levels (P < 0.0008) to normal. The pharmacologic dose (3.0 mg), like the lowest dose (0.1 mg), also improved sleep; however, it induced hypothermia and caused plasma melatonin to remain elevated into the daylight hours. Although control subjects, like insomniacs, had low melatonin levels, their sleep was unaffected by any melatonin dose.

In photoperiodic (day length-dependent) species, changes in melatonin profile duration influence the timing of seasonal rhythms. We investigated the effects of an artificially prolonged melatonin profile on endogenous melatonin and cortisol rhythms, wrist actigraphy, and reproductive hormones in humans. Eight healthy men took part in this double-blind, crossover study. Surge/sustained release melatonin (1.5 mg) or placebo was administered for 8 d at the beginning of a 16-h sleep opportunity (1600 h to 0800 h) in dim light. Compared with placebo, melatonin administration advanced the timing of endogenous melatonin and cortisol rhythms. Activity was reduced in the first half and increased in the second half of the sleep opportunity with melatonin; however, total activity during the sleep opportunities and wake episodes was not affected. Melatonin treatment did not affect the endogenous melatonin profile duration, pituitary/gonadal hormone levels (24-h), or sleepiness and mood levels on the subsequent day. In the short term, suitably timed sustained-release melatonin phase-shifts circadian rhythms and redistributes activity during a 16-h sleep opportunity, with no evidence of changes in the duration of endogenous melatonin secretion or pituitary/gonadal hormones.

### Melatonin or its analogs as premedication to prevent emergence agitation in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117NgVso]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Any studies with a high risk of bias were excluded from the meta-analysis. Data were expressed using the pooled risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using an I 2 test. The I 2 value of 0% corresponded to no degree and 25% to low, 50% to moderate, and 75% to high degrees of heterogeneity. The pooled effect size was measured by a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) if I 2 was larger than 50%; otherwise, a fixed effects model (Mantel–Haenszel) was employed. A continuity correction of 0.5 was applied if zero events were reported in one group. When heterogeneity was observed, a subgroup analysis was performed to further identify heterogeneity sources by type of melatonin (melatonin vs. ramelteon). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to calculate the adjusted CI and quantify the required information size (RIS) and monitoring boundaries. In the TSA model, the type I and type II error rates were 5% and 20%, respectively. Relative risk reduction was defined as 25%, and the incidence of the control arm was calculated based on the overall incidence of the corresponding control groups. Meta-regression was used to test the dose–response associations. Visual inspection of asymmetry in the funnel plots was applied to evaluate the publication bias. Statistical tests were conducted with Stata Version 17. TSA was carried out using TSA Viewer Version 0.9 Beta. P < 0.05 was deemed significant.

Grading of the evidence

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines (GRADEpro software;) were used to judge the certainty of the evidence. Certainty was initially assessed as high and downgraded or upgraded according to the risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency, publication bias, and dose-response gradient. The certainty of the evidence was defined as very low, low, moderate, or high.

### The effect of melatonin on sedation of children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging [^112XWeCH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Melatonin may induce a natural sleepiness and improve predictability of sedation drugs. We have investigated its clinical value in children sedated for magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods

In a stratified randomized double-blind study, 98 children received either melatonin or placebo 10 min before they were sedated with a standard oral regimen. Children > 5 and < 15 kg received chloral hydrate and those ≥ 15 and < 40 kg had a combination of temazepam with droperidol (T&D). The doses of melatonin were 3 and 6 mg, respectively. One observer recorded the time taken to reach criteria for deep sedation, sedation failure and other sedation-related events.

Results

In the chloral hydrate group (n = 50) 50% were deeply sedated by 31 min after melatonin and 40 min after placebo (P = 0.57). There were zero and 1 failures, respectively. The geometric mean time taken to reach deep sedation was 39 min in both subgroups. In the T&D group (n = 48) 50% were deeply sedated by 70 min in both subgroups (two failures in each); geometric mean times were 68 and 71 min, respectively (P = 0.58). Children closed their eyes slightly earlier after melatonin (respective geometric means 42 vs 48, P = 0.17), and took slightly longer to achieve discharge criteria (146 vs 135, P = 0.47).

Conclusion

In these doses and clinical conditions, melatonin did not contribute to sedation of children.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD), delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD). An update for 2015: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116TunQs]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) pharmacotherapy — melatonin dosing range, variability, and oversight are outlined: Inter-study medication comparisons will require equivalent dosing, with analyzed melatonin study doses ranged from 0.3–10.0 mg, and this guideline does not address specific medication/supplement doses. Optimal dosing may vary between CRSWDs, and inter-individual differences may exist within singular CRSWDs, including a study of N24SWD subjects that showed a tenfold variation in entraining doses. Melatonin supplements are not subject to FDA oversight, and safety concerns are noted particularly among children and those of reproductive age.

### Melatonin therapy to improve nocturnal sleep in critically ill patients: encouraging results from a small randomised controlled trial [^114aTEzz]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Melatonin appears to have a favourable adverse effect profile; headaches, dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness are the most common adverse events reported with short-term melatonin administration. Melatonin treatment appeared to be well tolerated in our patients, with only one patient reporting a single episode of headache.

Melatonin appeared to be rapidly absorbed from the oral solution, and peak concentrations were higher than those reported for comparable doses in healthy individuals. After oral dosing, the C max is affected by the solubility of melatonin in the formulation, alterations in bioavailability, and clearance. Orally administered melatonin is subject to an extensive 'first-pass effect', with bioavailability reported to be approximately 15%, although there is high variability due to factors such as cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) activity and co-administration of interacting drugs. The acute inflammatory cascade related to sepsis may adversely affect cytochrome P450 regulation, including CYP1A2 enzyme activity, and a prolonged reduction in enzyme function in patients recovering from critical illness may have contributed to the high peak concentrations. Conversely, the high C max and AUC (0–24) could not be accounted for by concurrent use of CYP1A2 inhibitors. Although conventional liver function tests are poor predictors of hepatic drug metabolism, there was a moderate correlation between plasma transaminase levels and measures of exogenous melatonin exposure. Contrary to a report of endogenous plasma levels in cirrhotic patients, no such association was found for total bilirubin, although the power of our analysis was limited.

### Melatonin therapy to improve nocturnal sleep in critically ill patients: encouraging results from a small randomised controlled trial [^117V6EjH]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sleep disturbances are common in critically ill patients, who present a loss of monophasic nocturnal sleep combined with frequent diurnal naps (irregular sleep-wake pattern) as well as a reduction in deeper, more restorative phases such as slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Although the consequences of such prolonged sleep fragmentation are unknown, they may be comparable to the significant morbidity associated with prolonged sleep deprivation. Patients themselves perceive sleep disturbances to be one of the most stressful components of their intensive care stay.

Nocturnal secretion of melatonin synchronises the sleep-wake and dark-light cycles, and disruption to the normal timing and amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion is associated with reduced sleep. Reduction in plasma melatonin levels and lack of circadian rhythm have been shown in critical care patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.

Exogenous melatonin has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the treatment of other circadian rhythm sleep disorders. This study aimed to examine the effect of exogenous melatonin on nocturnal sleep in patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation. The optimum oral dose to use in this population is also unknown and therefore a pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma melatonin concentrations was also undertaken.

### Oral melatonin for non-respiratory sleep disturbance in children with neurodisabilities: systematic review and meta-analyses [^112R9ec3]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Search results

We identified 15 745 records after deduplication, assessed 387 full‐text records, and included 13 RCTs, all of which investigated the use of oral melatonin as the pharmacological intervention. We did not identify any eligible trials evaluating another pharmacological intervention, so the remainder of the results therefore only concern trials of melatonin. The study selection process and reasons for exclusion are detailed in Figure S1 (online supporting information). A list of excluded studies is available at#/.

Study characteristics

Study characteristics are outlined in Table SII (online supporting information). The studies were undertaken in the following countries: Canada (four studies); 41, 42, 43, 44 Italy (one study); 45 the Netherlands (one study); 46 UK (four studies); 18, 47, 48, 49 and the USA (three studies). 50, 51, 52 Ten RCTs compared melatonin with placebo; one compared melatonin, a parent‐directed sleep‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy, and a combination of the two with placebo; and two compared two regimens of melatonin (5mg vs 10mg; and fast‐release verses sustained release). Ten were crossover trials and three were parallel‐group RCTs. Sample sizes ranged from six to 160 participants.

Owing to the different terminology used to describe sleep disturbances in the included studies, we classified assessment of sleep outcomes under the following headings: global sleep outcomes and composite scores; sleep initiation (e.g. sleep latency, sleep association, settling, bedtime resistance); sleep maintenance (e.g. night waking, waking time, parasomnia, cosleeping to manage night waking, sleep fragmentation), and sleep scheduling (e.g. daytime sleepiness).

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia [^111Tzjuo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant carer distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Although non-drug interventions are recommended as the first-line approach to managing these problems, drug treatment is often sought and used. However, there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this clinically vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 19 February 2020, using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, rest-activity, and sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a drug with placebo, and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with dementia who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias, and results. We used the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measures of treatment effect, and where possible, synthesised results using a fixed-effect model. Key outcomes to be included in our summary tables were chosen with the help of a panel of carers. We used GRADE methods to rate the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We found nine eligible RCTs investigating: melatonin (5 studies, n = 222, five studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), the sedative antidepressant trazodone (1 study, n = 30), the melatonin-receptor agonist ramelteon (1 study, n = 74, no peer-reviewed publication), and the orexin antagonists suvorexant and lemborexant (2 studies, n = 323). Participants in the trazodone study and most participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD); those in the ramelteon study and the orexin antagonist studies had mild-to-moderate AD. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. Primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy or polysomnography. In one study, melatonin treatment was combined with light therapy. Only four studies systematically assessed adverse effects. Overall, we considered the studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias. We found low-certainty evidence that melatonin doses up to 10 mg may have little or no effect on any major sleep outcome over eight to 10 weeks in people with AD and sleep disturbances. We could synthesise data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (TNST) (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; 2 studies, n = 184), and the ratio of day-time to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; 2 studies; n = 184). From single studies, we found no evidence of an effect of melatonin on sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, number of night-time awakenings, or mean duration of sleep bouts. There were no serious adverse effects of melatonin reported. We found low-certainty evidence that trazodone 50 mg for two weeks may improve TNST (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; 1 study, n = 30), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; 1 study, n = 30) in people with moderate-to-severe AD. The effect on time awake after sleep onset was uncertain due to very serious imprecision (MD -20.41 minutes, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; 1 study, n = 30). There may be little or no effect on number of night-time awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; 1 study, n = 30) or time asleep in the day (MD 5.12 minutes, 95% CI -28.2 to 38.4). There were no serious adverse effects of trazodone reported. The small (n = 74), phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg was reported only in summary form on the sponsor's website. We considered the certainty of the evidence to be low. There was no evidence of any important effect of ramelteon on any nocturnal sleep outcomes. There were no serious adverse effects. We found moderate-certainty evidence that an orexin antagonist taken for four weeks by people with mild-to-moderate AD probably increases TNST (MD 28.2 minutes, 95% CI 11.1 to 45.3; 1 study, n = 274) and decreases time awake after sleep onset (MD -15.7 minutes, 95% CI -28.1 to -3.3: 1 study, n = 274) but has little or no effect on number of awakenings (MD 0.0, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.5; 1 study, n = 274). It may be associated with a small increase in sleep efficiency (MD 4.26%, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.26; 2 studies, n = 312), has no clear effect on sleep latency (MD -12.1 minutes, 95% CI -25.9 to 1.7; 1 study, n = 274), and may have little or no effect on the mean duration of sleep bouts (MD -2.42 minutes, 95% CI -5.53 to 0.7; 1 study, n = 38). Adverse events were probably no more common among participants taking orexin antagonists than those taking placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.99; 2 studies, n = 323).

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to guide decisions about drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many widely prescribed drugs, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks for these common treatments. We found no evidence for beneficial effects of melatonin (up to 10 mg) or a melatonin receptor agonist. There was evidence of some beneficial effects on sleep outcomes from trazodone and orexin antagonists and no evidence of harmful effects in these small trials, although larger trials in a broader range of participants are needed to allow more definitive conclusions to be reached. Systematic assessment of adverse effects in future trials is essential.

### Melatonin for prevention of delirium in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit: a multiarm multistage adaptive randomized controlled clinical trial (DEMEL) [^1131meH5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute disorder in attention and awareness with additional disturbances in cognition. Delirium was reported in up to 80% of mechanically ventilated patients. Delirium has been associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients, including higher mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation and lengths of stay, with cognitive impairment after discharge in survivors.

Disturbances of sleep and circadian integrity are frequent in the critically-ill and have been implicated in delirium pathophysiology. For example, alterations in the circadian rhythm of melatonin excretion in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) were more profound in delirious patients as compared to their counterparts. Melatonin is a pleiotropic neurohormone produced by the pineal gland during the hours of darkness, with peak concentrations of ~ 100 pg/mL between 02:00 and 04:00 h, while bright light suppresses its production in the early morning. Nightly melatonin peak accelerates sleep initiation and improves sleep maintenance and efficiency. Treatment with melatonin is safe, inexpensive, and widely used in the community. Recent clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption suggest administering melatonin over no melatonin in adult patients admitted to the ICU. However, the certainty of evidence is low, as previous randomized controlled trials (RCT) that explored the use of melatonin or melatonin receptor agonists for delirium prophylaxis in the ICU found conflicting results. Of note, none specifically focused on mechanically ventilated patients, and none examined low-dose melatonin (all dosages were > 3 mg) except for a small feasibility study (< 25 patients per arm) that was not designed to assess clinical outcomes. Such higher doses may induce a "hangover" effect due to increased/prolonged plasma concentration with drowsiness during the late morning, jeopardizing the reset of the circadian clock. Recent guidelines highlight the need for RCTs to determine the optimal dosing of melatonin and to include mechanically ventilated patients in future studies. To address these uncertainties, we conducted a RCT based on two primary hypotheses: (1) a lower dose of melatonin (0.3 mg nightly — suggested as physiologic in pharmacokinetic studies) may offer a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile than a higher dose (3 mg nightly — the most commonly used oral dose in RCTs); and (2) the optimal melatonin dosing regimen may help prevent the onset of delirium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^114CobEC]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Melatonin has become a widely used sleeping aid for young individuals currently not included in existing guidelines. The aim was to develop a recommendation on the use of melatonin in children and adolescents aged 2–20 years, with chronic insomnia due to disorders beyond indication.

Methods

We performed a systematic search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomised trials (RCTs) in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Guidelines International Network, Trip Database, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European Sleep Research Society and Scandinavian Health Authorities databases. A separate search for adverse events was also performed. The latest search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and adverse events was performed on March 17, 2023. The latest search for RCTs was performed on to February 6, 2023. The language was restricted to English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Eligible participants were children and adolescents (2–20 years of age) with chronic insomnia due to underlying disorders, in whom sleep hygiene practices have been inadequate and melatonin was tested. Studies exclusively on autism spectrum disorders or attention deficit hyperactive disorder were excluded. There were no restrictions on dosage, duration of treatment, time of consumption or release formula. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events, assessed at 2–4 weeks post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness, quality of life, non-serious adverse events, and all-cause dropouts (assessed at 2–4 weeks post-treatment), plus quality of sleep and daytime functioning (assessed at 3–6 months post-treatment). Pooled estimates were calculated using inverse variance random effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using I 2 statistics. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. A multidisciplinary guideline panel constructed the recommendation using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The certainty of evidence was considered either high, moderate, low or very low depending on the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias. The evidence-to-decision framework was used to discuss the feasibility and acceptance of the constructed recommendation and its impact on resources and equity. The protocol is registered with the Danish Health Authority.

Findings

We identified 13 RCTs, including 403 patients with a wide range of conditions. Melatonin reduced sleep latency by 14.88 min (95% CI 23.42–6.34, 9 studies, I² = 60%) and increased total sleep time by 18.97 min (95% CI 0.37–37.57, 10 studies, I² = 57%). The funnel plot for total sleep time showed no apparent indication of publication bias. No other clinical benefits were found. The number of patients experiencing adverse events was not statistically increased however, safety data was scarce. Certainty of evidence was low.

Interpretation

Low certainty evidence supports a moderate effect of melatonin in treating sleep continuity parameters in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia due to primarily medical disorders beyond indication. The off-label use of melatonin for these patients should never be the first choice of treatment, but may be considered by medical specialists with knowledge of the underlying disorder and if non-pharmacological interventions are inadequate. If treatment with melatonin is initiated, adequate follow-up to evaluate treatment effect and adverse events is essential.

### Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease [^115wbMR2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population.

Objectives

To assess the effects, including common adverse effects, of any drug treatment versus placebo for sleep disorders in people with Alzheimer's disease through identification and analysis of all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 31 March 2013 using the terms: sleep, insomnia, circadian, hypersomnia, parasomnia, somnolence, "rest-activity", sundowning.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared a drug with placebo and that had the primary aim of improving sleep in people with Alzheimer's disease who had an identified sleep disturbance at baseline. Trials could also include non-pharmacological interventions as long as both drug and placebo groups had the same exposure to them.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors working independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias and results from the included study reports. Additional information was obtained from study authors where necessary. We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (209 participants, three studies, but only two yielded data suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study) and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, very limited information available). The melatonin and trazodone studies were of people with moderate-to-severe AD; the ramelteon study was of people with mild-to-moderate AD. In all studies participants had a variety of common sleep problems. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the published studies were at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting and some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting. We found no evidence that melatonin, either immediate- or slow-release, improved any major sleep outcome in patients with AD. We were able to synthesize data for two sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59, two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03, two studies). Other outcomes were reported in single studies. We found no difference between intervention and control groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset or number of night-time awakenings, nor in cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. Trazodone 50 mg administered at night for two weeks significantly improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0, one study) and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1, one study), but there was no clear evidence of any effect on the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6, one study) or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8, one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, nor on cognition or ADLs. No serious adverse effects were reported. Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment). The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects of ramelteon.

Authors' Conclusions

We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in AD. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in AD, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin is beneficial to AD patients with moderate to severe dementia and sleep problems. There is some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in AD. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.

### Paediatric neurodisability and sleep disorders: clinical pathways and management strategies [^116d18W9]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Our approach and treatment: Initially melatonin was tried. She was however able to fall asleep quickly independently and so may not have been indicated in the first instance (see box 4). In this case, high-dose alimemazine (an antihistamine) was prescribed due to the frequent night waking. This decision was made in the circumstance as the family had gone into crisis. Mum was asked to see her general practitioner (GP) and seek urgent help. Promethazine can be used as an alternative. Night sedation should be used as an emergency in the short term only, used with caution while other sleep solutions are explored and primarily in children with severe disability not in typically developing children. Clonidine is a medium-term medication for this degree of night waking at very low dose for children with significant disability, however there is possibility of build-up of tolerance so other support is needed (behavioural) in conjunction. Use of clonidine is outlined in box 5.

Box 4
Melatonin

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is the primary hormone produced by the pineal gland during nocturnal periods in response to darkness, to properly time circadian sleep/wake rhythms and enhance sleepiness. It is available in a prolonged release preparation.

Melatonin prescribing should be limited to those who have a confirmed diagnosis of insomnia. It is best to avoid prescribing for children mid-assessment who do not have a proven neurodisability condition that would imply abnormal melatonin production. These are conditions that should be considered early on. This may include children with:

Cortical blindness.
Midline brain defects such as septo-optic dysplasia or pituitary tumours.
Neurodegenerative disorders.
Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.
Acquired brain injury.

In addition, melatonin may be helpful in treating delayed sleep onset in autism (if assessed as not being bedtime resistance) after appropriate behavioural intervention. There are new preparations coming to market especially for autism with longer action such as Neurim which may have benefit maintaining sleep.

### Melatonin for the promotion of sleep in adults in the intensive care unit [^1122Xsw9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24-hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and patients perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Artificial lighting during night-time hours in the ICU may contribute to reduced production of melatonin in critically ill patients. Melatonin is known to have a direct effect on the circadian rhythm, and it appears to reset a natural rhythm, thus promoting sleep.

Objectives

To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of melatonin to adults in the intensive care unit. To assess whether melatonin given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2017), Embase (1974 to September 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to September 2017), and PsycINFO (1806 to September 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with adult participants (over the age of 16) admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses given melatonin versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were mechanically ventilated and those who were not mechanically ventilated. We planned to include studies that compared the use of melatonin, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night-time sleep, against no agent; or against another agent administered specifically to promote sleep.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included four studies with 151 randomized participants. Two studies included participants who were mechanically ventilated, one study included a mix of ventilated and non-ventilated participants and in one study participants were being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Three studies reported admission diagnoses, which varied: these included sepsis, pneumonia and cardiac or cardiorespiratory arrest. All studies compared melatonin against no agent; three were placebo-controlled trials; and one compared melatonin with usual care. All studies administered melatonin in the evening. All studies reported adequate methods for randomization and placebo-controlled trials were blinded at the participant and personnel level. We noted high risk of attrition bias in one study and were unclear about potential bias introduced in two studies with differences between participants at baseline. It was not appropriate to combine data owing to differences in measurement tools, or methods used to report data. The effects of melatonin on subjectively rated quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Three studies (139 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured through reports of participants or family members or by personnel assessments. Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups for participant assessment (using Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire) and nurse assessment. Two studies reported no difference in duration of sleep observed by nurses. The effects of melatonin on objectively measured quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (37 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, bispectral index (BIS) or electroencephalogram (EEG). Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups using BIS and actigraphy. These authors also reported longer sleep in participants given melatonin which was not statistically significant, and improved sleep (described as "better sleep") in participants given melatonin from analysis of area under the curve (AUC) of BIS data. One study used PSG but authors were unable to report data because of a large loss of participant data. One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in anxiety scores (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (94 participants) reported data for mortality: one study reported that overall one-third of participants died; and one study reported no evidence of difference between groups in hospital mortality (very low certainty). One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in length of ICU stay (very low certainty evidence). Effects of melatonin on adverse events were reported in two studies (107 participants), and are uncertain (very low certainty evidence): one study reported headache in one participant given melatonin, and one study reported excessive sleepiness in one participant given melatonin and two events in the control group (skin reaction in one participant, and excessive sleepiness in another participant). The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was limited by sparse data with few participants. We noted study limitations in some studies due to high attrition and differences between groups in baseline data; and doses of melatonin varied between studies. Methods used to measure data were not consistent for outcomes, and use of some measurement tools may not be effective for use on the ICU patient. All studies included participants in the ICU but we noted differences in ICU protocols, and one included study used a non-standard sedation protocol with participants which introduced indirectness to the evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of melatonin would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in ICU patients. We identified sparse data, and noted differences in study methodology, in ICU sedation protocols, and in methods used to measure and report sleep. We identified five ongoing studies from database and clinical trial register searches. Inclusion of data from these studies in future review updates would provide more certainty for the review outcomes.

### Melatonin as a hypnotic: con [^115P7ZtT]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

The physiological roles of melatonin are still unclear despite almost 50 years of research. Elevated melatonin levels from either endogenous nocturnal production or exogenous daytime administration are associated in humans with effects including increased sleepiness, reduced core temperature, increased heat loss and other generally anabolic physiological changes. This supports the idea that endogenous melatonin increases nocturnal sleep propensity, either directly or indirectly via physiological processes associated with sleep. The article "Melatonin as a hypnotic — Pro", also in this issue, presents evidence to support this viewpoint. We do not entirely disagree, but nevertheless feel this is an overly simplistic interpretation of the available data. Our interpretation is that melatonin is primarily a neuroendocrine transducer promoting an increased propensity for 'dark appropriate' behavior. Thus, it is our view that exogenous melatonin is only hypnotic in those species or individuals for which endogenous melatonin increases sleep propensity and is consequently a dark appropriate outcome. Evidence supporting this position is drawn primarily from studies of exogenous administration of melatonin and its varied effects on sleep/wake behavior based on dose, time of administration, age and other factors. From this perspective, it will be shown that melatonin can exert hypnotic-like effects but only under limited circumstances.

### Orexin receptor antagonism, a new sleep-enabling paradigm: a proof-of-concept clinical trial [^114idgHQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a persistent problem in ~10% of adults, with primary insomnia estimated to be present in ~25% of patients with chronic insomnia. Sleep-maintenance problems and nocturnal awakenings are more prevalent than sleep-onset difficulties. Nonpharmacologic treatments are often preferred; however, eventually, most patients either seek pharmacologic treatment or remain untreated. Current standard pharmacologic treatments for insomnia include the benzodiazepine receptor agonists, (which potentiate the activity of γ-aminobutyric acid at the ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid-A receptor), and the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists include benzodiazepines that decrease sleep latency and increase sleep time, with some agents also improving sleep maintenance. However, benzodiazepines have been associated with daytime drowsiness, tolerance, dependency, and withdrawal symptoms. Newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (nonbenzodiazepines) and ramelteon decrease sleep latency, whereas some agents, such as eszopiclone and modified-release zolpidem, increase sleep time and improve sleep maintenance. The side-effect profiles of nonbenzodiazepines and ramelteon appear to be better than those of benzodiazepines, with fewer next-day effects observed. New insomnia therapies with different mechanisms of action are currently under investigation with the aim of further improving tolerability and sleep maintenance and specifically targeting sleep–wake architecture.

We performed a two-part clinical study to evaluate the effect of almorexant on sleep in patients with primary insomnia. The primary objective was to determine the minimum dose of almorexant that would have a significant effect on sleep efficiency (SE). In the first part of the study, the effect of almorexant on SE was evaluated at a high dose of 400 mg; thereafter, we conducted the dose-ranging part of the study, which aimed to identify the minimum effective dose. The safety and tolerability of almorexant and its effect on objective and subjective sleep variables were also evaluated.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116dWWNL]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Secondary REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) due to a medical condition — immediate-release melatonin: Recommendation 6 states, "The AASM suggests that clinicians use immediate-release melatonin (vs no treatment) for the treatment of secondary RBD due to a medical condition in adults. (CONDITIONAL)". Remarks note brand variability: "As noted previously, there may be considerable differences in the active ingredients between different melatonin brands", and that "immediate-release melatonin labeled with the U.S. Pharmacopeia Verification Mark… may provide the most consistent dosing among currently available melatonin treatment options". The TF identified "1 randomized controlled trial and 9 observational studies" showing "clinically significant improvements in RBD dream-acting and vocalization episode frequency"; overall certainty was "low due to imprecision and the risk of bias associated with observational studies", and commonly reported adverse events included "daytime sleepiness, headache, trouble thinking, and nausea".

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^1152egJW]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Sample size

In order to achieve 95% power at the 5% level for the primary objective of assessing the change in sleep latency in the Intention to Treat (ITT) low excretors at Week 3, assuming a treatment effect of 19 min and a residual standard deviation of 40.6 min, 120 participants were required per treatment group. Assuming equal numbers of low and high excretors, 480 patients were required to complete treatment Week 3. Assuming a 10% dropout rate between baseline and Week 3, 540 patients would have to be randomized at baseline. In order to achieve 90% power at the 5% level for the first secondary objective of assessing the change in sleep latency in the ITT dataset of patients aged 65–80 years, assuming a treatment effect of 14 min and a residual standard deviation of 40.7 min, 179 patients ≥ 65 years were required per group (active and placebo). Therefore, 400 patients in this age range would need to be randomized at baseline. Assuming 45% of 540 patients already randomized would be ≥ 65 years old (245), an additional 150 patients would need to be randomized at baseline in this age group.

### Pharmacological interventions for sleepiness and sleep disturbances caused by shift work [^114G6X9i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Shift work results in sleep-wake disturbances, which cause sleepiness during night shifts and reduce sleep length and quality in daytime sleep after the night shift. In its serious form it is also called shift work sleep disorder. Various pharmacological products are used to ameliorate symptoms of sleepiness or poor sleep length and quality.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of pharmacological interventions to reduce sleepiness or to improve alertness at work and decrease sleep disturbances whilst off work, or both, in workers undertaking shift work in their present job and to assess their cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and PsycINFO up to 20 September 2013 and ClinicalTrials.gov up to July 2013. We also screened reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included all eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross-over RCTs, of pharmacological products among workers who were engaged in shift work (including night shifts) in their present jobs and who may or may not have had sleep problems. Primary outcomes were sleep length and sleep quality while off work, alertness and sleepiness, or fatigue at work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included trials. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate.

Main Results

We included 15 randomised placebo-controlled trials with 718 participants. Nine trials evaluated the effect of melatonin and two the effect of hypnotics for improving sleep problems. One trial assessed the effect of modafinil, two of armodafinil and one examined caffeine plus naps to decrease sleepiness or to increase alertness. Melatonin (1 to 10 mg) after the night shift may increase sleep length during daytime sleep (mean difference (MD) 24 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.8 to 38.9; seven trials, 263 participants, low quality evidence) and night-time sleep (MD 17 minutes, 95% CI 3.71 to 30.22; three trials, 234 participants, low quality evidence) compared to placebo. We did not find a dose-response effect. Melatonin may lead to similar sleep latency times as placebo (MD 0.37minutes, 95% CI - 1.55 to 2.29; five trials, 74 participants, low quality evidence). Hypnotic medication, zopiclone, did not result in significantly longer daytime sleep length compared to placebo in one low quality trial and we could not use the data from the study on lormetazepam. Armodafinil taken before the night shift probably reduces sleepiness by one point on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) (MD -0.99, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.67; range 1 to 10; two trials, 572 participants, moderate quality evidence) and increases alertness by 50 ms in a simple reaction time test (MD -50.0, 95% CI -85.5 to -15.5) at three months' follow-up in shift work sleep disorder patients. Modafinil probably has similar effects on sleepiness (KSS) (MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.35; one trial, 183 participants, moderate quality evidence) and alertness in the psychomotor vigilance test in the same patient group. Post-marketing, severe skin reactions have been reported. Adverse effects reported by trial participants were headache, nausea and a rise in blood pressure. There were no trials in non-patient shift workers. Based on one trial, caffeine plus pre-shift naps taken before the night shift decreased sleepiness (KSS) (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.17). We judged most trials to have a low risk of bias even though the randomisation method and allocation concealment were often not described.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence that melatonin improves sleep length after a night shift but not other sleep quality parameters. Both modafinil and armodafinil increase alertness and reduce sleepiness to some extent in employees who suffer from shift work sleep disorder but they are associated with adverse events. Caffeine plus naps reduces sleepiness during the night shift, but the quality of evidence is low. Based on one low quality trial, hypnotics did not improve sleep length and quality after a night shift. We need more and better quality trials on the beneficial and adverse effects and costs of all pharmacological agents that induce sleep or promote alertness in shift workers both with and without a diagnosis of shift work sleep disorder. We also need systematic reviews of their adverse effects.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^117AP2zC]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Immediate-release melatonin for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) — The TF identified 1 randomized controlled trial and 9 observational studies that assessed the efficacy of immediate-release melatonin in patients with isolated RBD, and these studies demonstrated clinically significant improvements in RBD dream enactment and vocalization episode frequency. The TF stated that the overall certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision and the risk of bias associated with observational studies, and commonly reported adverse events included daytime sleepiness, headache, trouble thinking, and nausea. The TF determined that the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects was strongly in favor of immediate-release melatonin, noted that the costs of the medication are relatively small compared to the potential high cost of injury due to dream enactment during sleep, and that the vast majority of patients would most likely use immediate-release melatonin compared to no treatment for their isolated RBD. Remarks emphasized that as melatonin is not regulated by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in the United States and several other jurisdictions, different formulations could potentially lead to varying efficacy between different melatonin brands.

### Use of transdermal melatonin delivery to improve sleep maintenance during daytime [^113QjvcD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Oral melatonin (MEL) can improve daytime sleep, but the hormone's short elimination half-life limits its use as a hypnotic in shift workers and individuals with jet lag or other sleep problems. Here we show, in healthy subjects, that transdermal delivery of MEL during the daytime can elevate plasma MEL and reduce waking after sleep onset, by promoting sleep in the latter part of an 8-h sleep opportunity. Transdermal MEL may have advantages over fast-release oral MEL in improving sleep maintenance during adverse circadian phases.

### Melatonin for prevention of delirium in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit: a multiarm multistage adaptive randomized controlled clinical trial (DEMEL) [^1158z5vM]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficacy stage

Of the 334 intention-to-treat patients, 33 high-dose melatonin patients were removed from the final analysis due to arm discontinuation; the remaining 301 patients composed the final analysis population, with no clinically relevant difference between the low-dose melatonin group (n = 147) and the placebo group (n = 154) (Table 1). The median [IQR] number of assessments per patient was 19.0 [10.3;27.0] and 16.0 [10.5;27.0] in the low-dose melatonin and the placebo group, respectively. Delirium assessment was attempted at 96.4% [89.2;100] and 96.4% [85.7;100] of all available time points in the low-dose melatonin and placebo groups, respectively.

There was no difference in the final primary outcome of delirium incidence between the low-dose melatonin group and the placebo group: 80/147 (54.4%) vs 85/154 (55.2%), risk ratio (RR), 0.986 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.803 to 1.211] (Fig. 3). Sleep depth and latency were worse with low-dose melatonin compared to placebo when assessed by the nurse, but all sleep parameters were similar between groups when assessed by the patient. All other key secondary outcomes were also similar between groups at day 14 (including delirium days, delirium- and coma-free days, cumulative doses of sedatives and opioids, use of sleep aid drugs and neuroleptics and global clinical assessment of sleep), day 28 (including duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator-free days, length of stay, and mortality), and day 90 (including quality of life, dependence, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress in survivors) (Table 2). One serious adverse event potentially related to the study drug (a prolonged coma) was reported in a patient from the low-dose melatonin group. Findings of the per-protocol analysis were similar to those of the intention-to-treat analysis (eTable 3 in electronic supplementary material 2). Comparisons involving the high-dose group had limited statistical power and did not yield additional insights (eTable 4 in electronic supplementary material 2). There was no evidence of a between-center effect (eResults in electronic supplementary material 2).

### Use of melatonin for children and adolescents with chronic insomnia attributable to disorders beyond indication: a systematic review, meta-analysis and clinical recommendation [^1144XMvG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Melatonin increased the total sleep time by 18.97 min (95% CI 0.37–37.57, I² = 57%, 10 studies, moderate certainty) (see Table 2), which was considered a moderate improvement compared to the total sleep time reported at baseline (ranged from 4 to 9.5 h). Further subgroup analysis showed no subgroup difference for age (p = 0.93), dosage (p = 0.40) or release formulations (p = 0.90). Sensitivity analysis showed no subgroup difference between studies of high–and low risk of bias. Forest plots and sensitivity analysis are presented in the Supplementary.

Sleep latency was reduced by 14.88 min (95% CI −23.42 to −6.34, I² = 60%, 9 studies, moderate certainty) (see Table 2), which was considered a moderate effect compared to estimates at baseline (range from 25 to 90 min). Further subgroup analysis showed no statistical difference for age (p = 0.74), dosage (p = 0.45) or release formulations (p = 0.74). Sensitivity analysis showed a significant subgroup difference (p = 0.0005). Sleep latency was not affected in studies of low risk of bias (MD −3.50, 95% CI −8.29 to 1.30, I² = 0%, 3 studies, low certainty), whereas studies of high risk of bias reported that sleep latency was reduced by 20.65 min (95% CI −29.07 to 12.23, I² = 14%, 6 studies, moderate certainty). Forest plots and sensitivity analysis are found in the Supplementary.

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^1178mumb]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Endogenous melatonin levels decrease with age, presumably due to an age-related decline in SCN circadian rhythmic functions or the calcification of the pineal gland. Since endogenous melatonin has beneficial effects on sleep in man and helps stabilize the physiological circadian rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle in humans, decline in melatonin levels may contribute to the common complaint of poor sleep quality seen amongst the elderly. This raised the possibility of improving sleep in elderly patients with insomnia by appropriately timed treatment with melatonin.

Early studies have shown an improvement of sleep in elderly insomnia patients by prescribing very high doses of melatonin. Later studies, mostly done with lower doses of immediate release melatonin preparations and in younger people suggested a limited efficacy in primary insomnia with short-term use (4 weeks or less).

Prolonged-release melatonin (PRM 2 mg), a formulation that releases melatonin gradually in the gut when administered orally in order to introduce melatonin into the circulation over the following 8–10 h, has proven efficacious and safe for the short-term treatment (3 weeks) of adults aged 55 years and older who have primary insomnia. It has been licensed since June 2007 in Europe and in other countries for the short-term treatment of primary insomnia characterized by poor quality of sleep in patients who are aged 55 years or above. Some young patients also may have low melatonin levels and the important clinical question is whether the population most likely to respond is defined by age or by low melatonin levels. Another important issue with the use of melatonin in clinical practice, considering the chronic nature of insomnia at older age, is whether long-term use is justified and safe.

This study was therefore designed to elucidate whether PRM efficacy is related to low endogenous melatonin levels or age, which is associated with declining melatonin production. The maintenance of efficacy and the safety of PRM beyond the acute treatment were also investigated.

In healthy adults, the nocturnal melatonin production rate is normally 10 to 80 μg/night and urinary excretion of the main melatonin metabolite, 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (6-SMT) is 8 to 56 μg/night but with wide variability. Thus, low endogenous melatonin in adults was defined as urinary excretion of the major melatonin metabolite of < 8 μg 6-SMT per night.

### Melatonin in medically ill patients with insomnia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115x9mu4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that melatonin improves sleep functioning, but this possibility has not been studied in medical populations.

Method

33 medically ill persons with initial insomnia were randomly assigned to receive either melatonin (N = 18) or placebo (N = 15) in a flexible-dose regimen. Double-blind assessments of aspects of sleep functioning were obtained daily across the next 8 to 16 days.

Results

The mean stable dose of melatonin was found to be 5.4 mg. Relative to placebo, melatonin significantly hastened sleep onset, improved quality and depth of sleep, and increased sleep duration without producing drowsiness, early-morning "hangover" symptoms, or daytime adverse effects (p < .05). Melatonin also contributed to freshness in the morning and during the day and improved overall daytime functioning. Benefits were most apparent during the first week of treatment.

Conclusion

Melatonin may be a useful hypnotic for medically ill patients with initial insomnia, particularly those for whom conventional hypnotic drug therapy may be problematic.

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^112Z8ger]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Insomnia is a common disorder, the diagnosis of which is based on a patient's complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or sleep that is of inadequate quality (non-restorative sleep). The sleep disturbance should have been present for at least 1 month and be associated with a negative impact on functioning the following day. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in the USA. About one-third of the adult population has experienced insomnia at some time and approximately 10% have a persistent problem.

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is the major hormone produced nocturnally by the pineal gland in a process driven by the biological clock residing in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Melatonin is a sleep regulator and signal of darkness in humans. Thus, the circadian rhythm in the synthesis and secretion of melatonin is closely associated with the sleep rhythm in both sighted and blind subjects. Melatonin promotes sleep in humans, presumably by inhibiting circadian wakefulness mechanisms and affects the activity of brain networks compatible with sleep induction. Exogenous melatonin has clock-shifting effects and may advance or delay the sleep phase depending on the time of administration according to the Phase-Response Curve.

### Role of melatonin in the management of sleep and circadian disorders in the context of psychiatric illness [^117WvapF]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Potential types of melatonin dysfunction and target effects of exogenous melatonin supplement according to dosage. In case of delayed melatonin rhythm, low-dose melatonin (≤ 1 mg) with earlier timing is needed to advance the melatonin rhythm for a chronobiotic effect. Meanwhile, in cases of blunted or dysregulated melatonin rhythms, high-dose melatonin usage (≥ 2 mg) with later timing would be better to enhance the melatonin rhythm and improve sleep disturbance for a soporific effect

In addition, administration time may be an important factor in advancing the circadian rhythm of melatonin. It may vary depending on the individual's circadian rhythm, but according to the results of a meta-analysis, administration at 18:00 or 20:00 h may be the most effective. The administration time would be optimal around 3 h before the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) based on the phase-response curve. Therefore, in order to more effectively correct sleep or circadian abnormalities in psychiatric disorders, it is necessary to apply both an appropriate dose and an appropriate dosing time, according to the purpose of melatonin supplements. In previous studies, a low-dose melatonin (< 1 mg) could be effective for advancing sleep and circadian rhythms as a chronobiotic. The phase-response curve was different depending on the dose. At doses as low as 1 mg, 2 h before DLMO may be the most effective dosing time to advance the rhythm. On the other hand, at high doses such as 3 mg, the most effective dosing time may be 5 h before DLMO. Given that the phase-response curve differs by the dosage, high doses of melatonin may not be beneficial to advance the melatonin rhythm.

The dosage and dosing time of melatonin could be different depending on the abnormalities of sleep and circadian rhythms as observed in patients with psychiatric disorders. We recently reviewed the objective methods of measuring sleep and circadian rhythms. Clinically, actigraphy is the most suitable and useful objective device for measurement. The assessment of personal abnormalities in sleep and circadian rhythm could optimize the efficacy of melatonin supplements both clinically and in trials. There is lack of evidence on the proper use of melatonin according to the individual rhythms. However, if these results were to accumulate, it is expected that the effects of melatonin can be improved through personalized intervention according to each individual's melatonin rhythm.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116sm4oV]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) pharmacologic management in older and neurodegenerative populations — clonazepam, melatonin, and rivastigmine — includes safety and dosing considerations. Concerning side effects of clonazepam include morning sedation, gait imbalance/falls, depression, and cognitive disturbances, and clonazepam can also exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing; among patients with secondary RBD and DLB or PD, clonazepam is often used in lower doses, starting at 0.25 mg, and dose requirements may decrease with aging, for example from 1.0 mg at age 55 years to 0.5 mg at age 70 years. Melatonin is an intriguing option for older patients (> 50 years old) because it is only mildly sedating, with dosing starting with 3 mg and increasing by 3-mg increments to 15 mg. Rivastigmine is typically administered by transdermal patch with dosing that starts at 4.6 mg applied every 24 hours and can increase to 13.3 mg daily, and adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, bradycardia, and possible excessive daytime sleepiness in secondary RBD.

### Use of melatonin in children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical recommendation [^115vTRKt]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Melatonin prescriptions for children and adolescents have increased substantially during the last decade. Existing clinical recommendations focus on melatonin as a treatment for insomnia related to neurodevelopmental disorders. To help guide clinical decision-making, we aimed to construct a recommendation on the use of melatonin in children and adolescents aged 5–20 years with idiopathic chronic insomnia.

Methods

A systematic search for guidelines, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCT) were performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, Cinahl, Guidelines International Network, Trip Database, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, American Academy of Sleep Medicine, European Sleep Research Society and Scandinavian Health Authorities databases. A search for adverse events in otherwise healthy children and adolescents was also performed. The latest search for guidelines, systematic reviews, and adverse events was performed on March 18, 2023. The latest search for RCTs was performed on to February 6, 2023. The language was restricted to English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Eligible participants were children and adolescents (5–20 years of age) with idiopathic chronic insomnia, in whom sleep hygiene practices have been inadequate and melatonin was tested. There were no restrictions on dosage, duration of treatment, time of consumption, or release formula. Primary outcomes were quality of sleep, daytime functioning and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included total sleep time, sleep latency, awakenings, drowsiness, quality of life, all-cause dropouts, and non-serious adverse events. Outcomes were assessed at different time points to assess short-term and long-term effects. Meta-analysis was performed using inverse variance random-effects model and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. If possible, funnel plots would be constructed to investigate publication bias. Heterogeneity was calculated via I 2 statistics. A multidisciplinary guideline panel formulated the recommendation according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The certainty of evidence was considered either high, moderate, low or very low depending on the extent of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias. The evidence-to-decision framework was subsequently used to discuss the feasibility and acceptance of the constructed recommendation alongside the impact on resources and equity. The protocol is registered with the Danish Health Authority.

Findings

We included eight RCTs with 419 children and adolescents with idiopathic chronic insomnia. Melatonin led to a moderate increase in total sleep time by 30.33 min (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.96–41.70, 4 studies, I² = 0%) and a moderate reduction in sleep latency by 18.03 min (95% CI -26.61 to -9.44, 3 studies, I² = 0%), both as assessed by sleep diary. No other beneficial effects were found. None of the studies provided information on serious adverse events, yet the number of participants experiencing non-serious adverse events was increased (Relative risk 3.44, 95% CI 1.25–9.42, 4 studies, I² = 0%). Funnel plots were not constructed due to the low number of studies. The certainty of evidence was very low on the quality of sleep and low for daytime functioning.

Interpretation

Evidence of very low certainty shows that benefits are limited and unwanted events are likely when melatonin is used to treat otherwise healthy children and adolescents with chronic insomnia. Melatonin should never be the first choice of treatment for this particular population, yet carefully monitored short-term use may be considered if sleep hygiene practices and non-pharmacological interventions have proven inadequate, and only if daytime function is compromised.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD), delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder (N24SWD), and irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD). An update for 2015: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112gHgVB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

GRADE approach — quality of evidence rating for study designs and outcomes is summarized as follows: Randomized trials have initial quality "High", whereas observational studies have initial quality "Low". Quality may be downgraded for "Risk of bias", "Inconsistency", "Indirectness", "Imprecision", and "Publication bias", each by "−1 Serious" or "−2 Very serious", and may be upgraded for "Large effect" ("+1 Large" or "+2 Very large"), "Dose response" ("+1 Evidence of a gradient"), and "All plausible residual confounding" ("+1 Would reduce a demonstrated effect" or "+1 Would suggest a spurious effect if no effect was observed"). The resulting quality categories are "High", "Moderate", "Low", and "Very Low", with explanatory definitions including "Low: corresponds to a low level of certainty in the effect estimate" and "Very low: corresponds to very little certainty in the effect estimate". A cumulative quality grade for a PICO question is "predicated upon the lowest level of evidence assigned to one of the CRITICAL outcomes", so mixed evidence (e.g., one moderate and one low) yields an overall "low" grade.

### Melatonin for preventing and treating jet lag [^114q2Cuw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Jet-lag commonly affects air travellers who cross several time zones. It results from the body's internal rhythms being out of step with the day-night cycle at the destination. Melatonin is a pineal hormone that plays a central part in regulating bodily rhythms and has been used as a drug to re-align them with the outside world.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin taken in different dosage regimens for alleviating jet-lag after air travel across several time zones.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit and Science Citation Index electronically, and the journals 'Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine' and 'Sleep' by hand. We searched citation lists of relevant studies for other relevant trials. We asked principal authors of relevant studies to tell us about unpublished trials. Reports of adverse events linked to melatonin use outside randomised trials were searched for systematically in 'Side Effects of Drugs' (SED) and SED Annuals, 'Reactions Weekly', MEDLINE, and the adverse drug reactions databases of the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) and the US Food & Drug Administration.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in airline passengers, airline staff or military personnel given oral melatonin, compared with placebo or other medication. Outcome measures should consist of subjective rating of jet-lag or related components, such as subjective wellbeing, daytime tiredness, onset and quality of sleep, psychological functioning, duration of return to normal, or indicators of circadian rhythms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. All compared melatonin with placebo; one in addition compared it with a hypnotic, zolpidem. Nine of the trials were of adequate quality to contribute to the assessment, one had a design fault and could not be used in the assessment. Reports of adverse events outside trials were found through MEDLINE, 'Reactions Weekly', and in the WHO UMC database.

Main Results

Nine of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet-lag from flights crossing five or more time zones. Daily doses of melatonin between 0.5 and 5mg are similarly effective, except that people fall asleep faster and sleep better after 5mg than 0.5mg. Doses above 5mg appear to be no more effective. The relative ineffectiveness of 2mg slow-release melatonin suggests that a short-lived higher peak concentration of melatonin works better. Based on the review, the number needed to treat (NNT) is 2. The benefit is likely to be greater the more time zones are crossed, and less for westward flights. The timing of the melatonin dose is important: if it is taken at the wrong time, early in the day, it is liable to cause sleepiness and delay adaptation to local time. The incidence of other side effects is low. Case reports suggest that people with epilepsy, and patients taking warfarin may come to harm from melatonin.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet-lag, and occasional short-term use appears to be safe. It should be recommended to adult travellers flying across five or more time zones, particularly in an easterly direction, and especially if they have experienced jet-lag on previous journeys. Travellers crossing 2–4 time zones can also use it if need be. The pharmacology and toxicology of melatonin needs systematic study, and routine pharmaceutical quality control of melatonin products must be established. The effects of melatonin in people with epilepsy, and a possible interaction with warfarin, need investigation.

### Low-dose exogenous melatonin plus evening dim light and time in bed scheduling advances circadian phase irrespective of measured or estimated dim light melatonin onset time: preliminary findings [^112QbAZb]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

The purpose of the present study was to preliminarily evaluate whether knowing the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) time is advantageous when treating delayed sleep-wake phase disorder with low-dose melatonin treatment plus behavioral interventions (ie, evening dim light and time in bed scheduling).

Methods

In this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, 40 adults with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder were randomly assigned to 4weeks of 0.5mg timed to be administered either 3hours before the DLMO (measured DLMO group, n = 20) or 5hours before sleep-onset time per actigraphy (estimated DLMO group, n = 20), in conjunction with behavioral interventions. The primary outcome was change in the DLMO (measured in-home). Secondary outcomes included sleep parameters per diary and actigraphy (sleep-onset and -offset times and total sleep time), Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, PROMIS-Sleep Disturbance, PROMIS-Sleep Related Impairment, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Mixed-effects models tested for group differences in these outcome.

Results

After applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (significant P value set at < .004), there were significant main effects for visit on all outcomes except for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and total sleep time per wrist actigraphy and diary. There were no group-by-visit interactions for any of the outcomes (P > .004).

Conclusions

Scheduled low-dose melatonin plus behavioral interventions may improve many circadian and sleep parameters regardless of whether melatonin administration is scheduled based on estimated or measured DLMO. A larger-scale trial is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.

### Melatonin: beyond circadian regulation-exploring its diverse physiological roles and therapeutic potential [^114ZMUP4]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

As an indoleamine with a long evolutionary history, melatonin's physiological functions have evolved from its initial role in regulating skin pigmentation in fish and amphibians to encompass a broad spectrum of critical physiological regulatory functions. In mammals, melatonin primarily serves to regulate the circadian rhythm system, which is essential for maintaining the sleep-wake cycle. Abnormal melatonin secretion has been strongly associated with the development of sleep disorders, which are recognized as significant risk factors for various chronic diseases. This article aims to comprehensively examine the diverse physiological functions of melatonin beyond its role in regulating circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle, while analyzing its mechanisms of action in modulating oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory responses, and mitochondrial function. Furthermore, this article evaluates the multifaceted effects of melatonin on energy metabolism, bone metabolism, nervous system regulation, and cardiovascular health at pharmacological doses, highlighting its importance in managing sleep disorders. By synthesizing current research findings, this article provides an objective assessment of the scientific foundation for melatonin's role in enhancing sleep quality and promoting overall health, while emphasizing the need to distinguish between its physiological and pharmacological effects.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^114m8ryA]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Taken together, to date only three relatively small RCTs and two POS studies have been conducted to test the efficacy of melatonin for reducing RBD. Two of the parallel-group RCTs showed no improvements after melatonin and the third cross-over study, showed partial improvements compared to placebo. These studies thereby highlight the importance of a double-blinded assessment to preclude a seemingly strong placebo effect influencing both the patients and assessors. Importantly, there are much fewer concerns regarding side effects with melatonin compared to clonazepam and for that reason, melatonin is almost certainly a safer first-line treatment option for RBD, especially in the elderly. Based on the current scientific evidence, however, our prior assumption that melatonin has a marked clinical effect should be tempered by the observation of marked placebo and/or regression to the mean effects in placebo-controlled trials. Adequately powered RCTs will provide more precise estimates of the true treatment effect size, if any.

Children/adolescents with DSWPD and psychiatric comorbidity — trial protocols and evidence profile indicate strategically timed fast-release melatonin may be effective at specific doses and timings. Strategically timed fast-release melatonin at dosages ranging from 3–5 mg may be effective for children/adolescents with DSWPD and psychiatric comorbidity. Level of reviewed evidence: LOW (Appendix, Table S4). Two randomized, placebo-controlled studies by the same group examined the use of melatonin among children/adolescents with psychiatric comorbidities (all diagnosed with ADHD); participants aged 6–12 years received fast-release melatonin for 4 weeks at doses of 3 or 5 mg at either 18:00 or 19:00, with the more recent study using weight-based dosing 3 mg if < 40 kg and 5 mg if ≥ 40 kg taken at 19:00, while the earlier protocol provided 5 mg at 18:00. No significant group differences were noted with respect to TST, and subjective assessments failed to demonstrate significant group differences in TST (n = 31), ISL (n = 33), or sleep-onset (n = 33) or offset (n = 33) times.

### The efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin for primary sleep disorders. A meta-analysis [^116kBchP]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Exogenous melatonin has been increasingly used in the management of sleep disorders.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin in the management of primary sleep disorders.

Data Sources

A number of electronic databases were searched. We reviewed the bibliographies of included studies and relevant reviews and conducted hand-searching.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for the efficacy review, and controlled trials were eligible for the safety review.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data, while the other verified data extracted. The Random Effects Model was used to analyze data.

Data Synthesis

Melatonin decreased sleep onset latency (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -11.7 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -18.2, -5.2)); it was decreased to a greater extent in people with delayed sleep phase syndrome (WMD: -38.8 minutes; 95% CI: -50.3, -27.3; n = 2) compared with people with insomnia (WMD: -7.2 minutes; 95% CI: -12.0, -2.4; n = 12). The former result appears to be clinically important. There was no evidence of adverse effects of melatonin.

Conclusions

There is evidence to suggest that melatonin is not effective in treating most primary sleep disorders with short-term use (4 weeks or less); however, additional large-scale RCTs are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. There is some evidence to suggest that melatonin is effective in treating delayed sleep phase syndrome with short-term use. There is evidence to suggest that melatonin is safe with short-term use (3 months or less).

### Melatonin effective for some sleep disorders… [^117BAMhK]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with normal sleep patterns, melatonin had a clinically insignificant effect on the time to sleep onset or on the amount of time actually spent asleep. Melatonin in doses of 1 to 3 mg caused an average delay of 12. 7 minutes in the onset of rapid eye movement compared with placebo. In patients with simple insomnia, melatonin helped adults fall asleep an average of 10. 7 minutes faster. Children had a better response, falling asleep an average of 17 minutes sooner. Melatonin was particularly effective in patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome, a condition in which a person's circadian rhythm is misaligned without an external cause such as jet lag or shift work. In these patients, sleep onset was an average of 38. 8 minutes faster.

Melatonin had no effect on sleep quality, wakefulness, total sleep time, or percentage of time spent in REM sleep. In patients with jet lag, melatonin did not decrease sleep onset latency or increase sleep efficiency, sleep quality, or the time spent in REM sleep, although it was effective in increasing the total sleep time. In one study, melatonin had an effect similar to zolpidem in patients with jet lag. Melatonin was not effective in patients with a secondary sleep disorder. Bottom Line: Melatonin in doses from 0. 1 to 10 mg is effective in helping adults and children who have difficulty falling asleep. It is particularly helpful in patients whose circadian rhythm is permanently disrupted. Melatonin increases sleep length, but not sleep quality, in patients who perform shift work or who have jet lag.

### Human phase response curves to three days of daily melatonin: 0.5 mg versus 3.0 mg [^116As1Qu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Phase response curves (PRCs) to melatonin exist, but none compare different doses of melatonin using the same protocol.

Objective

The aim was to generate a PRC to 0.5 mg of oral melatonin and compare it to our previously published 3.0 mg PRC generated using the same protocol.

Design and Setting

The study included two 5-d sessions in the laboratory, each preceded by 7–9 d of fixed sleep times. Each session started and ended with a phase assessment to measure the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). In between were 3 d in an ultradian dim light (< 150 lux)/dark cycle (light:dark, 2.5:1.5).

Participants

Healthy adults (16 men, 18 women) between the ages of 18 and 42 yr participated in the study.

Interventions

During the ultradian days of the laboratory sessions, each participant took one pill per day at the same clock time (0.5 mg melatonin or placebo, double blind, counterbalanced).

Main Outcome Measure

Phase shifts to melatonin were derived by subtracting the phase shift to placebo. A PRC with time of pill administration relative to baseline DLMO and a PRC relative to midpoint of home sleep were generated.

Results

Maximum advances occurred when 0.5 mg melatonin was taken in the afternoon, 2–4 h before the DLMO, or 9–11 h before sleep midpoint. The time for maximum phase delays was not as distinct, but a fitted curve peaked soon after wake time.

Conclusions

The optimal administration time for advances and delays is later for the lower dose of melatonin. When each dose of melatonin is given at its optimal time, both yield similarly sized advances and delays.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^1151F1h2]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Melatonin in ICU practice — evidence-to-recommendation rationale states that melatonin is commonly used to mitigate sleep and circadian disruption in critically ill adults, and endogenous melatonin suppression and circadian disturbances in critical illness provide a rationale for replacement therapy. The conditional recommendation favoring melatonin is based on the reduction of delirium prevalence and perceived improvement in sleep quality balanced against the low risk of adverse events, but these data have limitations which is why a strong recommendation was not provided. Sleep/circadian outcomes were not assessed in many included RCTs, and most RCTs that included sleep as an outcome used subjective measurement tools, which may introduce recall bias, includes only those who can respond, and does not measure sleep architecture.

### Melatonin as a hypnotic: pro [^115afPtT]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

In diurnal species, nocturnal melatonin secretion coincides with the habitual hours of sleep, in contrast to nocturnal animals which are at the peak of their activity while producing melatonin. Studies in humans, diurnal non-human primates, birds and fish show that melatonin treatment can facilitate sleep initiation during the daytime or improve altered overnight sleep. Behaviorally, the sleep-promoting effects of melatonin are distinctly different from those of common hypnotics and are not associated with alterations in sleep architecture. The effects of melatonin on sleep are mediated via specific melatonin receptors and physiologic doses of the hormone, those inducing circulating levels under 200 pg/ml, are sufficient to promote sleep in diurnal species. Aging reduces responsiveness to melatonin treatment and this correlates with reduced functional potency of melatonin receptors. Since melatonin receptors are present in different tissues and organs and involved in multiple physiologic functions, using physiologically relevant doses (0.1–0.3 mg, orally) and time of administration (at bedtime) is recommended, in order to avoid known and unknown side effects of melatonin treatment.

Short term (2 months)

A cross-over clinical trial involving intervention with a high melatonin dosage (12 mg/day) did not provide pain relief (SMD 0.24, 95% CI −0.39 to 0.87; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.31–4.43) and sleep score improvement compared to placebo. Ten participants reported no changes in symptoms, and one participant reported worsening of symptoms. The value of VAS score and serum plasma melatonin concentration was negatively associated, but it was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Two patients in the melatonin group demonstrated a positive correlation between decreased VAS scores and increased sleep hours. The Hamilton rating scale for anxiety (HAM) assessment scores was always higher in the melatonin group than placebo, with a statistically significant decrease in the melatonin group's anxiety score (p < 0.05). An approximate two-fold of patients reported sleep impairment using melatonin (n = 10, 62.5%) compared to placebo (n = 6, 37.5%). Mild daytime sleepiness was seen in melatonin and placebo groups, with high ESS scores but not significant between them (p > 0.05). The main adverse effect of melatonin that leads to the discontinuation of treatment on four patients were heavy tremor, sexual disturbances, blurred vision, and severe heavy headedness. Four patients were dropped from the study due to lack of efficacy, pain improvement, and follow-up loss.

Secondary outcomes

Total sleep time increased by 30.33 min (95% CI 18.96–41.70, 4 studies, high certainty) when assessed by sleep diaries (parent — and self-reported) (see Table 2). This was considered a moderate clinical effect compared to estimates reported at baseline (ranging between 7 and 9.5 h). Further tests for subgroup differences showed no statistical effect for age (p = 0.86). No statistical effect was found on total sleep time when assessed by actigraphy (2.40 min, 95% CI −115.84 to 120.64, 1 study, very low certainty). All forest plots are found in the Supplementary.

Sleep latency was reduced by 18.03 min (95% CI −26.61 to −9.44, 3 studies, high certainty) when assessed using a sleep diary (parent-reported), and by 27.04 min (95% CI −38.07 to −16.01, 1 study, very low certainty) when assessed using actigraphy (see Table 2). Both estimates were considered a moderate clinical effect compared to estimates at baseline (ranging between 51 and 60 min). We found a statistical, yet no clinical effect on sleepiness measured by the Karolinska sleepiness scale (self-rated) (MD −0.57, CI 95% −0.66 to −0.48, 1 study, low certainty) (see Table 2). A potential increase in wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) was found by actigraphy (MD 18.49, CI 95% 5.87–31.11, 1 study, very low certainty). Melatonin showed no statistical impact on all-cause dropouts (RR 2.48, CI 95% 0.39–15.54, 3 studies, moderate certainty) (see Table 2). Melatonin increased the number of participants experiencing non-serious adverse events (RR 3.44, 95% CI 1.25–9.42, 4 studies, moderate certainty) (see Table 2). Forest plots and an overview of reported non-serious adverse events are found in the Supplementary.

None of the studies reported on quality of sleep or daytime functioning at 3–6 months or quality of life. Due to a lack of data, it was not possible to perform subgroup analysis investigating the effect of dosage or release-form.

### Melatonin therapy to improve nocturnal sleep in critically ill patients: encouraging results from a small randomised controlled trial [^111PMcuh]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although suggesting a possible future role of melatonin in the routine care of critically ill patients, our findings need to be confirmed by a larger, possibly multicentre, randomised controlled trial, ideally using polysomnography as a continuous measure of sleep quantity and quality. A 10-mg nocturnal dose of melatonin is excessive in this patient population and reduced doses of 1 to 2 mg could be used in future chronotherapeutic studies.

### Pharmacological interventions for sleepiness and sleep disturbances caused by shift work [^111f2gBi]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are pharmacological interventions associated with better-quality sleep and alertness in shift workers?

Bottom Line

Low-quality evidence shows that melatonin is associated with 24 minutes longer daytime sleep after the shift but not with faster falling asleep compared with placebo. There is no association between hypnotics, such as zopiclone, and sleep outcomes, alertness, or harms. The alertness-promoting medications armodafinil and modafinil are associated with improved alertness during shift work but are also associated with headache and nausea.

### Melatonin and health: an umbrella review of health outcomes and biological mechanisms of action [^113eiGyB]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Quality (and number) of primary studies

Altogether 154 reviews (78.9%) did not evaluate the methodological quality of the primary studies (no validity assessments). In 41 reviews (21.1%) that did undertake this, the methodological quality of the primary data ranged from poor (N = 5) to high (N = 13), with moderate being most commonly reported (N = 18), as assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool or the Jadad Scale. The median number of primary studies included was N = 9 (when possible to estimate).

Melatonin receptor agonists

Melatonin receptor agonists, such as Circadin® (prolonged-release MLT), ramelteon, agomelatine or tasimelteon, bind to and activate the MLT receptors 1 and 2. These analogues of MLT are believed to have the same mechanisms of action as MLT and are typically used for the treatment of sleep disorders and depression. Two reviews of Circadin (prolonged-release MLT), four of ramelteon, two of agomelatine and one of tasimelteon were included. The duration, intensity and frequency varied across the reviews, with 8 mg being most commonly used in ramelteon studies, 2 mg for Circadin; 25–50 mg for agomelatine and 1–50 mg for tasimelteon.

Endogenous vs. exogenous MLT

In total, 31 reviews (15.8%) evaluated both exogenous and endogenous MLT. However, it was often difficult to ascertain the number of studies looking at exogenous MLT vs. endogenous MLT only. The exogenous vs. endogenous MLT doses are also incomparable, as the routes of administration and types of studies differed considerably (optional range 0.003 mg to 3 g).

### Effect of oral melatonin and wearing earplugs and eye masks on nocturnal sleep in healthy subjects in a simulated intensive care unit environment: which might be a more promising strategy for ICU sleep deprivation? [^112shhe2]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In our study, we found that administration of 1 mg of fast-release melatonin was successful in achieving good absorption. The mean maximal serum melatonin concentration was reached at about 1 h after administration, which was close to 20 times higher than the NL-night levels and 12 times higher than baseline levels, and then the levels fell but still remained at a higher level than on the NL, NLP and NLEE nights. Although oral melatonin might result in 10 to 100 times the normal peak night-concentration after ingestion, it has a wide safety margin. It is theoretically possible that high levels of melatonin were achieved with a high dose at night, so that even during the daytime, melatonin blood levels were sufficiently high to promote diurnal sleep as well. Daytime sleep would have then occurred and made nocturnal sleep more difficult. In addition, controlled release formulations would bring an increased risk of prolonged periods of supraphysiologic melatonin levels, therefore, we chose a relatively low dose of fast-released melatonin for our study. However, after melatonin administration the melatonin levels were lower than those in previous studies, perhaps because of overnight illumination exposure. The most suitable dose of melatonin in critically ill patients in ICU should be confirmed further, because Mistraletti et al. found that after administration of indole the melatonin peak was reached earlier in ICU patients than in healthy volunteers, and the rate of melatonin disappearance was slightly slower. In our study, using earplugs and eye masks during the simulated ICU noise and light elevated melatonin level to some degree and advanced the timing of the clock. However, the melatonin level was much lower than in the melatonin group and that is one of the reasons why melatonin has greater benefit on sleep in the simulated ICU environment.
