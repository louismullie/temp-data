## Question

Is sotalol considered first-line therapy for sick sinus syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sotalol is first-line therapy for sick sinus syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what sick sinus syndrome encompasses clinically and pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify the established first-line treatment for SSS. Next, I will examine sotalol's pharmacology and labeled indications. After that, I need to check sotalol's contraindications — especially in the context of SSS — and make sure I interpret any labeling nuances correctly. Finally, I will synthesize why sotalol could worsen SSS and clarify special scenarios like tachy-brady syndrome where a pacemaker changes the equation.

> Let me first confirm what sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is. SSS represents a spectrum of sinus node dysfunction, typically in older adults, characterized by sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial exit block, and often alternating bradyarrhythmias with atrial tachyarrhythmias (tachy-brady syndrome), with symptoms arising from end-organ hypoperfusion such as syncope, presyncope, and dizziness; intrinsic mechanisms include degenerative fibrosis and ion-channel remodeling of the sinoatrial node, though extrinsic factors can exacerbate it.

> Next, I should review the accepted first-line therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — are drugs ever first-line here? The consensus is consistent: remove reversible extrinsic factors when possible, but the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic SSS is atrial or dual-chamber pacing, which improves symptoms and quality of life and reduces certain complications compared with ventricular pacing, even though mortality impact may vary across studies [^111mgTkn] [^115trHF2].

> I will now examine sotalol's pharmacologic profile and labeled indications. Sotalol is a nonselective beta-blocker with additional Class III antiarrhythmic effects that slow sinus rate, decrease AV nodal conduction, and prolong repolarization; it is indicated for maintaining sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation/flutter and for treating life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but it is not indicated for treating sinus node dysfunction or bradyarrhythmias per se [^112Ajea4] [^116nswoy] [^1125CmqL].

> Now, I need to check the contraindications carefully. The FDA labeling lists bradyarrhythmias including sick sinus syndrome and second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker as contraindications to sotalol use, as well as long QT syndromes and certain decompensated states; I initially noted "sinus bradycardia: particularly when heart rate is less than 450 ms", which, wait, let me verify — "450 ms" is a QTc metric, not a heart rate, so that looks like a typographical mix-up in the excerpt, and elsewhere the same labeling emphasizes not initiating when QTc > 450 ms and recognizes sinus bradycardia and SSS as contraindications, which reinforces the core point that sotalol is contraindicated in untreated SSS unless a pacemaker is in place [^112jJ6EA] [^1127Ru4t] [^115M4UpJ].

> Why is this the case mechanistically? Let me think about the electrophysiology. Sotalol's beta-blocking effects increase sinus cycle length and depress AV nodal conduction, while its Class III effects prolong repolarization; in patients with intrinsic sinus node dysfunction, this can unmask or worsen clinically significant bradycardia or pauses, precipitating syncope or even arrest, and bradycardia is a commonly observed adverse reaction with sotalol in clinical use, reinforcing the biologic plausibility of harm in SSS without pacing support [^116nswoy] [^111vH379] [^114uzqeP].

> But wait, what about tachy-brady syndrome — could sotalol be used to suppress atrial tachyarrhythmias there? Hold on, I should verify the sequence of therapy. In tachy-brady SSS, rhythm-control agents like sotalol may be considered for the tachyarrhythmia component only after pacing is established to protect against drug-exacerbated bradycardia, which aligns with the general principle that pacemaker therapy is the foundational intervention in symptomatic SSS and with sotalol's explicit contraindication in SSS without a pacemaker [^111mgTkn] [^115trHF2] [^112jJ6EA].

> I should double-check real-world safety signals around bradycardia with sotalol initiation. Contemporary IV-loading cohorts show that a substantial fraction of patients develop clinically significant bradycardia during initiation — about one in four in some series — and the risk is magnified when concurrent AV nodal blockers are not held, underscoring the bradycardic liability of sotalol even outside the SSS context and supporting a cautious stance in patients predisposed to bradyarrhythmia [^1139fhFr] [^115s7eXr] [^117MdPj4].

> Bringing this together, I need to ensure the final synthesis is precise. Sotalol is not first-line therapy for sick sinus syndrome; the first-line therapy for symptomatic SSS is pacemaker implantation, and sotalol is explicitly contraindicated in SSS without a pacemaker because its beta-blocking and repolarization-prolonging effects can further depress sinus node function and AV conduction, worsening the underlying problem; if atrial tachyarrhythmias require suppression in tachy-brady syndrome, that consideration comes only after pacemaker placement to mitigate bradycardia risk [^111mgTkn] [^115trHF2] [^112jJ6EA] [^1125CmqL].

---

Sotalol is **not first-line** for sick sinus syndrome (SSS) because it can worsen bradycardia [^116nswoy] and cause life-threatening proarrhythmia, including torsades de pointes [^1127Ru4t]. Sotalol is **contraindicated in SSS without a pacemaker** and should only be considered if a permanent pacemaker is in place and other options have failed [^112jJ6EA]. First-line management is **pacemaker implantation** [^111mgTkn], with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for tachyarrhythmias once pacing is established [^115trHF2].

---

## Pharmacological properties of sotalol

Sotalol is a **non-selective beta-blocker with class III antiarrhythmic effects** [^112Ajea4]; it prolongs action potential duration and refractory periods and slows heart rate and AV conduction [^116nswoy]. These effects increase the risk of bradycardia and QT prolongation, especially in patients with intrinsic sinus node dysfunction [^111vH379].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding sotalol use in SSS

Current guidelines and clinical evidence **do not support sotalol as first-line therapy** for SSS [^111mgTkn] because it can exacerbate bradycardia and induce life-threatening arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes [^1127Ru4t]. The FDA explicitly contraindicates sotalol in patients with SSS without a pacemaker [^115M4UpJ] due to these risks [^112jJ6EA].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of sotalol in SSS

Sotalol carries **significant risks** in patients with SSS, including:

- **Bradycardia**: Sotalol's beta-blocking effects can exacerbate sinus node dysfunction, leading to severe bradycardia or sinus arrest [^116nswoy].

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: Sotalol prolongs the QT interval [^1127Ru4t], increasing the risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia [^114uzqeP].

- **Proarrhythmia**: Sotalol can induce new or worsen existing arrhythmias, particularly in patients with underlying sinus node dysfunction [^116VWA3f].

Given these risks, sotalol initiation requires **careful monitoring**, including baseline and serial ECGs, QT interval assessment [^1127Ru4t], and electrolyte monitoring. Hospitalization is recommended at initiation to enable prompt management of potential adverse events [^116VWA3f].

---

## Alternative first-line treatments for SSS

The primary treatment for symptomatic SSS is **permanent pacemaker implantation** [^111mgTkn]. Pacemakers effectively manage bradycardia, improve symptoms, and reduce the risk of syncope and other complications associated with sinus node dysfunction [^115trHF2]. Once pacing is established, **pharmacological therapy may be considered** for associated tachyarrhythmias; beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are commonly used because they control tachyarrhythmias without significantly exacerbating bradycardia when pacing support is available.

---

## Clinical scenarios where sotalol may be considered

Sotalol may be **considered** in specific clinical scenarios where:

- **Permanent pacemaker**: The patient has a permanent pacemaker in place, providing protection against bradycardia [^112jJ6EA].

- **Refractory tachyarrhythmias**: The patient experiences refractory tachyarrhythmias that have not responded to other antiarrhythmic medications [^111CTYsf] [^111Yv6QN].

- **Careful monitoring**: The patient can be closely monitored for QT prolongation and other adverse effects [^116VWA3f].

Even in these scenarios, sotalol should be **used cautiously**, with careful dose titration and regular monitoring of rhythm and QT interval [^115M4UpJ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Sotalol is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for sick sinus syndrome [^111mgTkn] because it can worsen bradycardia and precipitate life-threatening arrhythmias [^1127Ru4t]. The primary treatment for symptomatic SSS is **permanent pacemaker implantation** [^115trHF2]; once pacing is established, beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers can be used to manage associated tachyarrhythmias [^111mgTkn]. Sotalol should be reserved for patients with a pacemaker [^112jJ6EA] in whom other antiarrhythmic medications have failed, with careful monitoring and dose titration [^116VWA3f].

### Diagnosis and treatment of sick sinus syndrome [^111mgTkn]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome comprises a variety of conditions involving sinus node dysfunction and commonly affects elderly persons. While the syndrome can have many causes, it usually is idiopathic. Patients may experience syncope, pre-syncope, palpitations, or dizziness; however, they often are asymptomatic or have subtle or nonspecific symptoms. Sick sinus syndrome has multiple manifestations on electrocardiogram, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and alternating patterns of bradycardia and tachycardia (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome). Diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome can be difficult because of its nonspecific symptoms and elusive findings on electrocardiogram or Holter monitor. The mainstay of treatment is atrial or dual-chamber pacemaker placement, which generally provides effective relief of symptoms and lowers the incidence of atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic events, heart failure, and mortality compared with ventricular pacemakers.

### Sick sinus syndrome: A review [^115trHF2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome refers to a collection of disorders marked by the heart's inability to perform its pacemaking function. Predominantly affecting older adults, sick sinus syndrome comprises various arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias with or without accompanying tachyarrhythmias. At least 50 percent of patients with sick sinus syndrome develop alternating bradycardia and tachycardia, also known as tachy-brady syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome results from intrinsic causes, or may be exacerbated or mimicked by extrinsic factors.

- **Intrinsic causes**: These include degenerative fibrosis, ion channel dysfunction, and remodeling of the sinoatrial node.
- **Extrinsic factors**: These can be pharmacologic, metabolic, or autonomic.

Signs and symptoms are often subtle early on and become more obvious as the disease progresses. They are commonly related to end-organ hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion is most common, with syncope or near-fainting occurring in about one-half of patients. Diagnosis may be challenging and is ultimately made by electrocardiographic identification of the arrhythmia in conjunction with the presence of symptoms.

If electrocardiography does not yield a diagnosis, inpatient telemetry monitoring, outpatient Holter monitoring, event monitoring, or loop monitoring may be used. Electrophysiologic studies also may be used but are not routinely needed. Treatment of sick sinus syndrome includes removing extrinsic factors, when possible, and pacemaker placement. Pacemakers do not reduce mortality, but they can decrease symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^111vH379]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adverse reactions have been linked to the use of sotalol, which are typical of its Class II (beta-blocking) and Class III (cardiac action potential duration prolongation) effects. Commonly documented beta-blocking adverse reactions include bradycardia, dyspnea, and fatigue. Class III effects such as QT interval prolongation are dose-related.

- **Adverse reactions described elsewhere**: Proarrhythmia and negative inotropy are detailed in sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of propafenone and sotalol for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion of recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation [^115gVwjj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

This study was performed to evaluate, using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol, the long-term efficacy and safety of propafenone and sotalol in maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion of recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). The maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with recurrent AF has several potential benefits, the most important being a reduced risk of thromboembolic events.

Three hundred patients with recurrent AF (≥ 4 episodes in the last year) and AF at enrollment lasting < 48 hours were randomized to receive either propafenone (mean daily dose 13 ± 1.5 mg/kg; 102 patients), sotalol (mean daily dose 3 ± 0.4 mg/kg; 106 patients), or placebo (92 patients). After 1-year follow-up, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm were comparable between propafenone (63%) and sotalol (73%) and superior to placebo (35%; p = 0.001 vs. both drugs). Symptomatic recurrences occurred later with propafenone and sotalol than with placebo.

Nine patients (9%) in the propafenone group, 11 (10%) in the sotalol group, and 3 (3%) in the placebo group discontinued therapy due to adverse effects. Malignant nonfatal arrhythmias due to proarrhythmic effects were documented with sotalol only and occurred < 72 hours from the beginning of therapy in 4 patients (4%). During recurrences, the ventricular rate was significantly reduced in patients taking propafenone and sotalol (p = 0.001 for both drugs vs. placebo). The likelihood of remaining in sinus rhythm during follow-up was higher in younger patients with a smaller left atrium.

### Sotalol and a broken heart [^112UT4Lm]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

An 82-year-old woman with persistent atrial fibrillation underwent successful electrical cardioversion and was started on sotalol. After three days of in-hospital observation, she experienced only mild lengthening of the QT interval. Two weeks later, in clinic, following the unexpected death of her husband the previous day, she was noted to have profound QT interval prolongation. Although she was asymptomatic and echocardiography did not reveal regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy, she probably had a forme fruste of stress cardiomyopathy.

Following emotional trauma, a period of heightened vigilance for ventricular proarrhythmia is probably warranted in women treated with antiarrhythmic drugs that lengthen repolarization.

### IV sotalol use in pediatric and congenital heart patients: A multicenter registry study [^112MjXPh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The preferred method of initiating IV sotalol is unclear at present. Valdes et al. used 1 mg/kg over an hour for their acute arrhythmia termination group and 80% to 90% of the patient's prior daily oral maintenance dosage of sotalol divided every 8 to 12 hours over 5 hours in those receiving IV maintenance therapy. Perry et al. reported a standardized target dose of 30 to 40 mg/m² over 15 minutes for the acute arrhythmia termination group and maintenance dosing based on a 1:1 ratio of the recommended oral dose with intermittent doses every 8 to 12 hours to reach a daily dose of 50 mg/m² per day or 3 mg/kg per day infused over 2 hours.

Our data show, for both acute and maintenance dosing, that the mean administration of IV sotalol across multiple centers was 1 mg/kg over a median of 60 minutes. Some centers in this study used an IV sotalol infusion duration of ≤ 30 minutes without complications, consistent with published experience from Perry et al. The median time to arrhythmia termination was longer (44 minutes) when compared with previous studies (time to termination 33 minutes, 14 minutes), likely reflecting variable dosing regimens among participating centers.

The most common arrhythmia substrates were ectopic atrial tachycardia (31%), reentrant SVT (30%), and atrial flutter/fibrillation (17%). Patients with ectopic atrial tachycardia comprised a larger portion of recipients in our study compared with those of Valdes et al. (17%) and a smaller portion compared with Li et al. (43%). Of note, since the start of this study (March 2020), the Food and Drug Administration indications.

### Comparison of safety of sotalol versus amiodarone in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease [^116KyvWg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Sotalol is a commonly prescribed antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) used for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Although randomized studies have found that sotalol can significantly delay time to AF recurrence, its association with mortality is less clear, particularly among those with coronary artery disease.

We examined outcomes of 2,838 patients with coronary artery disease and AF. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling, landmark analysis, and time-dependent covariates for drug therapy, we compared cumulative survival among patients treated with sotalol (n = 226), amiodarone (n = 856), or no AAD (n = 1,756). The median follow-up was 4.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0–7.4). The median age was 68 years (IQR 60–75).

Compared with those treated with amiodarone or no AAD, patients treated with sotalol were less likely to be Black (6% vs. 13% vs. 13%) and have a previous myocardial infarction (35% vs. 51% vs. 48%) or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% (13% vs. 26% vs. 21%). In follow-up, persistence of sotalol was limited; 97% of patients treated with sotalol were treated for < 25% of the follow-up period.

In adjusted analysis accounting for time on therapy, sotalol use was associated with an increased risk of all-cause death compared with no drug (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.96, p = 0.0009), but a decreased risk of death compared with amiodarone (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.91, p = 0.0141).

In conclusion, sotalol therapy was more frequently used in patients with fewer co-morbidities.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115iWvSe]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

In 2019, Dahmane et al. conducted a cost-minimization analysis from the health sector perspective using Monte Carlo simulations to assess the cost savings for accelerated IV sotalol loading compared with a typical 3-day oral sotalol loading protocol. They found cost savings of $3123 with IV sotalol when administered over the course of a 2-day hospitalization and $4820 when completed over a single overnight stay, with the majority of savings coming from room and board expenses and hospital supplies. They noted that some projected savings with the accelerated IV loading protocol were offset by the costs of IV sotalol, which is much more expensive than the oral formulation at their institution ($1400–$2264 per 150 mg vial of IV sotalol vs. $0.10 per 80 mg tablet of oral sotalol). Despite the high cost of IV sotalol, the potential cost savings from reducing admission time, compared to prior studies with IV sotalol initiation, has been estimated between $3000 and $4000 when compared with a 3-day oral load.

### Rate of conversion and recurrence after sotalol treatment in patients with direct current-refractory atrial fibrillation [^113hE3yF]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

A number of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) will not have sinus rhythm (SR) restored by direct current (DC) cardioversion.

- **Hypothesis**: In patients with DC-refractory AF, oral pretreatment with sotalol increases the success rate at DC cardioversion.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with persistent AF, refractory at a first DC cardioversion, were prospectively included. A comparative group of patients with AF not refractory at DC cardioversion was studied. Oral sotalol treatment was started after unsuccessful DC cardioversion and given at least 7 days before renewed cardioversion. Four weeks after cardioversion, an electrocardiogram was performed.

- **Results**: In all, 53 patients were enrolled in the study. Forty-three (81%) in the sotalol group regained sinus rhythm (SR): 10 (19%) of these converted pharmacologically and 33 (62%) following a second DC cardioversion. SR was never restored in 10 patients (19%). After 4 weeks, SR was maintained in 29 patients (67%). The comparative group included 132 patients and differed significantly from the DC-refractory patients only with regard to weight. After 4 weeks, SR was maintained by 50 patients (37%) in this group.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with persistent AF refractory to DC cardioversion, oral pretreatment with sotalol results in a high rate of SR restoration, either pharmacologically or by DC cardioversion. Maintenance of SR at 4 weeks is of sufficient clinical relevance to consider this treatment option in patients with AF refractory to DC cardioversion.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111uth1C]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box warning and societal recommendations advocating for a three-day hospitalization and inpatient monitoring for QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias during the initiation of sotalol therapy, considerable variability exists in how this drug is loaded in clinical practice. The impact of this variability on hospitalization costs and patient outcomes is unknown. One potential avenue for shortening a patient's length of stay would be to administer sotalol in a formulation that allows for a more rapid achievement of steady-state concentration, facilitating the earlier detection of potential side effects.

Intravenous (IV) sotalol was initially given FDA approval for use in 2010 as a substitute for oral therapy in patients unable to take medications orally. In March 2020, IV sotalol received FDA approval for use as part of the drug's initial loading protocol. The IV administration shortens the time to steady-state plasma concentration from three days to just one to two days (single IV dose plus one to two oral doses). The ability to reduce hospital length of stay could significantly reduce costs associated with inpatient sotalol initiation and mitigate the overall economic burden that atrial fibrillation (AF) imposes on the healthcare system. Furthermore, protocol-based IV sotalol administration may eliminate the dosing variability that currently exists in clinical practice and potentially imparts the risk of drug underdosing or overdosing.

This study aims to investigate the average length of stay for oral sotalol initiation admissions and evaluate the costs associated with different dosing approaches.

### Rapid loading of sotalol or amiodarone for management of recent onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation: a randomized, digoxin-controlled trial [^1178XVrt]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Amiodarone and sotalol are commonly used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, but the efficacy of these agents administered as high-dose infusions for rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation is unknown. Use in this context would facilitate drug initiation in patients in whom ongoing prophylactic therapy is indicated.

- **Methods**: We assessed the efficacy and safety of rapid high-dose intravenous infusions of amiodarone and sotalol for heart rate control and rapid reversion to sinus rhythm in patients who came to the emergency department with recent-onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Patients (n = 140) were randomized to receive 1.5 mg/kg of sotalol infused in 10 minutes, 10 mg/kg of amiodarone in 30 minutes, or 500 microg of digoxin in 20 minutes. Electrical cardioversion was attempted for patients not converting to sinus rhythm within 12 hours.

- **Results**: The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone resulted in more rapid rate control than digoxin. Each of the three trial strategies resulted in similar rates of pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm (amiodarone, 51%; sotalol, 44%; digoxin, 50%; P = not significant). The overall rates of cardioversion after trial drug infusion and defibrillation were high for all groups (amiodarone, 94%; sotalol, 95%; digoxin, 98%; P = not significant), but there was a trend toward a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions in the amiodarone group.

- **Conclusion**: The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone in patients with symptomatic recent-onset atrial fibrillation results in rapid control of ventricular rate.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^1139fhFr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Clinical and safety outcomes**: Changes in heart rate and QT/QTc interval over the course of IV sotalol initiation are described in Table 2. At the end of the 60-minute IV sotalol infusion, the mean QT/QTc interval had increased from baseline by 29.7 ms; at discharge, after two additional oral doses, the QT/QTc interval had increased from baseline by 29.8 ms.

Of the 29 patients undergoing IV sotalol initiation, 7 had discontinuation of the infusion due to significant bradycardia. Six out of seven of these patients were on AV nodal blocking agents (five on metoprolol and one on diltiazem) that were not discontinued or dose reduced before the start of IV sotalol. None of the patients who developed significant bradycardia required transcutaneous pacing or IV chronotropic support. Conversion to oral sotalol load was attempted for two of these patients but ultimately aborted due to persistent bradycardia. One patient received 45 minutes of the IV sotalol infusion before discontinuation for bradycardia and was discharged after two additional oral doses. The other four patients were discharged off sotalol without attempts at further oral loading. Of the seven patients who developed significant bradycardia, three also had prolongation of the QT interval that would have required discontinuation. A total of 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%) underwent successful IV sotalol initiation. Of these, 10 out of 22 patients (45.5%) were discharged on the 80 mg dose of sotalol and 12 out of 22 patients (54.5%) were discharged on the 120 mg dose of sotalol.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112TmzWq]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

A total of 133 AF/AFL patients were admitted for sotalol initiation between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, and met the study inclusion criteria. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics are reported for the study population in Table 1. The average age was 70.0 ± 12.3 years, and 60.2% were male. Noteworthy baseline comorbidities included hypertension (82.7%), hyperlipidemia (72.2%), diabetes (36.1%), coronary artery disease (53.4%), cardiomyopathy (32.3%), past or smoking history (30.1%), and obstructive sleep apnea (40.6%). Mean baseline creatinine was 1.08 ± 0.45 (median: 0.97). Prior ablation occurred in 20.3% of patients, and 32.3% had undergone cardioversion before enrollment. A total of 94.0% of patients were admitted with a primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, and 23.2% with a diagnosis of atrial flutter (with some patients having a prior diagnosis of both arrhythmias). Patients presented with a mean ejection fraction of 59.9 ± 7.8% and a mean QTc of 453.7 ± 37.6 ms before sotalol dosing; a baseline left bundle branch block was present in 4.5%, and right bundle branch block in an additional 8.3%.

### Pediatric dosing of intravenous sotalol based on body surface area in patients with arrhythmia [^1139JW9P]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sotalol is a potent antiarrhythmic agent with class III antiarrhythmic and beta-blocking properties. It is often used in the treatment of pediatric arrhythmias with good results. Until recently, the English literature has predominantly described the efficacy of the oral sotalol formulation in pediatric patients. However, oral sotalol has a slow onset and is not practical for urgent or emergency situations requiring the termination of hemodynamically compromising or life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. Intravenous sotalol is available in the United States and is advisable in emergency situations because therapeutic blood levels can be achieved faster, and intravenous administration overcomes the uncertainty of variable oral absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.

In a recently published study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous sotalol in pediatric patients with incessant tachyarrhythmias, finding it effective and safe. To our knowledge, this is the first and only publication regarding the intravenous use of sotalol in a pediatric population in the English literature. We employed a dosing regimen based on the body weight of the patients. In the United States, the recommendation for intravenous sotalol dosing in pediatric patients is based on body surface area (BSA). The purpose of this paper is to compare the body weight-based dosing regimen to sotalol dosing expressed in terms of BSA as mg/m². This may aid physicians in making informed decisions on dosing strategies.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114Z5CEx]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

This study compared hospitalization costs derived from real-world data of patients admitted for oral sotalol initiation with theoretical cost savings projected from a proposed IV sotalol loading protocol. The projected cost savings reported support efforts to implement an IV sotalol loading protocol. However, real-world data from patients treated with IV sotalol are still needed to determine whether proposed IV loading protocols can truly be completed over a single overnight hospitalization and to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of IV sotalol loading.

Additionally, some centers, particularly those outside the United States, have implemented novel protocols for outpatient sotalol loading using ambulatory cardiac monitoring (e.g. cardiac event monitors, or implantable electronic pacemaker or defibrillator data) to monitor for ECG abnormalities such as QT prolongation and ventricular ectopy in the outpatient setting while loading patients with sotalol. If these novel approaches for outpatient sotalol loading prove safe and effective, they may provide viable and cost-effective alternatives to both oral and IV inpatient loading protocols. Additional studies are needed on both IV sotalol and these novel outpatient oral sotalol loading strategies to determine the feasibility, efficacy, safety, and costs associated with each to identify the optimal drug formulation and loading protocols for this medication.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias-a PEAKS Registry substudy [^112rdy25]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry received approval from the University of Utah Institutional Review Board. Each participating center obtained approval from their respective IRB, adhering to local regulations. All patients enrolled provided written, informed consent. The PEAKS Registry was a multicenter, observational registry focused on patients undergoing elective loading of sotalol for the treatment of atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation (AT/AF). This involved a new intravenous loading protocol. Previously described details and primary results demonstrated acceptable feasibility and safety.

	- Overall, 167 patients from 10 sites were followed, with retrospective data collection for some and prospective enrollment of more than half. Inclusion criteria required patients to be admitted solely for intravenous sotalol loading without other active arrhythmias and without standard exclusions for class III antiarrhythmic drugs. While adhering to the package labeling for intravenous sotalol loading was not mandatory, all care was provided at the discretion of the treating physician in line with local practices and standards. Generally, patients were treated consistent with the package insert during loading logistics: they were observed in-hospital during the infusion of IV sotalol and for two subsequent oral doses, with regular monitoring of the QTc using 12-lead ECGs.

	- The treating clinician determined the target oral sotalol dose, following the package insert guidelines.

### Mortality and ventricular arrhythmias in patients on d, l-sotalol for rhythm control of atrial fibrillation: A nationwide cohort study [^111TToV6]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Use of d, l-sotalol for rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has raised safety concerns due to the limited number of previous randomized studies not designed for mortality outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare mortality and ventricular arrhythmias incidences in AF patients treated with d, l-sotalol for rhythm control versus matched control patients treated with cardioselective beta-blockers.

- **Methods**: This population-based cohort study included AF patients from the Swedish National Patient Registry (2006–2017) who underwent rhythm control following a second cardioversion. Incidence rates (IRs) and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for mortality and a composite endpoint of cardiac arrest/death and ventricular arrhythmias were calculated for the overall cohort and a 1:1 propensity score matched cohort of d, l-sotalol versus beta-blocker treatment.

- **Results**: Among patients treated with d, l-sotalol (n = 4987) and beta-blockers (n = 27,078) with a mean follow-up of 458 days, all-cause mortality was lower in patients treated with d, l-sotalol: IR 1.21; 95% confidence interval 0.95–1.52 versus 2.42 (2.26–2.60) deaths per 100 patient-years; aHR 0.66 (0.52–0.83). The difference in mortality persisted in the propensity score matched comparison (n = 4953 in each group): aHR 0.63 (0.48–0.86). No differences were observed in the composite outcome: IR in propensity cohorts 2.13 (1.78–2.52) versus 2.07 (1.73–2.53) events per 100 years; aHR 1.01 (0.78–1.29).

In conclusion, there was no excess mortality with d, l-sotalol compared with cardioselective beta-blockers in patients undergoing rhythm control.

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^112Ajea4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Sotalol has both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class II) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class III) antiarrhythmic properties. Intravenous sotalol is a racemic mixture of d- and l-sotalol. Both isomers have similar Class III antiarrhythmic effects, while the l-isomer is responsible for virtually all of the beta-blocking activity. The beta-blocking effect of sotalol is non-cardioselective, half maximal at oral doses of about 80 mg/day and maximal at oral doses between 320 and 640 mg/day. Significant beta-blockade occurs at oral doses as low as 25 mg; significant Class III effects can be seen following a single oral or IV dose of 80 or 75 mg, respectively.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^117QVNhd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular outcomes are compared based on the timing of index inpatient sotalol initiation. There were no significant differences in outcomes observed when comparing time-based loading strategies. AF refers to atrial fibrillation, Aflutter to atrial flutter, VF to ventricular fibrillation, and VT to ventricular tachycardia.

The rate of QTc prolongation (> 500 ms) observed during follow-up differed significantly based on the length of the initial hospitalization. Postdischarge QTc prolongation occurred in 17.9% and 21.7% of patients initially admitted for 1 and 2 days, respectively. It occurred in 52.9% of patients admitted for 3 days, and 40.5% of patients who spent 4 or more days in the hospital during their index hospitalization for sotalol initiation, prompting dose titration. Death rates during follow-up based upon time of hospitalization were: 3.6% for 1 day, 17.4% for 2 days, 5.9% for 3 days, and 17.1% for hospitalizations of 4 or more days. These differences in death rates between groups did not achieve statistical significance (p = .08).

The remaining posthospitalization outcomes, including recurrence of AF and AFL, bradycardia, stroke, and readmission rates, were similar regardless of the length of stay during index admission for sotalol initiation.

The percentage of patients who developed QT prolongation is shown and stratified by the number of doses of sotalol received during the index hospitalization. Patients with longer stays had higher rates of QT prolongation, which may be related to the stay and additional need for drug titration.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1174KfVf]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Bradycardia and QTc prolongation were the most common in-patient side effects associated with sotalol initiation, occurring in approximately 20%–30% of patients during the index hospitalization. Despite the high rates of bradycardia and QTc prolongation, no ventricular arrhythmias occurred during hospitalization.

Postdischarge bradycardia and QTc prolongation were also common, occurring in 30%–40% of patients at 12-month follow-up. Long-term treatment failure, such as reAF or AFL, was also common, occurring in roughly one-third of patients. The high rate of treatment failure may have been due to the fact that approximately one-third of all patients were discharged on less than the minimum recommended dosage of sotalol. Serious adverse events were more common during the follow-up period, with death occurring in 10% of patients and stroke occurring in 3%, which reflects, in part, the inherent cardiovascular risk factors in many patients for whom sotalol is used for atrial fibrillation.

The economics behind hospital length of stay and its effects on costs to the healthcare system have been well studied, with many strategies having been employed to shorten patients' length of stay and thereby reduce hospitalization costs. These strategies have been implemented across a spectrum of medical specialties, including cardiology. Elective cardiac procedures could benefit immensely from interventions that facilitate same-day or short-stay hospital discharge. In 2018, Amin et al. assessed the costs associated with same-day discharge following elective percutaneous coronary interventions.

### Meta-analysis of the risk of torsades de pointes in patients treated with intravenous racemic sotalol [^113pZiRa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) racemic sotalol is useful for the treatment of multiple tachydysrhythmias. The authors hypothesized that the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) in patients treated with a single IV infusion of sotalol is lower than the 2–4% risk associated with chronic oral sotalol therapy.

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE search under the subject heading "sotalol" was made of all publications involving humans written in English or German from 1966 to October 1, 2000. A meta-analysis of all original reports, including patients who were given a single infusion of at least 1.5 mg/kg or 100 mg of IV sotalol over 30 minutes or less, was performed. Potential variables predictive of TdP were assessed. The primary outcome was the observation of TdP associated with IV sotalol infusion. Secondary measurements included hypotension, bradycardia, and worsening of congestive heart failure. All excluded studies and case reports were also examined for evidence of TdP associated with IV sotalol treatment.

- **Results**: The search included 1,005 publications. There were 37 reports in which 962 patients received IV sotalol and met the inclusion criteria. There was one report of self-terminating TdP lasting 10 seconds among the 962 patients included in the study. There was no report of TdP associated with only IV racemic sotalol administration in any of the excluded studies. Assuming that the risk of TdP is homogeneous in the population of patients treated with IV sotalol, based on the 962 included patients, the rate of TdP is 0.1% (95% CI = 0.003% to 0.6%).

- **Conclusions**: The overall risk of developing TdP in patients treated with IV racemic sotalol appears to be lower than previously associated with chronic oral sotalol therapy.

### Betapace AF [^116VWA3f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **General safety measures for initiation of oral sotalol therapy**: Withdraw other antiarrhythmic therapy before starting Betapace/Betapace AF and monitor for a minimum of 2 to 3 plasma half-lives prior to initiating Betapace/Betapace AF therapy if the patient's clinical condition permits [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Hospitalize patients being initiated or re-initiated on sotalol for at least 3 days or until steady-state drug levels are achieved, in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Initiate oral sotalol therapy in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious arrhythmias. Perform a baseline ECG to determine the QT interval and measure and normalize serum potassium and magnesium levels before initiating therapy. Measure serum creatinine and calculate an estimated creatinine clearance in order to establish the appropriate dosing interval. Monitor QTc 2 to 4 hours after each uptitration in dose. Discharge patients on sotalol therapy from an in-patient setting with an adequate supply of sotalol to allow uninterrupted therapy until the patient can fill a sotalol prescription. Advise patients who miss a dose to take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double the dose or shorten the dosing interval.

- **Adult dose for ventricular arrhythmias**: The recommended initial dose is 80 mg twice daily. This dose may be increased in increments of 80 mg per day every 3 days provided the QTc < 500 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Continually monitor patients until steady state blood levels are achieved.

### Amiodarone versus sotalol for atrial fibrillation [^111CTYsf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The optimal pharmacologic means to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation remains controversial.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 665 patients who were receiving anticoagulants and had persistent atrial fibrillation to receive amiodarone (267 patients), sotalol (261 patients), or placebo (137 patients) and monitored them for 1 to 4.5 years. The primary endpoint was the time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation beginning on day 28, determined by means of weekly transtelephonic monitoring.

- **Results**: Spontaneous conversion occurred in 27.1 percent of the amiodarone group, 24.2 percent of the sotalol group, and 0.8 percent of the placebo group; direct cardioversion failed in 27.7 percent, 26.5 percent, and 32.1 percent, respectively. The median times to recurrence of atrial fibrillation were 487 days in the amiodarone group, 74 days in the sotalol group, and 6 days in the placebo group according to intention to treat, and 809, 209, and 13 days, respectively, according to treatment received. Amiodarone was superior to sotalol (P < 0.001) and to placebo (P < 0.001), and sotalol was superior to placebo (P < 0.001). In patients with ischemic heart disease, the median time to a recurrence of atrial fibrillation was 569 days with amiodarone therapy and 428 days with sotalol therapy (P = 0.53). Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm significantly improved the quality of life and exercise capacity. There were no significant differences in major adverse events among the three groups.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias-a PEAKS registry substudy [^111BJv9C]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Sotalol is used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm among patients with atrial fibrillation. However, there is discretion regarding the dosing of chronic therapy, and the target oral dose dictates infusion doses for intravenous sotalol loading. At the time of writing, use and outcomes by dose are not well-described.

- **Methods**: In the Prospective Evaluation Analysis and Kinetics of IV Sotalol (PEAKS) Registry, we analyzed outcomes among patients undergoing elective IV sotalol load for atrial arrhythmias (AT/AF). Baseline characteristics, changes in ECG parameters, in-hospital adverse events, and arrhythmia outcomes were compared based on target oral dose (80mg vs. 120mg).

- **Results**: Among 163 total patients, 85 (52%) underwent loading anticipating a target oral dose of 80mg, compared with 78 (48%) for 120mg. Those targeting 80mg were older (median age 70 vs. 66, p < 0.001), with a similar proportion female (24% vs. 21%, p = 0.71), and without significant differences in comorbidities or renal function. Patients targeted for 80mg were less frequently kept in the hospital for 2 oral doses after intravenous infusion (45% vs. 89%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of sinus rhythm or adverse events during loading.

- **Conclusions**: Selection of target oral sotalol dose (120 vs. 80mg) does not appear to be driven by patient characteristics and may represent an opportunity for improved treatment. In-hospital adverse events are low overall without differences between doses.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^115s7eXr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

Oral sotalol initiation requires a multiple-day inpatient admission to monitor for QT prolongation during loading. A one-day intravenous (IV) sotalol loading protocol was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in March 2020, but limited data on clinical use and administration currently exists. This study describes the implementation of an IV sotalol protocol within an integrated health system, provides initial efficacy and safety outcomes, and examines the length of stay (LOS) compared with oral sotalol initiation.

- **Methods**: IV sotalol was administered according to a prespecified initiation protocol to adult patients with refractory atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. Baseline characteristics, safety and feasibility outcomes, and LOS were compared with patients receiving oral sotalol over a similar time period.

- **Results**: From January 2021 to June 2022, a total of 29 patients (average age 66.0 ± 8.6 years, 27.6% women) underwent IV sotalol load, and 20 patients (average age 60.4 ± 13.9 years, 65.0% women) underwent oral sotalol load. The load was successfully completed in 22/29 (75.9%) patients receiving IV sotalol and 20/20 (100%) of patients receiving oral sotalol, although 7/20 of the oral sotalol patients (35.0%) required dose reduction. Adverse events interrupting IV sotalol infusion included bradycardia (seven patients, 24.1%) and QT prolongation (three patients, 10.3%). No patients receiving IV or oral sotalol developed sustained ventricular arrhythmias before discharge. LOS for patients completing IV load was 2.6 days shorter (mean 1.0 vs. 3 days).

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112aGPuc]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

Sotalol was dosed twice daily based on prescribing physician preferences, with ECGs performed routinely every 12 hours (1–2 hours after each dose of sotalol). Within the study population, 24 patients (18.1%) received only two doses, 53 (39.8%) received only three doses, 18 (13.5%) received only four doses, 13 (9.8%) received only five doses, and 25 (18.8%) received six doses or more. The mean QTc before sotalol initiation was 453.7 ± 37.6 ms. After the first six doses of sotalol, the mean QTc of this population that remained on therapy was unchanged at 457.4 ± 37.6 ms.

The number of days spent in the hospital based on twice-daily in-patient dosing was as follows:

- **1 day**: 42.1%
- **2 days**: 17.3%
- **3 days**: 12.8%
- **≥ 4 days**: 26.3%

On average, patients were in the hospital for 3.9 ± 4.6 days (median: 2.2 days). In-hospital outcomes included:

- **Death**: 2 patients (1.5%)
- **Stroke**: 1 patient (0.8%)
- **VT/VF**: 0 patients (0%)
- **Bradycardia (< 50 bpm)**: 37 patients (27.8%)

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^115VXAJG]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

There are limited comparative data on safety and efficacy within commonly used Vaughan-Williams (VW) class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF).

We hypothesized that dronedarone and sotalol, two commonly prescribed VW class III AADs with class II properties, have different safety and efficacy effects in patients with nonpermanent AF.

A systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE®, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to June 15, 2021 (NCT05279833). Clinical trials and observational studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of dronedarone or sotalol in adults with AF were included. Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to quantify comparative safety and efficacy. Where feasible, we performed sensitivity analyses by including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Of 3581 records identified through database searches, 37 unique studies (23 RCTs, 13 observational studies, and 1 nonrandomized trial) were included in the NMA. Dronedarone was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of all-cause death compared to sotalol (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38 [95% credible interval, CrI: 0.19, 0.74]). The association was numerically similar in the sensitivity analysis (HR = 0.46 [95% CrI: 0.21, 1.02]). AF recurrence and cardiovascular death results were not significantly different between dronedarone and sotalol in all-studies and sensitivity analyses.

### Comparison of beta-blockers, amiodarone plus beta-blockers, or sotalol for prevention of shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators: The OPTIC study: A randomized trial [^111Yv6QN]. JAMA (2006). High credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is effective but is associated with high-voltage shocks that are painful. The objective of this study was to determine whether amiodarone plus beta-blocker or sotalol are better than beta-blocker alone for the prevention of ICD shocks.

A randomized controlled trial with blinded adjudication of events was conducted, involving 412 patients from 39 outpatient ICD clinical centers located in Canada, Germany, the United States, England, Sweden, and Austria. The study was conducted from January 13, 2001, to September 28, 2004. Patients were eligible if they had received an ICD within 21 days for inducible or spontaneously occurring ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

Patients were randomized to treatment for one year with amiodarone plus beta-blocker, sotalol alone, or beta-blocker alone. The primary outcome measure was ICD shock for any reason.

Shocks occurred in 41 patients (38.5%) assigned to beta-blocker alone, 26 patients (24.3%) assigned to sotalol, and 12 patients (10.3%) assigned to amiodarone plus beta-blocker. A reduction in the risk of shock was observed with the use of either amiodarone plus beta-blocker or sotalol versus beta-blocker alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.68; p < 0.001). Amiodarone plus beta-blocker significantly reduced the risk of shock compared with beta-blocker alone (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14–0.52; p < 0.001) and sotalol (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22–0.85; p = 0.02). There was a trend for sotalol to reduce shocks compared with beta-blocker alone (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–1.01; p = 0.055).

### Aim-AF: A physician survey in the United States and Europe [^111ReZpC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The initiation of AAD therapy reveals a notable number of respondents initiated sotalol therapy outside a hospital setting (53%). While this does not directly contradict recommendations, the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines state that hospital initiation of sotalol should be considered. As such, these responses suggest deviation from guidelines. A number of respondents (United States only) initiated dofetilide outside a hospital setting (16%). This does not follow the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines or the US Food and Drug Administration labeling for this agent, which recommend inpatient initiation of dofetilide because of QT prolongation and risk of torsades de pointes.

Monitoring of patients receiving AADs is recommended by guidelines to assess close monitoring of proarrhythmic risk factors in individuals using AADs. In general, respondents requested routine investigations (at least annually) most often with amiodarone. ECGs were routinely requested by 80% of respondents with amiodarone, sotalol, and class Ic drugs. Routine requests for electrolyte monitoring were similar between all AADs, but notably low for sotalol (52%) and class Ic drugs (50%). Renal function monitoring was also notably low with sotalol (57%) and dofetilide (US respondents only; 62%), despite both guidelines recommending electrolyte and renal function monitoring for all patients receiving sotalol. Respiratory function monitoring was requested by 64% of respondents with amiodarone and 14% with dronedarone. Monitoring of hepatic function with amiodarone, dronedarone, and class Ic drugs was requested by 84%, 57%, and 50% of respondents, respectively.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of sotalol versus dronedarone after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^111W4EsW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Atrial tachyarrhythmias are common after atrial fibrillation ablation, hence adjunctive antiarrhythmic drug therapy is often employed. Data on the effectiveness and safety of dronedarone and sotalol post-ablation are limited. Here, we compared health outcomes of ablated patients treated with dronedarone versus sotalol.

- **Methods and results**: A comparative analysis of propensity score–matched retrospective cohorts was executed using IBM MarketScan Research Databases. Patients treated with dronedarone following atrial fibrillation ablation were matched 1:1 to those treated with sotalol between January 1, 2013, and March 31, 2018. Outcomes of interest included cardiovascular hospitalization, proarrhythmia, repeat ablation, and cardioversion. This study was exempt from institutional review board review.

Among the 30,696 patients who underwent atrial fibrillation ablation, 2086 were treated with dronedarone and 3665 with sotalol post-ablation. Propensity‐score matching resulted in 1815 patients receiving dronedarone matched 1:1 to those receiving sotalol. The risk of cardiovascular hospitalization was lower with dronedarone versus sotalol at 3 months (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61–0.97]), 6 months (aHR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.63–0.93]), and 12 months after ablation (aHR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.66–0.93]). The risk of repeat ablation and cardioversion generally did not differ between the two groups. A lower risk of proarrhythmia was associated with dronedarone versus sotalol at 3 months (aHR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.64–0.90]), 6 months (aHR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70–0.93]), and 12 months (aHR, 0.

### Effectiveness of sotalol as first-line therapy for fetal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias [^111ghN1g]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Fetal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial flutter (AF) can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Digoxin is often used as a first-line therapy but can be ineffective and poorly transferred to the fetus in the presence of fetal hydrops. As an alternative to digoxin monotherapy, we have been using sotalol at presentation in fetuses with SVT or AF that are at risk of developing hydrops to achieve more rapid control of the arrhythmia.

The present study was a retrospective review of the clinical, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic data from all pregnancies with fetal tachycardia diagnosed and managed at a single center from 2004 to 2008. Of 29 affected pregnancies, 21 (16 SVT and 5 AF) were treated with sotalol at presentation, with or without the co-administration of digoxin. Of the 21, 11 (6 SVT and 5 AF) experienced resolution of the tachycardia within 5 days (median, 1 day). Six others showed some response, such as less frequent tachycardia, rate slowing, and resolution of hydrops, without complete conversion.

In one fetus with a slow response, the mother opted for pregnancy termination. The five survivors with a slow response were all difficult to treat postnatally, including one requiring radiofrequency ablation as a neonate. One fetus developed blocked atrial extrasystoles after one dose of sotalol and was prematurely delivered due to fetal bradycardia. Three grossly hydropic fetuses with SVT showed no response and died within 1 to 3 days of treatment.

In conclusion, transplacental sotalol, alone or combined with digoxin, is effective for the treatment of fetal SVT and AF, although outcomes can vary depending on individual fetal conditions.

### Defining cardiomyocyte repolarization response to pharmacotherapy in long-QT syndrome type 3 [^115ZMQYD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We investigated the effects of sotalol, a mixed class II and class III antiarrhythmic drug known for its high risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmia in patients with LQTS. Sotalol exhibited a dose-dependent prolongation of the FPDc from 0.1 to 30 μmol on all clones compared with the baseline (P < 0.05), with even low concentrations (0.1 and 0.3 μmol) showing a significant increase in FPDc (P < 0.01) on control hiPSC-CMs.

When the FPDc values were normalized to their baseline values, there was relatively little difference in proportional change with escalating doses of sotalol up to 3 μmol in any tested clone, suggesting minimal genetic background modifying effect.

### Pharmacologic prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery: A systematic review [^113aLFuZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Sotalol is a β-blocker that also possesses Class III anti-arrhythmic characteristics. The effectiveness of sotalol has been proven in placebo-controlled trials. Pfisterer et al. randomized 255 patients, who were referred for CABG or aortic valve operation, to receive either 80 mg of sotalol orally or a matching placebo. Sotalol significantly reduced (p = 0.0012) the rate of postoperative supraventricular tachy-arrhythmia from 46% (placebo) to 26%, as well as the length of hospital stay (p < 0.05). Preoperative β-blocker therapy was stopped before the surgery, which might have increased the incidence of SVA arrhythmia in the placebo group.

Gomes et al. randomized 130 patients who underwent open-heart surgery to receive sotalol (80 mg to 120 mg) or placebo. Sotalol significantly decreased postoperative AF (12.5%) compared to placebo (38%) with p < 0.001. An important limitation was the low number of participants. Several randomized controlled trials compared sotalol to conventional β-blockers. The largest study was by Suttorp et al, who performed a four-arm study comparing low or high doses of sotalol or propranolol in 429 patients. Sotalol 40 mg tds resulted in an incidence of 14% of AF compared with a 19% incidence of low-dose propranolol, revealing no statistical significance. Auer et al. randomized 312 patients who underwent cardiac surgery into four groups: 1. Metoprolol in combination with oral amiodarone, 2. Metoprolol, 3. Sotalol, 4. Placebo. The incidence of AF was 32% with sotalol and 40% with metoprolol, although this was again non-significant.

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^112712zF]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

Oral sotalol initiation requires a multiple-day, inpatient admission to monitor for QT prolongation during loading. A 1-day intravenous (IV) sotalol loading protocol was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in March 2020, but limited data on clinical use and administration currently exists. This study describes the implementation of an IV sotalol protocol within an integrated health system, provides initial efficacy and safety outcomes, and examines the length of stay (LOS) compared with oral sotalol initiation.

- **Methods**: IV sotalol was administered according to a prespecified initiation protocol to adult patients with refractory atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. Baseline characteristics, safety and feasibility outcomes, and LOS were compared with patients receiving oral sotalol over a similar time period.

- **Results**: From January 2021 to June 2022, a total of 29 patients (average age 66.0 ± 8.6 years, 27.6% women) underwent IV sotalol loading and 20 patients (average age 60.4 ± 13.9 years, 65.0% women) underwent oral sotalol loading. The load was successfully completed in 22/29 (75.9%) patients receiving IV sotalol and 20/20 (100%) of patients receiving oral sotalol, although 7/20 of the oral sotalol patients (35.0%) required dose reduction. Adverse events interrupting IV sotalol infusion included bradycardia (seven patients, 24.1%) and QT prolongation (three patients, 10.3%). No patients receiving IV or oral sotalol developed sustained ventricular arrhythmias before discharge. LOS for patients completing the IV load was 2.6 days shorter (mean 1.0 vs. 3.6, p <).

### Betapace AF [^115M4UpJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

To minimize the risk of drug-induced arrhythmia, it is essential to initiate or reinitiate oral sotalol in a facility capable of providing cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Sotalol can cause life-threatening ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation. If the QT interval extends to 500 msec or greater, the dose should be reduced, the dosing interval lengthened, or the drug discontinued.

It is important to calculate creatinine clearance to determine appropriate dosing. For complete boxed warning information, refer to the full prescribing information. Betapace/Betapace AF can cause life-threatening ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation. If the QT interval reaches 500 msec or greater, reduce the dose, lengthen the dosing interval, or discontinue the drug. Initiate or reinitiate treatment in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Adjust the dosing interval based on creatinine clearance.

### Sotalol dosing and outcomes among patients undergoing intravenous loading for atrial arrhythmias-a PEAKS registry substudy [^117JRk2k]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

- **Proportion of patients in sinus rhythm**: This section details the proportion of patients in sinus rhythm throughout sotalol loading, stratified by the target oral sotalol dose.

- **Heart rate and QTc trends**: Observations of heart rate and QTc trends during sotalol loading are discussed, focusing on patients targeting an oral dose of 80 mg (A) and 120 mg (B). Actual times of recorded tracings varied by group, resulting in different x‐axis scales.

- **Changes in ECG parameters**: Before discharge, changes in ECG parameters for sotalol loading are stratified by target oral sotalol dose.

Adverse clinical outcomes were rare and have been reported previously. They included symptomatic or actionable bradycardia (n = 5 for 80 mg, n = 5 for 120 mg) and QTc prolongation requiring dose adjustment or discontinuation (n = 1 for 80 mg, n = 3 for 120 mg).

### Implementation of an intravenous sotalol initiation protocol: Implications for feasibility, safety, and length of stay [^117MdPj4]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

In this study, intravenous sotalol was found to be a safe and well-tolerated method of sotalol initiation for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Almost one in four patients undergoing intravenous sotalol initiation experienced serious bradycardia; however, six out of seven of these patients were on AV nodal blocking agents at the time of initiation. Discontinuing or dose reducing these agents before intravenous sotalol initiation may help to mitigate these effects. QT prolongation was noted only in the context of serious bradycardia in our intravenous sotalol cohort, with a rate of approximately 10%, matching those found in other real-world data. No patients undergoing oral sotalol initiation had the drug discontinued due to bradycardia or QT prolongation, but 35% of the patients had doses reduced to less efficacious levels. No patients in either group experienced life-threatening sustained ventricular arrhythmias during their hospitalization. Notably, patients undergoing intravenous sotalol initiation had a significantly shorter hospital length of stay than those undergoing oral sotalol initiation, with a mean difference of 2.6 days. Based on cost estimates by Varela et al, this represents potential savings of more than $4000 per patient.

Additional analysis was performed evaluating changes in the QT/QTc interval during intravenous sotalol infusion and after the first and second oral doses. The increase in the QT/QTc interval by the end of the intravenous infusion approximates that seen at discharge. These findings provide preliminary clinical corroboration for pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic models that simulate peak serum concentrations of sotalol immediately after infusion.

### A multicentre, double-blind randomized crossover comparative study on the efficacy and safety of dofetilide vs sotalol in patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia and ischaemic heart disease [^1156GvKE]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drugs continue to be used for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, either in combination with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators or alone.

- **Aim of the study**: In a double-blind randomized crossover design, the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of oral dofetilide and oral sotalol were compared in 135 patients with ischemic heart disease and inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia.

- **Methods**: The inducibility of ventricular tachycardia was determined by programmed electrophysiological stimulation at baseline. Patients were then blindly randomized to receive either oral dofetilide 500 micrograms twice daily or oral sotalol 160 mg twice daily for 3 to 5 days. Suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia while on the drug was assessed by programmed electrophysiological stimulation. After a wash-out period of at least 2.5 days, the patients received the alternative treatment for 3 to 5 days. Suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia on the alternate drug was again determined by programmed electrophysiological stimulation. The selection of long-term treatment was blindly allocated based on programmed electrophysiological stimulation results.

- **Results**: During the acute phase, 128 patients received both dofetilide and sotalol. Sixty-seven patients were responders to either drug. Forty-six patients (35.9%) were responders to dofetilide compared with 43 (33.6%) to sotalol (P = ns). Only 23 patients responded to both dofetilide and sotalol. Adverse events, deemed treatment-related, were observed in 2.3% of patients receiving dofetilide.

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^1149AeB6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Sotalol was shown to prolong the time to the first symptomatic, ECG-documented recurrence of AFIB/AFL, as well as to reduce the risk of such recurrence at both 6 and 12 months. The 120 mg dose was more effective than 80 mg, but 160 mg did not appear to have an added benefit. Note that these doses were given twice or once daily, depending on renal function. Discontinuation because of adverse events was dose related.

- **Figure 1**: Time to first ECG-documented recurrence of symptomatic AFIB/AFL since randomization.

In a second multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 6 months duration in 232 patients with chronic AFIB, sotalol was titrated over a dose range from 80 mg/day to 320 mg/day. The patient population of this trial was 70% male with a mean age of 65 years. Structural heart disease was present in 49% of the patients. All patients had chronic AFIB for over 2 weeks. Some factors such as structural heart disease, QRS > 140 ms, any degree of AV block or functioning pacemaker, uncompensated cardiac failure, asthma, significant renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), heart rate < 50 bpm, myocardial infarction or open heart surgery in the past 2 months, unstable angina, infective endocarditis, active pericarditis, or myocarditis may have influenced the study outcomes.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of sotalol versus dronedarone after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^11392Fib]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Little is known about the optimal antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) strategy acutely or chronically after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Studies comparing the use of a class I or III AAD during the recovery phase after AF ablation have demonstrated a reduced risk of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATAs) and ATA-related hospitalizations compared with no AAD therapy. There are also multiple studies comparing specific AADs in patients with AF who are not undergoing catheter ablation. Despite this, there are limited data on the comparative efficacy or safety of AADs in the recovery or later phases after ablation, when changes in triggers, substrate, and autonomic milieu may alter the efficacy and/or safety profile of AADs.

Both dronedarone and sotalol are commonly used antiarrhythmic drugs with differing pharmacological effects, although both drugs have Vaughan Williams class II and III effects. Both drugs are indicated and used in similar patient populations, whereas other antiarrhythmic drugs are often prescribed to patients with different characteristics compared with dronedarone and sotalol. In particular, both dronedarone and sotalol have been shown to be effective and are recommended in AF guidelines for patients with structural and ischemic heart disease in the absence of significant or recently decompensated heart failure, although both may be used in patients without structural heart disease. In comparable patient groups, the European Society of Cardiology's 2020 guidelines recently maintained treatment with dronedarone as a class IA recommendation but downgraded treatment with sotalol to a IIbA recommendation.

### Maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation; sotalol vs bisoprolol [^1157cQsT]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of sotalol and bisoprolol in the maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 128) were randomized to sotalol (80 mg b.i.d.) or bisoprolol (5 mg per day). Patients with contraindications to beta-blockers, class III antiarrhythmic drugs, or previous treatment with study medication for the prevention of atrial fibrillation were excluded. Follow-up clinical evaluations were performed 1 day and 1 month after cardioversion, and thereafter at 3-month intervals.

- **Results**: There were no group differences in baseline clinical characteristics. After a follow-up of 12 months, 59% of all patients were still in sinus rhythm. The fraction remaining in sinus rhythm was calculated for the two groups by Kaplan-Meier analysis. During follow-up, 41% of patients on sotalol and 42% on bisoprolol developed atrial fibrillation (not significant). In two patients (3.1%) on sotalol, life-threatening proarrhythmias (torsade de pointes tachycardias) occurred, whereas none were found in the bisoprolol group. Symptomatic bradycardias occurred in two patients on sotalol and three on bisoprolol.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates that sotalol (160 mg per day) and bisoprolol (5 mg per day) are equally effective in maintaining sinus rhythm. Because of the side effects of sotalol, bisoprolol seems to be advantageous for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.

### Correction to: Comparative safety and effectiveness of sotalol versus dronedarone after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^111byJDd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

In the Discussion section:

- **Effectiveness**: The first sentence of the third paragraph initially read, "After the recovery phase, dronedarone treatment was associated with lower 1-year rates of ATA-related hospitalization, relative to sotalol treatment. The rates of ATA-related hospitalization were the same between dronedarone and sotalol treatment groups 6 months after AF ablation". It has been corrected to read, "After the recovery phase, dronedarone treatment was associated with lower rates of ATA-related hospitalization at 6 months, relative to sotalol treatment. The rates of ATA-related hospitalization were the same between dronedarone and sotalol treatment groups at 12 months after AF ablation".

- **Safety**: The first four sentences of the first paragraph originally stated, "There was a higher risk of composite proarrhythmia with sotalol compared with dronedarone after AF ablation. This difference was driven predominantly by a higher risk of significant bradyarrhythmias and pacemaker implantation in patients treated with sotalol. This is consistent with the known bradycardic effects of sotalol. There was a marginal increase in ventricular proarrhythmia at the 3-month follow-up, but no subsequent differences in ventricular proarrhythmia at 6 and 12 months". The corrected text reads, "There was a higher risk of composite proarrhythmia with sotalol compared with dronedarone after AF ablation. This difference was driven predominantly by a significantly higher risk of bradycardia at 3 months or by higher rates of pacemaker implantation at later stages".

Patients aged > 18 years who were undergoing an initial index ablation for AF during this period were identified". This has been corrected to read: "Patients with a diagnosis of AF were identified within the study period between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017 using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐9 and ICD‐10 codes. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who were undergoing an initial index ablation for AF during this period were identified".

In the Results section, under the heading - **Cohort formation**: the number of patients at each step of cohort formation was revised, including the number of patients excluded from the analysis, the number of patients who met enrollment criteria, and the number of patients in each treatment group.

In the Results section, under the heading - **Patient characteristics**: the baseline characteristics of patients in each treatment group (demographics, comorbidities, procedures and health care utilization, and concomitant medications) were updated.

In the Results section, under the heading - **Cardiovascular hospitalization**: the rates of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease (e.g. myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation), follow‐up procedures (repeat catheter ablation, cardioversion, etc) were detailed.

### Economics and outcomes of sotalol in-patient dosing approaches in patients with atrial fibrillation [^115bx5mk]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

We observed that the mean QTc duration at the time of admission did not increase in response to sotalol by the time of hospital discharge. Some of this is inherent to the drug being initiated during hospitalization to monitor for QT prolongation. Those with significant prolongation will have the sotalol dosage decreased or have the drug stopped altogether, as evidenced by the fact that QT prolongation was noted to occur in approximately one-fifth of the patient population at some point during their hospital stay. The average recorded QT interval following 6 oral sotalol doses was virtually unchanged from baseline.

An alternative explanation for the lack of QT prolongation may stem from issues with drug underdosing. Prior studies have shown a linear relationship between sotalol drug concentration and the extent of QTc prolongation, with the greatest QTc prolongation being achieved once the drug has reached steady-state concentration. In the same way that sotalol underdosing might explain the higher rates of arrhythmia recurrence, drug underdosing could also explain the lack of any significant increase in QTc duration. Similarly, potential drug underdosing could also explain the lack of any ventricular arrhythmias during follow-up.

One prior study reported a 5.8% incidence of new or increased ventricular arrhythmias in response to sotalol initiation. In that study, the median initiation and discharge dose were both 160 mg. When compared to the results of our study, where only approximately 5% of patients received doses greater than 80 mg and none developed ventricular arrhythmias, this supports…

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^116nswoy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Electrophysiology: Sotalol prolongs the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential in the isolated myocyte, as well as in isolated tissue preparations of ventricular or atrial muscle (Class III activity). In intact animals, it slows heart rate, decreases AV nodal conduction, and increases the refractory periods of atrial and ventricular muscle and conduction tissue.

In humans, the Class II (beta-blockade) electrophysiological effects of sotalol include increased sinus cycle length (slowed heart rate), decreased AV nodal conduction, and increased AV nodal refractoriness. The Class III electrophysiological effects in humans include the prolongation of the atrial and ventricular monophasic action potentials and effective refractory period prolongation of atrial muscle, ventricular muscle, and atrio-ventricular accessory pathways (when present) in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. With oral doses of 160 to 640 mg/day, the surface ECG shows dose-related mean increases of 40–100 ms in QT and 10–40 ms in QTc.

A study involving twenty-five children in an unblinded, multicenter trial focused on those with supraventricular (SVT) and/or ventricular (VT) tachyarrhythmias, aged between 3 days and 12 years (mostly neonates and infants). They received an ascending titration regimen with daily doses of 30, 90, and 210 mg/m², administered every 8 hours for a total of 9 doses. During the steady-state, the respective average increases above baseline of the QTc interval were 2, 14, and 29 ms at the 3 dose levels. The respective mean maximum increases in QTc above baseline were 23, 36, and 55 ms.
