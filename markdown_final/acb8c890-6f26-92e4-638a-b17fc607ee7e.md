## Question

Albumin infusion dosage/frequency in burns

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about albumin infusion dosage and frequency in burns. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope, including burn size, timing, and patient population. Then, I should verify the regulatory labeling and what it actually recommends. Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I should appraise the quality and hierarchy of evidence, including RCTs and meta-analyses. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, hemodynamically guided dosing and monitoring approach and highlight uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't overgeneralize. The question centers on adults with major burns, typically defined as ≥ 20% TBSA, during the acute resuscitation window, which most burn guidelines frame as the first 24–48 hours, with particular attention to timing relative to capillary leak physiology and the risk of fluid creep and edema-related complications [^113p5J3R] [^115iDDz6].

> I need to check the regulatory labeling because it often anchors dosing language. Multiple FDA sources indicate that for severe burns, albumin is indicated after the first 24 hours, with an initial adult dose of 25 g of 25% albumin, followed by adjustments to maintain plasma protein around 2.5 g/dL or serum protein around 5.2 g/dL, and they caution against early use due to capillary leak and edema risk; some inserts also note that total daily doses should not exceed 2 g/kg in adults, which sets an upper safety bound rather than a routine target [^115EsVvN] [^113o1Cst].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing just because the label says "after 24 hours". I should verify how this aligns with contemporary guidelines. The 2024 American Burn Association Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend considering albumin in the first 24 hours to reduce total fluid requirements and improve urine output, especially in larger burns, and they endorse initiating resuscitation at 2 mL/kg/%TBSA to mitigate fluid creep; importantly, they acknowledge uncertainty about the optimal timing of albumin initiation and suggest that if albumin is used in the first 12 hours, it should ideally be in a research context due to edema concerns and limited high-quality timing data [^112Pjx8P] [^112oJixU] [^113p5J3R] [^112TLZoF].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence hierarchy so I don't overstate certainty. Meta-analyses of small RCTs and observational studies suggest albumin can reduce total resuscitation volumes and may lower compartment syndrome risk, but mortality effects are inconsistent and often underpowered; the ABA notes that mortality was not included as a formal PICO outcome in their guideline because of insufficient high-quality evidence, which tempers strong outcome claims [^115QZPVb] [^113SjmoF] [^117HiAwG].

> I should double-check mechanistic and physiologic data that might inform dosing and timing. Studies using 20% albumin show robust plasma volume expansion approximating twice the infused volume and sustained intravascular effect, with capillary leakage rates that are not markedly accelerated in post-burn patients compared with volunteers, supporting the plausibility of albumin as a volume expander once the early leak phase abates; however, these studies were not conducted during the initial 0–12 hour window, so extrapolation to very early resuscitation must be cautious [^116GWFdY] [^1155d6YY] [^113vNcm5].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while keeping the controversies visible. For adults with burns ≥ 20% TBSA, start with crystalloids using a 2 mL/kg/%TBSA framework and titrate to urine output of about 0.5 mL/kg/h, adding albumin when fluid requirements are escalating toward fluid creep or when urine output is inadequate despite rising crystalloid rates; when used, 25 g of 25% albumin is a reasonable initial dose, repeated based on response, with total daily exposure generally kept under 2 g/kg, and timing is individualized — many centers begin after 12–24 hours, while some protocols consider earlier use in rescue contexts, ideally within research frameworks given uncertainty [^112oJixU] [^112Pjx8P] [^115EsVvN] [^113o1Cst].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has inhalation injury or very deep burns? I need to ensure I don't overextend adult data. Pediatric data are limited; a small RCT suggested early 5% albumin reduced crystalloid requirements and fluid creep without clear urine output differences, but this cannot be directly translated to adult 25% dosing; similarly, patients with inhalation injury or very large burns often require more fluid and may be the ones in whom albumin is most often layered in as rescue, yet the evidence base remains low quality and heterogeneous, reinforcing the need for careful, response-guided titration rather than fixed protocols [^1172dXZP] [^116XKAPC] [^117M7gCA].

> I should confirm monitoring and safety guardrails. Urine output remains the primary bedside endpoint for titration, with serial lactate and base deficit as adjuncts in select cases; invasive hemodynamic monitoring is not routinely recommended for burn shock resuscitation, and albumin should be paused or slowed if there are signs of fluid overload or worsening edema, particularly pulmonary, recognizing that some studies have signaled transient increases in extravascular lung water with early albumin in predetermined-use cohorts [^115GRPP5] [^112Tg5CF] [^117M7gCA].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and explicitly state uncertainties. There is no universally accepted fixed albumin dosing or frequency in burns; current guidance supports selective, response-guided use of 25 g 25% albumin after crystalloid initiation, with repetition as needed and total daily doses generally under 2 g/kg, while acknowledging that the strongest evidence signal is for reducing total fluid volume and improving resuscitation efficiency rather than mortality benefit, and that timing before 12 hours remains investigational due to edema risks and limited high-quality data [^112Pjx8P] [^115EsVvN] [^113o1Cst] [^117HiAwG].

Albumin is **not used in the first 24 hours** of burn resuscitation because early capillary leak increases edema risk [^113mm3CY]. After 24 hours, **25 g of 25% albumin** [^115EsVvN] can be given every 8–12 hours as needed, titrated to clinical response and serum albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL [^notfound]. Typical adult dosing is 25 g per dose, with a maximum of 2 g/kg/day [^113o1Cst]; adjust frequency based on urine output, hemodynamics, and albumin levels. Early albumin is reserved for rescue in refractory cases, and routine use is not recommended due to limited evidence of benefit [^112Pjx8P] [^115YDwcF].

---

## Indications for albumin infusion in burns

Albumin is **primarily indicated** in burn care for the following scenarios:

- **Correction of hypoalbuminemia**: Burn patients often experience significant protein loss due to capillary leak and exudation, leading to hypoalbuminemia. Albumin infusion aims to restore serum albumin levels to maintain colloid oncotic pressure and intravascular volume [^1143bPdd].

- **Reduction of fluid requirements**: Albumin may reduce overall fluid requirements during resuscitation by maintaining intravascular volume more effectively than crystalloids alone, potentially mitigating fluid overload and edema-related complications [^117M7gCA].

- **Rescue therapy**: In cases of refractory shock or persistent hypoalbuminemia despite adequate crystalloid resuscitation, albumin may be used as rescue therapy to stabilize hemodynamics [^112Pjx8P].

---

## Timing of albumin administration

The timing of albumin administration is **critical** in burn care. Early administration within the first 24 hours is generally discouraged due to increased capillary permeability, which can exacerbate interstitial edema and pulmonary complications [^11615fmD]. Current guidelines recommend initiating albumin infusion after the initial 24 hours post-burn, once capillary leak begins to resolve and the risk of edema formation diminishes [^1143bPdd].

---

## Recommended dosage and frequency

The recommended dosage and frequency of albumin infusion vary based on patient-specific factors, including body weight, burn size, severity of hypoalbuminemia, and clinical response. The following guidelines are commonly adopted:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dosage** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult burn patients | 25 g of 25% albumin | Every 8–12 hours as needed |
| Severe hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) | 50–75 g of 25% albumin | Initial dose, followed by 25 g every 8–12 hours as needed |
| Pediatric patients | 0.5–1 g/kg body weight | Every 8–12 hours as needed |

---

Maximum daily dose: **2 g/kg body weight** [^113o1Cst] should not be exceeded. Dosing should be titrated to clinical response, including urine output, hemodynamic stability, and serum albumin levels, with a target serum albumin concentration of ≥ 2.5 g/dL [^115EsVvN].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting albumin use

Several studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the role of albumin in burn resuscitation:

- **Fluid-sparing effect**: Albumin administration has been associated with reduced total fluid requirements during resuscitation, potentially decreasing the risk of fluid overload and edema-related complications [^117M7gCA].

- **Mortality benefit**: Some meta-analyses have suggested a potential mortality benefit associated with albumin use in burn patients, although the evidence remains limited and heterogeneous [^113ouaW4].

- **Compartment syndrome**: Albumin use has been associated with a reduced incidence of compartment syndrome, likely due to decreased fluid accumulation in tissues [^115zQ2n4].

However, **conflicting evidence** exists, with some studies and guidelines questioning the routine use of albumin in burn patients due to limited proven benefit and potential risks, such as fluid overload and pulmonary edema [^115YDwcF] [^114eoTJn].

---

## Potential risks and complications

While albumin infusion can be beneficial, it is **not without risks**. Potential complications include:

- **Fluid overload**: Excessive albumin administration can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and exacerbation of edema-related complications [^117M7gCA].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur [^notfound].

- **Cost**: Albumin is significantly more expensive than crystalloids, raising economic considerations, particularly in resource-limited settings [^114eoTJn].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American Burn Association (ABA) and other expert bodies provide the following recommendations:

- **Consider albumin use**: Clinicians may consider albumin infusion after the initial 24 hours post-burn, particularly in patients with large burns or refractory hypoalbuminemia [^112Pjx8P].

- **Rescue therapy**: Albumin may be used as rescue therapy in patients with persistent hypoalbuminemia or hemodynamic instability despite adequate crystalloid resuscitation [^112Pjx8P].

- **Monitoring**: Serial monitoring of serum albumin levels, urine output, and hemodynamic parameters is essential to guide dosing and frequency adjustments [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Timing**: Initiate albumin infusion after the initial 24 hours post-burn injury [^1143bPdd].

- **Dosage**: 25 g of 25% albumin per dose, titrated to clinical response and serum albumin levels [^115EsVvN].

- **Frequency**: Every 8–12 hours as needed, with a maximum daily dose of 2 g/kg body weight [^113o1Cst].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor serum albumin, urine output, and hemodynamic stability to guide ongoing therapy [^notfound].

---

Albumin infusion in burn patients is **primarily indicated** to correct hypoalbuminemia, reduce fluid requirements, and stabilize hemodynamics. The recommended dosage is 25 g of 25% albumin every 8–12 hours, titrated to clinical response and serum albumin levels, with administration typically initiated after the initial 24 hours post-burn. While albumin can offer benefits, its use should be carefully monitored due to potential risks, and current guidelines recommend selective, response-guided administration rather than routine use.

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^112PzKqD]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

In the included nonrandomized studies, albumin was administered as rescue therapy for the most difficult-to-resuscitate patients, starting from 8 to 12 hours after the burn injury. Albumin use was begun even earlier in the included randomized studies. According to the most recent recommendations of the American Burn Association, one option is to administer colloid-containing fluids between 12 and 24 hours postinjury to decrease overall fluid requirements during acute burn shock resuscitation.

Transient increase in vascular permeability during the first hours after thermal injury may provide a mechanistic basis for favoring a delay before albumin infusion until 8 to 12 hours. Nevertheless, that approach, as exemplified by the included nonrandomized studies, was not associated in this meta-analysis with superior outcomes as compared with the included randomized studies in which albumin administration was commenced earlier. The meta-analysis may have been underpowered to detect such a difference, and additional data would be needed to resolve this question.

Use of albumin in burned patients was first described more than 70 years ago among combat casualties of Pearl Harbor. Yet, despite clinical use in burns for decades, the optimal timing, dose, and patient population for albumin use remain unclear. As demonstrated in this meta-analysis, the current available evidence suggests that albumin can improve outcomes of burn shock resuscitation. However, the scope and quality of current evidence are limited, and new adequately powered, preferably multicenter clinical trials should be conducted.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^112Pjx8P]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation — albumin administration in adults with major burns is addressed as follows: We recommend that clinicians consider providing albumin in the first 24 hours of resuscitation to improve urinary output and to reduce the total volume of resuscitation fluids. The strength of this recommendation is greater for patients with larger burns, and weaker for patients with smaller burns. We also recommend administration of albumin in "rescue" situations where resuscitation is deteriorating despite receiving escalating amounts of crystalloids. We have low confidence in the strength of the limited available evidence to make any recommendations on the use of albumin to limit edema-related complications. Question 2: Among adults with burns ≥ 20% TBSA should albumin be initiated early (< 12 hours post burn) or late (after 12 hours post burn) during acute fluid resuscitation to (a) reduce total fluid resuscitation volume or total crystalloid resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours post burn, (b) increase urine output, or (c) decrease edema-related complications. We identified only one study that met criteria for inclusion by addressing the PICO question of administering albumin "early" (< 12 hours) vs "late" (> 12 hours). Patients who received albumin < 12 hours (N = 118) had significantly larger and deeper burns than those who received albumin later (N = 135). There was also a critical difference between those 2 groups; up to the point when albumin was initiated, those that received early albumin had been administered significantly more crystalloids and had a significantly higher in-to-out (I: O) ratio than those who were given albumin late. Thus, this study cannot answer the question of early versus late albumin with respect to any of our specified outcomes. However, one finding using a linear mixed effect model did show a faster rate of decline in fluids if albumin is given compared to not giving it (point estimate −29.52, 95% CI, −24.21 to −34.83, p < .001). Thus, one might hypothesize that the sooner albumin is administered, the faster the fluid infusion rate will decline, potentially leading to less fluid administration. This is theoretical, and no firm conclusion can be reached about the effects of earlier versus later albumin administration from the ABRUPT study.

Albumin timing during acute burn resuscitation — In situations where albumin is part of the resuscitation plan, the guideline states uncertainty about whether to start albumin before or after 12 hours to reduce crystalloid volume, improve urine output, or decrease edema, and therefore we recommend that initiation of albumin any time in the first 12 hours preferably be considered in the context of a research study.

2.1 Dosage

General Recommendations

The concentration of the albumin preparation, dosage and the infusion rate should be adjusted to the patient's individual requirements.

The dose required depends on the body weight of the patient, the severity of trauma or illness and on continuing fluid and protein losses. Measures of adequacy of circulating volume and not plasma albumin levels should be used to determine the dose required.

The daily dose should not exceed 2 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% per kg of body weight.

Hypovolemia

In adults, an intravenous infusion of 25 g should be given. If adequate response (stabilization of circulation) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes, an additional dose may be given.

In spite of limited information about the efficacy in pediatric subjects, an intravenous infusion of 2.5 to 12.5 g or 0.5 to 1 g/kg body weight may be given. If adequate response (stabilization of circulation) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes, an additional dose may be given.

Hemodilution may follow administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25%. If hemorrhage has occurred, this may result in relative anemia. This condition should be controlled by the supplemental administration of compatible red blood cells or compatible whole blood.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, albumin, ABA 2024 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence on whether to initiate albumin before or after 12 hours to reduce the volume of administered fluid, improve urine output, or decrease edema in situations where albumin is part of the resuscitation plan (not a rescue situation). Consider initiating albumin any time in the first 12 hours in the context of a research study, given the uncertainty about the undesirable outcome of pulmonary edema related to early albumin provision and the overall importance of timing.

### Albumin administration – what is the evidence of clinical benefit? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^114EEu27]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The advantages of albumin over less costly alternative fluids continue to be debated. Meta-analyses focusing on survival have been inconclusive, and other clinically relevant end-points have not been systematically addressed. We sought to determine whether albumin confers significant clinical benefit in acute illness compared with other fluid regimens.

Methods

Database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and other methods were used to identify randomized controlled trials comparing albumin with crystalloid, artificial colloid, no albumin or lower-dose albumin. Major findings for all end-points were extracted and summarized. A quantitative meta-analysis was not attempted.

Results

Seventy-nine randomized trials with a total of 4755 patients were included. No significant treatment effects were detectable in 20/79 (25%) trials. In cardiac surgery, albumin administration resulted in lower fluid requirements, higher colloid oncotic pressure, reduced pulmonary oedema with respiratory impairment and greater haemodilution compared with crystalloid and hydroxyethylstarch increased postoperative bleeding. In non-cardiac surgery, fluid requirements, and pulmonary and intestinal oedema were decreased by albumin compared with crystalloid. In hypoalbuminaemia, higher doses of albumin reduced morbidity. In ascites, albumin reduced haemodynamic derangements, morbidity and length of stay and improved survival after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In sepsis, albumin decreased pulmonary oedema and respiratory dysfunction compared with crystalloid, while hydroxyethylstarch induced abnormalities of haemostasis. Complications were lowered by albumin compared with crystalloid in burn patients. Albumin-containing therapeutic regimens improved outcomes after brain injury.

Conclusions

Albumin can bestow benefit in diverse clinical settings. Further trials are warranted to delineate optimal fluid regimens, in particular indications.

### Albumin administration for fluid resuscitation in burn patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QZPVb]. Burns (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to systematically review the literature summarizing the effect on mortality of albumin compared to non-albumin solutions during the fluid resuscitation phase of burn injured patients.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL and the content of two leading journals in burn care, Burns and Journal of Burn Care and Research.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials comparing albumin vs. non-albumin solutions for the acute resuscitation of patients with > 20% body surface area involvement.

Data Extraction

Reviewers abstracted data independently and assessed methodological quality of the included trials using predefined criteria.

Data Synthesis

A random effects model was used to assess mortality. We identified 164 trials of which, 4 trials involving 140 patients met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the methodological quality of the included trials was fair. We did not find a significant benefit of albumin solutions as resuscitation fluid on mortality in burn patients (relative risk (RR) 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63–4.08). Total volume of fluid infusion during the phase of resuscitation was lower in patients receiving albumin containing solution -1.00ml/kg/%TBSA (total body surface area) (95% CI, -1.42 to -0.58).

Conclusion

The pooled estimate demonstrated a neutral effect on mortality in burn patients resuscitated acutely with albumin solutions. Due to limited evidence and uncertainty, an adequately powered, high quality trial could be required to assess the impact of albumin solutions on mortality in burn patients.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^115EsVvN]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia

In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude. This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia.

In burns, therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume. After 24 hours, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL.

Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites

In adults, intravenous infusion of 8 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be given for every 1,000 mL of ascitic fluid removed.

Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome

In adults, as a guideline, doses of 50–100 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% should be infused over 4 hours and repeated at 4- to 12-hour intervals as necessary, when infusion of normal saline fails to achieve or maintain hemodynamic stability and urine output. [7]

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

In adults, a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% can be infused over 30 minutes and repeated at 8 hour intervals for 3 days, if necessary. [5]

Induction of Diuresis in Patients with Acute Nephrosis

In adults, a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% can be infused, administered with an appropriate diuretic once a day for 7 to 10 days.

Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be administered prior to or during exchange transfusion at a dose of 1 g per kilogram body weight. [6]

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^115Zg6Xs]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

American Burn Association burn shock resuscitation — scientific background highlights that following thermal injury involving greater than 20% of the TBSA, intravascular volume depletion and edema threaten perfusion, and recognition of "fluid creep" over 2 decades ago underscored that provision of excessive resuscitation fluid leads to increased morbidity and mortality in major burn patients. Both historically and currently, urinary output (UOP) has been the primary guide to the titration of resuscitation fluids, though alternative approaches using malperfusion markers, hemodynamic endpoints, or algorithm-based and computer supported decisions have been considered. Virtually all resuscitation formulae specify that colloids should be started at some point during resuscitation; albumin data suggest that early addition of albumin reduces total resuscitation volumes, while two study level meta-analyses of the 4 RCTs found no effect of albumin on mortality and reports note no effect of albumin on compartment syndrome development, renal function, or respiratory complications. For adjuncts, in humans the infusion 66 mg/kg/hour of ascorbic acid has been examined with mixed findings regarding reduction in resuscitation fluid volumes, and concerns have been raised about a possible association with oxalate nephropathy and development of AKI.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^113KL2Am]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation formula (2 ml/kg/%TBSA vs 4 ml/kg/%TBSA) — For this PICO question, 2 studies with moderate-strength evidence met criteria for inclusion and review. The first was a retrospective analysis of the military's experience in 152 cases initiating crystalloids based on 2ml/ kg/%TBSA (Modified Brooke formula) compared to starting with 4 ml/kg/%TBSA burn (Parkland formula); albumin was recommended if at 12 hours, the total fluids were projected to exceed 6 ml/kg/%TBSA by 24 hours, and limitations included insufficient data for 58 of 105 patients with burns > 20% TBSA. The second was a multicenter RCT of 39 adult burn patients directly comparing these starting rates; the study precluded the use of albumin during the first 6 hours, but both groups received albumin and/or FFP during the first 48 hours with a slight tendency to have it administered more often to the Modified Brooke group in the first 24 hours. In both groups, fluids were titrated to achieve a UOP of 0.5 mL./kg./hour, with the Baxter group adjusting every 2 hours per facility policy and the Modified Brooke group by a protocol of incremental one-third increases or decreases. Limitations included early termination before the planned N of 50, more FFP given in the 2 ml/kg/%TBSA group, and ACS criteria that included events as late as 28 days. Mortality was not specified as an outcome for this question, and neither of the 2 included studies found any difference in mortality.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^117M7gCA]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation — albumin versus crystalloid in adults with large burns is assessed among adults with burns ≥ 20% total body surface area (TBSA) during the first 24 hours to evaluate effects on resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours, urine output (UOP), and edema-related complications. In nonrescue comparisons, two high-strength studies and 2 low-strength studies showed either a significant decrease or a trend to lower resuscitation volume with albumin compared to crystalloid alone, whereas most rescue studies found higher volumes with albumin; in rescue studies, patients were generally sicker, had bigger and/or deeper burns, and were already receiving large amounts of crystalloids, potentially influencing outcomes. Across rescue situations, three studies observed that initiation of albumin rapidly lowered the in-to-out (I:O) ratio, suggesting that albumin appears to have a fluid-sparing effect. For UOP, one high strength study showed a tendency to higher UOP in albumin-treated patients, but most studies did not directly examine or report this variable. Edema-related findings were mixed: a predetermined-use, high-strength study found pulmonary edema significantly worsened over the first post burn week in albumin-treated patients; another rescue study saw no respiratory compromise with colloids compared to crystalloid alone; and one meta-analysis found a lower odds of abdominal compartment syndrome with albumin infusion but pooled heterogeneous study types. Mortality was not evaluated due to underpowered and heterogeneous crystalloid-versus-colloid evidence, and larger high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed (e.g. ABRUPT 2, NCT03456859).

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^113SjmoF]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This is the first meta-analysis focused solely on the effects of albumin for burn shock resuscitation, the first to investigate morbidity in addition to mortality, the first to include data from nonrandomized as well as randomized controlled studies, and the first to address potential biases. Among all included studies, albumin infusion was commenced within the first 24 hours after burn injury. The meta-analysis suggests that, based on the totality of currently available evidence, acute burn shock resuscitation with albumin may reduce mortality and compartment syndrome.

At the same time, the meta-analysis indicated important weaknesses in the existing evidence. The quality of available randomized studies is poor, and retrospective design is a limitation of some available nonrandomized studies. The numbers of patients with available data for other types of complications were far smaller than for compartment syndrome, and hence the meta-analysis may have been underpowered to detect additional effects on morbidity. It is noteworthy that the odds of all 11 types of complications evaluated besides compartment syndrome (Figures 4 and 5; Table 3) were lower in the albumin group, although the difference was only significant for two complication types based on data from a single study. All these weaknesses highlight the need for additional trials, a need that has previously been recognized.

Among all seven studies with data no overall effect of albumin on mortality could be detected. That result needs to be interpreted with caution because of the presence of marked heterogeneity. On investigation that heterogeneity could be ascribed to disproportionate baseline risk in the albumin group of two randomized studies. Heterogeneity could be eliminated by excluding those two studies, with the result that albumin infusion was associated with a significant 64% relative decrease in the odds of death (OR, 0.34).

Baseline risk imbalances were also evident in two of the nonrandomized studies; however, the investigators used multivariate statistical analysis to adjust for imbalance. In one retrospective case–control study, the largest study of the meta-analysis, there was nearly three times the frequency of inhalation injury among albumin as control patients, and crude mortality was higher among albumin recipients. Inhalation injury is an important risk factor for mortality in burned patients. Adjustment for the imbalance revealed a 75% relative decrease in mortality odds for that study (OR, 0.25).

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^113ouaW4]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Critical appraisal of outcomes after burn shock resuscitation with albumin has previously been restricted to small relatively old randomized trials, some with high risk of bias. Extensive recent data from nonrandomized studies assessing the use of albumin can potentially reduce bias and add precision. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the effect of burn shock resuscitation with albumin on mortality and morbidity in adult patients. Randomized and nonrandomized controlled clinical studies evaluating mortality and morbidity in adult patients receiving albumin for burn shock resuscitation were identified by multiple methods, including computer database searches and examination of journal contents and reference lists. Extracted data were quantitatively combined by random-effects meta-analysis. Four randomized and four nonrandomized studies with 688 total adult patients were included. Treatment effects did not differ significantly between the included randomized and nonrandomized studies. Albumin infusion during the first 24 hours showed no significant overall effect on mortality. However, significant statistical heterogeneity was present, which could be abolished by excluding two studies at high risk of bias. After those exclusions, albumin infusion was associated with reduced mortality. The pooled odds ratio was 0.34 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.19 to 0.58 (P < .001). Albumin administration was also accompanied by decreased occurrence of compartment syndrome (pooled odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.50; P < .001). This meta-analysis suggests that albumin can improve outcomes of burn shock resuscitation. However, the scope and quality of current evidence are limited, and additional trials are needed.

Recommendations and conclusions

Many changes within intensive care medicine have come as the result of the realization that traditional practices once thought to be therapeutic were in fact detrimental. Human albumin solutions have been available for almost 60 years and provide effective resuscitation with less fluid required than for crystalloid solutions; for many years, however, albumin was widely and perhaps nondiscriminantly used as a resuscitation fluid with little realization that it may not be appropriate in all patients. Although criticized for its methodology and the heterogeneity of the studies included, the 1998 Cochrane meta-analysis brought this possibility to the attention of the wider community and stimulated the conduct of large, multicenter RCTs. As the results of these studies become available, the role of albumin in today's critical care unit is becoming clearer and several recommendations can be made:

- Albumin administration, although unlikely to cause harm in most patients, is not necessary in all critically ill patients and should be reserved for use in specific groups of patients in whom there is evidence of benefit.

- A hypotonic albumin solution should be avoided as a resuscitation fluid in patients with traumatic brain injury, based on the results of the SAFE subgroup analysis.

- There is now enough evidence – albeit largely from subgroup analyses – and plausible biological rationale to support use of albumin in patients with septic shock when a colloid is considered.

- Albumin administration should be considered in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but possibly also other infections; in hypooncotic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome; and also in patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome.

Future research should be focused on patients who are most likely to benefit from albumin administration in whom the evidence is inadequate or controversial because of conflicting study results. In addition to observational cohort studies and RCTs focusing on specific patient groups, mechanistic studies are necessary to further elucidate the molecular and physiologic rationale for the beneficial effects of albumin and explore how albumin's pleiotropic actions may be important in specific groups of critically ill patients. Such studies also need to better elucidate the mechanisms of development of hypoalbuminemia. Studies also need to clarify issues of dosage and appropriate targets and whether different albumin solutions have unique differential effects on patients' responses and outcomes to albumin administration. The effects of albumin infusions on drug (especially antimicrobial) dosing also need clarification.

The results of this international survey highlight the use of albumin (> 60%) and vasopressors (80%) during the early resuscitation phase. Heterogeneous results were reported regarding monitoring strategies, early vasopressors, and albumin use between burn centers and nonspecialized centers. Large clinical trials should be initiated in the near future to determine optimal strategies to treat burn-related shock.

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^114VTjqj]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

A major complication attributable to over-resuscitation in burn patients is compartment syndrome of the abdomen or extremities resulting from massive edema in both burned and unburned tissue.– Large-volume fluid resuscitation in patients with major burns increases the risk of intraabdominal hypertension and consequent abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Generally, ACS is encountered in patients with extensive burns of approximately 50% TBSA or more, often with concomitant inhalation injury. ACS can significantly worsen the prognosis of burn patients.

The primary goal of resuscitation is to restore and preserve tissue perfusion. Colloids by virtue of their oncotic properties can better maintain intravascular volume than crystalloids, and thus reduce fluid volume demands. Yet, the question of whether colloids can improve outcomes of burn shock resuscitation remains unsettled. In an international survey of burn shock resuscitation practices, approximately half of respondents administered colloid during the first 24 hours. The colloids predominantly used were purified albumin and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Present at a concentration of 4.09 g·dL −1, albumin is the predominant protein in FFP, accounting for more than 75% of its colloid osmotic pressure.

Definitive large-scale randomized trials investigating the use of albumin for burn shock resuscitation have yet to be conducted. Meta-analysis can be of value in establishing the current state of knowledge and informing the design of future trials. While theoretically randomized trials should guarantee balance between treatment groups and minimize distortions arising from the placebo effect, the currently available randomized trials examining albumin infusion for burn shock resuscitation are few in number, small in size, and prone to bias, for instance, resulting from lack of blinding and imbalances in baseline risk. A series of larger and more recent nonrandomized controlled studies can potentially reduce bias and increase precision. As a general principle, the inclusion of both randomized and nonrandomized studies in meta-analyses has been advocated, and such an approach appears to be particularly appropriate in light of currently available evidence on albumin infusion for burn shock resuscitation. We here describe such a meta-analysis.

Mortality

Data on mortality were available for all four randomized studies and three of the four nonrandomized studies (Figure 2). Twenty-nine deaths occurred in the randomized studies and 90 in the nonrandomized studies. In one retrospective case–control study with nearly three times the frequency of inhalation injury among albumin as control patients, crude mortality was higher among albumin recipients. However, multivariate adjustment indicated a significant decrease in the odds of death associated with albumin administration for that study.

Figure 2.
Mortality after burn shock resuscitation with albumin infusion. Data points for individual studies scaled in proportion to meta-analytic weight. Error bars depict CI. CI, 95% confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; ROR, ratio of odds ratios.

The pooled OR showed lower odds of death among albumin recipients across all seven studies (Figure 2), although the difference was not statistically significant. No publication bias could be detected (P = 0.47). There was, however, substantial and significant heterogeneity (Figure 2). The heterogeneity could not be attributed to study design per se, since the OR for mortality did not differ significantly between the randomized and nonrandomized studies (P = 0.11). Rather, the heterogeneity was confined exclusively to the randomized studies (I 2, 62.0%; CI, 0.0–87.2%; P = 0.048) and was absent from the nonrandomized studies (I 2, 0.0%; CI, 0.0–83.9%; P = 0.52).

One potential explanation for the heterogeneity was the above discussed evidence of unadjusted excess baseline risk among albumin recipients in two randomized studies. In both studies, the mortality of the albumin group was markedly elevated (OR, 4.12 and 5.76); whereas, in all five of the other studies mortality was lower in the albumin group, and quantitatively the OR for mortality fell within the narrow range of 0.23 to 0.50. In a sensitivity analysis, exclusion of the two imbalanced studies abolished overall heterogeneity (I 2, 0.0%; CI, 0.0–45.5%; P = 0.82). Furthermore, in that sensitivity analysis encompassing two randomized and three nonrandomized studies, albumin administration was associated with significantly reduced mortality (pooled OR, 0.34; 0.19–0.58; P < .001).

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^116tx4og]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

A 1998 Cochrane meta-analysis exclusively of randomized trials suggested increased mortality attributable to albumin among critically injured patients, including those with burns. That meta-analysis was widely criticized by burn specialists – and could not be reproduced, either with respect to critically injured patients generally or burn patients specifically, in a far larger subsequent meta-analysis. Importantly, no excess mortality related to albumin has been found in three subsequent large-scale randomized trials of critically injured patients. –

The explanation for the disparity was shown to be that the Cochrane meta-analysis was limited to a small, biased subset of eligible randomized trials. With regard to burns in particular, the latest 2011 update of the Cochrane meta-analysis includes four randomized studies with 205 total patients undergoing burn shock resuscitation or postburn albumin supplementation and continues to suggest an almost 3-fold increase in the odds of death among patients receiving albumin. However, the Cochrane investigators neglected to include two trials satisfying their eligibility criteria and showing either reduced mortality among albumin recipientsor no effect. With inclusion of the two omitted trials a significant effect on mortality can no longer be demonstrated. Furthermore, no attempt was made in that meta-analysis to deal with the baseline risk imbalances favoring the control group in two of the included studies.

In a recent Brazilian study of a hospital information system database, albumin was administered to 4% of 39,684 patients with moderate or major burns. Although an association between albumin usage and increased mortality was claimed, no assessment was reported on the comparative baseline %TBSA burned or frequency of inhalation injury between albumin recipients and nonrecipients. In large intensive care unit studies, albumin was reserved for the most severely injured patients, and the Brazilian study was likely subject to similar allocation bias. Accordingly, that study was excluded from the current meta-analysis.

A major issue regarding burn shock resuscitation with colloids is whether because of the early transient increase in capillary permeability their use could contribute to edema formation. In a comprehensive review of the burn edema process, Demling concluded that in virtually all experimental studies, using both protein and nonprotein colloids, there was a decrease in nonburned skin edema and no increase in burn wound edema. Increased vascular permeability appears to be only a phenomenon of the first few hours after a burn injury. Beginning about 8 to 12 hours postburn, decreased plasma oncotic pressure resulting from depleted plasma protein levels contributes to fluid movement into the tissues.

### Evaluation of the "Early" use of albumin in children with extensive burns: a randomized controlled trial [^1172dXZP]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare early versus delayed albumin resuscitation in children with burns in terms of clinical outcome and response.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Burn center at a tertiary care teaching hospital.

Patients

Forty-six children aged 1–12 years with burns greater than 15–45% total body surface area admitted within 12 hours of burn injury.

Interventions

Fluid resuscitation was based on the Parkland formula (3mL/kg/% total body surface area), adjusted according to urine output. Patients received 5% albumin solution between 8 and 12 hours post burn in the intervention group (n = 23) and 24 hours post burn in the control group (n = 23). Both groups were assessed for reduction in crystalloid fluid infusion during resuscitation, development of fluid creep, and length of hospital stay.

Measurements and Main Results

There was no difference between groups regarding age, weight, sex, % total body surface area, cause of burn, or severity scores. The median crystalloid fluid volume required during the first 3 days post burn was lower in the intervention than in the control group (2.04 vs 3.05mL/kg/% total body surface area; p = 0.025 on day 1; 1.2 vs 1.71mL/kg/% total body surface area; p = 0.002 on day 2; and 0.82 vs 1.3mL/kg/% total body surface area; p = 0.002 on day 3). The median urine output showed no difference between intervention and control groups (2.1 vs 2.0mL/kg/hr; p = 0.152 on day 1; 2.58 vs 2.54mL/kg/hr; p = 0.482 on day 2; and 2.9 vs 3.0mL/kg/hr; p = 0.093 on day 3). Fluid creep was observed in 13 controls (56.5%) and in one patient (4.3%) in the intervention group. The median length of hospital stay was 18 days (range, 15–21 d) for controls and 14 days (range, 10–17 d) in the intervention group (p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Early albumin infusion in children with burns greater than 15–45% total body surface area reduced the need for crystalloid fluid infusion during resuscitation. Significantly fewer cases of fluid creep and shorter hospital stay were also observed in this group of patients.

### Treatment of burns in the first 24 hours: simple and practical guide by answering 10 questions in a step-by-step form [^11615fmD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

50% of this volume is infused in the first 8 hours, starting from the time of injury, and the other 50% is infused during the last 16 hours of the first day.

The type of fluid administration is a debatable question. Lactated Ringer has been commonly used and is even used up to date. On the other hand, many centres suggest balanced electrolyte solutions like Ringer-acetate to prevent the high dose administration of lactate. According to our experience and to the best of our knowledge, we believe that balanced electrolyte solutions are a safe option and therefore they are recommended in our centre. Furthermore, specific burn populations usually require higher resuscitation volumes sometimes as much as 30–40% higher (close to 5.7 mL/kg/%TBSA) than predicted by the Parkland formula. Klein et al have suggested that patients today are receiving more fluid than in the past. Their purpose was to find significant predictors of negative outcomes after resuscitation. They concluded that higher volumes equalled a higher risk for complications, i.e. lung-complications. These results support that fluid overload in the critical hours of early burn management may lead to unnecessary oedema.

Overall, the use of Parkland formula is just a process of estimation. Clinically, fluid needs of an individual, after the use of any suggested formula, should be at least monitored by several important factors such urine output, blood pressure and central venous pressure. An important point and considered to be the goal in fluid resuscitation is to maintain a urine output of approximately 0.5 ml/kg/h in adults and between 0.5 and 1.0 ml/kg/h in patients weighing less than 30 kg. Failure to meet these goals should be addressed with gentle upward corrections in the rate of fluid administration by approximately 25%.

Due to the capillary leak, most burn centres advise not to use colloids and other blood products within the first 24 hours. If used in the early phase (up to 12 h), it can lead to a prolonged tissue oedema and consecutive lung complications. Furthermore colloids are not associated with an improvement in survival, and are therefore more expensive than crystalloids. Liberati et al advocated that there is no evidence that blood products (including human albumin) reduce mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline.

### Patient survival after human albumin administration. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^112qcWrj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To test the hypothesis that albumin administration is not associated with excess mortality.

Data Sources

Computer searches of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, the Cochrane Library, and Internet documents; hand searching of medical journals; inquiries to investigators and medical directors; and review of reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing albumin therapy with crystalloid therapy, no albumin, or lower doses of albumin.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data. The primary end point was relative risk for death. Criteria used to assess methodologic quality were blinding, method of allocation concealment, presence of mortality as a study end point, and crossover. Small-trial bias was also investigated.

Data Synthesis

Fifty-five trials involving surgery or trauma, burns, hypoalbuminemia, high-risk neonates, ascites, and other indications were included. Albumin administration did not significantly affect mortality in any category of indications. For all trials, the relative risk for death was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.28). Relative risk was lower among trials with blinding (0.73 [CI, 0.48 to 1.12]; n = 7), mortality as an end point (1.00 [CI, 0.84 to 1.18]; n = 17), no crossover (1.04 [CI, 0.89 to 1.22]; n = 35), and 100 or more patients (0.94 [CI, 0.77 to 1.14]; n = 10). In trials with two or more such attributes, relative risk was further reduced.

Conclusions

Overall, no effect of albumin on mortality was detected; any such effect may therefore be small. This finding supports the safety of albumin. The influence of methodologic quality on relative risk for death suggests the need for further well-designed clinical trials.

### Plasma disappearance rate of albumin when infused as a 20% solution [^1165PXA1]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

No accelerated disappearance rate was observed when albumin was given as a 20% solution in patients with inflammation due to post-burn injury, in patients undergoing surgery without major hemorrhage, or in patients studied one day after major surgery. In these settings, infused albumin remained in the plasma as long as was observed in volunteers.

American Burn Association burn shock resuscitation — adult acute fluid resuscitation scope and key recommendations: This Clinical Practice Guideline addresses the topic of acute fluid resuscitation during the first 48 hours following a burn injury for adults with burns ≥ 20% of the total body surface area (%TBSA). A systematic literature search returned 5978 titles and after 3 levels of screening, 24 studies met criteria. We recommend that clinicians consider the use of human albumin solution, especially in patients with larger burns, to lower resuscitation volumes and improve urine output. We recommend initiating resuscitation based on providing 2 mL/kg/% TBSA burn in order to reduce resuscitation fluid volumes. We recommend selective monitoring of intraabdominal and intraocular pressure during burn shock resuscitation. We make a weak recommendation for clinicians to consider the use of computer decision support software to guide fluid titration and lower resuscitation fluid volumes. We do not recommend the use of transpulmonary thermodilution-derived variables to guide burn shock resuscitation. We are unable to make any recommendations on the use of high-dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), early continuous renal replacement therapy, or vasopressors as adjuncts during acute burn shock resuscitation. Mortality is an important outcome in burn shock resuscitation, but it was not formally included as a PICO outcome because the available scientific literature is missing studies of sufficient population size and quality to allow us to confidently make recommendations related to the outcome of survival at this time.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, more specifically with respect to management of sepsis, ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend to ensure rapid recognition and initiate aggressive empiric treatment of sepsis to improve outcomes in patients with burns:

- administer IV fluids to a target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg

- administer crystalloids as the initial fluid; insufficient evidence on the role of albumin

- set a goal to normalize lactate levels

- administer norepinephrine as the vasopressor of choice and vasopressin or epinephrine as second choices

- administer dobutamine as an option for inotropic support

- obtain cultures (blood, urine, sputum) and check the burn wound (and culture if suspected to be infected) before starting antibiotics

- initiate empiric antibiotics covering likely pathogens as soon as possible after the diagnosis of sepsis is made.

### Human albumin solution for resuscitation and volume expansion in critically ill patients [^114eoTJn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Human albumin solutions are used for a range of medical and surgical problems. Licensed indications are the emergency treatment of shock and other conditions where restoration of blood volume is urgent, such as in burns and hypoproteinaemia. Human albumin solutions are more expensive than other colloids and crystalloids.

Objectives

To quantify the effect on mortality of human albumin and plasma protein fraction (PPF) administration in the management of critically ill patients.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 31 May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1948 to week 3 May 2011), EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to Week 21 2011), CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to May 2011), PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/) (searched 10 June 2011, limit: last 60 days). Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked, and authors of identified trials were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing albumin or PPF with no albumin or PPF or with a crystalloid solution in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on the participants, albumin solution used, mortality at the end of follow up, and quality of allocation concealment. Analysis was stratified according to patient type.

Main Results

We found 38 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting death as an outcome. There were 1,958 deaths among 10,842 trial participants. For hypovolaemia, the relative risk of death following albumin administration was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.13). This estimate was heavily influenced by the results of the SAFE trial, which contributed 75.2% of the information (based on the weights in the meta-analysis). For burns, the relative risk was 2.93 (95% CI 1.28 to 6.72) and for hypoalbuminaemia the relative risk was 1.26 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.88). There was no substantial heterogeneity between the trials in the various categories (Chi(2) = 26.66, df = 31, P = 0.69). The pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.05 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.16).

Authors' Conclusions

For patients with hypovolaemia, there is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline. There is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality in critically ill patients with burns and hypoalbuminaemia. The possibility that there may be highly selected populations of critically ill patients in which albumin may be indicated remains open to question. However, in view of the absence of evidence of a mortality benefit from albumin and the increased cost of albumin compared to alternatives such as saline, it would seem reasonable that albumin should only be used within the context of well concealed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials.

### Morbidity in hospitalized patients receiving human albumin: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^1118Hgim]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of albumin administration on morbidity in acutely ill hospitalized patients.

Data Source

Computer searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library; hand searches of journals and Index Medicus; inquiries with investigators and fluid product suppliers; and examination of reference lists. No language or time period restrictions were adopted.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing the administration of albumin with that of crystalloid, no albumin, or lower-dose albumin.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data. The primary endpoint for the meta-analysis was morbidity, defined as the incidence of complications, including death. Trial quality was evaluated by blinding, allocation concealment, presence of morbidity as a study endpoint, and individual patient crossover.

Data Synthesis

Seventy-one trials were included in the categories of surgery or trauma, burns, hypoalbuminemia, high-risk neonates, ascites, and other indications. The 3,782 randomized patients in the included trials experienced a total of 3,287 complications, including 515 deaths and 2,772 cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, infectious, renal, respiratory, and other complications. Albumin significantly reduced overall morbidity, with a risk ratio of 0.92 (confidence interval [CI] 0.86–0.98). Control group albumin dose significantly affected the incidence of complications (p = .002). In 32 trials with no albumin administered to the control group, the risk ratio was 0.77 (CI, 0.67–0.88) compared with 0.89 (CI, 0.80–1.00) in 20 trials with control patients receiving low-dose albumin and 1.07 (CI, 0.96–1.20) in 19 trials with moderate-dose control group albumin.

Conclusions

Albumin reduces morbidity in acutely ill hospitalized patients. Concomitant administration of albumin in the control group can obscure the effects of albumin on clinical outcome in randomized trials.

### Human albumin solution for resuscitation and volume expansion in critically ill patients [^1136hYw8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Human albumin solutions are used in a range of medical and surgical problems. Licensed indications are the emergency treatment of shock and other conditions where restoration of blood volume is urgent, burns, and hypoproteinaemia. Human albumin solutions are more expensive than other colloids and crystalloids.

Objectives

To quantify the effect on mortality of human albumin and plasma protein fraction (PPF) administration in the management of critically ill patients.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group trials register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase and BIDS Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked, and authors of identified trials were contacted. The search was last updated in November 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing albumin/PPF with no albumin/PPF, or with a crystalloid solution, in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on the participants, albumin solution used, mortality at the end of follow up, and quality of allocation concealment. Analysis was stratified according to patient type.

Main Results

We found 31 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting death as an outcome. There were 177 deaths among 1519 trial participants. For each patient category the risk of death in the albumin treated group was higher than in the comparison group. For hypovolaemia the relative risk of death following albumin administration was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 2.22), for burns the relative risk was 2.40 (1.11 to 5.19), and for hypoalbuminaemia the relative risk was 1.38 (0.94 to 2.03). The pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.52 (1.17 to 1.99). Overall, the risk of death in patients receiving albumin was 14% compared to 9% in the control groups, an increase in the risk of death of 5% (2% to 8%). These data suggest that for every 20 critically ill patients treated with albumin there is one additional death.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence that albumin administration reduces the risk of death in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia, and a strong suggestion that it may increase the risk of death. These data suggest that the use of human albumin in critically ill patients should be urgently reviewed and that it should not be used outside the context of a rigorously conducted randomised controlled trial.

RESULTS

Included Studies

Through the search process 135 candidate study reports were identified (Figure 1). On screening of the abstracts, 31 of the reports were excluded, most often because they were review articles without original data. The full text of the other 104 articles was examined in detail. At that stage 96 additional reports were excluded, again most frequently because of lack of original data.

Figure 1.
Study selection process.

The remaining eight studies, four randomized, and four nonrandomized, with a total of 688 patients were included. – One randomized study involved both pediatric and adult patients, and only the data pertaining to the adults were extracted and analyzed. Another randomized study evaluated an echocardiographic protocol in 29 patients and a lung water protocol in 50 patients. Outcomes were reported exclusively for the lung water protocol, and only the data for those 50 patients were included in the meta-analysis.

Most of the studies were conducted in the United States (Table 1). The control fluid was lactated Ringer's in all but one study.

Table 1.
Study characteristics

Fluid protocols differed according to study design. In the randomized studies, test fluids were administered early to every patient, in all cases within the first 12 hours. Among the nonrandomized studies, by contrast, albumin was commenced only after 8 to 12 hours as rescue therapy for the difficult cases with observed excessive fluid requirements.

Should albumin infusions target albumin levels?

The need to make decisions as to whether or not a particular patient should receive albumin based on their albumin level is related to whether the considered use is targeted as resuscitation or supplementation. Most patients requiring resuscitation fluids in the ICU are hypoalbuminemic and, as mentioned earlier, the fluid will be given largely for its effects on COP – that is, limiting edema formation – provided that the hydrostatic pressure does not increase excessively. In such patients, monitoring the albumin concentration is probably of little value.

In more prolonged administration as supplementation, however, serum albumin levels may be a useful guide to ongoing needs, in combination with disease severity, hemodynamic status, and nutritional status; just as an arbitrary cutoff hemoglobin concentration should not be used to define absolute need for blood transfusion in all patients, so a specific serum albumin threshold for albumin administration is unlikely to be relevant to all. The meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients mentioned earlier suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. As a result, the ALBIOS study protocol stipulated that albumin administration should be titrated to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l. Albumin levels were measured on a daily basis and 200 or 300 mL of 20% albumin were administered in patients with albumin levels between 25 and 30 g/l or < 25 g/l, respectively. Following the time course of albumin levels, especially in response to an albumin infusion, may be more valuable than a single albumin level, but optimal albumin levels during critical illness are not clearly defined.

What type of albumin preparation?

Currently available human albumin solutions are developed using various techniques, such that the various commercially available albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidant properties, charge, capacity to bind drugs, and so forth. This is a difficult topic to evaluate because there are few data available about the precise composition of the different albumin solutions and whether or how this may impact on its clinical properties, but the differences may help explain some of the different study results. One study comparing six different commercially available preparations of albumin with serum albumin from healthy volunteers reported large differences between the solutions, particularly in terms of the presence of oxidized cysteine 34 (23% in human volunteer albumin vs 54 to 60% in commercial preparations), which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions. Precise compositions of albumin solution should be clearly identified in future study reports.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^112bQMmD]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation (American Burn Association CPG) — methods and PICO questions: The panel created 10 questions for adults with burns ≥ 20% TBSA assessing whether interventions reduce total fluid resuscitation volume or total crystalloid resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours post burn, increase urine output, or decrease edema-related complications. Questions address albumin during the first 24 hours versus crystalloid alone; timing of albumin initiation early (< 12 hours post burn) versus later (≥ 12 hours post burn); starting resuscitation at 2 mL/kg/%TBSA burn versus 4 mL/kg/%TBSA burn; use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) during acute resuscitation compared with crystalloids alone; high dose (66 mg/kg/hour) ascorbic acid (vitamin C) during crystalloid resuscitation; titrating fluids with central venous pressure (CVP), transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD), or stroke volume variation (SVV) or pulse pressure variation (PPV) versus hourly urine output with conventional endpoints; use of computerized decision support software (CDSS) to titrate fluids versus hourly urine output alone; consideration of early continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT); and monitoring intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), intra-ocular pressure (IOP), serum lactate (L), and arterial base deficit (BD) during the first 48 hours post burn. "Edema-related complications" were defined as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), limb (extremity) compartment syndrome, orbital compartment syndrome (OCS), elevated IOP, or pulmonary edema (radiologic or reduced PaO2/FiO2 ratio in first 48 hours).

### Burn resuscitation practices in north America: results of the acute burn resUscitation multicenter prospective trial (ABRUPT) [^116XKAPC]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

ABRUPT was a prospective, noninterventional, observational study of resuscitation practices at 21 burn centers. The primary goal was to examine burn resuscitation with albumin or crystalloids alone, to design a future prospective randomized trial.

Summary Background Data

No modern prospective study has determined whether to use colloids or crystalloids for acute burn resuscitation.

Methods

Patients ≥ 18 years with burns ≥ 20% total body surface area (TBSA) had hourly documentation of resuscitation parameters for 48 hours. Patients received either crystalloids alone or had albumin supplemented to crystalloid based on center protocols.

Results

Of 379 enrollees, two-thirds (253) were resuscitated with albumin and one-third (126) were resuscitated with crystalloid alone. Albumin patients received more total fluid than Crystalloid patients (5.2 ± 2.3 vs 3.7 ± 1.7 mL/kg/% TBSA burn/24 hours), but patients in the Albumin Group were older, had larger burns, higher admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and more inhalation injury. Albumin lowered the in-to-out (I/O) ratio and was started ≤ 12 hours in patients with the highest initial fluid requirements, given > 12 hours with intermediate requirements, and avoided in patients who responded to crystalloid alone.

Conclusions

Albumin use is associated with older age, larger and deeper burns, and more severe organ dysfunction at presentation. Albumin supplementation is started when initial crystalloid rates are above expected targets and improves the I/O ratio. The fluid received in the first 24 hours was at or above the Parkland Formula estimate.

### Plasma volume expansion and capillary leakage of 20% albumin in burned patients and volunteers [^116GWFdY]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Infusion of 20% albumin induced a long-lasting plasma volume expansion that amounted to twice the infused volume, as well as a urinary excretion that was 2.5 times the infused volume. The effectiveness was similar in patients studied at an average of 7 days post-burn when compared with healthy volunteers, despite marked differences in inflammatory biomarkers.

### Albumin supplementation for hypoalbuminemia following burns: unnecessary and costly! [^116TRjwq]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Following fluid resuscitation, patients with major burns frequently develop prolonged hypoalbuminemia. It is not known whether this should be corrected by albumin supplementation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are any benefits associated with albumin supplementation to correct hypoalbuminemia in burned adults. We conducted a retrospective comparison of patients with burns ≥ 20% TBSA admitted to an adult regional American Burn Association-verified burn center, from May 1, 2009, to September 30, 2010, where we did not routinely supplement albumin (control group), with patients admitted from October 1, 2010, to May 30, 2011, where we had instituted a protocol in which 5% human albumin was provided to maintain serum albumin levels > 20 g/L (albumin group). Comparisons were made from postburn (PB) day 2 to day 30 inclusive. There were no significant differences between control (n = 26) and albumin (n = 17) in age (48 ± 15 vs 45 ± 21 years; P = 0.56), burn size (33 ± 13 vs 34 ± 13%TBSA; P = 0.831), or full thickness burn size (19 ± 19 vs 23 ± 19%TBSA; P = 0.581). Inhalation injury was significantly more frequent in the albumin group than in controls (71% vs 31%; P = 0.01). The groups did not differ significantly in need for admission escharotomy, admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, number of surgical procedures/first 30 days, or 24 and 48 hours fluid resuscitation volume requirements. The overall mean daily serum albumin level from PB day 2 to 30 in the albumin group (26.9 ± 3.0 g/L) was significantly greater than in controls (21.9 ± 4.4 g/L; P < .001). There were no significant differences between the groups in daily SOFA score/first 30 days, peak SOFA score, ΔSOFA, hospital length of stay, time to wound healing, duration of mechanical ventilation, or 30-day and in-hospital mortality. The cost of routinely supplementing 5% albumin between PB day 2 to 30 in the albumin group was more than four times that for the controls where we did not routinely provide albumin (Can $65.50 vs Can $16.57 per patient per day). We conclude that routine supplementation of 5% human albumin to maintain a serum albumin level ≥ 20 g/L in burn patients is expensive and provides no benefit.

### Is albumin administration in the acutely ill associated with increased mortality? Results of the SOAP study [^115Ppmzn]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

The reason for an increased mortality in patients who received albumin cannot be identified from our study. Albumin has well-recognized, potentially important functions in the critically ill, including maintenance of colloid oncotic pressure, binding capacity for drugs and other substances, and scavenging of oxygen free radicals. Starling's principle may not appropriately reflect the microcirculation in critically ill patients, however, especially under conditions of capillary leakage, as may happen in sepsis or burns. Other possible negative effects of albumin administration may include myocardial depression due to decreased ionic calcium, and impaired renal function. Furthermore, albumin has anti-thrombotic properties that might be detrimental in some patients.

The recently completed, randomized controlled SAFE study showed no differences in outcome in critically ill patients requiring fluid repletion who were treated with 4% albumin compared to those treated with saline. The SAFE study was without doubt a well-conducted study that answered adequately the question it asked, that is, that in a heterogeneous population of critically ill patients albumin does not seem to have harmful effects. However, albumin was given, often transiently, as part of a fluid challenge and a 4% albumin solution was used. Therefore, a number of patients received only small amounts of albumin that were unlikely to influence outcome.

### Hemodynamic management of critically ill burn patients: an international survey [^1152yNGK]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of the initial management of severely burned patients with the dual purpose of avoiding both under- and over-resuscitation. There is a lack of consensus regarding the ideal amount and type of fluid and vasopressor use during initial resuscitation in this population.

This international survey focuses on the current practices regarding hemodynamic management of severely burned adult patients (total body surface burn area (TBSA) > 20%, with mechanical ventilation) in the early phase after injury.

The study was designed as an electronic survey addressed to intensive care unit (ICU) physicians. Experts of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) Burn ICU working group were invited to review the original survey. The final questionnaire (32 questions) is provided in Additional file 1. A link to an electronic questionnaire was sent to all ESICM members (with reminding emails on a bimonthly frequency) and was posted on the ESICM website. The link was active between 31 August and 18 October 2017.

There were 173 total respondents to the questionnaire. The respondents were from 58 different countries (72% were high-income countries) with most in Europe (62%). The background of the respondents was mainly intensive care (61%) and anesthesiology (31%). Most of the respondents (61%) declared working in a mixed ICU, and 60% of the responders worked in centers with less than 50 adult burn patients admitted annually. Additional file 2 summarizes the difference in participant responses between burn centers and nonspecialized centers. In 76% of the cases, a local protocol for fluid resuscitation was used. The Parkland formula (4 ml/kg/%TBSA) is used to start volume therapy on admission by 54% of the responders. In the first 48 h, the five most frequently used parameters to guide volume therapy are represented in Fig. 1a. Fifty five % of the respondents declared monitoring cardiac output and 65% among them use echocardiography. Techniques used to monitor cardiac output continuously are presented in Fig. 1b. The most commonly used crystalloid and colloid were respectively Ringer Lactate and albumin 20%. Triggers to initiate colloid infusion are presented in Fig. 1c. While considering other strategies to reduce fluid requirements, 80% of responders consider early norepinephrine administration (Fig. 1d).

### Plasma volume expansion and capillary leakage of 20% albumin in burned patients and volunteers [^1155d6YY]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Burn injury is associated with a long-standing inflammatory reaction. The use of albumin solutions for plasma volume support is controversial because of concerns of increased capillary leakage, which could aggravate the commonly seen interstitial oedema.

Methods

In the present open controlled clinical trial, an intravenous infusion of 20% albumin at 3 mL/kg was given over 30 min to 15 burn patients and 15 healthy volunteers. Blood samples and urine were collected for 5 h. Plasma dilution, plasma albumin and colloid osmotic pressure were compared. Mass balance calculations were used to estimate plasma volume expansion and capillary leakage of fluid and albumin.

Results

The patients were studied between 4 and 14 (median, 7) days after the burn injury, which spread over 7–48% (median, 15%) of the total body surface area. The albumin solution expanded the plasma volume by almost 15%, equivalent to twice the infused volume, in both groups. The urinary excretion exceeded the infused volume by a factor of 2.5. Capillary leakage of albumin occurred at a rate of 3.4 ± 1.5 g/h in burn patients and 3.7 ± 1.6 g/h in the volunteers (P = 0.61), which corresponded to 2.4 ± 1.0% and 2.5 ± 1.2% per hour of the intravascular pool (P = 0.85). The median half-life of the plasma volume expansion was 5.9 (25th–75th percentiles 2.7–11.7) h in the burn patients and 6.9 (3.4–8.5) h in the volunteers (P = 0.56).

Conclusions

Albumin 20% was an effective volume expander in patients at 1 week post-burn. No relevant differences were found between burn patients and healthy volunteers.

### Early albumin use improves mortality in difficult to resuscitate burn patients [^114jpMbE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal resuscitation algorithm remains elusive for patients with a large burn injury. Recent reports from the military support that larger burns that do not respond well to ongoing lactated Ringer's solution resuscitation may improve with the use of 5% albumin and vasopressors. We hypothesized that the use of 5% albumin and vasopressors, as needed, would decrease complications of fluid resuscitation and burn mortality.

Methods

Fluid needs during the first 24 hours after burn injury, complications, and demographics were collected from all patients 12 years and older with burn size 20% or more of total body surface area admitted from 2003 to 2010. In March 2007, we changed our resuscitation to include the use of 5% albumin in the first 24 hours if the estimated fluid needs at 12 hours after burn would lead to a fluid volume of 6 mL/kg per percent burn at 24 hours. The patients treated before this change (Preprotocol) were compared with those treated after the guideline change (Postprotocol).

Results

The two groups were well matched for age, burn size, and inhalation injury. Ventilator days and mortality were decreased in the Postprotocol group. There was a trend toward less intravenous fluid use in the Postprotocol group where the use of albumin was higher. There was significantly less vasopressor infusion in the Postprotocol group. There was no statistical difference in the number of escharotomies performed or overall incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome, but no patient required open laparotomy in the Postprotocol group.

Conclusion

An algorithm incorporating albumin use in the first 24 hours after burn injury was associated with the use of less vasopressor agents and lower mortality. Early albumin use was also associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation in burn patients sustaining burns 20% or more total body surface area.

### A review of the use of human albumin in burn patients [^115neF67]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

This review article examines the use of human albumin (HA) in burn treatment. Generally, there are two scenarios where HA may be administered: acutely as a volume expander during burn shock resuscitation and chronically following resuscitation to correct hypoalbuminemia. Although colloids were the cornerstone of the earliest burn resuscitation formulas, HA was in fact rarely used. More recently however, with the recognition of fluid creep, HA usage during resuscitation has increased. Animal studies demonstrate that during acute fluid resuscitation, administration of colloids, including albumin (ALB), have no ability to arrest the formation of burn wound edema, but they do reduce edema formation in the nonburn soft tissues and help preserve intravascular volume and reduce resuscitation fluid requirements with no apparent increase in extravascular water accumulation in the lung. Human studies suggest that immediate use of ALB during acute resuscitation achieves adequate resuscitation using a lower total overall volume requirement, transiently provides better maintenance of intravascular volume and cardiac output, produces less overall edema gain than crystalloid resuscitation alone but may be associated with increased extravascular lung water accumulation during the first postburn week. However, many questions remain unanswered, and modern, large-scale prospective studies are desperately needed. Maintenance of normal serum ALB levels through continuous supplementation of HA following burn resuscitation is even less well understood. Although this approach makes physiologic sense, the limited amount of available data from human burn studies reveal that chronic ALB supplementation is expensive and may not result in any major clinical benefits. Again, modernized prospective studies are greatly needed in this area.

### The effect of albumin administration in critically ill patients: a retrospective single-center analysis [^115ppihR]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: We aimed to analyze the effects of albumin on plasma volume in critically ill patients by assessing their hemoglobin before and after albumin administration.

Findings: This retrospective study included over 20,000 patients and showed a significant decrease in hemoglobin levels of over 8 g/L upon administration of 25 g albumin in 500 mL. This effect lasted for at least 12 hours and was also observable in patients with septic shock.

Meaning: Albumin is given more liberally in intensive care and has a significant and long-lasting effect on volume management.

The administration of albumin in critically ill patients has been a controversial topic for many decades. Although this abundant protein and key player in microvascular fluid exchange may have gained popularity in recent years, a lot of reservations concerning its use remain. This may partially be due to a lack of full therapeutic understanding about when to use albumin.

In the early 2000s, albumin was regarded as a potentially harmful blood product. The Saline Versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation trial of 2004, which compared the effect of 4% albumin and normal saline, concluded that albumin is not more harmful than normal saline. A revised clinical standard of equivalence between albumin and saline for volume resuscitation in critically ill patients was subsequently established. In the 2014 Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS) trial, which was the first randomized controlled trial investigating albumin in septic shock, no harm was observed compared to using crystalloid solutions alone. In fact, the albumin group showed small hemodynamic advantages. A post hoc analysis revealed a significant reduction in 90-day mortality for the most severe patients. According to a meta-analysis in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock the use of albumin demonstrated a significant reduction in 90-day mortality. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a synthetic colloid, was found to be more harmful than crystalloids in several studies, particularly in the 6S trial published in 2012. Thanks to its oncotic properties, albumin causes hemodilution as shown by Hahn and Zdolsek. In their study, the administration of 20%-albumin solution in healthy subjects caused a volume expansion of up to 3.4 mL (± 1.2 mL) per infused mL of 20%-albumin solution. Similar effects have been seen in septic, postburn, and in postoperative patients. This dilution causes a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and the drop can be used to assess the degree of volume expansion caused by albumin administration.

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^111FpMrP]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

METHODS

Inclusion Criteria

Controlled clinical studies comparing purified human albumin with crystalloid for burn shock resuscitation of adult patients were eligible for inclusion. Studies of postresuscitation albumin supplementation for hypoalbuminemia were not considered. Data on mortality and/or morbidity must have been available. Safeguards against bias arising from imbalances in baseline risk of poor outcome must have been implemented either through random allocation to treatment or, in the case of nonrandomized studies, by adjustment for observed imbalances with multivariate statistical methods. No language or time period restrictions were imposed.

Search Techniques

Published and unpublished studies conforming to the above inclusion criteria were sought by a variety of methods, including computer searches of bibliographic databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE), the Cochrane Library, meeting abstract databases and other Internet-resident information resources. Online and hard copy journal contents were perused. Reference lists were examined.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data from the reports of included studies. Differences in interpretation were resolved by discussion. Extracted data consisted of: study year, locale, and design; numbers of study centers, patients, deaths, and complications; resuscitation fluid regimens compared; age; %TBSA burned; inhalation injury; and imbalances in baseline risk factors.

Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome measure was the OR for mortality and particular types of complications. The pooled OR for included studies and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed under a random-effects model. Heterogeneity, that is, variability of effect size greater than expected for a homogeneous population of studies, was evaluated by Cochran Q test and the I 2 statistic. Differences in effect between randomized and nonrandomized studies were determined by test of interaction. Publication bias was assessed by linear regression of standardized effect vs precision. Quality assessment of randomized studies included three validated criteria: randomization method, allocation concealment, and blinding.

### Burn shock and resuscitation: proceedings of a symposium conducted at the meeting of the American Burn Association, Chicago, IL, 21 April 2015 [^113ffmhF]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

The Special Interest Groups of the American Burn Association provide a forum for interested members of the multidisciplinary burn team to congregate and discuss matters of mutual interest. At the 47th Annual Meeting of the American Burn Association in Chicago, IL, the Fluid Resuscitation Special Interest Group sponsored a special symposium on burn resuscitation. The purpose of the symposium was to review the history, current status, and future direction of fluid resuscitation of patients with burn shock. The reader will note several themes running through the following presentations. One is the perennial question of the proper role for albumin or other fluid-sparing strategies. Another is the unique characteristics of the pediatric burn patient. A third is the need for multicenter trials of burn resuscitation, while recognizing the obstacles to conducting randomized controlled trials in this setting.

Methods

Subjects

The present report is a secondary publication to four publications in which 3 mL/kg of 20% albumin (approximately 200 mL) was administered over 30 min at a constant rate by an infusion pump to 70 subjects in the following clinical settings: healthy volunteers (N = 15), post-burn patients (N = 15), ongoing surgery with minor blood loss (N = 15), ongoing surgery with major bleeding (N = 10), and postoperative patients (N = 15). Reporting adhered to the STROBE checklist.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Healthy volunteers included subjects with age > 18 years and blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration > 100 g/L.

The post-burn study recruited patients with a burn area > 6% of the Total Body Surface Area and age between 18 and 80 years. Exclusion criteria were unconsciousness, severe allergy, kidney failure or heart failure.

The study of ongoing elective surgery with minor blood loss recruited patients scheduled for surgery lasting for at least 5 h but without an expected major hemorrhage. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, poor health status (American Society of Anesthesiologist´s [ASA] Classes III-IV), severe allergy, kidney failure or heart failure.

For the study of ongoing elective surgery with major bleeding, patients were recruited who were > 18 years old and scheduled to undergo pelvic lymph node dissection, open radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. Exclusion criteria were renal dysfunction (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative stage ≥ 3), severe allergy, heart failure and alcohol abuse.

Inclusion criteria for the study of postoperative patients with inflammation were age > 18 years, ASA I-II, and Hb concentration of > 90 g/L.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^114sHcK1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Which concentration of albumin solution?

Albumin solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, mainly 20 to 25% or 4 to 5%, and which concentration should be used has generated some debate. Direct blood volume measurements in humans have revealed that the intravascular volume effect of isooncotic preparations of human albumin solutions is much higher than that of crystalloids (> 80% vs < 20%). However, the albumin concentration chosen largely depends on whether other fluids, especially crystalloids, are administered simultaneously – a 20% (20 g in 100 ml) albumin solution given simultaneously with 500 mL of normal saline solution is equivalent to a 3.3% (20/600) albumin solution. Nevertheless, hyperoncotic albumin may be a better choice if edema is already present, avoiding excessive sodium and chloride loads and their attendant complications.

Which dose of albumin?

Determining the ideal dose or volume of albumin that should be used is difficult. Early physiological studies demonstrated that administration of 5% albumin to septic patients expanded the plasma volume by an amount equivalent to the volume infused. Different studies have used different doses, and perhaps the dose should be adjusted according to a target serum albumin concentration, as in the ALBIOS study. The dose chosen by Mira and colleagues in the EARSS study (100 mL of 20% albumin 8 hourly for 3 days) achieved an increase in serum albumin to 25 to 29 g/l, raising the possibility that the albumin dose used may have been too low to show definite benefit – although this increase was similar to that reported in the SAFE study subgroup analysis of patients with sepsis, in whom a benefit was reported.

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^116gpYxe]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Nonrandomized Study Quality

Published from 2007 to 2012, the four nonrandomized studies accounted for 81.2% of the total patients in the meta-analysis (Table 1). Thus, these studies were more recent and far larger than their randomized counterparts. They were, however, limited at least in part by retrospective design. Two were retrospective case–control studies. The other two compared patients before vs after the institution of a new fluid protocol calling for the use of 5% albumin in difficult-to-resuscitate patients. In one of those two, data were prospectively collected for consecutive patients after the switch to the new protocol. Otherwise the prospective vs retrospective design of the two before–after studies was unspecified.

Both retrospective case–control studies exhibited significant baseline risk imbalances. In one, inhalation injury was 2.9-fold more frequent in the albumin group (Table 2). In the other, baseline APACHE II score was higher in the albumin group. In both studies, results were adjusted for baseline imbalance using multivariate logistic regression. The groups differed slightly but significantly by age in one before–after study (Table 2).

Fluid interventions

In total, 2068 patients were exposed to pooled human albumin solutions as outlined in table 2and the online supplement. Median albumin exposure was 175.0 g (16.0–180.0 g) for a median of 3 days (40 minutes–28 days) in a median volume of 1.7 L (0.4–3.4 L). Thus the median daily albumin exposure was 70.0 g (16.0–300.0 g). Early infusionwithin 6,12, and 24 hourswas described in seven trials. Five studiesused a fixed predefined protocol with a median of 40.0 g daily (range 16–60 g) for 3 days (40 minutes–28 days), representing a total median exposure of 180.0 g (16–220 g) in 0.9 L (0.4–1.1 L).

Three studies were designed to improve hypoalbuminaemia in addition to fluid volume expansion and resuscitation. Early (≤ 24 hours) improvement of hypoalbuminaemia resulted in a median albumin concentration of 26.5 g/L (24.0–28.6 g/L), representing a median increase from baseline of 5.4 g/L (1.0–16.0 g/L). The median overall post-intervention hypoalbuminaemia was 28.0 g/L (25.0–29.5 g/L), representing a median increase from baseline of 5.7 g/L (5.3–16.0 g/L) with treatment. ALBIOSand SAFEintervention protocols were ≤ 28 days or intensive care unit length of stay, but their respective medians were 9 and 8.2 days. The median post-intervention albumin concentration on day 7 was 27.2 g/L (25.0–29.4 g/L) for ALBIOSand SAFE, with a median increase from baseline of 2.8 g/L (1–4.5 g/L).

Comparison fluid exposures were crystalloids (0.9% saline, Ringer's lactate) received in control group arms by 2122 patients, and colloids (hydroxyethyl starch, gelatin) by 156 patients. Exposure to 6% tetrastarch 130 kDa occurred in 36 patients across two small studies, and gelatin in six patients.

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^115zQ2n4]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Morbidity

The most frequently reported forms of morbidity were compartment syndrome of the abdomen or extremities (Figure 3), respiratory complications (Figure 4), and renal dysfunction (Figure 5). Thirty-eight total cases of compartment syndrome were reported among two randomized and three nonrandomized studies. The albumin group experienced a marked relative decrease of 81% in the odds of compartment syndrome (pooled OR, 0.19; P < .001). The magnitude of the effect did not differ between the randomized and nonrandomized studies (P = 0.71), and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.29) or publication bias (P = 0.28).

Albumin infusion was accompanied by reduced odds of respiratory complications, renal dysfunction, need for escharotomy or fasciotomy, tissue necrosis, sepsis, cardiovascular complications, edema, hypoproteinemia, local infection, and gastrointestinal and central nervous system complications (Figures 4 and 5; Table 3). In most instances, these differences were nevertheless not statistically significant. Only gastrointestinal and central nervous system complications, reported in a single randomized study, were significantly reduced by albumin.

### Early fluid resuscitation with hydroxyethyl starch 130 / 0.4 (6%) in severe burn injury: a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial [^112HfzVn]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Interventions

The primary study medication was balanced 6% HES 130/0.4. After patient enrollment and randomization, fluid resuscitation was done as follows. Each patient first received two bags of unblinded lactated Ringer's solution (500 mL each bag), followed by one bag (500 mL) of blinded study solution, the latter being either again lactated Ringer's solution or balanced 6% HES 130/0.4. After each bag of study solution, all patients again received two bags of unblinded lactated Ringer's solution, before a next bag of study solution from the blinded box was infused. This fluid regimen alternating unblinded lactated Ringer's fluid with blinded study solution ensured an overall ratio of crystalloids versus colloids of 2:1 in the HES patients. The patients not receiving HES but blinded lactated Ringer's study solution instead were exposed solely to crystalloids during the entire course of the study. Fluid resuscitation was guided by predefined target variables as listed in Figure 1. Accordingly, fluid administration was increased or decreased until target variables were reached. The administration of additional albumin or any other colloid was excluded in both groups. All resuscitation fluids were administered as continuous infusions via peristaltic pumps. Infusion rate (mL/h) was continuously adjusted to the actual patient fluid needs. Except for volume resuscitation, there was no difference in patient care, including cardiovascular monitoring, pharmacologic and respiratory support, nutrition, and surgical treatment of burn wounds.

Outcome measures

Primary outcome was the group difference of administered resuscitation fluid within the first 72 hours after admission. Secondary endpoints were creatinine level at day 1 and the difference over day 1 to 3, urine output at day 1 and the difference over day 1 to 3, incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during hospitalization, length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), length of stay in the hospital, in-hospital mortality, and 28-day mortality. Collected baseline characteristics were age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, body weight, body height, percentage of burn, and the amount of pre-hospital administered fluids.

A post hoc analysis was performed for 90-day mortality and incidence of renal replacement therapy during hospital stay.

### Rational use of human albumin: plan-do-check-act cycle in clinical practice [^112nT4fc]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2025). High credibility.

Plan

Currently, many companies produce HA, and there exist differences in the indications described in the instructions from different manufacturers, which in part leads to the irrational use of HA.

The current problems in the clinical application of HA mainly lie in: (1) No harmonised indications for the use of HA; (2) Excessively long duration of the medication course; and (3) Extensive use for nutritional support. Probing into the reasons, except for the different instructions of HA from various manufacturers, usually many clinicians empirically believe that infusing HA to reach the goal value of serum albumin will improve the nutritional conditions of patients, and postoperative albumin supplementation can facilitate wound healing regardless of the serum albumin levels of patients. In response to this phenomenon, a panel of experts discussed and determined the solutions, mainly including (1) Establishing rules for front-loaded review of prescriptions through information technology means; (2) Creating an electronic application form for HA; and (3) Regular and special reviews of HA prescriptions. Also, periodic training for departments that may have a high demand for HA has been conducted to raise the awareness of medical staff about HA.

The application form specifies that the prescriptions for HA should be a temporary prescription with a dosage of up to 3 days; meanwhile, to ensure reasonableness, there should be a test value for the serum albumin of the patient prior to the application, and it can be used only if it is less than 25 g/L, there is a corresponding indication (such as severe burns) or less than 30 g/L with liver cirrhosis or cancer combined with pleural or abdominal fluid. The detailed application form is provided in online supplemental table 1, which was developed with the help of American guidelines and recommendations of the Italian Society of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohaematology.

Do

Clinical pharmacists trained relevant medical staff and actively communicated with them during the advancement process. Meanwhile, the healthcare information system was actively improved with a window pop-up indicating the availability of HA when a physician prescribed HA, and incorporated HA into approval management. Physicians were required to fill out an application form before starting a prescription for HA, and after the clinical pharmacist had reviewed and approved the application online, the prescription could be issued. Moreover, clinical pharmacists regularly provided comments and feedback on the prescriptions of HA.

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^113JSa7v]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Although fluid resuscitation is the foundation of acute burn care, the optimal type, timing, and amount of fluid for burn shock remains inadequately investigated. Early burn resuscitation formulas of the 1940s and 1950s incorporated colloids, usually in the form of albumin-containing blood products, but also purified albumin. Unacceptably high rates of viral hepatitis transmission discouraged the continued use of plasma preparations available during that period, however. By contrast, no case of viral disease transmission has ever been identified for licensed albumin or albumin contained in other licensed products, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. In addition to concern about viral disease transmission, the subsequent introduction of crystalloid-only formulas was prompted by an increasing focus on the role of extravascular sodium deficiency in burn shock.

The commonly used Parkland and modified Brooke formulas using crystalloid in the form of lactated Ringer's solution have remained unchanged since their introduction in the 1970s. In the first 24 hours after a burn, the Parkland formula calls for 4 ml·kg −1 crystalloid per percent TBSA (%TBSA) burned and the modified Brooke formula for 2 ml·kg −1 per %TBSA.

An increasingly recognized concern is that many patients are found to receive considerably more resuscitation fluid than predicted by the formulas. This phenomenon was termed "fluid creep" by Pruitt in 2000, and excessive resuscitation has emerged as a significant problem in modern burn care. Numerous reports document that the majority of patients with major burns are exceeding the predicted amount of acute care resuscitation fluid. – In a 2007 U.S. multicenter study of patients with major burns, fluid in excess of the predicted volume was accompanied by increased odds of pneumonia, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.92, bloodstream infections (OR, 2.33), adult respiratory distress syndrome (OR, 1.55), multiorgan failure (OR, 1.49), and death (OR, 1.74).

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112rFaKH]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

Intravenous albumin is a human-derived blood product manufactured from donated human plasma. It is used broadly in hospitalized patients, as well as in outpatients with complications of cirrhosis. Intravenous albumin has been studied in numerous, large, well-designed, randomized controlled clinical trials in multiple patient populations; the data show few applications of albumin that improve patient outcomes. Albumin is more expensive to manufacture and to provide to patients, when compared with crystalloids. The International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines undertook this guideline development process to provide clinicians with actionable recommendations for appropriate use of intravenous albumin.

1. In critically ill adult patients (excluding patients with thermal injuries and ARDS), intravenous albumin is not suggested for first-line volume replacement or to increase serum albumin levels (Conditional Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

2. In critically ill adult patients with thermal injuries or ARDS, intravenous albumin is not suggested for volume replacement or to increase serum albumin level (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

3. In critically ill adult patients, intravenous albumin in conjunction with diuretics is not suggested for removal of extravascular fluid (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

4. In pediatric patients with infection and hypoperfusion, intravenous albumin is not recommended to reduce mortality (Strong Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

5. In preterm neonates (≤ 36 weeks) with low serum albumin levels and respiratory distress, intravenous albumin is not suggested to improve respiratory function (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

6. In preterm neonates (≤ 32 weeks or ≤ 1,500 g) with or without hypoperfusion, intravenous albumin is not suggested for volume replacement (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^115AqDD5]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Burns

Appropriate and effective initial resuscitation of victims of burns is vital for survival and reduction of morbidity and mortality. The deeper and more extensive the burn, the greater the fluid requirements, but excessive fluid administration will also increase morbidity by generation of edema. The formulas used for calculating volume requirements (e.g. Brooke & Parkland) use only body surface area (BSA) and do not compensate for depth. In clinical practice, the fluid requirement is approximately 5 ml/kg/ %BSA during the first 24 h.

The rate of fluid administration will initially be rapid with up to half the daily requirement given in the first 6 h. The use of colloid solutions is controversial. Hyperoncotic colloids worsen outcome, but the role of albumin or synthetic colloids (e.g. HES) is less clear. Colloid solutions shorten the time to achieve hemodynamic goals, but increase expense without a concomitant improvement in outcome.

Enteral resuscitation is effective if commenced within 6 h. Placement of a feeding tube should be part of the resuscitation protocol for burns. Delay of feeding for more than 6 h will result in an increasing feeding failure due to gastroparesis and ileus. Maintenance of enteral feeding maintains the gut associated lymphoid tissue that participates in maintenance of immunity at all epithelial surfaces including the skin. A standard formula may be used starting at 2 ml/kg/h and increasing incrementally every 3 h until the goal rate calculated for each patient is reached.

Two simple investigations should be used to monitor the effectiveness of resuscitation from burns. The first is the hematocrit, which may be as high as 70% on admission after extensive burns. Failure to reduce the hematocrit below 40% within the first 6 h is an accurate indicator of poor prognosis. The second is urine output, which should be maintained at around 1 ml/kg/h. Development of acute renal failure carries a very poor prognosis with extensive burns. A more detailed review of fluids in burn resuscitation is beyond the scope of this paper; however, further references are provided.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115BWA7Q]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Guidelines Focus

These recommendations apply to patients receiving albumin in critical care settings with hypovolemia, sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, thermal injuries, and ARDS; cirrhosis; intradialytic hypotension; and cardiovascular surgery. These settings were included based on common uses of albumin, the systematic review of the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and with input from the panel. We included studies that compared the use of albumin with that of other resuscitation fluids, other pharmaceutical treatments, or standard of care.

Target Population

These guidelines provide actionable recommendations for the most common indications for the use of albumin. The use of albumin for therapeutic apheresis was excluded because recent guidelines were published.

Guidelines Development Process

Panel Composition

This guideline development process was funded by the Ontario Regional Blood Coordinating Network (Ontario, Canada) and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG; funded by Canadian Blood Services). Neither entity had any input on recommendations or guidelines content. An international panel of neonatal, pediatric, and adult specialists with expertise in the use of albumin developed the recommendations. This panel included 20 members with expertise in intensive care, hepatology, gastroenterology, nephrology, hematology, pathology, neonatology, transfusion medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, internal medicine, and methodology and a patient representative. A framework and related clinical questions were developed according to the United States Preventative Services Task Force Criteria. Disclosures were ascertained yearly from all members.

### A comparison of albumin and saline for fluid resuscitation in the intensive care unit [^1173HnP3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

The study SAFE was published by Simon Finfer and colleagues in 2004 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness and Maintenance fluid therapy. In the SAFE study, the trial question was: what is the effect of fluid resuscitation with saline in a heterogeneous population of patients in the ICU? In the SAFE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SAFE study, the population was: 6997 patients (2800 female, 4197 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had been admitted to the ICU. The key exclusion criteria were ICU admittance after cardiac surgery, after liver transplantation, or for the treatment of burns. In the SAFE study, the interventions were: n = 3497 albumin (4% for a period of 28 days) n = 3500 saline (0.9% for a period of 28 days). In the SAFE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of death from any cause during the 28-day period (20.9% vs. 21.1%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.91 to 1.09). In the SAFE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in length of stay in the ICU (6.5 days vs. 6.2 days; AD 0.24 days, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.54) No significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation (4.5 days vs. 4.3 days; AD 0.19 days, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.47) Borderline significant increase in duration of RRT (0.48 days vs. 0.39 days; AD 0.09 days, 95% CI 0 to 0.19). In the SAFE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in new single-organ or multiple-organ failure. In the SAFE study, the conclusion was: in patients who had been admitted to the ICU, albumin was not superior to saline with respect to the rate of death from any cause during the 28-day period.

### Re-evaluating currently available data and suggestions for planning randomised controlled studies regarding the use of hydroxyethyl starch in critically ill patients-a multidisciplinary statement [^116QdyF8]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Material and methods

In a first step, we screened the four recent meta-analyses published in 2013 including RCTs with critically ill patients following sepsis, trauma, burns or any other disease hospitalised in an ICU. The intervention group received any type of HES. Control patients received 0.9% saline, Ringer's acetate, or Ringer's lactate. We excluded trials that exclusively compared HES with either other synthetic colloid or albumin that may potentially induce equally harmful effect and thereby mask any effects of HES. We prospectively decided to include only studies published in English.

In a second step, we analysed studies on the adherence to 'presumably correct indication' using both the four meta-analyses and original published manuscripts. Then, we defined the following six criteria and generated a six-point score:

1. Did the authors randomise patients within a maximum of 6 h after the first sign of shock? This arbitrary time period was chosen based on Rivers et al. and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines.

2. Did the authors restrict HES for initial volume resuscitation? (We acknowledge that this issue is in conflict with its licensing and marketing authorisation.)

3. Did the authors use any consistent algorithm for haemodynamic stabilisation?

4. Do baseline data enable identification of reproducible indicators of hypovolaemia, haemodynamic instability or increased lactate?

5. Did the authors adhere to the summary of product characteristics, particularly to maximal dose of HES per day (for example, 6% HES 130/0.4 < 50 mL/kg; 6% HES 200/0.5 < 33 mL/kg; 10% HES 200/0.5 < 20 mL/kg)? (Details of product characteristics have recently been summarised).

6. Did the authors adhere to safety issues of product characteristics, particularly to the contraindication for patients with pre-existing renal failure or renal replacement therapy (RRT)?

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114JUe2C]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence Summary

Sixteen, of 19 systematic reviews were retrieved and included. These reports included a broad critical care patient population, including patients with critical illness, sepsis, thermal injuries, and ARDS. Three of the 19 systematic reviews were excluded because they assessed the impact of albumin only on fluid balance, gelatin vs colloids, or all colloids compared with crystalloids (without reporting albumin vs other fluids).

A systematic review from 2019identified 55 RCTs comparing crystalloid with colloids in critical care. Data on mortality were available for 26,329 patients from 46 studies. No mortality benefit was found when crystalloid was compared with albumin (relative risk [RR] 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96–1.10). Crystalloids were less effective than colloids in hemodynamic resuscitation end points (eg, mean arterial pressure) but this did not translate into improvements in patient outcomes. After this systematic review, one RCT was identified that examined 360 patients with sepsis with an underlying diagnosis of cancer (albumin was compared with Ringer's lactate); no differences in mortality or other outcomes were found. A systematic review from 2018 conducted by the Cochrane collaborationfound no difference in mortality in patients in the ICU (20 studies; N = 13,047) when patients managed with crystalloids were compared with those managed with albumin at the end of follow-up (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.06), at 30 days (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93–1.06), or at 90 days (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04) or who needed kidney replacement therapy (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96–1.27). The largest randomized trial is the Saline Versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation trial published in 2004, which enrolled 6,997 patients receiving critical care (including a mix of medical and surgical patients) and compared 4% albumin with 0.9% normal saline. No differences were found in outcomes, including 28-day mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91–1.09).

### Early hypoalbuminemia is associated with 28-day mortality in severely burned patients: a retrospective cohort study [^1161ZFmM]. Burns (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoalbuminemia is a frequent condition in the first 24h after a severe burn injury and is associated with worse outcomes.

Methodology

We investigated the relation between very early hypoalbuminemia (< 6h after admission) and clinical outcome in a retrospective cohort admitted to our unit for severe burn injuries between 2012 and 2017.

Results

73 severely burned patients were included, with a delay of admission of 3 (2–4)h. In a context of early exogenous supply of albumin, admission and 4H Albuminemia (Alb4h) were significantly lower in deceased patients (respectively, 34 (29–37) vs 27 (23–30) g/l; p = 0.009 and 27 (24–32) vs 21 (17–27) g/l; p = 0.022) whereas albuminemia ≥ 6h were not. The best threshold value of Alb4h to discriminate 28-day mortality was 23g/l. Patients with an Alb4h < 23g/l had a higher 28-day mortality than patients with an Alb4h ≥ 23g/l (42% vs 11%; p = 0.003); adjusted OR = 4.47 (95% CI 1.15–17.36); p = 0.03.

Conclusion

In severely burned patients receiving early albumin supply, early hypoalbuminemia is associated with higher mortality whereas later albuminemia (≥ 6h) is not. Exploration of whether early albumin infusion (8-12h post injury) may alter clinical outcome is warranted.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^1172CSMh]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines from the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany published perioperative fluid guidelines for children in 2017. They recommended that colloids, including albumin, be used during surgery where crystalloids alone are not sufficiently effective and blood products are not indicated. In 2021, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommended the use of albumin in the fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock when patients required large volumes of crystalloids.

Five RCTs that will enroll an additional 4,864 patients are ongoing and are expected to provide additional clarity on the role of albumin (Table 2). These trials will add clarity to the ICTMG recommendations for intensive care patients with infection, high-risk adult cardiac surgery, patients with acute kidney injury receiving kidney replacement therapy, and outpatients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Table 2
Ongoing, Large Randomized Clinical Trials Comparing IV Albumin With Alternative Treatments

This guideline is limited by the uncertainty in the evidence identified in the literature search for many different patient populations and the limitation of the search to the English language. The lack of comparative dosing strategies leaves uncertainty on the choice between 4% to 5% and 20% to 25% albumin formulations, the dose for each indication, the risk of fluid overload, and the dosing schedules. The guidelines are limited to common uses of albumin and cannot address every possible patient scenario where albumin has been used in RCTs. The published studies often did not collect or did report adverse reactions from IV albumin, or both, limiting the conclusions regarding the potential risks of albumin. These guidelines improve on those previously published because of the rigorous methodology, broad scope of the recommendations, inclusion of a patient representative in the guideline process, and broad community consultation process. The guidelines will be supported by tools developed by the ICTMG Dissemination and Implementation Committee to assist hospitals with aligning practice with the evidence.

Future research is needed in multiple clinical settings including: (1) the role and timing of albumin in patients with sepsis or other conditions with insufficient response to crystalloids, (2) the role of albumin in patients undergoing surgery, (3) the role of albumin for intradialytic hypotension, and (4) the role of albumin in all indications for patients with cirrhosis. Research also is needed to understand therapeutic targets of albumin resuscitation (hemodynamic, urinary output, laboratory), the optimal formulation, and the dosing strategy. The risk of IV albumin infusions needs further investigation to allow clinicians to weigh the risk to benefit profile appropriately. Studies should include patient-important outcomes, rather than focusing on short-term physiologic outcomes.

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^116vJKrD]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

More than 80% of all patients were derived from the included nonrandomized studies, and so the meta-analysis borrowed major strength from those studies. Thus, there was a clear advantage to including nonrandomized studies. This advantage was not gained at the cost of heterogeneity, inasmuch as there was in no case any significant effect size difference between the randomized and nonrandomized studies (Figures 2–5). This finding is consistent with numerous large-scale empirical studies demonstrating agreement between randomized and nonrandomized studies. –

Mortality from burn injuries is now at historically low levels, and thus more attention is being focused on associated morbidity. The recent renewed interest in the use of albumin has been driven by the desire to reduce morbidity related to the large quantities of resuscitation fluid administered to burn patients in the first 24 hours. Aggressive fluid therapy can escalate the massive edema in both burned and nonburned tissue occurring after burn injury. Edema leads to tissue hypoxia and increased tissue pressure. Increased interstitial pressure in burned soft tissue compartments often necessitates escharotomy or even fasciotomy. ACS is an extreme example of massive edema, which can be life-threatening. Compartment syndrome can also occur in unburned limbs, requiring fasciotomies. In all five studies with data on either abdominal or extremity compartment syndrome, albumin use was consistently associated with a marked decrease in this complication. The overall pooled results showed an 81% relative odds decrease for compartment syndrome in the albumin group patients. This observation is in accord with a randomized trial of 31 severely burned patients comparing FFP and lactated Ringer's as the resuscitation fluids. There was a significantly greater increase in intraabdominal pressure among patients assigned to the crystalloid protocol, and all but one patient of 15 in that group exceeded the 25-mm Hg pressure threshold associated with complications. By contrast, 14 of the 16 patients in the FFP group did not exceed the threshold.

### Plasma volume expansion and capillary leakage of 20% albumin in burned patients and volunteers [^116w7fU7]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Albumin is the colloid fluid of choice when treating oedematous hypovolemic patients. A comparison between iso-oncotic 4–5% and the hyperoncotic 20% albumin in intensive care patients showed a fluid-sparing effect of the latter preparation, which is desirable because oedema impairs wound healing and increases the diffusion distance for oxygen.

Burn patients develop severe oedema due to negative interstitial fluid pressure, inflammation-induced tissue swelling and intensive crystalloid fluid therapy. The use of albumin is controversial. A widespread belief is that infused albumin is easily translocated to the interstitial space because the injury elicits an inflammation-mediated toxic effect on the endothelium. However, the intravascular persistence of 20% albumin and the associated capillary leakage has rarely been assessed in a clinical setting.

The aim of this study was to compare the plasma volume expansion in burn patients with that of volunteers following administration of a standardised amount of 20% albumin (primary outcome measure). A further purpose was to assess the changes in colloid osmotic pressure (secondary outcome measure) and to use these data to estimate the capillary leakage of albumin and fluid.

The hypothesis was that burn patients have a less pronounced plasma volume expansion and a lower colloid osmotic pressure, but a greater capillary leakage of albumin and fluid. For ethical reasons, patients were not studied during the most active resuscitation stage, but instead between 4 and 14 days (mean, 7 days) after the burn injury. The assessments were made using mass balance calculations based on measurements of blood Hb, plasma albumin and urine.

### Effect of fluid resuscitation with albumin on mortality in patients with severe burns: a nationwide inpatient data analysis [^111eKYmA]. Burns (2024). Medium credibility.

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of albumin administration on mortality in patients with severe burns. We retrospectively analyzed data from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination Database, a nationwide inpatient database in Japan. We identified patients in the database aged ≥ 15 years who were admitted with severe burns (burn index ≥ 15) from April 2014 to March 2021. We included patients who received albumin within 2 days of admission in the albumin group and those who did not in the control group. The outcome was the 28-day mortality. Eligible patients (n = 2492) were categorized into an albumin group (n = 1128) or a control group (n = 1364). One-to-one propensity score matching generated 530 pairs of patients with and without albumin administration. The 28-day mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (albumin vs. control, 21.7% vs. 22.8%; risk difference, -1.1%; 95% confidence interval, -6.1% to +3.9%). These results suggest that albumin administration within 2 days of admission in patients with severe burns may not be associated with mortality during the acute phase.

### Plasma disappearance rate of albumin when infused as a 20% solution [^113vNcm5]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The transcapillary leakage of albumin is increased by inflammation and major surgery, but whether exogenous albumin also disappears faster is unclear.

Methods

An intravenous infusion of 3 mL/kg of 20% albumin was given over 30 min to 70 subjects consisting of 15 healthy volunteers, 15 post-burn patients, 15 patients who underwent surgery with minor bleeding, 10 who underwent surgery with major bleeding (mean, 1.1 L) and 15 postoperative patients. Blood Hb and plasma albumin were measured on 15 occasions over 5 h. The rate of albumin disappearance from the plasma was quantitated with population kinetic methodology and reported as the half-life (T 1/2).

Results

No differences were observed for T 1/2 between volunteers, post-burn patients, patients who underwent surgery with minor bleeding and postoperative patients. The T 1/2 averaged 16.2 h, which corresponds to 3.8% of the amount infused per h. Two groups showed plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein of approximately 60 mg/L and still had a similarly long T 1/2 for albumin. By contrast, patients undergoing surgery associated with major hemorrhage had a shorter T 1/2, corresponding to 15% of the infused albumin per h. In addition, our analyses show that the T 1/2 differ greatly depending on whether the calculations consider plasma volume changes and blood losses.

Conclusion

The disappearance rate of the albumin in 20% preparations was low in volunteers, in patients with moderately severe inflammation, and in postoperative patients.

### Burn patient characteristics and outcomes following resuscitation with albumin [^111pK6Ke]. Burns (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Use of colloids in acute burn resuscitation may reduce fluid requirements, but effect on mortality is unknown. We hypothesized that patients who received albumin would have similar mortality to patients who did not receive albumin.

Methods

We performed a case-controlled study of inpatients who sustained burns of ≥ 20% total body surface area (TBSA). Patients who received albumin during resuscitation because of increased fluid requirements (ALB) were compared to a cohort of patients matched for age and TBSA who did not receive albumin (CON).

Results

Patients with inhalation injury were significantly more likely to receive albumin (OR 4.89, 95% CI 2.58–9.30). ALB patients had significantly higher mean initial lactate (3.64 versus 2.29, p = 0.01), longer mean time to resuscitation (52.8 h versus 36.3 h; p = 0.001), and higher resuscitation volume (9.4 mL/kg/%TBSA versus 6.4 mL/kg/%TBSA for CON). Mortality was not significantly different between the two groups (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.85–4.22). Albumin was protective in a multivariate model of mortality (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07–0.97).

Conclusions

Despite more severe systemic dysfunction, burn patients who received albumin did not suffer increased mortality. A novel finding is the decreased likelihood of mortality associated with the administration of albumin during burn resuscitation.

### Albumin replacement in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^114AAt2D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study ALBIOS was published by Pietro Caironi and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the ALBIOS study, the trial question was: what is the role of albumin replacement in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock? In the ALBIOS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ALBIOS study, the population was: 1810 patients (717 female, 1093 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe sepsis. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, terminal state, known adverse reaction to albumin administration, severe sepsis or septic shock in patients after proved or suspected head injury, congestive HF (NYHA class of 3 or 4), hepatic cirrhosis with ascites, intestinal malabsorption syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, burns. In the ALBIOS study, the interventions were: n = 903 albumin (20% albumin and crystalloid solution for fluid replacement) n = 907 crystalloids (crystalloid solution alone for fluid replacement). In the ALBIOS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 28 days (31.8% vs. 32%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.14). In the ALBIOS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause at 90 days (41.1% vs. 43.6%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05). In the ALBIOS study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe sepsis, albumin was not superior to crystalloids with respect to death at 28 days.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^111FM2SR]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

American Burn Association — burn shock resuscitation with computerized decision support software (CDSS) in adults with burns ≥ 20% TBSA: We make a weak recommendation for clinicians to consider the use of CDSS to reduce total resuscitation fluid volumes, but we are unable to make any recommendation on use of CDSS to reduce edema-related complications. In a single-center comparison to traditional/manual hourly urine output titration, CDSS resulted in a 24-hour total resuscitation volume of 4.2 mL/kg/%TBSA burn versus 6.5 mL/kg/%TBSA burn and more time within target urine output after the first 48 hours (31% vs. 23% of the time), with the CDSS cohort compared to 38 historical control patients. In multicenter observational data, across all 285 patients, clinicians engaged with the computer's recommended infusion rate, within ± 20 mL/hour, 72% of the time, ranging between 54% and 96% between centers, and mean 24‑hour volumes across centers ranged from 3.1 mL/kg/%TBSA burn to 4.5 mL/kg/%TBSA burn with total administered 24‑hour volumes from 3.5 to 5.3 mL/kg/%TBSA burn, lower than the average resuscitation volume of 5.2 mL/kg/%TBSA burn identified in a review involving 3196 patients from 48 studies. Among adherent users, a total of 146 of the 285 patients followed recommendations (defined as administering a fluid rate within ± 20 mL/h of the recommended rate) 83% of the time in the first 24 hours (ie, in 20 of the first 24 hourly decisions), and the 24‑hour crystalloid volume was 4 ± 1.6 mL/kg/%TBSA burn versus 4 ± 1.9 mL/kg/%TBSA burn in nonfollowers; secondary outcomes included lower mortality with CDSS users (29% vs. 44%, P < .05). The panel expressed concern about potential loss of frequent bedside clinical patient assessment and critical decision making with CDSS and noted that "The benefit of CDSS probably, but not certainly, outweighs this undesirable effect".

### Albumin in burn shock resuscitation: a meta-analysis of controlled clinical studies [^1112ok6Z]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Randomized Study Quality

The quality of the randomized studies was generally poor. These were small, mostly old studies with a high risk of bias. The total numbers of patient in these four studies ranged from 18 to 50 (Table 1). Three of the four were published more than 30 years ago. Only one was conducted at more than one center.

Small size rendered these studies more vulnerable to chance imbalances in baseline risk of poor outcome, despite randomization. In the one multicenter study, mean %TBSA burned and proportion of patients with inhalation injury were both higher in the albumin group (Table 2). While neither difference, taken singly, reached statistical significance, predicted mortality at baseline accounting for both %TBSA burned and inhalation injurywas significantly higher in the albumin group (P = 0.011). No statistical adjustment was applied for this imbalance. In another study, mean %TBSA burned was 16.3% higher in the albumin than control group (Table 2); however, that difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.14).

Table 2.
Patient characteristics

In one each of the four included randomized studies, patients were assigned to treatment group by computer-generated randomization list, random number table, hospital number, and an unspecified method. Allocation concealment was accomplished through the use of sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes in the multicenter study. Measures taken to ensure allocation concealment were unspecified for the remaining studies. The multicenter study was unblinded. The use of blinding, if any, was unspecified for the other studies.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guideline on care of burns in the wilderness [^116L8Ms7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Burn fluid resuscitation — prehospital titration, routes, and thresholds: Fluid resuscitation should be titrated to maintain a urine output of 0.5 to 1.0 mL·kg−1·h−1 in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL·kg−1·h−1 in children. For prehospital providers without pumps, drip rates of 20 drops/min for infants (60 mL·h−1), 40 drops/min for pediatric patients (~125 mL·h−1), and 80 drops/min for adults are reasonable. Oral fluid resuscitation has been used for burns up to 40% TBSA in low-resource settings. Under extreme circumstances, when fluids may not be administered via other routes, fluids may be instilled into the subcutaneous tissues or delivered by rectal infusion, known as proctoclysis, and if it is not possible to formally measure urine output and evacuation is delayed, rescuers should titrate fluids so that the victim produces copious pale-yellow urine. We recommend oral rehydration for resuscitation of burn injuries of < 20% TBSA. Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We recommend that intravenous fluid resuscitation be started, if available, for burns of > 20% TBSA. Grade: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. We suggest that starting with a rate of 2 mL·kg−1·% TBSA is reasonable given the constraints of field care. Grade: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We suggest that oral rehydration may be sufficient for burns of up to 40% TBSA. Grade: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We suggest that fluid resuscitation may proceed by alternate routes in extreme circumstances, including nasogastric tube, subcutaneous infiltration, and proctoclysis. Grade: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We recommend that the patient's volume status should be monitored with titration of fluids as needed. Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^112Tg5CF]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for burn injury, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, infusion rate and monitoring, ABA 2024 guidelines recommend to do not use transpulmonary thermodilution-derived variables (intrathoracic blood volume index, global end-diastolic volume index, cardiac index, and extra-vascular lung water index) to reduce total resuscitation fluid volumes or decrease edema-related complications. Insufficient evidence to recommend using stroke volume variation or pulse pressure variation on either of these outcomes.

### Early fluid resuscitation with hyperoncotic hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 (10%) in severe burn injury [^113JDVqG]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

There is strong evidence that starting fluid resuscitation early improves clinical outcome in patient with severe burn injury, but there is no consensus about which kind of fluids would be the optimal treatment. In order to increase plasma osmolarity and thus reduce fluid losses into the extravascular space, some authors propose to add hypertonic solutions (e.g. hypertonic saline) in fluid resuscitation in these patients. Fluid resuscitation in particular with excessive amounts of crystalloids in severe burn victims may lead to edema formation and thus contribute to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). ACS has a high impact on mortality in such patients and in one study 22 out of 25 patients died. One of the treatment options for patients with ACS might be surgical abdominal decompression. The main controversy about fluid resuscitation in severe burns is about the use or the avoidance of colloids, which solution to use and, last but not least, when to begin with the administration of colloids. Among the available colloids, albumin and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are mainly used. The Cochrane Injuries Group presented a relative risk of death after albumin administration of 2.4 in a metaanalysis. Nevertheless, the infusion of albumin is very common in fluid management of severe burns.

The aim to reduce pulmonary complications (i.e. ARDS) and ACS by volume overload raised the issue of the application of colloids such as hyperoncotic HES. Colloids given after 24 hours in addition to crystalloids the extravascular lung water index did not increase. The major concern about hyperoncotic HES 200/0.5 (10%) administration consists of its negative effects on renal function leading to renal failure and renal replacement therapy (RRT). Hyperoncotic HES used as a plasma-volume expander in brain-dead kidney donors has been shown to induce osmotic-nephrosis-like lesions and immediately impaired renal function in kidney-transplant recipients.

There is no evidence of whether the application of hyperoncotic HES 200/0.5 (10%) within the first 24 hours would improve or deteriorate the outcome in patients with severe burn injuries. Expert opinions of burn specialists consist of strictly avoiding colloids such as HES during the first 24 hours. This restriction is based on reports from the early 1970 s expressing the fear of overloading the interstitial compartment with colloids due to increased capillary leakage in the early stage of trauma, which later might have negative effects on wound healing after surgical treatment.

### Albumin in critical care: SAFE, but worth its salt? [^1165JqZG]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Intravascular fluid therapy is a common critical care intervention. However, the optimal type of resuscitation fluid, crystalloid or colloid, remains controversial. Despite the many theoretical benefits of human albumin administration in critically ill patients, there has been little evidence to support its widespread clinical use. Previous systematic reviews have led to conflicting results regarding the safety and efficacy of albumin. The recently reported Saline versus Albumin Evaluation study has provided conclusive evidence that 4% albumin is as safe as saline for resuscitation, although no overall benefit of albumin use was seen. Subgroup analysis of the albumin-treated group revealed a trend towards decreased mortality in patients with septic shock, and a trend towards increased mortality in trauma patients, especially those with traumatic brain injury. The results of these subgroups, as well as the use of higher albumin concentrations and other synthetic colloids (dextrans, starches), require rigorous evaluation in clinical trials. Finally, the Saline versus Albumin Evaluation trial represents a methodological milestone in critical care medicine, due to its size, its efficient trial design, and its logistical coordination. Future studies are still required, however, to establish a therapeutic niche for albumin and other colloids.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^114UdA5s]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

For resuscitation in patients with traumatic brain injury

In the SAFE trial, patients with traumatic brain injury treated with albumin had worse outcomes than saline-treated patients. Using pattern mixture modeling, the probable mechanism for the increased mortality appeared to be albumin-induced increases in intracranial pressure. The hypotonic and hypooncotic nature of the albumin solution used may also have played a role.

For albumin replacement in patients with hypoalbuminemia

The effects of increasing albumin concentrations by giving exogenous albumin have also been investigated in the critically ill. A meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. However, in a subgroup analysis of the SAFE study in patients with hypoalbuminemia, using a cutoff value of 25 g/l, there were no significant differences in outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients and normoalbuminemic patients who received albumin. In a pilot RCT of 100 hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients who were randomized either to receive 300 mL of 20% albumin solution on the first day and then 200 ml/day if the serum albumin concentration remained < 30 g/dl or to receive no albumin, Dubois and colleagues reported that organ function (as assessed by change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) improved more in the albumin-treated patients (P = 0.03); these patients also had a less positive fluid balance (P = 0.04). There was also a beneficial effect on cumulative calorie intake during the first week, suggesting that albumin may have helped decrease intestinal edema.

### Plasma volume expansion and capillary leakage of 20% albumin in burned patients and volunteers [^111hQx2d]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The experiments described here were carried out in a strictly standardised fashion, but the body weights and the plasma concentrations of certain key variables differed between the groups at baseline. Heavier subjects would have received more 20% albumin, so the plasma dilution and the plasma volume expansion differed in numerical (Table 2), although not in relative, terms (Fig. 2 a, b). Therefore, the result of our evaluation of the primary outcome measure is that the plasma volume expands in proportion to the infused volume of 20%, with no relevant differences between burn patients and healthy volunteers.

The secondary outcome measures were derived from plasma albumin, COP, and body weight, which all differed at baseline. The albumin infusions gave greater rises in plasma albumin in the burn patients, which can be understood from their hypoalbuminaemic state (Fig. 2 d). The albumin leakage was similar in both groups in absolute, but not in relative, terms, suggesting that capillary leakage of albumin was relatively independent of the albumin concentration in the plasma (Fig. 2 e and f). The burn patients also had a markedly lower COP at baseline; however, absolute changes between the groups in response to the infusions were apparently cancelled out due to the logarithmic correlation between the plasma albumin and COP.

A further limitation is that ethical considerations precluded the inclusion of patients with the very largest burn injuries. The burned area of our patients varied between 7% and 48% of the TBSA, which is still representative of the clinical scenario for burns at an intensive care unit. In addition, the most acute stage (days 1 to 3) was not covered in the present study, which was due to ethical and practical problems associated with the extensive study protocol. The fluid that evaporated from the burned area was also not included in the calculations.

A minor but statistically significant increase was noted in the plasma IL-6 concentration in the burn victims during the study. This increase might be due to inflammation caused by the blood sampling procedure, where some withdrawn blood was re-administered to keep the sampled blood volume as low as possible (mean total 150 mL).

### Recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents: WHO emergency medical teams technical working group on burns (WHO TWGB) 2017–2020 [^112yCcgY]. Burns (2021). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid

There are a number of recognised guidelines and formulae for fluid management in burns care, primarily focused on care of the individual burns patient. Little evidence however exists detailing the impact of minimal fluid administration in the early phase of response to a burn casualty and whether this would cause harm or be of benefit especially in the event of a MCI. A 2017 review identified that due to the challenges of austere environments fluid resuscitation can be delayed or restricted in burns up to 40% TBSA provided the patient is quickly transported to a treatment facility. The complications of aggressive fluid resuscitation however are well documented. In addition to clinical complications, logistical considerations should also be taken into account.

The recommendation detailed above suggests, when indicated, intravenous crystalloids (lactated Ringer, supplemented with dextrose in children) should be given at a volume and rate of 100mls/kg/24 h (TBSA > 40%). Burned surface area (%TBSA) however forms no part of the calculation unlike in other burn fluid formulae. This supports a more simplified yet fully individualised approach whereby fluid volume administered should be routinely adjusted in accordance with patient's clinical response and not adhered to in a strict formulaic manner.

If a patient needs a high volume of fluid due to deteriorating clinical course, early advanced airway intervention should be considered in conjunction with the increased resource need for on-going patient care.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^115iDDz6]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

American Burn Association burn shock resuscitation — purpose and definition of acute fluid resuscitation: The recommendations within this guideline are intended only to guide clinicians faced with any of the clinical questions we have addressed. These recommendations do not rigidly define the standard of care or best practice, they are not prescriptive, and they do not replace bedside clinical judgement and decision making by a clinician resuscitating a patient with an acute burn injury. For this CPG, the term "acute fluid resuscitation" refers to provision of intravenous fluid during the first 48 hours following an acute burn injury in an adult involving at least 20% of the total body surface area (%TBSA). We recognize that the definition of completion of acute fluid resuscitation is nebulous and that resuscitation may continue between 48 and 72 hours post burn in some cases.

### Fluid management in burn patients: results from a European survey-more questions than answers [^116ntX54]. Burns (2008). Low credibility.

Many strategies were proposed for fluid management in burn patients with different composition containing saline solution, colloids, or plasma. The actual clinical use of volume replacement regimen in burn patients in Europe was analysed by an international survey. A total of 187 questionnaires consisting of 20 multiple-choice questions were sent to 187 burn units listed by the European Burn Association. The response rate was 43%. The answers came from a total of 20 European countries. Volume replacement is mostly exclusively with crystalloids (always: 58%; often: 28%). The majority still use fixed formulae: 12% always use the traditional Baxter formula, in 50% modifications of this formula are used. The most often used colloid is albumin (always: 17%, often: 38%), followed by HES (always: 4%, often: 34%). Gelatins, dextrans, and hypertonic saline are used only very rarely. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is given in 12% of the units as the colloid of choice. Albumin was named most often to be able to improve patients' outcome (64%), followed by HES (53%), and the exclusive use of crystalloids (45%). Central venous pressure (CVP) is most often used to monitor volume therapy (35%), followed by the PiCCO-system (23%), and mixed-venous saturation (ScVO2; 10%). It is concluded that the kind of volume therapy differs widely among European burn units. This survey supported that no generally accepted volume replacement strategy in burn patients exists. New results, e.g. importance of goal-directed therapy or data concerning use of albumin in the critically ill, have not yet influenced strategies of volume replacement in the burn patient.

### Colloid administration normalizes resuscitation ratio and ameliorates "fluid creep" [^111uzd2s]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Although colloid was a component of the original Parkland formula, it has been omitted from standard Parkland resuscitation for over 30 years. However, some burn centers use colloid as "rescue" therapy for patients who exhibit progressively increasing crystalloid requirements, a phenomenon termed "fluid creep". We reviewed our experience with this procedure. With Institutional Review Board approval, we reviewed all adult patients with ≥ 20%TBSA burns admitted from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2007, who completed formal resuscitation. Patients were resuscitated using the Parkland formula, adjusted to maintain urine output of 30 to 50 ml/hr. Patients who required greater amounts of fluid than expected were given a combination of 5% albumin and lactated Ringer's until fluid requirements normalized. Results were expressed as an hourly ratio (I/O ratio) of fluid infusion (ml/kg/%TBSA/hr) to urine output (ml/kg/hr). Predicted values for this ratio vary for individual patients but are usually less than 0.5 to 1.0. Fifty-two patients were reviewed, of whom 26 completed resuscitation using crystalloid alone, and the remaining 26 required albumin supplementation (AR). The groups were comparable in age, gender, weight, mortality, and time between injury and admission. AR patients had larger total and full-thickness burns and more inhalation injuries. Patients managed with crystalloid alone maintained mean resuscitation ratios from 0.13 to 0.40, whereas AR patients demonstrated progressively increasing ratios to a maximum mean of 1.97, until albumin was started. Administration of albumin produced a dramatic and precipitous return of ratios to within predicted ranges throughout the remainder of resuscitation. No patient developed abdominal compartment syndrome. Measuring hourly I/O ratios is an effective means of expressing and tracking fluid requirements. The addition of colloid to Parkland resuscitation rapidly reduces hourly fluid requirements, restores normal resuscitation ratios, and ameliorates fluid creep. This practice can be applied selectively as needed using predetermined algorithms.

5. 2 g per 100 mL. Third space protein loss due to infection or burns: initial dose of 50 to 100 g. An infusion rate of 1–2 mL per minute is usually indicated in the absence of shock. In some patients, the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours. In critically ill patients, however, albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate.
