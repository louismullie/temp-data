## Question

A 46-year-old woman presents with acute onset fever and painful erythematous plaques on the face and upper extremities. Labs show neutrophilia, and skin biopsy demonstrates a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis. She is diagnosed with Sweet syndrome. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing this diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a diagnosis of Sweet syndrome in a 46-year-old woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and its synonyms. Then, I should verify the most specific ICD-10-CM code available for Sweet syndrome. Next, I will check whether any subtyping or etiologic modifiers are required or available. Finally, I will consider documentation requirements and any coding pitfalls to ensure accurate billing and claims processing.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its nomenclature. Sweet syndrome is also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, characterized by tender erythematous plaques or nodules, fever, neutrophilia, and a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis on biopsy, which matches the clinical scenario described here [^c5ca4149] [^c328db5b].

> Now, I need to find the most specific ICD-10-CM code. Wait, let me verify the exact code. The most specific code for Sweet syndrome in ICD-10-CM is L98.2, which corresponds to acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, i.e. Sweet syndrome. I should double-check that there are no more granular subcodes or etiologic extensions, and I do not see any further subdivisions under L98.2 in the materials provided, so L98.2 is the correct, most specific code to use here [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about subtyping. I initially wondered if I should add a secondary code to specify classic versus malignancy-associated or drug-induced Sweet syndrome, but I should confirm whether ICD-10-CM provides etiologic subcodes for L98.2. I need to check carefully, and I do not find malignancy-associated or drug-induced subcodes under L98.2 in the supplied references, so adding an etiologic modifier is not required by ICD-10-CM structure in this case, though documenting the subtype clinically is still important for care coordination [^notfound].

> Next, I should review documentation requirements to support coding accuracy. I need to ensure the record clearly states the diagnosis as Sweet syndrome or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and that the supporting features are documented, including fever, neutrophilia, and the histopathology showing dense neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis, because payer review may hinge on this level of detail to justify L98.2 rather than a nonspecific skin condition code [^c5ca4149] [^c328db5b].

> But wait, what if the encounter involves a suspected underlying trigger that also needs coding? I should confirm that if an associated condition is identified, such as a hematologic malignancy or a drug trigger, those should be coded separately in addition to L98.2, since ICD-10-CM does not bundle etiologies into the Sweet syndrome code itself. This ensures complete diagnostic capture and appropriate risk adjustment for billing purposes [^notfound].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for Sweet syndrome in this 46-year-old woman is L98.2, with the diagnosis name documented as Sweet syndrome or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, supported by fever, neutrophilia, and biopsy showing dense neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis. No more specific subcode exists in ICD-10-CM for this entity, and any associated conditions should be coded separately if identified [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for Sweet syndrome is **L98.2** (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis). This code applies to all clinical subtypes — classic, malignancy-associated, and drug-induced — and should be used regardless of the underlying cause. Accurate documentation of the diagnosis and any associated conditions (e.g. malignancy, drugs) is essential for coding and billing.

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic criteria

Sweet syndrome is characterized by the following **clinical and histopathological features**:

- **Clinical features**: Acute onset of tender, erythematous plaques or nodules, often on the upper extremities, face, or trunk, accompanied by fever and neutrophilia [^c328db5b].

- **Histopathology**: Dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis without vasculitis, which is a hallmark of the diagnosis [^c5ca4149].

- **Associations**: Sweet syndrome can be idiopathic or associated with malignancies (particularly hematologic), autoimmune diseases, infections, or drugs [^c328db5b].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for Sweet syndrome

The ICD-10-CM code for Sweet syndrome is **L98.2**, which corresponds to acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. This code encompasses all clinical subtypes of Sweet syndrome, including classic, malignancy-associated, and drug-induced forms.

---

## Coding considerations and documentation requirements

When coding for Sweet syndrome, the following **documentation elements are essential** to ensure accurate coding and billing:

- **Confirmed diagnosis**: The diagnosis of Sweet syndrome should be clearly documented by the treating physician, supported by clinical findings and histopathological evidence [^c5ca4149].

- **Associated conditions**: Any underlying conditions or triggers (e.g. malignancy, autoimmune disease, infections, or medications) should be documented, as they may require additional ICD-10-CM codes for comprehensive coding [^c328db5b].

- **Treatment details**: Documentation of treatment provided, such as systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapies, is important for clinical context and billing purposes [^c328db5b].

## Examples of ICD-10-CM coding scenarios

| **Clinical scenario** | **Primary icd-10-cm code** | **Additional codes (if applicable)** |
|-|-|-|
| Classic Sweet syndrome (idiopathic) | L98.2 | None |
| Sweet syndrome associated with malignancy (e.g. leukemia) | L98.2 | C95.90 (leukemia, unspecified) |
| Drug-induced Sweet syndrome (e.g. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) | L98.2 | T45.1X5A (adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs) |
| Sweet syndrome with systemic involvement (e.g. pulmonary involvement) | L98.2 | J84.89 (other specified interstitial pulmonary diseases) |

---

## Common coding errors and how to avoid them

Common coding errors for Sweet syndrome include:

- **Incorrect code selection**: Using unspecified dermatitis codes (e.g. L30.9) instead of the specific code L98.2 for Sweet syndrome.

- **Failure to document associated conditions**: Not documenting underlying malignancies, autoimmune diseases, or drug exposures, which can lead to incomplete coding and potential loss of reimbursement.

- **Lack of histopathological confirmation**: Not providing histopathological evidence to support the diagnosis, which can result in coding disputes or denials.

To avoid these errors, ensure **accurate documentation**, use the **specific ICD-10-CM code L98.2**, and include any **associated conditions** or triggers.

---

## Impact of accurate coding on patient care and reimbursement

Accurate coding for Sweet syndrome has **significant implications** for patient care and reimbursement:

- **Clinical decision-making**: Accurate coding ensures appropriate clinical management, including evaluation for underlying malignancies or autoimmune diseases [^c328db5b].

- **Reimbursement**: Proper coding facilitates appropriate reimbursement for diagnostic evaluations, treatments, and follow-up care.

- **Epidemiological tracking**: Accurate coding contributes to better understanding of disease prevalence, associations, and outcomes, informing public health initiatives and research [^439852f4].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for Sweet syndrome is **L98.2** (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis). Accurate documentation of the diagnosis, associated conditions, and treatment details is essential for proper coding, billing, and clinical management.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^4eb4edcb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

Methods

Patients and study design

Since 2012, electronic patient charts have been used at all ICUs at the Medical University of Vienna enabling a complete documentation of crucial patient characteristics including diagnosis, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests as well as therapy and medication. Patients were included retrospectively between 1 st January 2012 and 31 st December 2020 at 11 ICU wards (medical, anesthesiological and surgical). For our study, potentially eligible patients were identified by screening electronic patient charts for SRDs using the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). These patients were then assessed for study eligibility. Patients under the age of 18, patients with no SRD due to false coding, patients with an ICU length of stay < 1 day and patients after scheduled surgery or trauma were excluded.

Diagnosis of the underlying rheumatologic disease was established according to internationally accepted and validated criteria, such as the classification criteria by the EULAR and the American College of Rheumatology.

SRDs were categorised into the following groups:

Connective tissue disease (CTD) including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, systemic sclerosis, mixed CTD and overlap syndromes.
Vasculitides including granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, Goodpasture syndrome and large vessel vasculitides.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA) including axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
Others including adult-onset Still's disease, primary antiphospholipid syndrome, deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2, Sweet's syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever, sarcoidosis and Behçet's disease.

This study followed the recommendations of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology initiative for reporting observational studies in epidemiology.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Sweet syndrome and neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands [^0dc20de2]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Sweet syndrome is a rare cutaneous condition with a broad clinical differential diagnosis. It can be classified into 3 subtypes: classic, malignancy-associated, and drug-induced. There are numerous associated disorders and provoking medications. Uncommonly, it can present as a multiorgan disease and cause significant morbidity. Systemic corticosteroids are the gold standard of treatment and yield rapid improvements in both lesions and symptoms. Nonsteroidal therapies may be effective alternatives, although high-quality comparative data are lacking. Some treatments for Sweet syndrome have paradoxically been implicated in the induction of disease.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome and maternal opioid-related diagnoses: analysis of ICD-10-CM transition, 2013–2017 [^e53db25e]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hospital discharge records remain a common data source for tracking the opioid crisis among pregnant women and infants. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification may have affected surveillance. Our aim was to evaluate this transition on rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), maternal opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid-related diagnoses (OUD with ICD-10-CM codes for long-term use of opioid analgesics and unspecified opioid use).

Methods

Data from the 2013–2017 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample were used to conduct, interrupted time series analysis and log-binomial segmented regression to assess whether quarterly rates differed across the transition.

Results

From 2013 to 2017, an estimated 18.8 million birth and delivery hospitalizations were represented. The ICD-10-CM transition was not associated with NAS rates (rate ratio [RR]: 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90–1.08; P = 0.79) but was associated with 11% lower OUD rates (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80–0.98; P = 0.02) and a decrease in the quarterly trend (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–1.00; P = 0.04). The transition was not associated with maternal OUD plus long-term use rates (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.89–1.09; P = 0.76) but was associated with a 20% overall increase in opioid-related diagnosis rates including long-term and unspecified use (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09–1.32; P < .001).

Conclusions

The ICD-10-CM transition did not appear to affect NAS. However, coding of maternal OUD alone may not capture the same population across the transition, which confounds the interpretation of trend data spanning this time period.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^75e6b150]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

3. Results

3.1. Line coding

In total, the participants rated 2576 lines. They assigned more codes correctly using the ICD-11 (63.3%) than the ICD-10 (42.1%) (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 229.23, P < 0.001), encountered fewer difficulties assigning ICD-11 diagnoses (no difficulty 86.6%) than ICD-10 diagnoses (47.2%) (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 863.81, P < 0.001), and perceived fewer cases of ambiguity for the ICD-11 (no ambiguity: 75.5%) than for the ICD-10 (29.1%) (χ 2 [1, N = 2512] = 1003.84, P < 0.001).

Six of the lines referred to what is called "chronic primary pain" in the ICD-11 and 12 referred to chronic secondary pain. The diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly in the ICD-11 between chronic primary (62.2%) and secondary pain syndromes (63,8%) (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 0.64, P > 0.4) (Fig. 1). In the ICD-10, however, coding of chronic secondary pain was poor (27.2%) while existing chronic primary pain conditions were recognized correctly (70.8%) (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 722.51, P < 0.001). Regarding the perceived difficulty of the code assignment, primary and secondary pain did not differ in the ICD-11 (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 0.004, P > 0.9), but did so in ICD-10 (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 58.87, P < 0.001), with secondary pain being more difficult (refer to Fig. 1 for percentages). A parallel picture is revealed for ambiguity of code assignment. In the ICD-11, no difference between primary and secondary pain was observed (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 0.09, P > 0.7), but in the ICD-10, more ambiguity was reported for code assignments for secondary pain (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 49.14, P < 0.001).

### New practical aspects of sweet syndrome [^c328db5b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sweet syndrome (SS), or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is an inflammatory, non-infectious skin reaction characterized clinically by tender, erythematous papules/plaques/pustules/nodules commonly appearing on the upper limbs, trunk, and head and neck; histologically, SS is characterized by dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis. SS is accompanied by fever; an elevation of inflammatory markers (e.g., erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein) in serum may also be observed. Although most cases of SS are idiopathic, SS also occurs in the setting of malignancy or following administration of an associated drug. SS has also been reported in association with pregnancy and a burgeoning list of infectious (most commonly upper respiratory tract infections) and inflammatory diseases; likewise, the litany of possible iatrogenic triggers has also grown. Over the past several years, a wider spectrum of SS presentation has been realized, with several reports highlighting novel clinical and histological variants. Corticosteroids continue to be efficacious first-line therapy for the majority of patients with SS, although novel steroid-sparing agents have been recently added to the therapeutic armamentarium against refractory SS. New mechanisms of SS induction have also been recognized, although the precise etiology of SS still remains elusive. Here, we catalogue the various clinical and histological presentations of SS, summarize recently reported disease associations and iatrogenic triggers, and review treatment options. We also attempt to frame the findings of this review in the context of established and emerging paradigms of SS pathogenesis.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^14c41608]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Another difference of ICD-10-CM is that it includes manner of injury/intent within the drug overdose diagnosis code itself, while ICD-9-CM captured this information with a separate external cause of injury code. In addition to standard intent categories for injury (unintentional, intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined), the drug overdose codes can indicate an adverse effect or underdosing. Adverse effects are pharmacological effects from medication correctly prescribed and properly administered, while underdosing is the effect of using less of a drug than was prescribed. Another change introduced is that guidance instructs coders to choose unintentional intent if no other intent is explicitly noted in the medical record, whereas ICD-9-CM instructs coders to default to undetermined intent. These changes in guidance could result in systematic changes of drug overdose intent categorisation that will affect counts when stratifying drug overdoses by intent. In two studies, by Heslin et al and Moore and Barrett, intentional self-harm and assault cases were excluded in the drug overdose definitions. However, in other studies, Slavova et al and CDC researchers included these cases.

ICD-10-CM codes T36–T50 (poisoning by, adverse effect of, and underdosing of drugs, medicaments and biological substances) have been used frequently to study and surveil acute drug overdose. However, several codes from outside of the injury chapter ('Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes') could be relevant for drug overdose surveillance when coded as co-occurring conditions on the medical record. One example is O9A.2, 'Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium'. In the event that someone experiences a drug overdose during pregnancy, ICD-10-CM mandates placement of O9A.2 as the primary diagnosis. Another example is codes for substance use with intoxication from the mental health chapter of ICD-10-CM, such as F11.22, 'Opioid dependence with intoxication', which has been used in syndrome definitions for rapidly identifying suspected drug overdose cases.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^77d27c46]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision) is the next major revision of the ICD by the World Health Organization (WHO). ICD-11 differs dramatically from historical versions, as it is based on an underlying semantic network of terms and meaning, called the Foundation. To function as a mutually exclusive and exhaustive statistical classification, ICD-11 creates derivative linearizations from the network that is a monohierarchy with residual categories such as Not Elsewhere Classified. ICD-11 also introduces the widespread post-coordination of terms, which allows for highly expressive representation of detailed patient descriptions. Phenotyping features are included in many subchapters or the signs and symptoms chapter. Composite phenotype descriptions of specific presentations or syndromes can be represented though post-coordination. Rare diseases are well represented in the Foundation, though not all appear in the relatively shallow linearization hierarchies.

### Performance measure development, use, and measurement of effectiveness using the guideline on mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^4f1b14a5]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

### Validation of an international classification of disease, tenth revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) algorithm in identifying severe hypoglycaemia events for real-world studies [^e186f07e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

The transition to the ICD-10-CM coding system has reduced the utility of hypoglycaemia algorithms based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes in real-world studies of antidiabetic drugs. We mapped a validated ICD-9-CM hypoglycaemia algorithm to ICD-10-CM codes to create an ICD-10-CM hypoglycaemia algorithm and assessed its performance in identifying severe hypoglycaemia.

Materials and Methods

We assembled a cohort of Medicare patients with DM and linked electronic health record (EHR) data to the University of North Carolina Health System and identified candidate severe hypoglycaemia events from their Medicare claims using the ICD-10-CM hypoglycaemia algorithm. We confirmed severe hypoglycaemia by EHR review and computed a positive predictive value (PPV) of the algorithm to assess its performance. We refined the algorithm by removing poor performing codes (PPV ≤ 0.5) and computed a Cohen's κ statistic to evaluate the agreement of the EHR reviews.

Results

The algorithm identified 642 candidate severe hypoglycaemia events, and we confirmed 455 as true severe hypoglycaemia events, PPV of 0.709 (95% confidence interval: 0.672, 0.744). When we refined the algorithm, the PPV increased to 0.893 (0.862, 0.918) and missed < 2.42% (< 11) true severe hypoglycaemia events. Agreement between reviewers was high, κ ≥ 0.93 (0.89, 0.97).

Conclusions

We translated an ICD-9-CM hypoglycaemia algorithm to an ICD-10-CM version and found its performance was modest. The performance of the algorithm improved by removing poor performing codes at the trade-off of missing very few severe hypoglycaemia events. The algorithm has the potential to be used to identify severe hypoglycaemia in real-world studies of antidiabetic drugs.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^12e9dff6]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

### Histiocytoid sweet syndrome… [^c5ca4149]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Clinical features of a patient with histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. A, The patient showed numerous edematous erythematous plaques involving the upper back. B, Close-up view of the lesions. Histopathologic features of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. A, Scanning power showing edema of the papillary dermis and a bandlike, inflammatory infiltrate involving the superficial and mid-dermis. B, The inflammatory infiltrate spared the epidermis. C, In some areas, the collagen bundles of the dermis in the center of the aggregates of inflammatory cells showed a splinted appearance. This case series demonstrates that some fresh cutaneous lesions of Sweet syndrome are histopathologically characterized by an infiltrate mostly composed of cells that may be misinterpreted as histiocytes, when in fact they are immature myeloid cells.

We named this histopathologic variant histiocytoid Sweet syndrome, which should not be mistaken with leukemia cutis or other inflammatory dermatoses that are histopathologically characterized by histiocytes interstitially arranged between collagen bundles of the dermis. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, also called Sweet syndrome, was first described by Robert Douglas Sweet in 1964. 1 It is a reactive disorder of unknown etiology characterized by painful, erythematous, cutaneous plaques and nodules of rapid onset accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. Often, the disease follows a viral infection, especially of the upper respiratory tract, but it has been also described in association with hematologic and visceral malignancies, medications, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, and pregnancy.

Sweet syndrome can be classified into the following 3 subtypes: idiopathic or associated with various inflammatory disorders; associated with hematological malignancies; and associated with solid malignant visceral neoplasms. The first category accounts for most of the reported cases.
2. Histopathologically, SS is categorized as a neutrophilic dermatosis. The usual histopathologic findings consist of intense edema of the papillary dermis, an underlying bandlike, dense, dermal, inflammatory infiltrate mainly composed of mature neutrophils with leukocytoclasis and no features of vasculitis. In rare instances, however, typical lesions of SS may show histopathologic features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, 3 although this vasculitis appears to be secondary instead of primary, and its presence does not exclude a diagnosis of SS.
4.

This case series demonstrates that some patients with fresh lesions of SS are histopathologically characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate mostly composed of cells that may be misinterpreted as histiocytes, when in fact these cells are immature neutrophils. We have named this histopathologic variant of SS histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. Histopathologic differential diagnosis should be established with leukemia cutis and other inflammatory conditions characterized by histiocytes interstitially arranged between collagen bundles of the dermis. The most common clinical presentation of the cutaneous lesions consisted of edematous erythematous plaques and nodules. The most common laboratory abnormalities consisted of leukocytosis with neutrophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the neutrophilic dermatoses (pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome) [^7404860b]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Neutrophilic dermatoses include a spectrum of disorders with similar histologic appearance and pathologic processes. Clinically, however, they have different physical manifestations and associations. This group includes two diseases for which dermatologists are commonly consulted in the hospital, namely pyoderma gangrenosum and acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, or Sweet's syndrome. Evaluation is challenging, and many therapeutic approaches have been described for both. The previously reported diagnostic criteria, physical descriptions, differential diagnosis, workup, and treatment options are reviewed. A practical approach to pyoderma gangrenosum and Sweet's syndrome for the provider is described.

### Consensus agreement to rename burning mouth syndrome and improve international classification of diseases-11 disease criteria: an international Delphi study [^80678aa6]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) proposes revisions in the nomenclature, disease definition, and diagnostic criteria for "burning mouth syndrome" (BMS). This process could benefit from additional systematically collected expert input. Thus, the purpose of this study was to use the Delphi method to (1) determine whether revision in nomenclature and alternative names for "BMS" are warranted and (2) identify areas of consensus among experts for changes to the disease description and proposed diagnostic criteria of "BMS", as described in the ICD-11 (World Health Organization). From 31 international invited experts, 23 who expressed interest were sent the survey. The study used 4 iterative surveys, each with a response rate of ≥ 82%. Consensus was predefined as 70% of participants in agreement. Data were summarized using both descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis. Consensus indicated that BMS should not be classified as a syndrome and recommended instead renaming to "burning mouth disorder". Consensus included deletion of 2 diagnostic criteria: (1) emotional distress or functional disability and (2) the number of hours symptoms occur per day. Additional items that reached consensus clarified the disease definition and proposed more separate diagnostic criteria, including a list of local and systemic factors to evaluate as potential secondary causes of oral burning. Experts in this study recommended and came to consensus on select revisions to the proposed ICD-11 BMS nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, and disease definition. The revisions recommended have the potential to improve clarity, consistency, and accuracy of diagnosis for this disorder.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Sweet syndrome: clinical presentation, associations, and response to treatment in 77 patients [^fefa07a2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sweet syndrome is a neutrophilic dermatosis with cutaneous tender lesions that can be associated with malignancies, infections, systemic inflammatory disorders, and medications. Although numerous studies have described Sweet syndrome, few studies have systematically investigated Sweet syndrome.

Objective

We sought to describe characteristics and treatments of patients with Sweet syndrome and evaluate clinical differences depending on the underlying cause.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted to identify patients with Sweet syndrome evaluated at Mayo Clinic from 1992 to 2010.

Results

Of 77 patients with Sweet syndrome (mean age of onset 57 years), 43 (56%) were male. Eighteen patients (23%) reported a preceding infection. A total of 41 (53%) patients were classified as having classic Sweet syndrome, 27 (35%) patients had malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome, and in 9 (12%) patients drug-induced Sweet syndrome was considered. In all, 21 patients had a hematologic malignancy or myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder, whereas 6 patients had solid tumors. The mean hemoglobin level, in both male and female patients (P < .0443 and P < .0035, respectively), was significantly lower in malignancy-associated versus classic and drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Systemic corticosteroids were the most frequently used treatment (70%).

Limitations

This is a retrospective study and represents patients from a single academic center.

Conclusions

Sweet syndrome is a distinctive disorder with certain clinical and histologic characteristics, which usually has a complete response to systemic corticosteroids. It is important to evaluate Sweet syndrome patients who have laboratory evidence of anemia for an underlying malignancy.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, 2016 to 2022 [^fc074544]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome

Because no specific ICD-10 code for CHS existed during the study period, we applied diagnostic criteria to estimate the presence of cannabis use disorder (CUD), cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), and CHS for each ED visit. As used here, CUD refers to cannabis-related diagnoses — including use, abuse, dependence, and poisoning — and does not align precisely with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition)–defined CUD.

CUD was identified using the Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR), which aggregates over 70 000 ICD-10 codes into 530 clinically meaningful categories. We classified CUD as present if any diagnosis in the record fell under CCSR category MBD019 (cannabis-related disorders) or MBD30 (subsequent encounters for cannabis-related disorders). Because cannabis use is often underreported in clinical settings, this broader definition was used to optimize detection.

CVS was classified as present when the primary diagnosis (ie, the main reason for the ED visit) was either ICD-10 code R11.15 (cyclical vomiting, not associated with migraine) or R11.10 (vomiting, unspecified). On the basis of these criteria, visits were assigned to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive groups: (1) no CVS, CUD, or CHS; (2) CUD only; (3) CVS only; and (4) CHS, defined as a primary CVS diagnosis with a cannabis-specific secondary diagnosis (F12x or T40.7Xx).

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### A case of sweet syndrome associated with human granulocytic anaplasmosis… [^5846c2c1]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Background Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, or Sweet syndrome, is a condition that is presumed to be triggered by infectious disease agents. We report a case of SS associated with human granulocytic anaplasmosis, which is of interest because Anaplasma phagocytophilum infects, multiplies in, and disrupts the function of neutrophils, the key infiltrating cell in SS. Observations A patient with initial dermatologic manifestations of SS who did not respond to standard SS treatment was suspected to have concurrent HGA with the demonstration of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic transaminase levels. The HGA diagnosis was established when morulae in neutrophils were observed on a peripheral blood smear, a finding confirmed by both serologic examination and polymerase chain reaction on the skin biopsy specimen used to establish the SS diagnosis.

Conclusion The significant involvement of neutrophils with both SS and HGA warrants a broader search for additional cases that may further define whether pathogenetic linkages could exist. Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, or Sweet syndrome, was first described in 1964. 1 The 4 cardinal features in the original report by Sweet1 were fever; neutrophilic leukocytosis; painful plaques on the limbs, face, and neck; and dense dermal neutrophilic infiltration on skin biopsy specimen. Report of a case On June 5, 2002, a 59-year-old white woman was referred by her allergist for dermatologic consultation. She had a 3-day history of a painful rash on the knees, ankles, and wrists. Her temperature was 101. 3°F. Erythematous papules, plaques, and nodules were noted on the thighs, knees, ankles, heels, forearms, wrists, and hands.

Skin biopsy specimens for hematoxylin-eosin staining were taken from each thigh and revealed a dense dermal perivascular and interstitial infiltrate consisting predominantly of neutrophils mixed with lymphocytes and histiocytes. Screening laboratory findings at presentation revealed a white blood cell count of 6900/μL, a platelet count of 370 ×103/μL, a hemoglobin level of 10. 9 g/dL, elevated serum. alkaline phosphatase level of 166 U/L, an alanine aminotransferase level of 60 U/L, a γ-glutamyltransferase level of 167 U/L, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 76 mm/h, negative findings from an antinuclear antibody test, and a rheumatoid factor titer of 16. Sweet syndrome in human granulocytic anaplasmosis. A, Pink plaques on extremities characteristic of SS.

B, Confirmed in part by the presence of a neutrophilic infiltrate in the superficial dermis. The patient responded immediately to treatment with 40-mg prednisone, and 14 days later after the prednisone was tapered to 20 mg, the fever and clinical signs returned. Her WBC and platelet counts dropped to as low as 2500/μL and 23 ×103/μL, respectively. Based on falling WBC and platelet counts, doxycycline hyclate, 100 mg twice daily, was initiated for presumptive HGA. An examination of Wright-stained buffy-coat and peripheral blood smears revealed scattered morulae in neutrophils consistent with human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Serum IgG and IgM titers for Lyme disease and blood cultures were negative. The acute-phase serologic titer for HGA was less than 64, but subsequent convalescent titers rose to 2048. Elevated titers were confirmed by a second laboratory.

### Identification of substance-exposed newborns and neonatal abstinence syndrome using ICD-10-CM-15 hospitals, Massachusetts, 2017 [^a8d7ff0a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Opioid use disorder and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) increased in Massachusetts from 1999 to 2013 (1,2). In response, in 2016, the state passed a law requiring birth hospitals to report the number of newborns who were exposed to controlled substances to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH)* by mandating monthly reporting of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes related to maternal dependence on opioids (F11.20) or benzodiazepines (F13.20) and to newborns affected by maternal use of drugs of addiction (P04.49) or experiencing withdrawal symptoms from maternal drugs of addiction (P96.1) separately. † MDPH uses these same codes for monthly, real-time crude estimates of NAS and uses P96.1 alone for official NAS state reporting. § MDPH requested CDC's assistance in evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of either maternal or newborn codes to identify substance-exposed newborns, and of newborn exposure codes (both exposure [P04.49] or withdrawal [P96.1]) and the newborn code for withdrawal alone (P96.1) to identify infants with NAS cases related to three exposure scenarios: 1) opioids, 2) opioids or benzodiazepines, and 3) any controlled substance. Confirmed diagnoses of substance exposure and NAS abstracted from linked clinical records for 1,123 infants born in 2017 and their birth mothers were considered the diagnostic standard and were compared against hospital-reported ICD-10-CM codes. For identifying substance-exposed newborns across the three exposure scenarios, the newborn exposure codes had higher sensitivity (range = 31%-61%) than did maternal drug dependence codes (range = 16%-41%), but both sets of codes had high PPV (≥ 74%). For identifying NAS, for all exposure scenarios, the sensitivity for either newborn code (P04.49 or P96.1) was ≥ 92% and the PPV was ≥ 64%; for P96.1 alone the sensitivity was ≥ 79% and the PPV was ≥ 92% for all scenarios. Whereas ICD-10-CM codes are effective for NAS surveillance in Massachusetts, they should be applied cautiously for substance-exposed newborn surveillance. Surveillance for substance-exposed newborns using ICD-10-CM codes might be improved by increasing the use of validated substance-use screening tools and standardized facility protocols and improving communication between patients and maternal health and infant health care providers.

Our study objective was to describe the incidence, costs of care, length of stay, comorbidities, and mortality of SJS and TEN in US adults. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2009–2012, containing a 20% sample of all US hospitalizations, was analyzed. We used a validated approach involving International Classification of Disease, 9th edition, Clinical Modification codes to identify SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN (n = 2,591, n = 502, and n = 564, respectively). The mean estimated incidences of SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN were 9.2, 1.6, and 1.9 per million adults per year, respectively. SJS/TEN was associated with nonwhite race, particularly Asians (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% confidence interval = 3.02–3.54) and blacks (odds ratio = 2.01, 95% confidence interval = 1.92–2.10). Significantly prolonged length of stay and higher costs of care (SJS: 9.8 ± 0.3 days, $21,437 ± $807; SJS/TEN: 16.5 ± 1.0 days, $58,954 ± $5,238; TEN: 16.2 ± 1.0 days, $53,695 ± $4,037) were observed compared with all other admissions (4.7 ± 0.02 days, $11,281 ± $98). Mean adjusted mortality was 4.8% for SJS, 19.4% for SJS/TEN, and 14.8% for TEN. SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN pose a substantial health care burden. Predictors of mortality included increasing age, increasing number of chronic conditions, infection (septicemia, pneumonia, tuberculosis), hematological malignancy (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia), and renal failure (P ≤ 0.03 for all). Further studies are needed to confirm mortality findings to improve prognostication of SJS/TEN.

Regarding the level of detail provided in the classification, the participants' ratings favoured the ICD-11 over the ICD-10 for every diagnostic code assessed. A majority (74.1%) judged the level of detail in the ICD-11 codes as "just right" vs 24.8% for the ICD-10. (χ 2 [3, N = 2515] = 1073.01, P < 0.001). Most participants regarded the level of detail in ICD-10 (68.7%) as "too low" (Fig. 3). Some lines in ICD-11 were perceived as allowing too little coding details (for a line-by-line analysis cf S5); > 30% regarded the codes for chronic nonspecific back pain, postherniotomy and postmastectomy pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy and central poststroke pain as too broad.

### Sweet's syndrome presenting as acute hand infection [^5511fd82]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Sweet's syndrome, originally described as an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, belongs to a class of skin lesions that histologically have intense epidermal and/or dermal inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils without evidence of infection or vasculitis. Skin lesions of Sweet's syndrome most commonly present on the face, trunk, upper extremities, and hands. The presenting lesions are often confused with infections because of their clinical appearance.

Methods

A retrospective search of the electronic medical record was performed to identify patients with Sweet's syndrome from 1996 to the present. These records were then reviewed to identify those patients who had Sweet's syndrome that involved the hands.

Results

A total of 103 patients with Sweet's syndrome have been seen and treated at Scott and White Memorial Hospital since 1996. Of these, 49 patients had lesions on the hands. The presentation, treatment, and outcomes of several of these patients are presented.

Conclusions

As physicians responsible for the treatment of hand lesions, it is important to consider the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome because these wounds are unresponsive to antibiotics, do not benefit from débridement, and instead, require treatment with steroids.

### Monitoring new symptoms after COVID-19 infection among primary care patients in New York city [^50b4d8df]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems causing substantial long-term morbidity. The implications of the Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly for primary care, remain unknown. This cross-sectional study examines new symptoms reported at primary care encounters during three post-acute follow-up intervals after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

Electronic health record data from the NYU Langone COVID Deidentified Dataset were queried for adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, and then restricted to those with a new ICD-10-CM code documented at a post-acute COVID-related primary care follow-up > 14 days after testing positive. New diagnoses and the corresponding Clinical Classifications Software Refined categories were assessed at the following intervals: 0.5–3 months ("subacute"), 3–6 months ("prolonged"), and 6–9 months ("persistent").

Results

Out of 3,154 patients, a new ICD-10-CM code was documented among 499 patients (∼16%). Respiratory complaints, including cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, were most common. Malaise and fatigue were reported consistently among 10–13% of patients at all three time-intervals. Musculoskeletal pain, circulatory symptoms, and sleep-wake disorders were also observed at primary care follow-up.

Conclusion

This cross-sectional study provides support of a post-acute COVID syndrome, demonstrating that patients continue to experience symptoms after the acute infection period. Extensive follow-up data allowed for examining new symptoms up to 9 months after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding of the course of multi-organ post-acute sequelae is restricted by cross-sectional study design limitations. Standardized, sequelae-related ICD-10-CM codes to specify the type and duration of post-acute COVID-related symptoms would enable better monitoring of the growing number of SARS-CoV-2 infection survivors.

### Individual-and hospital-level factors associated with epidermal necrolysis mortality: a nationwide multilevel study, France, 2012–2016 [^9cde9b22]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidermal necrolysis (EN) is a rare and life-threatening condition.

Objectives

To assess whether admitting hospital characteristics and interhospital transfer are associated with mortality due to EN.

Methods

We studied the French nationwide hospital discharge database (retrospective national cohort). All patients admitted during 2012–2016 with a code for EN in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, were eligible. We extracted data on the patients (age, sex, intensive care unit admission, comorbidities) and hospitals (private proprietary vs. public, nonteaching or teaching; and number of admissions for EN as a proxy for experience). Multivariable analysis was used to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality with mixed logistic regression.

Results

We identified 991 patients (467 male; mean age 52·7 ± 23 years). They were admitted to 300 different hospitals, including teaching hospitals (25% of hospitals) for around half of the patients. Overall, 597 patients (60%) had a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), 171 (17%) had SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) overlap and 223 (23%) had TEN. In total, 109 (11%) patients died: nine (2%) with SJS, 26 (15%) with SJS/TEN overlap and 74 (33%) with TEN. The in-hospital mortality rate was lower in centres with vs. without substantial EN experience - odds ratio for one supplemental EN admission in a department 0·5 (95% confidence interval 0·3–1·0); P = 0·05 - even after adjusting for potentially relevant individual risk factors. We found no significant association between mortality and interhospital transfer.

Conclusions

Our findings highlight increased survival of patients with EN in centres with a high volume of EN procedures. If confirmed in other settings, these findings reinforce the importance of expertise in early diagnosis and management of this condition. What's already known about this topic? Epidermal necrolysis (EN) is a rare and life-threatening condition. At the individual level, risk factors for in-hospital mortality have been identified. Few studies have examined the association between hospital characteristics and EN mortality, with special attention to referral hospitals. What does this study add? Short-term mortality rates were lower for patients in centres with EN experience than in centres without EN experience, after adjusting for known risk factors. We found no association between interhospital transfer and survival. If confirmed in other settings, these findings support the early transfer of patients with suspected or diagnosed EN to centres with experience, where a multidisciplinary approach can be implemented by experienced healthcare professionals, to maximize short-term survival.

### Sweet syndrome in children [^8a6cc83d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical features of Sweet syndrome in children. Our study population consisted of seven children diagnosed with Sweet syndrome over a 22-year period. Age, sex, appearance and location of lesions, associated signs and symptoms, past medical history, pathology, and subsequent disease course were documented for each patient. Fever and typical lesions were reported in most of patients in our study. The majority of patients presented with less-typical findings, such as pustules, vesicles, bullae, oral ulcerations, atrophic scars, and evidence of pathergy. Of the seven children in our study, four were found to have a preceding nonspecific upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, and two were diagnosed with an underlying hematologic malignancy. Our results suggest that atypical lesions are relatively common in children with Sweet syndrome and that underlying malignancy is associated with a minority of cases of pediatric Sweet syndrome.

### Sweet syndrome: a painful reality [^70bf6c1a]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Sweet syndrome is a rare disorder that is manifested by constellation of clinical features, including fever, neutrophilic leucocytosis, raised painful plaques on skin and dermal infiltration by neutrophils. Numerous aetiological associations have been reported in the literature, including various haematological malignancies and drugs. Our case was peculiar because of association of capecitabine and Sweet syndrome in rectal cancer. We describe a case of a woman aged 57 years, with recently diagnosed stage III rectal cancer, developed painful erythematous rash over her face along with fever and headache. Skin biopsy was performed which revealed typical findings of Sweet syndrome. She was successfully treated with systemic steroids. Our case was an unusual presentation of Sweet syndrome in a patient with rectal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant capecitabine.

### Diabetes complications severity index (DCSI)-update and ICD-10 translation [^e5fbee97]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

The Diabetes Complications Severity Index (DCSI) converts diagnostic codes and laboratory results into a 14-level metric quantifying the long-term effects of diabetes on seven body systems. Adoption of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) necessitates translation from ICD-9-CM and creates refinement opportunities.

Methods

ICD-9 codes for secondary and primary diabetes plus all five ICD-10 diabetes categories were incorporated into an updated tool. Additional modifications were made to improve the accuracy of severity assignments.

Subjects

The tools were tested in a Medicare Advantage population.

Results

In the type 2 subpopulation, prevalence steadily declined with increasing score according to the updated DCSI tool, whereas the original tool resulted in an aberrant local prevalence peak at DCSI = 2. In the type 1 subpopulation, score prevalence was greater in type 1 versus type 2 subpopulations (3 versus 0) according to both instruments. Both instruments predicted current-year inpatient admissions risk and near-future mortality, using either purely ICD-9 data or a mix of ICD-9 and ICD-10 data.

Discussion

While the performance of the tool with purely ICD-10 data has yet to be evaluated, this updated tool makes assessment of diabetes patient severity and complications possible in the interim.

E-cigarette or vaping product use–associated lung injury (EVALI) ICD-10 coding guidelines — For encounters, an umbrella diagnosis of U07.0 Vaping-related disorder should be used, and examples of additional specific condition diagnoses include J68.0 Bronchitis and pneumonitis due to chemicals, gases, fumes, and vapors; J69.1 Pneumonitis due to inhalation of oils and essences; J80 Acute respiratory distress syndrome; J82 Pulmonary eosinophilia, not elsewhere classified; J84.114 Acute interstitial pneumonitis; J84.89 Other specified interstitial pulmonary disease; R04.89 Diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage; and, when no additional condition is specified, J68.9 Unspecified respiratory condition due to chemicals, gases, fumes, and vapors. Other codes that may be relevant in combination include F12.- Cannabis related disorders and F17.29- Nicotine dependence, other tobacco product, with a clinical note describing the type of e-cigarette used; in addition, T65.291- Toxic effect of other tobacco and nicotine, accidental (unintentional) or T40.7X1- Poisoning by cannabis (derivatives), accidental (unintentional), may also be appropriate, and additional codes may be needed to fully characterize an event so that encounters fully comply with ICD-10 coding rules.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### From histiocytoid sweet syndrome to myelodysplasia cutis: history and perspectives [^da538c15]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2005, a new histologic variant of Sweet syndrome (SS) has been described and termed histiocytoid SS (HSS). Clinically, patients had a typical SS, but on skin biopsy, the infiltrates were composed of immature nonblast myeloid cells. Nearly 50% of patients with HSS have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). HSS may be the first manifestation leading to the diagnosis of MDS. In 2015, a new category of myeloid dermatosis has been proposed, called myelodysplasia cutis, describing the specific skin infiltration by myelodysplastic cells in patients with MDS.

### Systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with Sweet's syndrome [^3172dd72]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

PURPOSE: To describe the first pediatric report of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome associated with Sweet's syndrome. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS: A patient with Sweet's syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We report the case of a 7-yr-old female child with an acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in complete remission after an autologous bone marrow transplantation, with a clinical picture of skin lesions and fever that met the criteria of Sweet's syndrome and developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Her clinical condition worsened despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and standard measures of cardiovascular support. An infectious site could not be identified, and all culture results were negative. Her condition improved dramatically once steroid therapy was administered, and she made a full recovery. CONCLUSION: Although it is a rare condition, the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome must be considered in a patient with the typical skin lesions and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The correct diagnosis is of great clinical importance, because therapy with systemic steroids results in a fast and remarkable improvement.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Optimal statin use for prevention of sepsis in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^71473e78]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis patients were defined as those who were diagnosed with sepsis for the first time and received antibiotic treatment during their hospitalization, based on the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM code. Patients with recurrent sepsis were excluded from the study. It is important to note that all enrolled sepsis patients had no prior history of sepsis and were experiencing the condition for the first time. The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM official guidelines specify the use of specific codes for sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Specifically, the codes "038.xx" and "995.91" are utilized for sepsis, while "995.92" and "758.52" are designated for septic shock. In the ICD-10-CM coding system, the codes "A40.xx" and "A41.xx" are used to identify sepsis, with the fourth digit specifying the organism causing the infection. The code "R65.20" is used for severe sepsis without septic shock, while the codes "R65.21" and "R65.22" are used for septic shock of different severity levels.

Pseudocarcinomatous Sweet syndrome (pSS) is a rare histopathologic variant of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that may clinically and histologically mimic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This is only the second published case of pSS. Awareness and recognition of this histopathologic variant of Sweet syndrome (SS) is important to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis and treatment delay.

### Acute illness associated with cannabis use, by route of exposure: an observational study [^c014188d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about the relative harms of edible and inhalable cannabis products.

Objective

To describe and compare adult emergency department (ED) visits related to edible and inhaled cannabis exposure.

Design

Chart review of ED visits between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016.

Setting

A large urban academic hospital in Colorado.

Participants

Adults with ED visits with a cannabis-related International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM), code.

Measurements

Patient demographic characteristics, route of exposure, dose, symptoms, length of stay, disposition, discharge diagnoses, and attribution of visit to cannabis.

Results

There were 9973 visits with an ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM code for cannabis use. Of these, 2567 (25.7%) visits were at least partially attributable to cannabis, and 238 of those (9.3%) were related to edible cannabis. Visits attributable to inhaled cannabis were more likely to be for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (18.0% vs. 8.4%), and visits attributable to edible cannabis were more likely to be due to acute psychiatric symptoms (18.0% vs. 10.9%), intoxication (48% vs. 28%), and cardiovascular symptoms (8.0% vs. 3.1%). Edible products accounted for 10.7% of cannabis-attributable visits between 2014 and 2016 but represented only 0.32% of total cannabis sales in Colorado (in kilograms of tetrahydrocannabinol) during that period.

Limitation

Retrospective study design, single academic center, self-reported exposure data, and limited availability of dose data.

Conclusion

Visits attributable to inhaled cannabis are more frequent than those attributable to edible cannabis, although the latter is associated with more acute psychiatric visits and more ED visits than expected.

Primary Funding Source

### Treatment of Sweet's syndrome in pregnancy [^6fcfd282]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Pregnancy-associated Sweet's syndrome is a rare occurrence (2%), with good prognosis, spontaneous resolution after delivery, and not increased infant morbidity and mortality. However, differential diagnosis is not easy for physician not familiar with skin lesions. Systemic involvement, even though unusual, might occur in nearly every organ of the body, including pericardium, myocardium, and placenta, as well as one report of early fetal miscarriage, questioning the possibility of risks underestimation. We present two further cases, one occurred in a 31-year-old woman at 26 weeks of gestation and the other on a 26-year-old woman at 24 weeks of gestation, primigravidae. Both presented with tender papules and nodules on their face and upper body parts. Laboratory examinations and skin biopsy histology were pathognomonic. Monitoring of general maternal and fetal conditions showed no signs of sufferance, but the decision to accelerate skin symptoms release, being time to delivery quite distant, challenge the treatment options. There are no recommended treatments for Sweet syndrome and the choice is very limited during pregnancy. A short course of oral steroids was very effective, with lesions healing in few days, no relapses or fetal complications. When pregnant patients exhibit fever, neutrophilia, arthralgia or myalgia, and tender erythematous plaques or nodules, Sweet syndrome should be considered. The trained dermatologist is in the leading position to address the differential diagnosis, reassure the patient, and avoid complications, even if they are rare.

### Mucosal ulcers, extremity nodules, and fevers [^a63de1c1]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sweet syndrome
B. Behçet's disease
C. Primary EBV infection
D. Erythema multiforme
E. Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection

Answers:
A. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with neutrophilia, fevers, and typically edematous plaques or vesiculobullous lesions. Histology would show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and papillary dermal edema without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
B. Behçet's disease – Correct. The oral and genital ulcers, neutrophilic vasculitis on histology of erythema nodosum-like skin lesions, as well as ocular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms with an otherwise unremarkable infectious and inflammatory workup led to a diagnosis of Beçhet's disease.
C. Primary EBV infection – Incorrect. EBV infection may have been both an inciting trigger for Behçet's disease and the cause of her initial presentation consistent with infectious mononucleosis. Associations between EBV infection and Behçet's disease have been well demonstrated. While EBV itself can have dermatologic manifestations, EBV alone was improbable, particularly given evidence of neutrophilic vasculitis on biopsy and subsequent EBV viral load and IgM testing were negative.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. The rash associated with erythema multiforme typically consists of targetoid plaques on the distal extremities. Skin biopsy findings here are also not compatible with erythema multiforme, which would show a vacuolar interface dermatitis with a lymphocytic infiltrate, rather than a neutrophilic vasculitis as pictured.
E. Primary HSV infection – Incorrect. Erythema-nodosum like skin lesions would be highly unusual for primary HSV infection. HSV serologies and PCR were obtained and negative.

Definition of inherited heart disease using routinely collected health data

Seven of the 12 inherited heart diseases included in our search strategy were defined in at least one study (table 2). All studies specified ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis codes to define an inherited heart disease population; three studies also used procedure codes. Across all 12 studies, there were 17 definitions of inherited heart disease. Of these, nine definitions were used in at least two studies or conditions.

Definitions of identifying inherited heart disease using routinely collected health data

Marfan syndrome

Two of the seven Marfan syndrome studies did not further detail relevant ICD-9 code(s). The remaining five studies had a consistent definition of Marfan syndrome based on the coding system used by the routinely collected data source. Specifically, the two German studies used the ICD-10-GM (German Modification) diagnosis code Q87.4, given as either an in-hospital diagnosis or two outpatient diagnoses within 6 months. The three studies using ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modification) all used the diagnosis code 759.82. One of these studies required the diagnosis code to be either the primary or secondary diagnosis.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Four of the five hypertrophic cardiomyopathy studies used the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 425.1 to identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; one study used the ICD-9-CM code of 425.18. Two of the five studies used the ICD diagnosis code alone to identify patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The other three studies required the patient to have a procedure code for a septal myectomy, septal ablation or alcohol septal ablation, in addition to the ICD diagnosis code of 425.1. One of these three studies also required the ICD diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to be the primary diagnosis.

Other inherited heart diseases

One study defined six inherited heart diseases using ICD-9 diagnosis codes. In addition to HCM, these conditions include Brugada syndrome (ICD-9 code of 746.89), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (427.1) and long QT syndrome (426.82). Despite left ventricular non-compaction and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy being distinct diseases, both were identified using one ICD-9 code (425.4).

### Malignancy-associated sweet syndrome presenting with simultaneous histopathologic and morphologic variants [^284ed438]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sweet syndrome (SS), also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is an uncommon nonvasculitic neutrophilic dermatosis.SS is categorized as classic Sweet syndrome, malignancy-associated (MSS), or drug-induced. SS may be further divided into phenotypic and histopathologic variants. Here, we present a patient with multiple simultaneous histopathologic and phenotypic variants of SS.

### Generalized sweet syndrome lesions associated with Behçet disease: a true association or simply co-morbidity? [^1e6d9dea]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Sweet syndrome or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is a condition characterized by painful erythematous papules, nodules, and plaques, which demonstrate mature neutrophilic infiltration of the upper dermis histopathologically, and is usually associated with systemic symptoms such as fever and neutrophilia. Generalized Sweet syndrome lesions are usually noted in association with malignancies. Sweet syndrome lesions are rarely seen in patients with Behçet disease and, if present, are usually fewer in number. In this report, we present two female patients who developed generalized Sweet syndrome lesions during follow-up after the diagnosis of Behçet disease. The clinical and histopathologic findings in our patients together with the data in the literature suggest that generalized Sweet syndrome lesions in a patient with clinically inactive Behçet disease should remind the clinician that a strict differential diagnosis needs to be made between Sweet syndrome associated with Behçet disease and the rare cutaneous manifestation of Behçet disease that resembles the lesions of Sweet syndrome.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^a5d430ff]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Level of injury (1)

Similarly, inference about level of injury can be extrapolated from the ICD-10 descriptor "tetraplegia or paraplegia unspecified" but this controlled vocabulary cannot distinguish aetiology (e.g. SCI from SCD). Thus, we report that it is not reasonable to derive a definitive SCI/D aetiology or assign an injury level from this single ICD-10-AM 7th EDN code. For reasons involving false positives or false negatives, this filter was rejected and is omitted from Fig. 1.

Systematic search strategy

To reduce the assumptions introduced by single filters or NLM search terms, we next referenced aggregated ICD-10 codes to the consensus taxonomies of SCD and the ISNCSCI standard.

Level of injury (2)

A Windows Excel find function search for all descriptors containing the NLM terms "paraplegia" or "tetraplegia" or " cauda equina syndrome" yielded a definitive cohort of 140 (28%) cases (Fig. 3). In rank order, a principal diagnosis of "Other paralytic syndromes: Cauda equina syndrome" (50 cases; 9.9%) was the most common followed by "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Tetraplegia, unspecified" (36 cases; 7.1%) and "Paraplegia and tetraplegia: Paraplegia, unspecified" (34 cases; 6.7%). From this we surmise that when referenced to ICD-10 standards and the controlled NLM vocabulary, an agnostic systematic search strategy can provide some information of relevance to health service planning about level of injury (constrained to 3 categories); with the caveat that it is not possible to rule out false positives/ negatives or achieve a precise SCI/D taxonomic classification.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Complications, adverse drug events, high costs, and disparities in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children vs COVID-19 [^3a00857f]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

After several waves of COVID-19, attention has now turned to understanding post–COVID-19 condition, which has been termed long COVID. For children, the most serious post-COVID complication has been multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a relatively novel hyperinflammatory syndrome that customarily arises approximately 1 month after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, sometimes resulting in cardiac complications in previously healthy children. Since mid-May 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been tracking case reports of MIS-C.

However, since the CDC surveillance of MIS-C relies on hospitals voluntarily reporting to state health departments, we do not yet have a complete picture of MIS-C across the full spectrum of US hospitals. Most CDC studies on MIS-C complications have been limited to at most 66 hospitals across 31 states, with studies on incidence having up to 1700 MIS-C cases. For a rare syndrome such as MIS-C, this small set of data poses a challenge to exploring the disease in greater detail. However, a new International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code for MIS-C was established in 2021 for reimbursement purposes. In this study, we used this new coding to investigate MIS-C across 4057 hospitals in 31 states (77% of the US population). With these novel and more complete data that include 4107 MIS-C cases, we are able for what is, to our knowledge, the first time to provide a more complete picture of MIS-C across the US. Since a feature of MIS-C is multiorgan dysfunction, our first goal was to examine how death, adverse medication events (AMEs), length of stay, and costs vary in both MIS-C and COVID-19 by the number of organ systems affected. The second goal was to identify racial and ethnic disparities in these outcomes for MIS-C vs COVID-19. The third goal was to investigate how these racial and ethnic disparities varied across the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) for MIS-C and COVID-19 to better understand the socioeconomic factors associated with the racial and ethnic disparities in MIS-C.

The ages and sexes of patients assigned codes for TSS-specific and possible TSS (staph) is shown in Figure 2. Most cases occurred in female patients 10–49 years of age (peak 10 −19 years). For both sexes, the proportion of cases was comparable for the < 10-year and > 49-year age groups.

Figure 2
Total TSS-specific and possible TSS codes associated with Staphylococcus aureus, Colorado, 1993–2006. TSS, toxic shock syndrome.

The crude population-based incidence for TSS-specific (staph) cases in patients 1–65 years of age averaged 0.64 per 100,000 (95% CI 0.59–0.70). For female patients 10–39 years of age, the incidence averaged 1.18 per 100,000 (95% CI 0.94–1.41). We compared the annual incidence for TSS-specific (staph) cases in Colorado during 1993–2006 (this study) with estimated incidences from 2 previously reported periods in Colorado using medical record review for 1970–1982 and 1987–1997. We found no significant difference in the annual incidence in female patients 10–39 years of age among the 3 periods (p = 0.134, analysis of variance).

Fifty-three case records (1.8% of total sample) of patients hospitalized during 1998–2006 at Children's Hospital Colorado were identified with TSS-specific, possible TSS, or infectious shock not TSS codes and available for independent, blinded review using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS case definitions. Within this subset, our ICD-9-CM–based code definition for TSS-specific or possible TSS had a sensitivity of 86.5%, specificity of 75.0%, and positive predictive value of 88.9%.

Study Design

People with T2D who had at least one recorded value of HbA1c and BMI (or waist circumference) were identified to form five annual cohorts between January 2017 and December 2021 (Fig. 1). Each annual cohort comprised people who were (1) ≥ 18 years of age on the date of annual check-up, (2) had a confirmed diagnosis of T2D (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10th revision; ICD-10 code: E11–14) with a prescription for an antihyperglycemic agent (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code [ATC] code: A10), and (3) had at least 1 pair of health check-up data which included HbA1c and BMI, or HbA1c and waist circumference values. People were excluded from the annual cohorts if they had a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (ICD-10 code: E10), gestational diabetes (ICD-10 code: O24.4–24.9; P70.0), postsurgical hypoinsulinemia (ICD-10 code: E89.1), drug-induced Cushing syndrome (ICD-10 code: E24.2), or cancer (ICD-10 code: C00-D48).

### A review and proposed approach to the neutrophilic dermatoses of childhood [^de8867ff]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Neutrophilic dermatoses (NDs) are inflammatory skin conditions that are not associated with infection. The classification and clinical approach to these conditions in children is poorly described. This review classifies these conditions into five nosological subtypes: Sweet's syndrome, pyoderma gangrenosum, aseptic pustules, neutrophilic urticarial dermatoses, and Marshall's syndrome. In addition, we review the various secondary diseases that need to be excluded in the clinical management of the NDs of childhood, with a focus on the autoinflammatory conditions that the reader may not be familiar with. We propose a practical clinical approach to these disorders.

### Clinical features of neutrophilic dermatosis variants resembling necrotizing fasciitis [^a1a15d7f]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Pyoderma gangrenosum and necrotizing Sweet syndrome are diagnostically challenging variants of neutrophilic dermatosis that can clinically mimic the cutaneous and systemic features of necrotizing fasciitis. Improved characterization of these rare variants is needed, as improper diagnosis may lead to inappropriate or delayed treatment and the potential for morbidity.

Objective

To determine the characteristics of necrotizing neutrophilic dermatosis to improve diagnostic accuracy and distinguish from infection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A case series of patients with necrotizing neutrophilic dermatosis treated at 3 academic hospitals (University of California San Francisco, Oregon Health and Science University, and University of Minnesota) from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017, was performed along with a literature review of related articles published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2017. Data were obtained from medical records as well as Medline and Embase databases. All patients had signs resembling necrotizing infection and had a final diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum with systemic features or necrotizing Sweet syndrome. Patients were excluded if a diagnosis other than neutrophilic dermatosis was made, if key clinical information was missing, and if reported in a non-English language.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Description of key characteristics of necrotizing neutrophilic dermatosis.

Results

Overall, 54 patients with necrotizing neutrophilic dermatosis were included, of which 40 had pyoderma gangrenosum with systemic features and 14 had necrotizing Sweet syndrome. Of the 54 patients, 29 (54%) were male and 25 (46%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 51 (19) years. Skin lesions commonly occurred on the lower (19 [35%]) and upper (13 [24%]) extremities and developed after a surgical procedure (22 [41%]) or skin trauma (10 [19%]). Shock was reported in 14 patients (26%), and leukemoid reaction was seen in 15 patients (28%). Of the patients with necrotizing neutrophilic dermatosis, 51 (94%) were initially misdiagnosed as necrotizing fasciitis and subsequently received inappropriate treatment. Debridement was performed in 42 patients (78%), with a mean (SD) of 2 (2 [range, 1–12]) debridements per patient. Four amputations (7%) were performed. Forty-nine patients (91%) received antibiotics when necrotizing neutrophilic dermatosis was misdiagnosed as an infection, and 50 patients (93%) received systemic corticosteroids; all patients responded to immunosuppressants.

Conclusions and Relevance

A complex spectrum of clinical findings of pyoderma gangrenosum and Sweet syndrome with prominent systemic inflammation exists that defines a new subset of neutrophilic dermatoses, termed necrotizing neutrophilic dermatoses; recognizing the difference between this variant and severe infection may prevent unnecessary surgical procedures and prolonged disease morbidity associated with a misdiagnosis and may expedite appropriate medical management.

We describe a 49-year-old man with acute myelogenous leukemia associated with Sweet's syndrome and abscess-like lesions mimicking an infectious disease. Although blisters may be included in the clinical spectrum, frank non-infectious abscesses have not been reported as far as we know. Clinicians should be familiar with this clinical and histopathologic variant of Sweet's syndrome. It is mandatory to make every effort to find an infectious cause for abscesses before a diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome is made.

### Validation of syndromic surveillance for respiratory pathogen activity [^33d5b713]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

Syndrome Data Collection and Case Definitions

We defined syndrome data as data in health-related registries that reflect infectious disease activity without identifying causative pathogen(s) or focusing on pathogen-specific symptoms (such as routine surveillance data for influenza-like illness or surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis for polio).

Registries for syndrome data were included if they met the following criteria: 1) registration on a daily basis;2) availability of postal code, age, and sex; 3) availability of retrospective data (> 2 years); and 4) (potential) real-time data availability.

Six registries were selected (Table 1) that collected data on work absenteeism, general practice (GP) consultations, prescription medications dispensed by pharmacies, diagnostic test requests (laboratory submissions), hospital diagnoses, and deaths. In all registries, data were available for all or a substantial part of 1999–2004. For the GP, hospital, and mortality registry, definition of a general respiratory syndrome was guided by the case definitions and codes found in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), as selected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA). For the laboratory submissions and the pharmacy syndrome, we selected all data that experts considered indicative of respiratory infectious disease (for detailed syndrome definitions, see Technical Appendix).

### First case of merkel cell carcinoma in a young patient with sweet syndrome [^d334913e]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

There have been reports of Sweet syndrome arising in association with other cutaneous malignancies, including melanoma. However, our case is the first reported association of Sweet syndrome with MCC reported in the medical literature. Our patient's presentation is unique for several reasons. First, she was diagnosed with the malignancy at a very young age; MCC usually occurs in older males with a history of extensive sun exposure. Second, MCC is a highly immunogenic condition that is associated with other malignancies and an immunosuppressed state. The patient had no other pertinent medical history beyond a diagnosis of Sweet syndrome, and there were no medical conditions that would have increased her risk for MCC. Her relatively young age and lack of comorbidities may account for her good prognosis because MCC is traditionally an extremely aggressive disease with a 5-year disease-specific survival rate of 64% and a median overall survival duration of only 31 months.

The manifestation of Sweet syndrome in this patient is also unique given the relative lack of knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of the disease. Specifically, the treatment of our patient's MCC did not involve any use of chemotherapy, thus ruling out drug-induced Sweet syndrome. In addition, she did not have any prior infections or autoimmune conditions that would meet criteria for classical Sweet syndrome. Although it is known that nearly two-thirds of malignancy associated Sweet syndrome patients develop the syndrome before or concurrently with the diagnosis of the malignancy, the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome in the patient occurred years before the diagnosis of MCC. Thus, any causal relationship between Sweet syndrome and MCC cannot be demonstrated. However, it is possible that the immunogenic changes caused by the cancer further disrupted autoinflammatory regulation in an already susceptible patient, the results of which manifested as an acute flare up of Sweet syndrome in the month before the diagnosis of MCC.

2010. 164-b. Sweet syndrome, originally named acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, was described in 1964 by Dr Robert Douglas Sweet as a syndrome that presents with an acute onset of fever, leukocytosis, and erythematous plaques composed of neutrophils1as well as with characteristically painful red-brown nodules that are raised and sharply demarcated. These nodules are often located in the head and neck region, although they have been reported to involve lymph nodes, 2oral mucosa, 3lower extremities, 2and genitals. 4Although the syndrome may occur in the absence of other known diseases, it is often associated with hematologic and immunologic disorders.

### Classification of emergency department chief complaints into 7 syndromes: a retrospective analysis of 527, 228 patients [^6a8963b4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Electronic surveillance systems often monitor triage chief complaints in hopes of detecting an outbreak earlier than can be accomplished with traditional reporting methods. We measured the accuracy of a Bayesian chief complaint classifier called CoCo that assigns patients 1 of 7 syndromic categories (respiratory, botulinic, gastrointestinal, neurologic, rash, constitutional, or hemorrhagic) based on free-text triage chief complaints.

Methods

We compared CoCo's classifications with criterion syndromic classification based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnoses. We assigned the criterion classification to a patient based on whether the patient's primary diagnosis was a member of a set of ICD-9 codes associated with CoCo's 7 syndromes. We tested CoCo's performance on a set of 527,228 chief complaints from patients registered at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center emergency department (ED) between 1990 and 2003. We performed a sensitivity analysis by varying the ICD-9 codes in the criterion standard. We also tested CoCo on chief complaints from EDs in a second location (Utah).

Results

Approximately 16% (85,569/527,228) of the patients were classified according to the criterion standard into 1 of the 7 syndromes. CoCo's classification performance (number of cases by criterion standard, sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI)], and specificity [95% CI]) was respiratory (34,916, 63.1 [62.6 to 63.6], 94.3 [94.3 to 94.4]); botulinic (1,961, 30.1 [28.2 to 32.2], 99.3 [99.3 to 99.3]); gastrointestinal (20,431, 69.0 [68.4 to 69.6], 95.6 [95.6 to 95.7]); neurologic (7,393, 67.6 [66.6 to 68.7], 92.7 [92.6 to 92.8]); rash (2,232, 46.8 [44.8 to 48.9], 99.3 [99.3 to 99.3]); constitutional (10,603, 45.8 [44.9 to 46.8], 96.6 [96.6 to 96.7]); and hemorrhagic (8,033, 75.2 [74.3 to 76.2], 98.5 [98.4 to 98.5]). The sensitivity analysis showed that the results were not affected by the choice of ICD-9 codes in the criterion standard. Classification accuracy did not differ on chief complaints from the second location.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that, for most syndromes, our chief complaint classification system can identify about half of the patients with relevant syndromic presentations, with specificities higher than 90% and positive predictive values ranging from 12% to 44%.

### Sweet's syndrome with pulmonary involvement [^8822ff3b]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Sweet's syndrome is an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis with classical clinical features. Systemic manifestations in Sweet's syndrome including fever, arthralgia, myalgia and ocular involvement are common. Pulmonary involvement is a rare manifestation that has been reported previously in 34 cases and can be fatal if left untreated. We report a striking case of Sweet's syndrome with respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary interstitial infiltrates, which rapidly responded to intravenous corticosteroid therapy. This case is an important reminder of the systemic manifestations of Sweet's syndrome and highlights the value of collaboration between different medical specialities to optimise patient management and outcomes.

### Atypical presentation of sweet syndrome with nodular erythema and oral ulcerations provoked by ad26.COV2.S SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and review of literature [^c401858f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The aim of this article is to present the case of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome-SS) after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case of SS provoked by this specific vaccine. What is more, the mildly symptomatic beginning of the disease, later followed by typical SS manifestation with a variety of symptoms including nodular erythema of the feet and oral ulcerations, made it very challenging to establish the diagnosis. The article focuses on the current literature on the acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, along with the coexistence with other neutrophilic dermatoses and anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations as provoking factors. It emphasizes the necessity for sharing the knowledge and experience on the subject of SS's clinical manifestations and underlying causes to facilitate prompt diagnosis and introduction of appropriate treatment.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM — compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families' annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family's inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children's health care.

### Accuracy of routinely collected hospital administrative discharge data and death certificate ICD-10 diagnostic coding in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome: a systematic review and validation study [^46e0572d]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Systematic review

No studies were identified which evaluated the sensitivity or PPV of individual diagnostic ICD-10 codes for PSP or CBS (Fig. 1). Two of the full text reviewed articles highlighted the incorrect assignment of PSP patients to the "G12.22 Progressive Bulbar Palsy" code (G12.2 codes Motor Neuron Disease).

Frequency and distribution of clinical diagnoses coded using ICD-10 diagnostic codes G23.1, G25.9, G31.0, G31.8, G23.9, G23.8 and F02.0 in SMR01

The clinical diagnoses in individuals assigned the candidate ICD-10 diagnostic codes are detailed in Table 2. All individuals with G23.1 code (n = 9) had a clinical diagnosis of PSP. Of 61 individuals with the G31.8 code, one individual had PSP listed amongst their differential diagnoses. CBS was not identified. The other clinical diagnoses assigned this code were a combination of parkinsonian (n = 4) and dementia (n = 49) syndrome diagnoses, as well as smaller number (n = 8) of other neurological diagnoses, detailed in Table 2. Few cases were assigned the remainder of the candidate ICD-10 codes. Two individuals, coded with both G31.0 and F02.0, had a predominantly frontotemporal dementia syndrome with potentially suggestive clinical features (postural instability, symmetrical rigidity, frontal behavioural–spatial syndrome) of PSP or CBS, though neither had been given these diagnoses. No cases assigned the G25.9, G23.9, or G23.8 ICD-10 diagnostic codes had a clinical diagnosis of PSP or CBS.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^2c847ed5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Classification codes — there have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would impact the 2021 CPG update, so ICD-10 content was not updated or revised; there is a transition plan to ICD-11 codes which will include coding for primary chronic pain and secondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal); and changes to ICD-11 codes are likely in a future CPG update because directly coding chronic pain will noticeably impact clinical classification of low back pain (LBP).

### Sweet's syndrome in a patient with infective endocarditis: a rare clinical entity [^98ff763b]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Sweet's syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, has been associated with malignancy, autoimmune disease and collagen vascular disease. The association of infective endocarditis and Sweet's syndrome is rare. The authors report a case of Sweet's syndrome in a patient with infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis should be excluded in patients of rheumatic heart disease presenting with Sweet's syndrome. Alternatively, Sweet's syndrome should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a patient with infective endocarditis develops skin lesions.

### Increase of a wide range of bioactive substances in an active phase of neuro-sweet disease [^1cc11b43]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Learning points

Sweet disease is a rare inflammatory skin disease characterised by fever, leucocytosis and distinctive skin rashes. Neuro-Sweet disease should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses when physicians encounter a patient with skin rashes and encephalitis or meningitis.
Sweet disease and Behçet disease share similar clinical manifestations. Neuro-Sweet disease can mimic neuro-Behçet disease and cannot be differentiated based on neurological symptoms alone. Human leucocyte antigen typing results and skin findings are the major differences between these diseases, but controversies remain regarding these differences.
Multiple cytokines appear to be involved in the active phase of Sweet disease. The cytokine profiles in Sweet disease may be non-specific, but the accumulation of cytokine profiles in Sweet disease will help elucidate the pathogenesis of Sweet disease and lead to cytokine-targeted therapies tailored to individual patients with refractory or recurrent Sweet disease.

### Two age peaks in the incidence of chronic fatigue syndrome / myalgic encephalomyelitis: a population-based registry study from Norway 2008–2012 [^e94b27d2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Some patients fulfilling the criteria for a diagnosis of CFS/ME may be missed in the current study due to the possible use of ICD-10 codes for other conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as neurasthenia, burn-out syndrome, malaise and fatigue, or fibromyalgia. However, while a diagnosis of G93.3 gives the right to social security benefits, such as sickness benefit or disability pension, this is most often not the case for, for example, neurasthenia, which includes many of the same symptoms but to a milder degree. According to the guide from the Norwegian Directorate of Health, the code for neurasthenia should only be used when CFS/ME has been ruled out. The ICD-10 guidelines also state that F48.0 ('neurasthenia') excludes G93.3. Thus, we regard G93.3 as the ICD-10 code most closely related to CFS/ME.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^3398bfbe]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 display the performance characteristics for each symptom in the prespecified subgroups. Sensitivity was low for all symptoms in all subgroups (range, 0.17–0.45). The observed values of false-positives, false-negatives, true-positives, and true-negatives differed between inpatients and outpatients for fever (χ 2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (χ 2 = 14.25; P = 0.003) but not cough (χ 2 = 5.13; P = 0.16). Statistically significant differences in the same observed values were found between age subgroups for fever (χ 2 = 42.63; P < .001) and dyspnea (χ 2 = 14.77; P = 0.02) but not cough (χ 2 = 6.28; P = 0.39). Here, we report the χ 2 statistic and P value; see eTable 1, eTable 2, and eTable 3 in the Supplement for the contingency tables used to generate these results. High false-negative rates were the main contributor to poor ICD-10 code performance. The proportion of patients with a false-negative ICD-10 code result ranged from 35.8% for fever among patients older than 64 years to 54.5% for fever among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Assessment of neonatal abstinence syndrome surveillance-Pennsylvania, 2019 [^ce144cd8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a withdrawal syndrome associated with prenatal opioid or other substance exposure (1), has increased as part of the U.S. opioid crisis (2). No national NAS surveillance system exists (3), and data about the accuracy of state-based surveillance are limited (4,5). In February 2018, the Pennsylvania Department of Health began surveillance for opioid-related NAS in birthing facilities and pediatric hospitals* (6). In March 2019, CDC helped the Pennsylvania Department of Health assess the accuracy of this reporting system at five Pennsylvania hospitals. Medical records of 445 infants who possibly had NAS were abstracted; these infants had either been reported by hospital providers as having NAS or assigned an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) hospital discharge code potentially related to NAS. † Among these 445 infants, 241 were confirmed as having NAS. Pennsylvania's NAS surveillance identified 191 (sensitivity = 79%) of the confirmed cases. The proportion of infants with confirmed NAS who were assigned the ICD-10-CM code for neonatal withdrawal symptoms from maternal use of drugs of addiction (P96.1) was similar among infants reported to surveillance (71%) and those who were not (78%; p = 0.30). Infants with confirmed NAS who were not assigned code P96.1 typically had less severe signs and symptoms. Accurate NAS surveillance, which is necessary to monitor changes and regional differences in incidence and assist with planning for needed services, includes and is strengthened by a combination of diagnosis code assessment and focused medical record review.
