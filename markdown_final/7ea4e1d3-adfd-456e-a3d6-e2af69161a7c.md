## Question

Is the L5 S1 joint the same as the sacroiliac joint?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the L5-S1 joint is the same as the sacroiliac joint. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise anatomical definitions and locations. Then, I should verify the bony articulations involved in each joint. Next, I will compare their innervation patterns and biomechanics. After that, I should review how clinical guidelines and imaging distinguish them diagnostically. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and highlight any common confusions that might lead to this question.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical definitions. The L5-S1 joint refers to the lumbosacral junction, which includes the L5/S1 intervertebral disc and the L5-S1 facet (zygapophyseal) joints, forming the articulation between the fifth lumbar vertebra and the sacrum, whereas the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is the paired diarthrodial joint that connects the sacrum to each ilium in the pelvis, typically located inferior to the L5-S1 level and posterior to the pelvis [^111jChQZ] [^113DriD6] [^114Fo7eF] [^114JmeoJ] [^113fXX9r].

> Wait, let me verify the bony articulations to avoid conflating levels. The L5-S1 junction involves L5 and S1 vertebrae with their disc and facet articulations, while the SIJ involves the sacrum and ilium. They are adjacent but distinct structures, and the SIJ is commonly described as lying inferior to the L5-S1 level in the posterior pelvis, which immediately tells me they cannot be the same joint [^111jChQZ] [^113DriD6].

> I need to check the innervation next, because that often clarifies pain generators. The L5-S1 facet joint is innervated by the medial branches of the L4-L5 dorsal rami, whereas the SIJ receives a more complex, variable innervation from lateral branches of the S1-S3 dorsal rami with contributions from the L5 dorsal ramus and, variably, L4, which is why lateral branch radiofrequency targets differ from facet procedures and why SIJ denervation includes S1-S3 and often L5 rather than L4-L5 medial branches [^114msiYM] [^111jChQZ] [^115EU269].

> Hold on, I should verify the biomechanics to ensure I'm not overstating similarity. The L5-S1 facet joints are part of the mobile lumbar posterior elements and experience meaningful flexion-extension and shear, whereas the SIJ is designed primarily for stability with very limited motion, on the order of a few degrees, and its function is load transfer from spine to pelvis. This functional divergence further underscores that they are different joints with different roles [^114msiYM] [^114Fo7eF] [^111e3MJQ].

> Next, I should review how clinical guidelines distinguish them diagnostically. For suspected L5-S1 facet pain, medial branch blocks are used. For suspected SIJ pain, intra-articular SIJ injections and lateral branch blocks are recommended, and the diagnostic criteria and thresholds differ, reinforcing that these are evaluated as separate pain generators with different block targets and response criteria [^114P9xza] [^115aHy86] [^115C2v6D].

> But wait, what if the confusion stems from proximity and symptom overlap? Let me consider that possibility. Pain from the SIJ can refer to the buttock, groin, and occasionally the posterior thigh, and it may mimic L5-S1 pathology; conversely, L5-S1 radicular or facet pain can be misattributed to the SIJ, which is why guidelines emphasize a combination of history, provocative maneuvers, and image-guided blocks to differentiate them rather than assuming they are the same entity [^116vDEaE] [^116Vhiyu].

> I should double-check imaging descriptors to ensure I'm not missing a terminological pitfall. Imaging literature consistently treats the SIJ and the L5-S1 disc/facet as separate anatomical regions, with dedicated SIJ imaging protocols and distinct pathologies such as sacroiliitis versus L5-S1 disc degeneration, which again confirms they are not interchangeable terms [^113fXX9r] [^115gMFfQ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. The L5-S1 joint complex and the sacroiliac joint are anatomically distinct, involve different bony partners, have different innervations, serve different biomechanical roles, and are diagnosed and treated with different interventional targets. They are adjacent and can produce overlapping pain patterns, but they are not the same joint [^111jChQZ] [^114msiYM] [^114P9xza].

---

The L5-S1 joint and the sacroiliac (SI) joint are **distinct structures** with different anatomy, biomechanics, and clinical roles. The L5-S1 joint is the **lumbosacral junction** (disc and facet joints between L5 and S1), whereas the SI joint links the sacrum to the ilium and is a separate, load-transfer joint below L5-S1 [^111jChQZ]. They are often confused because of proximity and overlapping pain patterns, but they have different innervation, motion, and treatment implications [^116vDEaE] [^1148TjeE].

---

## Anatomical differences

| **Feature** | **L5-s1 joint** | **Sacroiliac (si) joint** |
|-|-|-|
| Location | Lumbosacral junction (L5-S1 disc and facet joints) | Posterior pelvis; sacrum-ilium articulation |
| Joint type | Synovial (facet) and intervertebral disc | Diarthrodial synovial joint with limited motion |
| Motion | Moderate flexion-extension and rotation | Minimal motion (~2°); primarily stability |
| Innervation | L5 and S1 nerve roots; dorsal rami | Lateral branches of S1-S3 dorsal rami; L5 dorsal ramus |
| Function | Load bearing; spinal flexibility | Load transfer; pelvic stability |

---

## Biomechanical differences

- **L5-S1 joint**: Bears axial load and allows spinal motion; susceptible to disc degeneration and facet arthropathy [^114Fo7eF].

- **SI joint**: Primarily stabilizes and transfers load between spine and pelvis; limited motion; prone to shear stress and instability [^1148TjeE].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Pain patterns**: L5-S1 pain localizes to low back/buttock with possible leg radiation; SI pain localizes to buttock/groin with minimal distal radiation [^116vDEaE] [^1148TjeE].

- **Diagnosis**: L5-S1 relies on exam, imaging, and selective nerve root blocks; SI diagnosis uses provocative tests and controlled intra-articular injections [^114P9xza] [^115aHy86].

- **Treatment**: L5-S1 is managed conservatively or with fusion; SI pain is treated with injections, radiofrequency, or SI fusion [^111ih1Kg] [^1115XZPJ].

---

## Clinical confusion

Confusion arises from **proximity and overlapping pain patterns**, yet the joints are anatomically and functionally distinct, with different innervation and motion, which guides diagnosis and treatment [^116vDEaE] [^1148TjeE].

---

The L5-S1 and SI joints are **separate structures** with distinct anatomy, biomechanics, and clinical implications; recognizing these differences is essential for accurate diagnosis and management.

### Pelvic fixation with a quad-rod technique using S2 alar iliac and medialized entry iliac screws for long fusion constructs [^1169SyF7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Three cases from our practice demonstrating the described quad-rod technique being used in the care of patients are described (Table 1, Figures 1–6). All cases were done by the senior author.

Surgical Technique

Anatomic bony landmarks to be exposed:
• Pars interarticularis at each level
• Facet joints at each level
• Transverse processes at each level
• Upper 1/3 of the sacrum including the S1 and S2 sacral foramina
• Sacroiliac joints bilaterally
• Posterior superior iliac spine bilaterally

Dissection is done in a standard subperiosteal fashion until the transverse processes and the upper 1/3 of the sacrum including the S1 and S2 dorsal foramina are exposed. The sacroiliac joints, posterior superior iliac spines, and the iliac crest adjacent to the S1 foramen should also be exposed. A Hohmann retractor can be positioned over the iliac crest to provide excellent exposure of the pelvic instrumentation starting points. To ensure patient safety during this technique, it is not advisable to begin instrumentation until all bony landmarks are clearly visualized given that this technique relies heavily on patient anatomy rather than imaging guidance to place instrumentation. Generally, the only form of imaging necessary to place instrumentation in this technique is preoperative AP and lateral radiographs and a preoperative CT scan (axial cuts). Preoperative CT is recommended because it assists the surgeon in using the anatomic technique to appropriately plan pedicle screw start point, trajectory, and size. CT scan also helps to plan appropriate start point, trajectory, and size of the S2AI and MEI screws because there is some variation in individual patient pelvic anatomy as well as between sexes which affects screw start point and trajectory during insertion. After all bony landmarks are exposed, pedicle instrumentation is begun at L4, followed by L5 and S1 in a caudal progression. Special attention should be paid to the insertion point of the L5 screw, ensuring that it falls on a line between L4 and the S1 pedicle screws. Pelvic instrumentation follows pedicle screw insertion.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^114b7Gxr]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Algorithmic approach to SI joint pain.

The emerging disconnect between the growing incidence of diagnosed SI pathology and underwhelming treatment efficacy of medical treatment has been matched with an increase in surgical SI joint fusion procedures for intractable SI joint pain. Rather than managing inflammation and pain, surgical fusion of the SI joint immobilizes the joint and eliminates the motion thought to cause inflammation and SI joint pain. Surgical stabilization of the sacroiliac joint is generally considered when a patient has persistent moderate to severe pain, functional impairment, and failed a minimum of 6 months of conservative care. Surgical fixation can be by a lateral or posterior/posterior oblique approach with the literature supporting minimally invasive options for improving pain and function and maintaining a low adverse event profile. The majority of the literature supports the lateral approach being the most studied. The posterior/posterior oblique approaches, as well as percutaneous graft implants over hardware, have opened a pathway for interventional pain physicians to now offer these therapies in lieu of a surgeon.

### The ability of single site, single depth sacral lateral branch blocks to anesthetize the sacroiliac joint complex [^113nBMgu]. Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the physiologic effectiveness of single site, single depth sacral lateral branch injections.

Design

Randomized, controlled, and double-blinded study.

Setting

Outpatient pain management center.

Patients

Fifteen asymptomatic volunteers.

Interventions

The dorsal sacroiliac ligament was probed and the sacroiliac joint was injected with contrast medium until capsular distension occurred. The presence or absence of pain with each maneuver was noted. Under double-blind conditions, subjects returned 1 week later for L5 dorsal ramus and S1–4 lateral branch injections; 10 subjects received 4% lidocaine (active) injections while five subjects received saline (control) injections. After 30 minutes, subjects had repeat ligamentous probing and capsular distension of the same sacroiliac joint that was previously tested. The presence or absence of pain with each maneuver was noted. In a parallel anatomic study, S1 and S2 lateral branch injections with green dye were performed on two nonembalmed cadavers. Dissection was undertaken to quantify the degree of staining of these target lateral branch nerves.

Outcome Measures

Presence or absence of pain for ligamentous probing and sacroiliac joint capsular distension.

Results

Forty percent had no discomfort upon repeat ligamentous probing after active lateral branch injections while 100% retained pain upon repeat ligamentous probing with control lateral branch injections. Forty percent of the active group and 20% of the control group did not feel repeat capsular distension of the sacroiliac joint after the lateral branch injections. In the anatomic study, 11 lateral branch nerves were isolated while staining occurred in only four cases or 36%.

Conclusions

Anatomic limitations exist with single site, single depth sacral lateral branch injections rendering them physiologically ineffective on a consistent basis.

### Biomechanical effects of transverse partial sacrectomy on the sacroiliac joints: an in vitro human cadaveric investigation of the borderline of sacroiliac joint instability [^111TBY5Y]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

In vitro laboratory study.

Objective

To measure the effects of transverse partial sacrectomies on the compressive and torsional stiffness of the sacroiliac joints.

Summary Of Background Data

Surgical treatment for sacral tumor of different location and nature includes partial or complete sacrectomy. Though the biomechanical investigations about the local destructive force of residual sacrum after partial sacrectomy have been reported, biomechanical properties of the residual sacroiliac joints after different transverse partial sacrectomies remain unknown.

Methods

Seven fresh human cadaveric L5-pelves with normal bone mineral density were used in this study. Each specimen was tested in intact condition first, followed by a series of segmental transverse partial sacrectomies: under S2 partial sacrectomy (U-S2); U-(1/2)S2; U-S1; U-(1/2)S1; and right side sacroiliac joint resection (one-side). A material testing machine was used to apply 800 N compression and 7 Nm torsion loads through the L5/S1 joint. The resected dimensional area of sacroiliac joints and structural stiffness of the residual sacroiliac joints were analyzed.

Results

Average percentages of the resected area of sacroiliac joints were 8.4% in U-S2, 15.1% in U-(1/2)S2, 24.8% in U-S1, and 72.3% in U-(1/2)S1, respectively. In compression U-S2 approximately one-side preserved 98.7%, 97.1%, 94.4%, 82.9%, and 55.2% of the initial stiffness of the sacroiliac joint, respectively. No significant differences were detected among intact, U-S2, U-(1/2)S2, and U-S1 (P > 0.05). However, compressive stiffness of U-(1/2)S1 and one-side was markedly less than that of intact, U-S2, and U-(1/2)S2 (P < 0.05). In Torsion U-S2 approximately one-side preserved 90.7%, 88.5%, 81.9%, 71.9%, and 44.5% of the initial sacroiliac joint stiffness, respectively. No significant differences were demonstrated among intact, U-S2, and U-(1/2)S2 (P > 0.05); However, U-S1, U-(1/2)S1 and one-side exhibited significantly less torsional stiffness than intact and U-S2 (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In surgical treatment of distal sacral tumor, transverse partial sacrectomy involving S1 could result in rotational instability, and the resection level beyond (1/2)S1 further led to compressive instability. When the sacrectomy was at or above the S1/2 level, local reconstruction should be considered.

### Anatomic parameters for instrumentation of the sacrum and pelvis: a systematic review of the literature [^112SJ5Lj]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction:

Multiple cadaver and radiographic analyses have been performed to define the surgical anatomy of the sacrum and pelvis. We provide a comprehensive review of this information, creating an accurate anatomic guide for practice and research.

Methods:

A systematic review was performed to identify publications citing sacral or iliac morphometric parameters based on cadaver or radiographic anatomy.

Results:

A total of 780 abstracts were evaluated. Fifty-six articles were included for final review and grouped into four sections: (1) bone density, (2) bony corridors, (3) screw length and trajectory, and (4) neurovascular and alimentary anatomy.

Conclusion:

A systematic analysis of the radiographic and gross anatomic features of the sacrum has yet to be published. This review includes details on the spatial arrangement of the S1 and S2 pedicle screws, sacroiliac screws, iliac screws, S2 alar iliac screws, and pelvic neurovascular anatomy. The study can be referenced by clinicians for sacral dissection, implant application, and ongoing advances in orthopaedic research.

### Best practices for postoperative management of posterior sacroiliac joint fusion [^114VUXjX]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

SIJ fusion is a rapidly growing and evolving therapy with developing evidence to support its safety and efficacy. In the setting of a desired surgical outcome, safety and efficacy can be adversely impacted by poor post-operative care. The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience has created this best practice document in an effort to improve and standardize care in this critical time of patient recovery.

### Sacroiliac joint pain [^113aP5Bs]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

The sacroiliac joint is a source of pain in the lower back and buttocks in approximately 15% of the population. Diagnosing sacroiliac joint-mediated pain is difficult because the presenting complaints are similar to those of other causes of back pain. Patients with sacroiliac joint-mediated pain rarely report pain above L5; most localize their pain to the area around the posterior superior iliac spine. Radiographic and laboratory tests primarily help exclude other sources of low back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and bone scans of the sacroiliac joint cannot reliably determine whether the joint is the source of the pain. Controlled analgesic injections of the sacroiliac joint are the most important tool in the diagnosis. Treatment modalities include medications, physical therapy, bracing, manual therapy, injections, radiofrequency denervation, and arthrodesis; however, no published prospective data compare the efficacy of these modalities.

### Iatrogenic sacroiliac joint syndrome after percutaneous pedicle screw fixation at the L5-S1 level: case report [^112CJ4kX]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Importance

This article reports an unexpected complication of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation at the L5-S1 level.

Clinical Presentation

We describe a 66-year-old man who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion followed by percutaneous pedicle screw fixation at the L5-S1 level. The Sextant pedicle screw system was used. The patient experienced postoperative sacroiliac joint syndrome caused by the screw head and rod tip. In the immediate postoperative period, the preoperative right-side leg pain improved, but the patient complained of left-side buttock and leg pain. The left-side screws were removed, and after revision surgery, the left-side pain disappeared. However, at that time, right-side pain recurred. We found that the screw head and rod had violated the iliac crest and the sacroiliac joint, causing referred pain rather than radicular pain. After the screw head was repositioned and the rod was replaced with a new shorter rod with a blunt end, the patient's symptom was relieved.

Conclusion

Surgeons should be aware of this unprecedented adverse effect when planning percutaneous pedicle screw fixation at the L5-S1 level. An android pelvis with a narrow and high iliac crest can be a risk factor. Careful preoperative evaluation and more accurate surgical technique are needed to prevent this type of complication.

### Biomechanical effects of a novel posteriorly placed sacroiliac joint fusion device integrated with traditional lumbopelvic long-construct instrumentation [^116dx4fm]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

S2-alar-iliac (S2AI) screw fixation effectively ensures stability and enhances fusion in long-segment constructs. Nevertheless, pelvic fixation is associated with a high rate of mechanical failure. Because of the transarticular nature of the S2AI screw, adding a second point of fixation may provide additional stability and attenuate strains. The objective of the study was to evaluate changes in stability and strain with the integration of a sacroiliac (SI) joint fusion device, implanted through a novel posterior SI approach, supplemental to posterior long-segment fusion.

Methods

L1-pelvis human cadaveric specimens underwent pure moment (7.5 Nm) and compression (400 N) tests in the following conditions: 1) intact, 2) L2-S1 pedicle screw and rod fixation with L5-S1 interbody fusion, 3) added S2AI screws, and 4) added bilateral SI joint fixation (SIJF). The range of motion (ROM), rod strain, and screw bending moments (S1 and S2AI) were analyzed.

Results

S2AI fixation decreased L2-S1 ROM in flexion-extension (p ≤ 0.04), L5-S1 ROM in flexion-extension and compression (p ≤ 0.004), and SI joint ROM during flexion-extension and lateral bending (p ≤ 0.03) compared with S1 fixation. SI joint ROM was significantly less with SIJF in place than with the intact joint, S1, and S2AI fixation in flexion-extension and lateral bending (p ≤ 0.01). The S1 screw bending moment decreased following S2AI fixation by as much as 78% in extension, but with statistical significance only in right axial rotation (p = 0.03). Extending fixation to S2AI significantly increased the rod strain at L5-S1 during flexion, axial rotation, and compression (p ≤ 0.048). SIJF was associated with a slight increase in rod strain versus S2AI fixation alone at L5-S1 during left lateral bending (p = 0.048). Compared with the S1 condition, fixation to S2AI increased the mean rod strain at L5-S1 during compression (p = 0.048). The rod strain at L5-S1 was not statistically different with SIJF compared with S2AI fixation (p ≥ 0.12).

Conclusions

Constructs ending with an S2AI screw versus an S1 screw tended to be more stable, with reduced SI joint motion. S2AI fixation decreased the S1 screw bending moments compared with fixation ending at S1. These benefits were paired with increased rod strain at L5-S1. Supplementation of S2AI fixation with SIJF implants provided further reductions (approximately 30%) in the sagittal plane and lateral bending SI joint motion compared with fixation ending at the S2AI position. This stability was not paired with significant changes in rod or screw strains.

### Ligaments stabilizing the sacrum and sacroiliac joint: a comprehensive review [^111uCJeT]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

The sacroiliac joint is a diarthrodial synovial joint in the pelvis. Anatomically, it is described as a symphysis, its synovial joint characteristics being limited to the distal cartilaginous portion on the iliac side. It is a continuous ligamentous stocking comprising interconnecting ligamentous structures and surrounding fascia. Its ligaments, the primary source of its stability, include the anterior, interosseous and dorsal sacroiliac, the iliolumbar, sacrotuberous, and sacrospinous. Structural reinforcement is also provided by neighboring fascia and muscles. Lower back pain is a common presentation of sacroiliac joint disease, the best-established treatments being corticosteroid injections, bipolar radiofrequency ablation, and sacroiliac joint fusion.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^115aHy86]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Sacroiliac joint pain — diagnostic algorithm criteria state that pain must be caudal to L5 with at least some positive provocative tests and sacroiliac tenderness; sacroiliac joint blocks have a good evidence of accuracy in the diagnosis using comparative controlled local anesthetic blocks, the prevalence is estimated around 25% using a double block paradigm with false-positive rates of approximately 20% for single uncontrolled injections, and the relief obtained should be 75% with bupivacaine outlasting lidocaine.

### Latest evidence-based application for radiofrequency neurotomy (LEARN): best practice guidelines from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^116WcaYH]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Lateral Sacral Branch Radiofrequency Neurotomy

Early studies brought attention to the sacroiliac joint as a pain generator through reproduction of symptoms by way of provocative maneuvers and diagnostic/therapeutic injections into the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). Laslett et al found provocative maneuvers to be helpful but lacked sensitivity. There is no evidence to support any provocative SIJ maneuver as pathognomonic for SIJ pain; hence, the use of diagnostic SIJ blocks utilizing local anesthetics with or without steroids has evolved as the current standard. Although, initially, such injections were done blindly, image-guidance has substantially improved the accuracy of this procedure. However, therapeutic intra-articular injections only provide temporary relief for most patients. Recalcitrant cases led to the advent of other treatment options for SIJ dysfunction. RFN emerged as the most viable choice given its known evidence and effectiveness in treating facet-mediated pain.

Histological analysis of the sacroiliac joint has verified the presence of nerve fibers within the joint capsule and adjoining ligaments. The sacroiliac joint is thought to receive its innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, the dorsal rami of L5, S1, S2, and S3, as well as the superior gluteal nerve. There is an additional ventral innervation of the sacroiliac joint that is inaccessible for denervation.

Sacral lateral branch neurotomy addresses the posterior sacroiliac structures, which includes both the posterior joint and ligaments. Therefore, the response to intra-articular sacroiliac joint injections, per se, does not necessarily correlate to radiofrequency success. However, blocking the innervation lateral to the foramen at different depths has been shown to be more effective. However, there are no placebo-controlled trials for lateral sacral nerve blocks to confirm this thought process. This is a treatment gap in appropriately selecting patients for sacral lateral branch neurotomy.

Current Available Evidence of Lateral Sacral Branch Radiofrequency Neurotomy

Two controlled and two pragmatic RFN studies of the lateral sacral branch are described in Table 6 with the remaining lateral sacral branch radiofrequency neurotomy studies being observational.

Cooled radiofrequency ablation for sacral lateral branch nerves — Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the sacral lateral branch nerves and dorsal rami of L5 may be considered in patients with sacroiliac joint pain diagnosed with dual diagnostic blocks (Grade of Recommendation: C). The work group narrative notes that there are other studies showing clinical benefits from cooled lateral branch radiofrequency neurotomies for sacroiliac joint pain, but these were omitted because they either did not fulfill the initial definition or inclusion criteria, or were published after the literature search closed. In one retrospective review, patients with chronic LBP (n = 27) who had > 50% pain relief after 2 diagnostic sacroiliac joint (SI) joint blocks and underwent cooled radiofrequency were included.

### Sacroiliac dysfunction and minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion [^115rJhmS]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is the largest diarthrodial joint in the human body and accounts for approximately 20% of all low back pain, which is commonly seen in patients with lumbosacral fusions. Despite this, SIJ dysfunction often poses a challenging diagnosis depending on clinical evaluation, imaging, and image-guided joint injection. SIJ fusion is an effective and safe method of treatment, with minimally invasive approaches fitting well within the armamentarium of interventional radiologists treating chronic pain and other musculoskeletal conditions. Contemporary technical approaches and clinical considerations are discussed.

### A biomechanical investigation of the sacroiliac joint in the setting of lumbosacral fusion: impact of pelvic fixation versus sacroiliac joint fixation [^114SKMzd]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a known source of low-back pain. Randomized clinical trials support sacroiliac fusion over conservative management for SIJ dysfunction. Clinical studies suggest that SIJ degeneration occurs in the setting of lumbosacral fusions. However, there are few biomechanical studies to provide a good understanding of the effect of lumbosacral fusion on the SIJ. In the present study, researchers performed a biomechanical investigation to discern the effect of pelvic versus SIJ fixation on the SIJ in lumbosacral fusion.

Methods

Seven fresh-frozen human cadaveric specimens were used. There was one intact specimen and six operative constructs: 1) posterior pedicle screws and rods from T10 to S1 (PS); 2) PS + bilateral iliac screw fixation (BIS); 3) PS + unilateral iliac screw fixation (UIS); 4) PS + UIS + 3 contralateral unilateral SIJ screws (UIS + 3SIJ); 5) PS + 3 unilateral SIJ screws (3SIJ); and 6) PS + 6 bilateral SIJ screws (6SIJ). A custom-built 6 degrees-of-freedom apparatus was used to simulate three bending modes: flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR). Range of motion (ROM) was recorded at L5-S1 and the SIJ.

Results

All six operative constructs had significantly reduced ROM at L5-S1 in all three bending modes compared to that of the intact specimen (p < 0.05). In the FE mode, the BIS construct had a significant reduction in L5-S1 ROM as compared to the other five constructs (p < 0.05). SIJ ROM was greatest in the FE mode compared to LB and AR. Although the FE mode did not show any statistically significant differences in SIJ ROM across the constructs, there were appreciable differences. The PS construct had the highest SIJ ROM. The BIS construct reduced bilateral SIJ ROM by 44% in comparison to the PS construct. The BIS and 6SIJ constructs showed reductions in SIJ ROM nearly equal to those of the PS construct. UIS and 3SIJ showed an appreciable reduction in unfused SIJ ROM compared to PS.

Conclusions

This investigation demonstrated the effects of various fusion constructs using pelvic and sacroiliac fixation in lumbosacral fusion. This study adds biomechanical evidence of adjacent segment stress in the SIJ in fusion constructs extending to S1. Unilateral pelvic fixation, or SIJ fusion, led to an appreciable but nonsignificant reduction in the ROM of the unfused contralateral SIJ. Bilateral pelvic fixation showed the greatest significant reduction of movement at L5-S1 and was equivalent to bilateral sacroiliac fusion in reducing SIJ motion.

Neuroablative Techniques

If conservative and SIJ therapeutic injections have failed to provide relief neuro-ablative techniques are an accepted next best step to manage a painful SIJ. The posterior sensory innervation of the SIJ is through nerve branches that pass medially from the posterior aspect of the SIJ to converge to the rami dorsalis from the L4 to the S1–S4 dorsal rami. Given these anatomic features, different SIJ RF ablation approaches have been described:
Sequential Radiofrequency lesions in the posteroinferior aspect of the joint by leapfrogging an electrode at less than 1-cm intervals. However, a review of this technique pointed out that only 36% of patients reported more than 50% pain relief lasting at least 6 months, being that only a small portion of the joint was denervated.
Intra-articular phenol has been suggested by some in the past, but because of the inherent risks most practicing physicians who treat SIJ pain shy away from this method of ablation.
RF ablation targeting the lateral branches of the primary dorsal rami from L5-S2 has met with more auspicious results, with most studies reporting sustained relief lasting at least 6 months in over 60% of subjects. Anatomic studies have demonstrated that the lateral branches which provide nociceptive and proprioceptive input from the SI joints vary in number, location, level and also between patients, hence conventional RF techniques where the RF lesion is about 3–4 mm and uniplanar cannot capture it all.
Enhancing lesion size to overcome this obstacle, has been attempted using bipolar lesioning, internally cooled electrodes, and replacing RF electrodes with cryoprobes. Bipolar lesioning has yielded good anecdotal results by creating a continuous strip lesion, the technique itself is limited by wide variations in tissue impedance around the sacral foramina resulting in asymmetric ablative patterns.
Cryoablation has also led to a shorter duration of benefit.
Both controlled and uncontrolled studies support the use of cooled RF. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study 64% and 57% of patients experienced more than 50% pain relief at 3- and 6-month follow-up, respectively, with comparable improvements in function and medication reduction the median duration of benefit in successful patients being 8 months.
Lateral sacral neuro-ablation by the above techniques may not benefit all painful SIJ pain because targeting the posterior nerve supply of the joint does not address pain emanating from the ventral aspect of the joint. One studyfound that lateral sacral branch blocks were more effective at preventing SIJ pain secondary to extra-articular (i.e. ligamentous) stimulation than from capsular distension. Another analyzed 77 patients and concluded that more than half of the patients continue to experience at least 50% relief greater than 6 months post procedure with predictors like the elderly, higher pre-procedure pain scores, opioid usage, and pain radiating beyond the knee were associated with treatment failure.
Internally cooled electrodes remove the constraint of tissue charring on lesion expansion; hence, it can increase lesion diameter by 200% to 300%, and volume by a factor of 8 thus eliminating the concern of lesion size during thermal radiofrequency.

Radiofrequency Ablation

Prior to performing radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a diagnostic block of the lateral sacral branches (S1–3) and L5 dorsal rami is recommended, even if the patient has previously received intra-articular SIJ injections. Although many older studies have utilized intra-articular SIJ injection as the standard for selecting candidates for lateral branch RFA, this strategy does not account for extra-articular sources of pain such as the posterior sacral ligaments as well as posterior joint complex that are targeted by lateral branch RFA. A cutoff of 50% pain relief or higher from lateral branch diagnostic block may be implemented prior to offering RFA. Furthermore, a multi-site, multi-depth lateral branch block approach is recommended as an important tool that may prognosticate if lateral branch RFA may assist with extra-articular SIJ pain. Contraindications to offering neuroablative modalities for SIJ pain include sacral fracture, malignancy, infection, and coagulation.

Best Practice Statement on Diagnostic Blockade Prior to Neuroablative Procedures of the SIJ

Dual diagnostic blockade of the L5 primary dorsal ramus and sacral lateral branches (S1–3) with 50% improvement in pain and function is the preferred strategy prior to neuroablative procedures of the SIJ.

Historically, a leapfrogging RFA technique (see Figure 2) has been utilized sequentially within the SIJ, but only 36% of patients experienced over 50% pain relief at six months Figure 2. This was attributed to only partial denervation of the SIJ. Currently, the lateral sacral branches (S1–3) and L5 dorsal rami are the preferred targets for RFA to treat SIJ joint, with sustained relief for at least six months reported in over 60% of participants.

### Introduction to lumbosacral and sacropelvic fixation strategies [^114Fo7eF]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

We are pleased to present this Neurosurgical Focus video supplement on lumbosacral and sacropelvic fixation strategies. Despite advancement in surgical techniques and technologies in spine, achieving consistent solid fusion across the lumbosacral junction remains a major challenge. The anatomy of the lumbosacral junction allows for a higher range of motion compared to other areas of the thoracolumbar spine. The L5-S1 interspace is exposed to significant shear forces. As a result, complications such as pseudoarthrosis, screw pull-out, implant fracture, or sacral fractures can occur. Complications are particularly seen in long fusion constructs ending across the lumbosacral junction. To reduce these complications, various lumbosacral and sacropelvic fixation techniques have been developed and utilized. The current supplement is intended to provide instructional videos that illustrate several current techniques for lumbosacral and sacropelvic fixation. The collection includes techniques for anterior L5-S1 interbody fusion, minimally invasive L5-S1 interbody fusions, lumbosacral pedicle screw placement, sacroiliac fusion, and sacro-alar-iliac screw placement. The authors of the videos in the supplement have provided detailed narration and video illustration to describe the nuances of the various open and minimally invasive techniques for lumbosacral and sacral-pelvic fixation. We are pleased to have such a collection of quality video illustration from experts in the field. It's been our privilege to serve as guest editors for this supplement and we believe that you will enjoy the contents of this supplement.

### Lumbar fusion leads to increases in angular motion and stress across sacroiliac joint: a finite element study [^11421F25]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

The assessment of sacrum angular motions and stress across sacroiliac joint (SIJ) articular surfaces using finite element lumbar spine-pelvis model and simulated posterior fusion surgical procedures.

Objective

To quantify the increase in sacrum angular motions and stress across SIJ as a function of fused lumbar spine using finite element lumbar spine-pelvis model.

Summary Of Background Data

A review of the literature suggests that for 20% to 30% of spine surgery patients, failed back surgery syndrome as a possible complication. The SIJ might be a contributing factor in failed back surgery syndrome in 29% to 40% of cases. The exact pathomechanism which leads to SIJ pain generation is not well understood. We hypothesized that lumbar spine fusion leads to increased motion or stresses at the SIJ; this alone could be a trigger of the pain syndrome.

Methods

A finite element model of the lumbar spine-pelvis was used to simulate the posterior fusion at L4-L5, L4-S1, and L5-S1 levels. The magnitude of the sacrum angular motion and average of stresses across SIJ articular surfaces were compared with intact model in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation motions.

Results

The computed sacrum angular motions in intact spine, after L4-L5, L5-S1, and L4-S1 fusion gradually increased with maximum value in L4-S1 fusion model. Also, the average stress on SIJ articular surfaces progressively increased from minimum in L4-L5 to maximum in L4-S1 fusion models.

Conclusion

The fusion at the lumbar spine level increased motion and stresses at the SIJ. This could be a probable reason for low back pain in patients after lumbar spine fusion procedures.

### What happens at the L5 / S1 facet joint when implants are placed across the sacroiliac joint? [^111z9RKg]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Injuries to the posterior pelvic ring are often stabilized with fixation across the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). However, the compensatory changes at the neighboring L5/S1 facet joint are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the compensatory change in pelvic kinematics and contact forces at the L5/S1 facet joint after fixation across the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) using a cadaveric model.

Methods

Five fresh-frozen cadaveric pelvis specimens were dissected to remove non-structural soft tissue. Retroreflective markers were fixed to the L5 body, S1 body and bilateral anterior superior iliac spines to represent the motion of L5, S1 and the ileum, respectively. Pressure sensors were inserted in both L5/S1 facet joints. Testing was performed using a robotic system that applied load to mimic ambulation. Testing was performed prior to SIJ fixation, after unilateral SIJ fixation and bilateral fixation.

Results

Contact force at the L5/S1 facet joint significantly increased by 55% from 48.4 N to 75.2 N following unilateral fixation (p = 0.0161) and increased by 100% to 96.9 N after bilateral fixation (p = 0.0038). Unilateral SIJ fixation increased flexion of the ilium relative to L5 from 1.2° to 2.0° (p = 0.01) and increased axial rotation of L5 relative to S1 from 0.7° to 1.6° (p = 0.001). Bilateral fixation increased flexion of the ilium relative to L5 to 2.0° from 1.2° prior to fixation (p = 0.001), increased axial rotation of L5 relative to S1 to 1.2° from 0.7° prior to fixation (p = 0.002) and increased flexion of L5 relative to S1 to 2.4° from 1.5° prior to fixation (p = 0.04).

Conclusion

The L5/S1 facet joint experiences compensatory increased motion under increased contact force after unilateral and bilateral SIJ fixation, possibly predisposing it to adjacent segment arthritis.

### Diagnosing sacroiliac joint pain [^116vDEaE]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a diarthrodial joint that has been implicated as a pain generator in approximately 10% to 25% of patients with mechanical low back or leg symptoms. Unique anatomic and physiologic characteristics of SIJ make it susceptible to mechanical stress and also create challenges in the diagnosis of SIJ pain. A variety of inciting causes for SIJ pain may exist, ranging from repetitive low-impact activities such as jogging to increased stress after multilevel spine fusion surgery to high-energy trauma such as in motor vehicle accidents. Similarly, wide variability exists in the clinical presentation of SIJ pain from localized pain or tenderness around the SIJ to radiating pain into the groin or even the entire lower extremity. No pathognomonic clinical history, physical examination finding, or imaging study exists that aids clinicians in making a reliable diagnosis. However, imaging combined with clinical provocative tests might help to identify patients for further investigation. Although provocative physical examination tests have not received reliable consensus, if three or more provocative tests are positive, pursuing a diagnostic SIJ injection is considered reasonable. Notable pain relief with intra-articular anesthetic injection under radiographic guidance has been shown to provide reliable evidence in the diagnosis of SIJ pain.

4.6.4 Sacroiliac joint pain and dysfunction

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is the largest axial joint and consists of a synovial joint and complex ligamentous structures. SIJ dysfunction is a common cause of low back, buttock, and leg pain, with a prevalence of 15%–30% in persons presenting with low back pain. Although the sacroiliac joint is located in the posterior pelvis, pain arising from the joint can manifest as pain in the lumbar spine, buttock, leg distal to the knee, and into the foot. The pain tends to worsen with transitions, such as from sitting to standing. Numerous provocative tests have been described. Pain to palpation of the SIJ (just inferior and medial to the posterior superior iliac spine) and absence of pain above L5 support the diagnosis. Additional evidence‐based tests include Gaenslen's test, SIJ distraction test, thigh thrust test, SIJ compression test, and the FABER test, although none of these tests have high reliability when used alone. Due to the challenging nature of the diagnosis, some experts advocate that the presence of three positive tests should be considered indicative of SIJ dysfunction (sensitivity 0.94, specificity 0.78). Injection into the SIJ can also provide diagnostic and/or therapeutic benefit and confirm the diagnosis.

Although inflammatory arthritides and spondyloarthropathies may present with SIJ pain, a comprehensive review of relevant history and physical examination findings is beyond the scope of this review. However, clinicians should strongly consider the possibility in patients with skin or nail manifestations of psoriasis, a personal history of uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease, a family history of spondyloarthropathy, or clinical dactylitis.

### Radiologic analysis and clinical study of the upper one-third joint technique for fluoroscopically guided sacroiliac joint injection [^113vJR39]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac intraarticular injection by the traditional technique can be challenging to perform when the joint is covered with osteophytes or is extremely narrow.

Objective

To examine whether there is enough space for the needle to be advanced from the L5-S1 interspinous space to the upper one-third sacroiliac joint (SIJ) by magnetic resonance image (MRI) analysis as an alternative to fluoroscopically guided SIJ injection with the lower one-third joint technique, and to determine the feasibility of this novel technique in clinical practice.

Study Design

MRI analysis and observational study.

Setting

An interventional pain management practice at a university hospital.

Methods

We analyzed 200 axial T2-weighted MRIs between the L5 and S1 vertebrae of 100 consecutive patients. The following measurements were obtained on both sides: 1) the thickness of fat in the midline; 2) the distance between the midline (Point C) and the junction (Point A) of the skin and the imaginary line that connects the SIJ and the most medial cortex of the ilium; 3) the distance between the midline (Point C) and the junction (Point B) of the skin and the imaginary line that connects the SIJ and the L5 spinous process; 4) the distance between the SIJ and midline (Point C) on the skin, or between the SIJ and the midpoint (Point C') of the line from Point A to Point B; and 5) the angle between the sagittal line and the imaginary line that connects the SIJ and the midline on the skin. The upper one-third joint technique was performed to establish the feasibility of the alternative technique in 20 patients who had unsuccessful sacroiliac intraarticular injections using the lower one-third joint technique.

Results

The mean distances from the midline to Point A and to Point B were 21.9 ± 13.7 mm and 27.8 ± 13.6 mm, respectively. The mean distance between the SIJ and Point C (or Point C') was 81.0 ± 13.3 mm. The angle between the sagittal line and the imaginary line that connects the SIJ and the midline on the skin was 42.8 ± 5.1°. The success rate of sacroiliac intraarticular injections with the upper one-third joint technique was 90% (18/20).

Limitations

This was an observational study and lacked a control group.

Conclusions

Sacroiliac intraarticular injections with the upper one-third joint technique are advisable when it is hard to perform them with the lower one-third joint technique.

Introduction

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is becoming an increasingly recognized pathology in patients with lower back pain, with current estimates suggesting that 15–30% of lower back pain may be attributed to SIJ pathology. The SIJ connects the sacrum to the bilateral ilium bones and is the largest axial synovial joint in the body by surface area. The SIJ is relatively inflexible due to the wide surface area of the joint, which is reinforced with irregular bony elevations and depressions that interlock the two bones in a "C" shape as well as thick, redundant ligaments exterior to the synovium. The SIJ has a very narrow joint space, ranging from 0.5 to 4mm leading to approximate ranges of motion of 3 degrees in flexion and extension, 1.5 degrees in axial rotation, and 0.8 degrees in lateral bending.

Sacroiliac pain may be caused by exterior shearing forces, hypo- or hyper-mobility, micro- or macro-fractures, soft tissue injury, inflammation, pregnancy causing laxity in the supporting ligaments, leg length discrepancy, and prior lumbar fusion, among others. The proximity of the joint to the hip joint and lumbar spine often leads to a variety of presenting symptoms, which has led to SIJ pain being referred to as the great "mimicker" of different pain pathologies. The innervation of the SIJ is complex and, despite some conflicting information in the literature, most clinicians agree that the sensory fibers stem from the lateral branches of the posterior rami of L5-S4, which are the pain sensors of the joint.

Because the differential diagnosis for SIJ pain is broad, misdiagnosis is common. The diagnosis of SIJ pain begins with a thorough history and physical examination. If a patient has a positive response to 3 or more SIJ provocative tests, the pain is likely due to pathology in the SIJ and may result in a positive diagnostic SIJ block. The SIJ block consists of intraarticular injection of corticosteroids and local anesthetics to reduce inflammation and pain, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Current standards suggest that a 75% pain improvement after two separate injections is considered a positive diagnosis of sacroiliitis.

### Does spinopelvic imbalance after minimally invasive lower lumbar fusion predispose patients to subsequent minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusions? a case-control study [^113CDwRk]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is a frequently overlooked source of persistent low back pain after lower lumbar surgery. The SIJ is an adjacent joint to the lower lumbar spine and can thus be subject to adjacent segment disease (ASD) after lower lumbar fusion. Spinopelvic imbalance can potentially predispose a patient to ASD in the SIJ, causing SIJ dysfunction. However, the impact of spinopelvic imbalance following minimally invasive (MIS) lower lumbar fusion on SIJ dysfunction and, thus, subsequent fusion remains inconclusive. We sought to determine whether spinopelvic imbalance after lower lumbar fusion predisposes patients to subsequent MIS SIJ fusion (SIJF).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed consecutive elective lower lumbar fusion patients (ending levels L5/S1) to select our cases and controls in a 1:1 match. We included patients who underwent MIS lower lumbar fusion from 10/2005 to 05/2021 at a single institution with an ending level including L5 or S1, a starting level at or below T12, and had at least two years of follow-up. We excluded patients with inadequate or absent postoperative X-rays, those who underwent lumbar fusion for trauma or infection, pelvic fixation, revision lumbar surgery, and prior SIJF. We performed a pilot study to determine the sample size as 190 per group. Confounders, including the number of pregnancies, were collected. Consistent with prior literature, we defined spinopelvic imbalance as a PI-LL mismatch of < -10° or > 10° [1–5]. We compared the groups using univariate analysis. The odds of developing SIJF related to PI-LL mismatch were calculated using Chi-Square. We performed multivariable analysis modeling on SIJF to adjust for covariates.

Results

We included 488 patients (203 SIJF vs. 285 control). Between groups, the SIJF patients were significantly younger (52.55 ± 12.81 vs. 55.84 ± 14.71; P = 0.005), had a higher proportion of females (67.5% vs. 55.1%; P = 0.006), and increased levels fused (1.78 ± 0.97 vs. 1.38 ± 0.64; P < 0.001). Interestingly, number of pregnancies was not significantly different (P = 0.791). PI-LL mismatch demonstrated a 3.54 increased odds of requiring subsequent SIJF (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression adjusting for age at lumbar fusion, female sex, and number of levels demonstrated that PI-LL mismatch (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.06–1.15; p < 0.001) and operative levels (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.42–2.39; p < 0.001) were independently associated with significantly increased odds of requiring SIJF, while age (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96–0.99; p < 0.001) and female sex (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36–0.81; p = 0.003) were associated with significantly decreased odds of requiring SIJF.

Conclusion

PI-LL mismatch following MIS lower lumbar fusion was independently associated with significant odds of requiring subsequent SIJF. Optimizing spinopelvic imbalance can decrease the odds of requiring subsequent SIJF after MIS lower lumbar surgery. Given the biases associated with the retrospective and observational nature of our study design, further prospective studies are needed.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^1148TjeE]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Presentation

Sacroiliac Joint Biomechanics

The SI joints are designed primarily for stability. The joint rotates about three planes of axes (flexion and extension, rotation, and translation) but by very small amounts approximated at two degrees. Motion along the sacroiliac joint is not linear as it occurs simultaneously in multiple planes. Anatomic pathology changes affecting many of the SI joint structures can lead to nociception. There are numerous reported etiologies for SI joint pain. The causes can be divided into intraarticular and extra-articular sources. Examples of intraarticular causes are arthritis and infection of the SI joint. Common extra-articular causes include enthesopathy, fractures, ligamentous injury, and myofascial pain. In addition to the etiologic sources, there are numerous factors that can predispose a person to gradually develop SI joint pain. Risk factors that increase stress on the SI joint are leg length discrepancy, gait abnormalities, prolonged vigorous exercise, scoliosis, pregnancy, spinal fusion to the sacrum, and hip pathology.

History Findings

The sacroiliac joint can be responsible for 10–38% of low back pain, and oftentimes presents with pain below the belt line with radiations into the groin and lower extremity, infrequently with radiations below the knee in the L5-S1 dermatomal pattern. The pain is aching in quality, with absence of burning quality or numbness and tingling. Pain is often with movement, can radiate into the ipsilateral groin and into the buttock. The differential of evaluation of low back can be narrowed by the performance of a physical exam and performance of provocative maneuvers for the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain.

### Stabilization of the sacroiliac joint with the SI-bone surgical technique [^113DriD6]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Although the motion of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) is minimal, pain can originate from the SIJ on mechanical loading and affect walking, sitting and sleep patterns. The SIJ refers to the pair of joints inferior to the L5-S1 joint, and functions as the inferior adjacent level after a L5-S1 fusion. SIJ pain has a clinical overlay of symptoms often similar to low back pain (LBP) generated by the lumbar spine. The differential diagnosis in any patient with LBP should include the triad of low back, SIJ, and hip. SIJ pain is also a known cause of residual LBP after successful lumbar fusion. Relief of the patient's pain with a diagnostic SIJ block verifies the SIJ as the site of the pain generator. The SI-bone technique of stabilization of the SIJ is a true minimally invasive surgical technique performed through an initial small skin incision and then over pins, with the aid of fluoroscopy in three orthogonal axes with one axis parallel to the posterior sacral cortical line at the S1 to S2 region. The fluoroscopy procedure includes the following steps: 1) pre-op plan of the desired 3 implant trajectories to account for the anatomic variations; 2) placement of 3 Steinman pins at these trajectories across the SIJ starting in a small skin incision; 3) drill, broach and then implant placement as a cannulated system. All these steps are performed with the assistance of fluoroscopy in all three imaging planes - lateral, inlet and outlet views. The SI-Bone implants are triangular shaped titanium and have a rough surface for immediate stability. This rough surface is believed to aid in the osteo-fixation of the implants to the ilium and sacrum, as well as to long term fusion of the SIJ after its prolonged immobilization.

Prognostic Blockade for Radiofrequency Neurotomy

The construct of dual comparative anesthetic blocks with two separate local anesthetics as a prelude to radiofrequency neurotomy has been established for cervical and lumbar facet denervation, although the extension of this paradigm to sacroiliac denervation has important limitations. First, sacroiliac innervation is inconsistent, second, the sacroiliac lateral branches are not always in the same tissue planes, and third, our understanding of the sources of innervation of the sacroiliac complex has been evolving. With respect to innervation, it was believed that the joint received innervation from the L4 medial branch, L5 dorsal ramus and the lateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branches, leading Cohen et al in 2008to include these nerves in their randomized prospective controlled trial. Subsequently, the L4 medial branch was believed not to contribute to the sacroiliac complex, leading Patel et al in 2012 to exclude the L4 medial branch from their RCT. In both studies, the prognostic block technique differed. In the Cohen trial, the patients were randomized to sham procedure or radiofrequency neurotomy if they reported > 75% relief with one intra-articular corticosteroid and anesthetic injection 6 hours post-injection. In the Patel et al RCT, patients were eligible for study enrollment if they received > 75% relief of their index pain with two sets of single-site, single-depth, anesthetic blocks of the L5 dorsal ramus and S1-S3 sacral lateral branches.

Indications and Contraindications

Axial non-radicular pain is the most common clinical presentation in the contemporary pain clinic. Amongst this group of patients, mixed and nociceptive pain syndromes predominate with pain arising from the anterior and posterior elements, including facet joints, annular tears in the discs, and sacroiliac joints. Lower back and buttock pain without distal radicular and neuropathic features must be carefully evaluated to precisely define the primary source of pain. The presence of pain should be corroborated with at least three positive clinical signs, subsequent to which prognostic dual comparative multi-site multi-depth anesthetic blocks with > 75% relief with each block of the lateral S1, S2, S3 branches are the best indication for the sacral radiofrequency denervation procedure.

The procedure is contraindicated in anyone with localized infection, refusal and/or inability to provide informed consent, and pregnancy when fluoroscopy is indicated. Relative contraindications are poorly visualized anatomy and cases in which limited visualization of the sacral foraminal precludes adequate placement of the radiofrequency cannulas.

### A systematic review of the normal sacroiliac joint anatomy and adjacent tissues for pain physicians [^115NoXxC]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) forms a complex joint and has shown to be underappreciated in its involvement with lower back pain. Research efforts have intensified on SIJ anatomy and biomechanics because of its predisposing position to pain and dysfunction in individuals suffering from lower back discomfort. Previous work has focused on SIJ anatomy including bone and joint structure, innervation, as well as biomechanics and the treatment of SIJ pain. However, to date, no review exists describing the range of 'normal' anatomic features of the SIJ.

Objectives

To describe the normal appearance of the SIJ and adjacent tissues, as opposed to 'abnormal' conditions involving SIJ morphology. It will also identify key areas that require further study because of lacking information or disagreement.

Study Design

A systematic literature review.

Setting

The research took place at the University of Otago, New Zealand. All published research on 'normal SIJ anatomy' available from MEDLINE, OVID, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct were included, available until December 2018, in English, French, and German. Subject areas included bony landmarks, joint type, bone morphology, ligamentous attachments, muscular and fascial relationships, blood supply, fatty infiltration, and morphologic variation.

Methods

Articles met the selection criteria if they contained specific information on SIJ anatomy, including bone morphology and architecture, ligaments, muscle attachments, innervation, vasculature, and the presence of fat. Biomechanics and kinematics related keywords were used as the literature often couples these with the anatomy. Keywords of individual articles were named as 'structures of interest'.
Results

A total of 88 primary and 101 secondary articles were identified in the time frame from 1851 to 2018. Primary articles provided quantitative data and detailed anatomic descriptions. Secondary articles did not focus specifically on the anatomy of the SIJ. Although research appeared to be in general agreement on bony landmarks, joint type, myofascial attachments, vasculature, and innervation of the SIJ, there was only part consensus on ligament attachments and cartilage structure. Information regarding bone density of the articulating surfaces of the SIJ is lacking. Despite its potential clinical significance, fatty infiltration within the joint lacks research to date.

Limitations

Only the given databases were used for the initial search. Keyword combinations used for this review may not have been inclusive of all articles relevant to the SIJ. Work in languages other than the ones listed or work that is not available via the internet may be missing.

Conclusions

This study provides an overview of normal SIJ structures, including all neuromusculoskeletal elements related to the joint. There is a lack of knowledge on the SIJ ligaments warranting further investigation. Furthermore, there are discrepancies in relation to the nomenclature, layers, attachment sites, and on the topographical relationships between ligamentous tissues and nerves. Subsequent studies on the quantification of fat and bone density in the SIJ have been suggested. These could be useful radiologic parameters to assess the condition of the joint clinically. This review may provide insight into the clinical signs and abnormal biomechanical features of the joint for the purposes of treating SIJ pain.

Key Words

Bone density, bony landmarks, fat infiltration, innervation, ligaments morphology, muscles, sacroiliac joint, vasculature.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is among the most common human health problems, with a global point prevalence of 9.4%, yearly prevalence of 38%, and accounting for half of years lived with disability (YLD) due to a musculoskeletal disorder worldwide. Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a complex biopsychosocial condition in which recurrent back pain with or without clear pathology leads to chronic pain, physical dysfunction, social isolation, and/or mood changes. It is challenging to treat a nonspecific condition and even more difficult to treat symptoms without an accurate diagnosis to allow for source control.

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a large, irregularly shaped, serpentine joint structure bordered anteriorly and posteriorly by the sacroiliac ligaments. The joint itself is about two-thirds synovial and one-third ligamentous, with the synovial portion extending anteroinferiorly and reinforced at its posterosuperior aspect by syndesmotic ligament. The form of the SIJ begets its function – it is intended for stability, with a sacral concave depression interlocking with a corresponding iliac osseous ridge. This construct is further reinforced extra-articularly by the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments. The SIJ complex is part of the kinetic chain connecting the spine and lower extremities, and may be a primary or secondary pain generator depending on the clinical scenario and should be examined routinely in the evaluation of back or leg complaints. The SIJ is particularly enigmatic in its ability to mimic hip and lumbar spine pathology and also to result from the surgical treatment of hip and spine issues. Yoshihara proposes that misdiagnosed sacroiliac syndrome occurs commonly, such that some patients may undergo unnecessary lumbar fusion. This highlights the importance of educating clinicians on the SIJ, as the treatment option landscape has evolved to become significantly less invasive, and the accurate diagnosis and treatment of LBP is paramount.

The SIJ has been estimated in a number of series to contribute to pain in 10–38% of cases of LBP. The early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of LBP is critical to mitigating conversion to cLBP and high-impact pain states that are managed as chronic disease. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnostic and treatment algorithm for symptomatic SIJ dysfunction in the patient presenting with low back pain.

### Anatomic parameters for instrumentation of the sacrum and pelvis: a systematic review of the literature [^112zCbys]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Multiple cadaver and radiographic analyses have been performed to define the surgical anatomy of the sacrum and pelvis. We provide a comprehensive review of this information, creating an accurate anatomic guide for practice and research.

Methods

A systematic review was performed to identify publications citing sacral or iliac morphometric parameters based on cadaver or radiographic anatomy.

Results

A total of 780 abstracts were evaluated. Fifty-six articles were included for final review and grouped into four sections: (1) bone density, (2) bony corridors, (3) screw length and trajectory, and (4) neurovascular and alimentary anatomy.

Conclusion

A systematic analysis of the radiographic and gross anatomic features of the sacrum has yet to be published. This review includes details on the spatial arrangement of the S1 and S2 pedicle screws, sacroiliac screws, iliac screws, S2 alar iliac screws, and pelvic neurovascular anatomy. The study can be referenced by clinicians for sacral dissection, implant application, and ongoing advances in orthopaedic research.

### The sacroiliac joint: anatomy, physiology and clinical significance [^115edRHn]. Pain Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a putative source of low back pain. The objective of this article is to provide clinicians with a concise review of SIJ structure and function, diagnostic indicators of SIJ-mediated pain, and therapeutic considerations. The SIJ is a true diarthrodial joint with unique characteristics not typically found in other diarthrodial joints. The joint differs with others in that it has fibrocartilage in addition to hyaline cartilage, there is discontinuity of the posterior capsule, and articular surfaces have many ridges and depressions. The sacroiliac joint is well innervated. Histological analysis of the sacroiliac joint has verified the presence of nerve fibers within the joint capsule and adjoining ligaments. It has been variously described that the sacroiliac joint receives its innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, the superior gluteal nerve, and the dorsal rami of L5, S1, and S2, or that it is almost exclusively derived from the sacral dorsal rami. Even though the sacroiliac joint is a known putative source of low back and lower extremity pain, there are few findings that are pathognomonic of sacroiliac joint pain. The controlled diagnostic blocks utilizing the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria demonstrated the prevalence of pain of sacroiliac joint origin in 19% to 30% of the patients suspected to have sacroiliac joint pain. Conservative management includes manual medicine techniques, pelvic stabilization exercises to allow dynamic postural control, and muscle balancing of the trunk and lower extremities. Interventional treatments include sacroiliac joint, intra-articular joint injections, radiofrequency neurotomy, prolotherapy, cryotherapy, and surgical treatment. The evidence for intra-articular injections and radiofrequency neurotomy has been shown to be limited in managing sacroiliac joint pain.

(c) Exaggeration of sacral movement in nutation and counternutation. Original medical illustration by Kamil Sochacki, DO.

It is important to note that significant axial compressive/shear force and torsion can lead to SIJ dysfunction and pain complaints. Specifically, this is more pronounced when forces are applied in a unidirectional and asymmetric manner, which can disrupt overall joint stability and lead to ligamentous strain. The ligaments which contribute most to this stability include the iliolumbar, posterior SI, interosseous, sacrotuberous, and sacrospinous ligaments.

Best Practice Statement on SI Anatomy

It is recommended that clinicians should have a thorough understanding of the anatomy and biomechanics of the SIJ.

Diagnosis

SIDs comprise various more discrete pathologies, which include SIJ dysfunction, sacroiliitis, and SIJ arthropathy, all of which can occur independently or collectively. Given the varying pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these different entities and because of the plethora of non-SID diagnoses that can also cause chronic low back pain, the specific and reliable diagnosis of SID can be challenging. However, a nuanced appreciation of SIJ anatomy and biomechanics along with the collective utilization of the patient history, physical examination with provocative maneuvers, imaging modalities, and anesthetic blocks can facilitate the diagnosis of SID.

### MRI-based synthetic CT for assessment of the bony elements of the sacroiliac joints in children [^1164deKQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis/image assessment/definitions

CT and sCT were reconstructed in a paracoronal plane (parallel to the dorsal cortex of the S2 vertebral body) a true axial and a true sagittal plane, all with a slice thickness of 1 mm. Two radiologists (N.H. and E.S.) with 18 and 10 years of experience respectively, independently reviewed sCT and CT images. For the measurements, sCT and CT images were mixed and displayed in random order. Readers were blinded to clinical and demographic findings. Definitions were first defined in consensus on 5 other sCT and 5 other CT scans of pediatric patients, not included in the study because they did not have paired data.

Overall image quality, presence of lumbosacral transitional anomaly, and fusion of sacral vertebral growth plates at levels S1/S2 and S2/S3 were scored. Cortical delineation of the joint space at both iliac and sacral sides, presence of joint facet defects, ossified nuclei, and bony bridges were scored (Table 1). Quantitative analysis was performed by measuring the maximal diagonal width and height of the S1 and S2 vertebral bodies and the maximum height of the disc space at levels L5–S1, both on a midsagittal plane. The maximum width of the spinal canal at levels L5–S1 was measured in the axial plane (Table 2). Prior to quantitative analysis, the two readers reached a consensus on measurement methodology.

In order to investigate the intra-reader reliability, 1 reader (E.S.) repeated the measurements 1 month later (a delay added to avoid recall bias).

Statistical analysis

An agreement between sCT and CT for the categorical measures was determined by Cohen's kappa. Confusion matrices were generated for CT as the gold standard. For the continuous measures, differences between methods were analyzed with Bland–Altman plots and equivalence analyses. An equivalency design was chosen to prove whether the outcomes did not differ by more than a clinically or scientifically meaningful threshold. For the equivalence analyses, the equivalence margin was set to 1 mm, which represents 1 voxel of a typical high-resolution CT scan.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^113BdY3n]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) has been estimated to contribute to pain in as much as 38% of cases of lower back pain. There are no clear diagnostic or treatment pathways. This article seeks to establish a clearer pathway and algorithm for treating patients.

Methods

The literature was reviewed in order to review the biomechanics, as well as establish the various diagnostic and treatment options. Diagnostic factors addressed include etiology, history, physical exam, and imaging studies. Treatment options reviewed include conservative measures, as well as interventional and surgical options.

Results

Proposed criteria for diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction can include pain in the area of the sacroiliac joint, reproducible pain with provocative maneuvers, and pain relief with a local anesthetic injection into the SIJ. Conventional non-surgical therapies such as medications, physical therapy, radiofrequency denervation, and direct SI joint injections may have some limited durability in therapeutic benefit. Surgical fixation can be by a lateral or posterior/posterior oblique approach with the literature supporting minimally invasive options for improving pain and function and maintaining a low adverse event profile.

Conclusion

SIJ pain is felt to be an underdiagnosed and undertreated element of LBP. There is an emerging disconnect between the growing incidence of diagnosed SI pathology and underwhelming treatment efficacy of medical treatment. This has led to an increase in SI joint fixation. We have created a clearer diagnostic and treatment pathway to establish an algorithm for patients that can include conservative measures and interventional techniques once the diagnosis is identified.

### Sacroiliac joint syndrome [^1159DkvJ]. Pain Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The sacroiliac joint has long been considered to be a potential source of low back and/or buttock pain with or without lower extremity symptoms. Until recently, supportive evidence for this disorder has been empirical as it was solely derived from information garnered from patients who obtained successful treatment for a constellation of signs, symptoms and examination findings believed to be indicative of sacroiliac joint syndrome. Due to this fallacious reasoning, successful treatment denotes a correct diagnosis; many of the concepts espoused during the past few decades have been predicated upon spurious data. With the advent of and systematic utilization of fluoroscopically guided diagnostic sacroiliac joint blockade specific epidemiologic, symptomatic, examination, diagnostic, and outcome data have been derived. This review describes current concepts and provides information that expounds and, in some instances, supplants prior held notions about this disorder.

### Sacroiliac joint pain after lumbar / lumbosacral fusion: current knowledge [^115acDyp]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) has gained increased attention as a source of persistent or new pain after lumbar/lumbosacral fusion. The underlying pathophysiology of SIJ pain may be increased mechanical load, iliac crest bone grafting, or a misdiagnosis of SIJ syndrome. Imaging studies show more frequent degeneration of the SIJ in patients with lumbar/lumbosacral fusion than in patients without such fusion. Using injection tests, it has been shown that SIJ pain is the cause of persistent symptoms in a considerable number of patients after fusion surgery. Recent articles reporting on surgical outcomes of SIJ fusion include a high percentage of patients who had lumbar/lumbosacral fusion or surgery before, although well-controlled clinical studies are necessary to assess the efficacy of surgical treatment. Taking these findings into consideration, the possibility that the SIJ is the source of pain should be considered in patients with failed back surgery syndrome after lumbar/lumbosacral fusion.

### Anatomic parameters for instrumentation of the sacrum and pelvis: a systematic review of the literature [^114czpcE]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Neurologic Structures

The five sacral nerve roots, the lumbosacral plexus, and the sympathetic trunk are at risk with instrumentation of the sacrum. Five sacral nerve roots exist, which descend from the conus medullaris. The first four exit through the foramina, and the fifth exits between the sacrum and the coccyx. These spinal nerves course from the dorsal root ganglia and branch into the ventral and dorsal rami. All major motor nerve roots exit ventrally with only sensory cutaneous nerves exiting dorsally.

The lumbosacral trunk (L4-L5) joins the sacral plexus anterior to the piriformis muscle to form the sciatic nerve. The fourth lumbar nerve root courses medial to the psoas muscle and crosses just superior to the first sacral foramen to join the fifth lumbar nerve root, which traverses laterally to join it. The location of the fifth lumbar nerve root can be variable and occurs either laterally on the ala near the SI joint or medially over the S1 pedicle. It is typically lateral to the internal iliac vein. The lumbosacral trunk is the closest anatomic structure to the sacrum, passing just 0.1 mm off of the anterior surface periosteum.

### Comparison of quadrapolar ™ radiofrequency lesions produced by standard versus modified technique: an experimental model [^116QU7Cp]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lower back pain (LBP) is defined as any back pain from the ribs to proximal thigh.LBP is a global public health issue and is associated with substantial financial costs and loss of quality of life.–In different age groups, the pathology of different structures are responsible for LBP. In adults, aged < 45 years, LBP is the most common cause of activity limitations and LBP, after arthritis, is the second most common cause of activity limitations in individuals aged 45–65 years old. One well-known cause of LBP is sacroiliac (SI) joint pain.SI joint pain is responsible for LBP in 18%–30% of individuals.

The SI joint plays an important role in load transfer between the spine and lower extremities. The innervation of the SI joint is not well understood. It has been reported that the joint receives innervation from the L4, L5 (L5DR), and the S1-to-S3 dorsal rami along with contributions from S4.–Others have reported that the SI joint receives innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, the dorsal rami of L5, S1, and S2. Variability exists between individuals in the path of the sacral lateral branches leaving the posterior foramina. These sacral lateral branches may travel along the surface of the sacrum or run distally into the posterior ligaments. Findings from immunohistological studies indicate that nociceptors are present throughout the joint capsule and ligaments. Nociceptors are also present throughout the subchondral bone; however, to a lesser extent.SI joint pain is often caused by ligament laxity or asymmetric laxity.

### American Society of Pain and Neuroscience best practice (ASPN) guideline for the treatment of sacroiliac disorders [^111jChQZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Relevant Anatomy

The SIJ is the largest axial joint in the human body and is diarthrodial in nature. Specifically, there are two bony surfaces of the joint, the sacrum and the ilium. The joint space is approximately 1–2 millimeters wide and is largely limited to the anterior third of the sacral–iliac interface, whereby synovium exists. The remaining two-thirds of the joint is comprised primarily of ligamentous tissue, including the ventral, interosseous, and iliolumbar ligaments, which contribute to overall stability by limiting movement. Stability is also due to discontinuity of the posterior capsule, which has many ridges and depressions that serve to limit movement of the joint. Unique to the SIJ is the existence of both hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage.

The innervation of the SIJ has yet to be clearly defined; however, several nerves have been implicated in signaling pain from the SIJ. The posterior SIJ, which is a common location of pain, has been thought to receive innervation from the lateral branches of the L4 to S3 dorsal rami nerve roots; however, the L3 and S4 dorsal rani nerve roots have also been considered. In addition, minor innervation may come from the superior gluteal nerve. Although ventral rami nerve roots may also have a contribution, this is thought to be relatively minor and clinically unimportant. In contrast to the posterior aspect, the anterior SIJ is thought to be innervated by the lateral branches of the L2 to S2 ventral rami nerve roots; however, some have also suggested a lack of innervation to this area.

The bony anatomy of the SIJ can vary between individuals and drastically changes with age. The sacral aspect of the joint is generally concave whereas the iliac component is convex. With age, this iliac surface can degenerate and become rough in texture. In contrast, the sacral surface, which already has a rough and irregular surface, can also undergo similar degenerative changes; however, these occur many years after iliac degeneration has begun. With age, the joint space also decreases and becomes a less effective shock absorber; however, age-related autofusion does not typically occur.

Sacroiliac Radiofrequency Ablation

Sacroiliac regional pain syndrome (SIRP) is a pain condition that is characterized by a localized pain below the posterior superior iliac spine and the buttock region. The pain arises from the densely innervated joint, joint capsule and the ligamentous structures in the posterior and the anterior aspects of the joint. The prevalence of the SIRP pain depends on age of the patient, typically increasing with age, as the mechanics shift the weight from the anterior elements to the posterior elements. There is also a higher incidence in patients who have undergone adjacent segment fusion at the lumbosacral level. The importance of understanding the SIRP condition is that it accounts for many instances of lower back and buttock pain currently treated by the primary care providers and specialists.

Because of the transient and inconsistent results of sacroiliac injections (with local anesthetics, steroids) and prolotherapy, more definitive treatments have been sought. Since the advent of radiofrequency neurotomy, multiple authors have deployed a variety of different approaches to denervate the joint. There has been variability historically in outcomes attributable to patient selection, target selection, and procedural technique.

Pathophysiology and Innervation of the Sacroiliac Region

The SIJ is a 1–2 mm wide diarthrodial joint with an articular cartilage, synovial fluid, and a fibrous capsule. The joint has a strong ligamentous support structure that serves to stabilize the joint. The joint still has motion in two planes. The innervation of the intra-articular portion of the joint has been vigorously contested over the years. It appears that anteriorly, there is innervation from the lumbosacral trunks, obturator nerve, and gluteal nerves, and posteriorly from the lateral branches of the S1-S3 dorsal rami. Historically, there was a belief that there is also innervation from the L4 medial branch and the L5 dorsal ramus. Sacroiliac joint complex pain emanates from the extra-articular elements in addition to or separate from the intra-articular portion of the joint. This complex includes the articular portion of the joint, the joint capsule, overlaying dorsal ligaments, regional muscles, and nerves that supply these structures.

### The anatomy of the lateral branches of the sacral dorsal rami: implications for radiofrequency ablation [^111Ppfnv]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a major source of pain in patients with chronic low back pain. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the lateral branches of the dorsal sacral rami that supply the joint is a treatment option gaining considerable attention. However, the position of the lateral branches (commonly targeted with RFA) is variable and the segmental innervation to the SIJ is not well understood.

Objectives

Our objective was to clarify the lateral branches' innervation of the SIJ and their specific locations in relation to the dorsal sacral foramina, which are the standard RFA landmark.

Methods

Dissections and photography of the L5 to S4 sacral dorsal rami were performed on 12 hemipelves from 9 donated cadaveric specimens.

Results

There was a broad range of exit points from the dorsal sacral foramina: ranging from 12:00–6:00 position on the right side and 6:00–12:00 on the left positions. Nine of 12 of the hemipelves showed anastomosing branches from L5 dorsal rami to the S1 lateral plexus.

Limitations

The limitations of this study include the use of a posterior approach to the pelvic dissection only, thus discounting any possible nerve contribution to the anterior aspect of the SIJ, as well as the possible destruction of some L5 or sacral dorsal rami branches with the removal of the ligaments and muscles of the low back.

Conclusion

Widespread variability of lateral branch exit points from the dorsal sacral foramen and possible contributions from L5 dorsal rami and superior gluteal nerve were disclosed by the current study. Hence, SIJ RFA treatment approaches need to incorporate techniques which address the diverse SIJ innervation.

Gaenslen's Maneuver

Provocation testing is continued with the patient positioned back to supine and the affected side pelvis laterally displaced toward the edge of the exam table. The patient is asked to maximally flex the unaffected side hip and knee and hold that position using their hands. The examiner will then drape the affected side leg over the side of the examination table moving the hip into an extended position. The examiner will stabilize the flexed extremity with one hand while simultaneously provided gentle downward pressure on the anterior aspect of the extended thigh. The test is positive when the patient's pain is reproduced.

Common Etiologies and Risk Factors

Sacroiliac joint dysfunction and the common etiologies to consider are best identified by an appreciation for the anatomy. With the sacroiliac joint largely being innervated by L4-S3 for nociception, along with intra and extra-articular sources of dysfunction: muscular irritation, capsular disruption, shearing, fractures, infection, and arthritis. These etiologies can be acute or repetitive in nature. Historic risk factors and associations include scoliosis, lumbar fusion, pregnancy, seronegative HLA-B27 spondyloarthropathies, repetitive athletic activity, and leg length discrepancies. Hyperparathyroidism and repetitive shear-stress injuries in athletes can cause sacroiliitis-like changes of the joint.

Perhaps the two most common risk factors for developing SIJ dysfunction are history of pregnancy and history of a prior lumbar surgery. The joint can become painful during pregnancy as it widens and develops increased motion. This can lead to further pathology overtime. It has also been shown that multilevel lumbar surgery and fusion may yield higher incidence of SIJ pain as compared to discectomy alone.

Diagnostic lumbar facet joint blocks — technique and validity evidence — are described as controlled diagnostic blocks that "can be performed by anesthetizing the joint via injection of local anesthetics intraarticularly or in close proximity to the medial branches of the dorsal rami", with rationale that "lumbar facet joints are capable of causing pain" and "Facet joints have been shown to be a source of pain in patients using diagnostic techniques of known reliability and validity". Face validity "has been established by injecting small volumes of local anesthetic and contrast material onto the target points… and by determining the spread of contrast medium in the posteroanterior and lateral radiographs". Construct validity emphasizes eliminating placebo effects, and "testing a patient first with lidocaine and subsequently with bupivacaine" has "been tested and proven". The "specificity of the effect of lumbar facet joint blocks was demonstrated in controlled trials", whereas "Provocation response of facet joint pain was shown to be unreliable in one study". Despite debates, "controlled local anesthetic blocks continue to be the best available tool to identify intervertebral disc(s), facet joint(s), or sacroiliac joint(s) as the source of low back pain", though "these reference standards are invasive, expensive, and often difficult to interpret… and therefore may not be suitable for routine clinical use as a primary diagnostic modality".

Diagnostic Injection

It can be challenging to make an exact diagnosis of SIJ pain due to the fact that there is no pathognomonic clinical history, physical examination, or radiological evidence for SIJ dysfunction. Furthermore, symptoms may be the result of other common spinal conditions, such as lumbosacral facet syndrome, disc herniation, or proximal L5 nerve pathology. With no evidence to support any single provocative SIJ maneuver or diagnostic imaging modality as pathognomonic for SIJ pain, intra-articular SIJ blocks utilizing local anesthetics with or without steroids have evolved as the diagnostic standard.

Historically, SIJ injections were performed without image guidance and based solely on palpation techniques. In a single-site study, blind SIJ injections were initially performed and then needle placement was confirmed with fluoroscopy. Accurate placement of SIJ injection was found to be successful in only 12% of injections when performed blind. Fluoroscopic guidance has been shown to be more accurate than ultrasound guided (98.2% vs 87.3%), although both means are reliable methods of infiltrating the SIJ. The main limitation with ultrasound-guided SIJ injections is the lack of ability to visualize an arthrogram as one would on fluoroscopy. CT-guided injections have also been identified to allow for intra-articular injections with reduction in SIJ pain symptoms. However, one study showed accurate needle placement in only 76% of cases. A recent single-site study suggested improved efficacy with CT-guided versus fluoroscopically guided injections in the SIJ. However, limitations and drawbacks of CT-guided SIJ injections include the lack of ability to view contrast in real-time both intra-articularly, as well as contrast extravasation, and the risk of increased radiation exposure.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^112fqnB3]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of SIJ pain is a multifaceted process that involves a careful assessment. The practitioner must first focus on the history, observe the gait pattern, and perform the key points of the physical exam including provocative maneuvers. A thorough review of the imaging should be performed. SIJ diagnostic blocks will confirm the diagnosis. It is essential to rule out other concomitant pathologies. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, long-term solutions may exist, such as SIJ ablation, or posterior or lateral SIJ fusion. In addition, long-term spinal comorbidities often accompany SIJ dysfunction and should be reassessed frequently in those who suffer from other pain pathologies.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^112ZBXRJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The nerve supply of the SIJ complex has been described posteriorly by the lateral branches of the S1–S3 dorsal rami (with some fibers of the L4 and L5 dorsal rami) while the anterior aspect is supplied by branches of the lumbosacral trunk and the obturator and superior gluteal nerves. Limited success with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation has been attributed to not just the course variability of the innervating nerves, but also that innervation of the joint complex is very variable. Being that the anterior and posterior compartments of the SIJ joint complex have their own individual varying nerve supply, radiofrequency neurotomy of the posterior nerves may not provide complete relief of the painful presentation.

Neuromodulation

During the past few decades, spinal cord and peripheral nerve stimulation have increasingly been used to treat chronic pain and recent studies have shown that subcutaneous stimulation and sacral nerve root stimulation may be successful in treating SIJ pain and coccygodynia, respectively. However, more studies are needed for neuromodulation to be a primary therapy for painful SIJ syndromes.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^113QpYZ8]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain — sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SJD) surgical question 12 asks whether sacroiliac joint fusion compared with medical/interventional treatment decreases pain duration and intensity, increases functional outcomes, and improves return-to-work in patients with low back pain (LBP). A systematic review "yielded no studies to adequately address this question", and because "this review examined only evidence in the subset of patients without prior lumbar surgery and without pain below the knee" while "additional literature comparing surgical treatment to medical/interventional treatment including patients with prior lumbar surgery or pain below the knee were not included", "a definitive statement favoring sacroiliac fusion over medical/interventional treatment in patients suffering with LBP from an SI source cannot be made". For future research, "the work group recommends additional randomized controlled trials (non-industry funded) to confirm the superiority of surgical treatment for SJD in patients failing medical/interventional treatment".

### Sacroiliac joint dysfunction: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^112SDz1e]. European Spine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review the anatomy and function of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ), as well as the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and treatment options for SIJ dysfunction.

Methods

The SIJ serves an extremely crucial function in mobility, stability, and resistance against shear forces. Joint mobility becomes increasingly limited with age-related cartilaginous changes that begin in puberty and continue throughout life. Pain can also be localized to the SIJ itself, known as SIJ dysfunction. A literature review was performed on the anatomy, etiology, risk factors, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options for SIJ dysfunction.

Results

SIJ dysfunction is an under-recognized source of low back pain. Dysfunction can result from various clinical conditions, as well as abnormal motion or malalignment of the joint. Diagnosis and evaluation of SIJ dysfunction are difficult, with use of physical maneuvers and image-guided anesthetic injection. Non-operative treatment options are considered first-line due to high surgical complication rates. Such options include conservative management, radiofrequency treatment, nerve blocks, and articular injections. Surgical management involves open and percutaneous approaches.

Conclusion

With the aging nature of the population, SIJ dysfunction has emerged as an extremely prevalent issue. Current research into the pathophysiology and risk factors of SIJ dysfunction is extremely important for planning preventative and therapeutic strategies. Various treatment options exist including conservative management, radiofrequency, nerve blocks, intra-articular or peri-articular injections, and surgical fixation. Improved diagnostic methods in clinical practice are thus critical to properly identify patients suffering from SIJ dysfunction, plan early intervention, and hasten return to function.

Sacroiliac (SI) joint pain is a challenging condition affecting 15% to 25% of patients with axial low back pain, for which there is no standard long-term treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that historical and physical examination findings and radiological imaging are insufficient to diagnose SI joint pain. The most commonly used method to diagnose the SI joint as a pain generator is with small-volume local anesthetic blocks, although the validity of this practice remains unproven. In the present review I provide a comprehensive review of the anatomy, function, and mechanisms of injury of the SI joint, along with a systematic assessment of its diagnosis and treatment.

Compared to the inferior joint approach, cranial tilt and a great degree of obliquity is required. The obliquity is performed until the anterior and posterior sacroiliac joint lines intersect at the midbody of the joint.

Histological analysis of the sacroiliac joint has verified the presence of nerve fibers within the joint capsule and adjoining ligaments. The sacroiliac joint receives its innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, the superior gluteal nerve and the dorsal rami of L5, S1, and S2. Sacral lateral branch nerve blocks have been more recently utilized in part to address pain from the posterior sacroiliac structures, which includes both the posterior joint itself as well as the various ligaments. There is, however, additional ventral innervation of the sacroiliac joint that is typically inaccessible for blocks or denervation. As a result, the use of sacral lateral branch nerve blocks is exclusively used to prognosticate response to radiofrequency neurotomy, and not diagnostic for sacroiliac joint dysfunction. There is no available literature that evaluates its ability to be used as a screening test for more definitive surgical procedures such as sacroiliac fusion.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114msiYM]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar facet joint pain — anatomic basis and experimental evidence identify facet joints as pain generators. Lumbar facet joints are pairs of joints that stabilize and guide motion in the spine, and controlled studies have established intervertebral discs, facet joints, and sacroiliac joints as potential sources of low back and lower extremity pain. Thus, lumbar facet joints are a well recognized source of low back and referred pain in the lower extremity in patients with chronic low back pain, and facet joints are well innervated by the medial branches of the dorsal rami. Neuroanatomic, neurophysiologic, and biomechanical studies have demonstrated free and encapsulated nerve endings in lumbar facet joints, as well as nerves containing substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Experimental models show both mechanical injury and inflammation of the facet joint produce persistent pain in otherwise normal rats, and mechanical injury of the facet joint increases cytokine messenger RNA in the dorsal root ganglion.

Vascular Structures

Aortic bifurcation into the common iliac arteries occurs left of the midline at the lower level of the L4 vertebrae. The average distance of the bifurcation from the L5/S1 disc is 18 mm. The angle subtended by the bifurcation is 46°, with the left common iliac being 10° more vertical than the right. At the level of S1, the two vessels average 43 mm apart.

The MSA is 2 to 3 mm in diameter. It originates 4 cm proximal to the aortic bifurcation and travels inferiorly, remaining near the midline. The MSA terminates into an anastomosis with the lateral sacral arteries, ultimately providing arterial branches to the ventral sacral foramina. Although consistently present, its course relative to the midline is highly variable. The MSA may be to the right or to the left of the midline by < 3 cm and thus is a poor anatomic landmark.

Distal to the aortic bifurcation, the right and left common iliac arteries travel in an inferolateral direction and branch into the internal and external iliac arteries. The right common iliac artery is 22 mm in diameter. It crosses the right common iliac vein and bifurcates anterior and lateral to the vein at the level of the L5-S1 disc. The left common iliac artery travels anterior and lateral but parallel to the vein. The distance from the anterior sacrum to the internal iliac artery averages 11 mm.

Other smaller arterial branches include the iliolumbar artery and the lateral sacral artery. The iliolumbar artery is the first branch of the internal iliac artery and travels cranially, posteriorly, and laterally across the superior aspect of the SI joint. The lateral sacral artery is the second branch of the internal iliac artery at the level of S1–2 and is approximately 30 mm from the midline.

Abstract

Clinical management of sacroiliac disease has proven challenging from both diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives. Although it is widely regarded as a common source of low back pain, little consensus exists on the appropriate clinical management of sacroiliac joint pain and dysfunction. Understanding the biomechanics, innervation, and function of this complex load bearing joint is critical to formulating appropriate treatment algorithms for SI joint disorders. ASPN has developed this comprehensive practice guideline to serve as a foundational reference on the appropriate management of SI joint disorders utilizing the best available evidence and serve as a foundational guide for the treatment of adult patients in the United States and globally.

### Pulsed radiofrequency denervation for the treatment of sacroiliac joint syndrome [^116TEdaH]. Pain Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Current therapies for sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction offer discouraging results in alleviating low back pain. The innervation and target nerves for radiofrequency denervation (RFD) of the SIJ remain unclear. We present a prospective case series on the treatment of intractable SIJ dysfunction with pulsed radiofrequency denervation (PRFD) of lateral branches from L4-S3.

Interventions

A total of 126 patients with presumptive SIJ dysfunction based on history and physical examination underwent arthrographically confirmed steroid/local anesthetic SIJ injection. Fifty-two patients (41.3%) had > 75% pain relief after two consecutive injections, physical therapy, repeated SIJ injections, and/or analgesics. Twenty-two patients failed to respond. These patients underwent PRFD of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1 and S2.

Outcome Measures

Visual analog score (VAS) and quality of life (QOL) assessments were performed prior to and after treatment.

Results

Sixteen patients (72.7%) experienced "Good" (> 50% reduction in VAS), or "Excellent" (> 80% reduction in VAS) pain relief following PRFD. Duration of pain relief range was 6–9 weeks in four patients, 10–16 weeks in five patients, and 17–32 weeks in seven patients. In addition, QOL scores improved significantly in all measured categories. Six patients (26.1%) did not respond to PRFD and had less than 50% reduction in VAS and were considered failures.

Conclusions

PRFD of the lateral branch of the medial branch of L4, posterior primary rami of L5, and lateral branches S1 and S2 is an effective treatment for some patients with SIJ pain unresponsive to other forms of therapy.

### Randomized placebo-controlled study evaluating lateral branch radiofrequency denervation for sacroiliac joint pain [^115L9Fjk]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac joint pain is a challenging condition accounting for approximately 20% of cases of chronic low back pain. Currently, there are no effective long-term treatment options for sacroiliac joint pain.

Methods

A randomized placebo-controlled study was conducted in 28 patients with injection-diagnosed sacroiliac joint pain. Fourteen patients received L4-L5 primary dorsal rami and S1-S3 lateral branch radiofrequency denervation using cooling-probe technology after a local anesthetic block, and 14 patients received the local anesthetic block followed by placebo denervation. Patients who did not respond to placebo injections crossed over and were treated with radiofrequency denervation using conventional technology.

Results

One, 3, and 6 months after the procedure, 11 (79%), 9 (64%), and 8 (57%) radiofrequency-treated patients experienced pain relief of 50% or greater and significant functional improvement. In contrast, only 2 patients (14%) in the placebo group experienced significant improvement at their 1-month follow-up, and none experienced benefit 3 months after the procedure. In the crossover group (n = 11), 7 (64%), 6 (55%), and 4 (36%) experienced improvement 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure. One year after treatment, only 2 patients (14%) in the treatment group continued to demonstrate persistent pain relief.

Conclusions

These results provide preliminary evidence that L4 and L5 primary dorsal rami and S1-S3 lateral branch radiofrequency denervation may provide intermediate-term pain relief and functional benefit in selected patients with suspected sacroiliac joint pain. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results and to determine the optimal candidates and treatment parameters for this poorly understood disorder.

### Classification vs diagnostic criteria: the challenge of diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis [^115gMFfQ]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conventional radiography of sacroiliac joints (Fig. 4A) showed suspicious changes in the right sacroiliac joint – subchondral sclerosis and no clearly visible joint space in the upper portion of the joint that can be potentially related to true bony ankylosis as a manifestation of SpA but can also represent degenerative changes – a bulky osteophyte or a capsule ossification mimicking true ankylosis. MRI-STIR (Fig. 4B) showed no active inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints, but some bone marrow oedema in the vertebral bodies L5 and S1. MRI-T1 (Fig. 4C) showed no SpA compatible structural changes, but: (i) ossification of the capsule in the right sacroiliac joint that was responsible for the ankylosis-like appearance of the joint on the conventional radiography, and (ii) degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc L5/S1 with fatty metaplasia of the bone marrow of L5 and S1 vertebrae – degenerative changes compatible with the Modic type II lesion. Bone marrow oedema visible on STIR has, therefore, also degenerative origin. In this case, the presence of uveitis, HLA-B27, and inflammatory back pain is overweighed by the absence of SpA typical changes on imaging and – even more importantly – by the presence of degenerative changes explaining long-lasting back pain (Fig. 4D). Of note, an inappropriate application of the ASAS classification criteria instead of the diagnostic approach in this case would have resulted in a conclusion of the presence of axial SpA due to the presence of chronic back pain that started before 45 years of age, HLA-B27-positivity, presence of inflammatory back pain and acute anterior uveitis. 4

HLA-B27 is positive, CRP is normal. Conventional radiography of sacroiliac joints showed suspicious changes, but no SpA-compatible changes could be found on MRI. At the same time, degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc represent the most likely explanation of back pain in this case. See the article text for further details.

3. Palpation

Surface anatomy of the posterior aspect of the spine is best appreciated with the patient standing. It is important to palpate specific structures. The point of maximal tenderness should be correlated with the underlying bone or soft tissue anatomy. Palpate over the spinous processes, facet joints, paraspinal muscles, sacroiliac joints, gluteal muscles, posterior superior iliac spines, posterior iliac crest, ischial tuberosities and greater trochanters.

Surface anatomy of the anterior aspect of the spine is best appreciated with the patient supine with the knees bent to relax the abdominal muscles. The vertebral bodies of L4, L5 and S1 are palpable just below the umbilicus. The anterior abdominal muscles are best palpated with the patient performing a partial sit-up.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^115ZHv1P]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Imaging

Although helpful, but not definitive for the diagnosis of a pain generator, it is important to obtain imaging of the SIJ to rule out red flags such as fracture, malignancy, or infection. Initial imaging should include lumbar and pelvis X-ray with anterior/posterior, oblique, and lateral views. These images can help rule out other sources of LBP which may masquerade as SIJ pain, including hip osteoarthritis, lumbosacral spondylosis, and spondylolisthesis. The timing of imaging varies greatly on patient presentation and the presence of any "red flag" symptoms. Typically, pain that has been present for less than 6 weeks does not need to be imaged. If pain is present for longer than six weeks, imaging should be considered. In addition, if interventional therapy is planned, plain films should be obtained prior to injection. MRI of the lumbar spine to rule out neural compression, especially of the L5 nerve root may be helpful. The SIJ can be difficult to profile on radiographs, and clear evidence of structural lesions involving the joint may or may not be identifiable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often recommended for the diagnosis of sacroiliitis related to HLA-B27 seronegative spondyloarthropathies (Psoriasis arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, Inflammatory bowel disease with associated arthritis, and Reactive arthritis) due to its high sensitivity and ability to visualize bone marrow and SIJ edema (Figure 7).SIJ pain due to non-inflammatory arthropathy typically has little findings on advanced imaging, but can show joint space narrowing, osteophytes and sclerosis (Figure 8).

Sacroiliac joint pain — diagnosis lacks a universally accepted gold standard, and a systematic review suggests that a combination of sacroiliac joint pain provocative maneuvers appears to be useful in pinpointing the sacroiliac joint as the principal source of symptoms in patients with pain below the fifth lumbar vertebra; although a positive bone scan has high specificity, it is associated with a very low sensitivity. A meta-analysis showed that the thigh thrust test, the compression test, and 3 or more positive stressing tests contain sufficient discriminative power for diagnosing sacroiliac joint pain, but in view of the lack of a gold standard, the diagnostic validity of tests for sacroiliac joint pain should be regarded with caution.

Evidence assessment of sacroiliac joint blocks — only one study was performed with a single block with 50% to 74% pain relief and did not assess prevalence; two studies evaluated 50% to 74% relief with dual blocks, with a prevalence rate of 38% with 50% relief and 26.6% using 70% relief. When dual blocks were utilized as the criterion standard, the prevalence rate was 38% with a false-positive rate of 21%, and a large retrospective evaluation found a prevalence rate of 26.6% using 70% pain relief. Across eight studies using a cutoff threshold between 75% and 100% relief following a single block, prevalence ranged from 10% to 62%; 53% and 62% prevalence rates were found in highly selected populations, including one study employing greater than 90% pain relief with pain predominantly below L5, and another using 80% pain relief as the criterion standard.

### The surgical neurovascular anatomy relating to partial and complete sacral and sacroiliac resections: a cadaveric, anatomic study [^113J9QYC]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pelvic and sacral surgeries are considered technically difficult due to the complex multidimensional anatomy and the presence of significant neurovascular structures. Knowledge of the key neurovascular anatomy is essential for safe and effective execution of partial and complete sacral resections. The goal of this anatomic, cadaveric study is to describe the pertinent neurovascular anatomy during these procedures.

Methods

Three embalmed human cadaveric specimens were used. Sacrectomies and sacroiliac joint resections were simulated and the structures at risk were identified. Both anterior and posterior approaches were evaluated.

Results

During sacroiliac joint resection, L5 nerve roots are at high risk for iatrogenic injury; the vasculatures at greatest risk are the common iliac vessels and internal iliac vessels with L5-S1 and S1-S2 high sacrectomies. Minor bleeding risk is associated with S2-S3 osteotomy because of the potential to damage superior gluteal vessels. S3-S4 osteotomy presents a low risk of bleeding. Adjacent nerve roots proximal to the resection level are at high risk during higher sacrectomies.

Conclusions

Several sacrectomy techniques are available and selection often depends on the specific case and surgeon preference; nevertheless, anatomic knowledge is extremely important. Considering the highly variable anatomic relations of the vascular bundles, a preoperative evaluation with CT or MRI with vascular reconstruction may be helpful to decrease bleeding risk by preemptively binding the internal iliac vessels in cases where higher tumors are present. To decrease the risk of damaging nerve roots, it is recommended to perform the resection as close to the involved foramina as possible.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^115KJ3Tv]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is one of the most common causes of low back pain, accounting for 15 to 30% of all cases. Although SIJ dysfunction accounts for a large portion of chronic low back pain prevalence, it is often overlooked or under diagnosed and subsequently under treated. The purpose of this review was to establish a best practices model to effectively diagnose SIJ pain through detailed history, physical exam, review of imaging, and diagnostic block.

Methods

A literature search was performed on the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain and sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The authors proposed diagnostic recommendations based upon the available literature and a detailed understanding of diagnosing SIJ pain.

Results

The practitioner must focus on the history, location of pain, observed gait pattern, and perform key points of the physical exam including sacroiliac provocative maneuvers. If the patient exhibits at least three provocative maneuvers then the SIJ may be considered as a possible source of pain. Additionally, a thorough review of the imaging should be performed to rule out other etiologies of low back pain. In the absence of any pathognomonic tests or examination findings, diagnostic SIJ blocks have evolved as the diagnostic standard.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of SIJ pain is a multifaceted process that involves a careful assessment including differentiating other pain generators in the region. This involves careful history taking, appropriate physical examination including provocative maneuvers and diagnostic injections. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, long-term solutions may be considered, including recent advances in sacral lateral branch denervation and sacroiliac joint fusion.

The sacroiliac joint complex (SIJC) is composed of complex anatomy of numerous potential pain generators that demonstrate varying pathophysiology and differing innervations. This heterogeneity has been a challenge to advancing research and clinical care. Moving forward, individualized approaches taking these factors into account may be a path forward to improved outcomes. Thus, as we move toward precision medicine in interventional spine care, it is imperative to investigate more targeted diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the SIJC.

### Facet dimensions, orientation, and symmetry at L5-S1 junction in lumbosacral transitional States [^114JmeoJ]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Study analyses dimensions, angular orientations, and symmetry of articular facets at the L5-S1 junction associated with transitional anomalies comprising (1) L5-S1 accessory articulations; (2) complete sacralization of the L5 vertebrae; and (3) completely lumbarized S1 sacral segments. Data were compared with same parameters evaluated in normal sacrum.

Objective

Investigating probable morphologic differences in facet joints at the normal and transition affected lumbosacral junctions.

Summary Of Background Data

Facet joints at the L5-S1 play an important role in load sharing and imparting stability at this area as well as are involved in conditions such as isthmic spondylolysis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and osteoarthritis, giving rise to low back pain situations. Several morphologic variations at the lumbosacral junction have been studied and inconsistently alluded to be associated with these painful conditions. Lumbosacral transitional anomalies, on the other hand, have also been linked to low back pain situations. L5-S1 transitions have been shown to be associated with altered L5-S1 articular morphology as well as load-sharing pattern at the region. The analysis of L5-S1 zygapophysial anatomy in context of transitional anomalies at this region has rarely been documented.

Methods

Both the superior articulating facets in the normal as well as in transition associated sacra were measured for (1) height, (2) width, (3) surface area, and (4) angulation of the articular surfaces with reference to the midsagittal plane. Data were also analyzed to find structural asymmetry between the two sides.

Results

Facets demonstrated smallest linear dimensions, surface areas, and maximum coronal orientation in lumbarized specimens. Facets areas associated with accessory articulations were also smaller and coronally oriented. Sacralization induced insignificant alteration in the facet morphology. Asymmetry (tropism) was observed in facets predominantly associated with accessory L5-S1 articulations.

Conclusions

L5-S1 transitions possess altered facet morphology. These alterations are possibly related to low back pain situations.

### "Successful minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion in patients presenting with concomitant sacroiliac joint dysfunction and joint auto fusion" [^113yFKNh]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a common cause of lower back pain, especially in patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery. While spontaneous bony fusion, i.e. auto-fusion, of the sacroiliac joint may provide mechanical stability, the underlying pathophysiology of this disease remains incompletely understood. Here, we present two patients with pre-operative auto-fused joints presenting with sacroiliac joint dysfunction who underwent successful minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion.

Case Presentations

Two patients presented with pre-existing radiologic auto-fusion of their sacroiliac joints with intra-articular injection-proven sacroiliac joint dysfunction refractory to conservative management. Both patients underwent minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion and reported complete and sustained pain relief persisting at one year post-operatively. Radiologic findings confirmed the appropriate placement of fixation hardware without complications.

Discussion

These cases challenge the conventional understanding that bony fusion resolves sacroiliac joint dysfunction by highlighting the potential role of non-mechanical factors, including neural contributions, in driving persistent pain. Neural innervation of the sacroiliac joint, including lateral branches of the L5-S3 dorsal rami, may be implicated, as supported by recent evidence of effective neural-based interventions.

Conclusions

This report highlights that sacroiliac joint dysfunction may be present in patients with pre-existing auto-fusion. The presence of bony fusion of the sacroiliac joint(s) may not preclude a diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and patients may benefit from minimally invasive fusion surgery. The underlying mechanism of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is complex and incompletely understood.

### Functional anatomy and pathophysiology of axial low back pain: disc, posterior elements, sacroiliac joint, and associated pain generators [^115y7BSF]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Careful consideration of functional lumbosacral anatomy reveals the capacity for pain generation in the disc, zygapophysial joint, sacroiliac joint, and surrounding ligaments. However, the methods used to definitively implicate a particular anatomic structure in axial low back pain have limitations. Anatomically and biomechanically, the discs and posterior elements are inextricably connected to a dynamic biotensegrity network of ligaments, muscles, and fascia. This article examines key lumbosacral anatomic structures and their functional interdependence at the macroscopic, microscopic, and biomechanical level. Particular attention is given to the capacity of each structure to generate low back pain.

### Sacroiliac joint ablation using MR-HIFU [^114NqhAH]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The sacroiliac joint is the culprit in 15–30% of patients with chronic lumbar back pain. Ablation of the posterior sensory nerves supplying the joint is an established treatment option before arthrodesis. We report the successful application of MR-HIFU in a patient with therapy-refractory pain using the Sonalleve MR-HIFU system. The outpatient procedure was performed under spinal anaesthesia and analgosedation. The ramus dorsalis of L5 as well as the lateral branches of the ramus dorsalis S1-S3 was targeted, and tissue peak temperature per sonication was controlled using MR-thermometry. There were no post-interventional complications. Clinical improvement began 4 days post-intervention with complete resolution of the pain after 1 month.

Study Design

Retrospective case analysis and presentation.

Objectives

The purpose of this article is to discuss the spectrum of failed spondylolisthesis cases for which either anterior column support or iliac screw fixation or both are useful in salvaging failed spondylolisthesis surgeries.

Summary Of Background Data

Past studies and experience have suggested that there is a relatively high rate of sacral screw failure both in long constructs to the sacrum in the adult population and also with treatment of both high-grade and adult spondylolisthesis at L5-S1. It has been noted that anterior column support at L5-S1 and additional fixation points in the sacropelvic unit provide some protection to the sacral screws.

Methods

This article details the author's personal and institutional experience with sacropelvic fixation and anterior column support at L5-S1 to salvage failed spondylolisthesis cases.

Results

To some extent, each case needs to be individualized. It is not always necessary to provide both anterior column support at L5-S1 and protection of the sacral screws with iliac screws. However, in the most complex problems using both seems to provide the greatest chance for an acceptable radiographic and clinical outcome. Most biomechanical studies have supported the use of anterior column support and iliac fixation to protect sacral screws, suggesting, of the two, that the iliac screws are more valuable.

Conclusions

For many of these cases of both high-grade dysplastic spondylolisthesis and low-grade adult isthmic spondylolisthesis, a reasonable combination of anterior column support and/or iliac screw fixation may be logical to reduce the incidence of failure and need for revision. The biggest concern with using iliac screw fixation is that these screws are prominent in a percentage of patients and the ultimate impact on the sacroiliac joint is not fully investigated. However, at our institution with 5- to 10-year follow-up, the impact on the sacroiliac joint has been minimal.
