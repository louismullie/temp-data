## Question

can you do an estrogen-progesterone IUD in a patient with migraine and aura

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an "estrogen-progesterone IUD" is appropriate and safe for a patient with migraine with aura. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what contraceptive method the user actually means and whether such an IUD exists. Then, I should verify the vascular risk profile of migraine with aura and how estrogen-containing contraception modifies that risk. Next, I will review guidance on combined hormonal contraception versus progestin-only methods, including levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and counseling points tailored to a patient with migraine with aura, including alternative options and risk-factor assessment [^116hxHpe] [^114Yvuko].

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here; at first glance I wondered if there might be an IUD that combines estrogen and progestin, but wait, let me verify this because I should not assume anything and I need to ensure I'm not missing a niche product, and after checking the evidence, there is no "estrogen-progesterone IUD" in clinical practice — modern IUDs are either nonhormonal copper devices or hormonal devices that release levonorgestrel, a progestin, without any estrogen, and the levonorgestrel IUD's effect is largely local with low systemic levels and does not carry the thrombotic risk profile associated with systemic estrogen exposure [^114Yvuko] [^112DZNVe].

> Next, I should review the vascular risk context; migraine with aura independently increases ischemic stroke risk, so hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any estrogen exposure in this setting, because even small additive risks can matter in specific patients, and multiple epidemiologic analyses show a higher ischemic stroke risk in migraine with aura, with risk further amplified by additive factors like smoking and estrogen, and some long-term data also signal a relationship with hemorrhagic stroke, though absolute risks remain low in young women [^111vaAki] [^1146dmZS] [^114dZPAx].

> Now I need to check the status of combined hormonal contraception (pills, patch, ring) in migraine with aura; I should confirm label-level contraindications and guideline positions before concluding, and the FDA labeling for multiple combined oral contraceptives explicitly lists migraine with aura as a contraindication, while primary care guidelines advise avoiding combined hormonal contraception in patients with migraine with aura due to increased ischemic stroke risk, and systematic reviews also associate combined oral contraceptives with a two- to fourfold increase in stroke risk in women with migraine, reinforcing that estrogen-containing contraception should be avoided here [^113daFXA] [^112mokmE] [^116hxHpe] [^115jBCtr].

> I will now examine progestin-only options, including the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD; I should double-check that these methods do not confer the same vascular risk signal, and consistent evidence and guidance indicate that progestin-only methods — such as levonorgestrel IUDs, implants, injectables, and progestin-only pills — as well as the copper IUD, are appropriate and can be safely used in women with migraine, including those with aura, given the absence of estrogen and the lack of an associated increase in ischemic stroke risk seen with combined methods [^112DZNVe] [^115jBCtr] [^114Yvuko].

> Let me consider practical counseling and selection; I should confirm that a levonorgestrel IUD is a reasonable first-line long-acting reversible contraceptive in this scenario, and ACOG recommends LARC methods broadly as safe and effective for most women with few contraindications, and emphasizes counseling on expected bleeding changes to improve satisfaction and continuation; if estrogen is to be avoided, the levonorgestrel IUD or the copper IUD are both excellent choices, with the copper IUD being entirely nonhormonal and the levonorgestrel IUD typically reducing menstrual blood loss after an initial period of irregular spotting, which is nonharmful and often improves over time [^114Yvuko] [^115HUoCk] [^112WSCvt].

> But wait, what if there are additional vascular risk factors; I should confirm a broader risk assessment and document migraine with aura clearly because risk is additive, so I would screen for smoking, hypertension, age over 35, and other cardiovascular risks, avoid combined estrogen-progestin pills/patch/ring, and document the counseling provided, while reassuring the patient that levonorgestrel IUDs do not increase stroke risk and are not associated with increased migraine frequency, and that either the levonorgestrel IUD or the copper IUD are sound options in migraine with aura [^116hxHpe] [^115jBCtr] [^114Yvuko].

> In summary, I need to ensure we correct the initial premise: there is no estrogen-progestin IUD; if the intent was an IUD, then a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is progestin-only and is appropriate in migraine with aura, whereas any combined estrogen-containing contraceptive should be avoided because of the elevated ischemic stroke risk in this population, so the safe recommendation is a levonorgestrel IUD or a copper IUD with counseling on bleeding expectations and routine risk-factor review [^114Yvuko] [^116hxHpe] [^115jBCtr] [^112DZNVe].

No — estrogen-progestin IUDs are **not available or approved** [^114Yvuko]; only progestin-only IUDs exist. In migraine with aura, **estrogen-containing contraceptives are contraindicated** [^113daFXA] due to increased ischemic stroke risk [^114LjaY2]. Progestin-only (levonorgestrel) IUDs are **safe and recommended** [^114Yvuko], as they do not increase stroke risk or exacerbate aura [^112DZNVe]. If estrogen is needed, use the lowest effective dose [^117C3vcA] and monitor closely; nonetheless, avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives in migraine with aura [^116hxHpe].

---

## Availability of estrogen-progestin IUDs

Currently, **no estrogen-progestin IUDs are available or approved** [^114Yvuko]; all IUDs are either progestin-only (levonorgestrel) or non-hormonal (copper). Levonorgestrel IUDs release progestin locally, resulting in minimal systemic estrogen exposure.

---

## Risks associated with estrogen-containing contraceptives in migraine with aura

Estrogen-containing contraceptives (COCs, patch, ring) are **contraindicated in migraine with aura** [^113daFXA] due to increased ischemic stroke risk [^114LjaY2]. The risk is highest in women with migraine with aura who use estrogen-containing contraceptives [^114LjaY2], especially when additional risk factors are present (smoking, hypertension, age > 35) [^116hxHpe] [^117C3vcA].

---

## Safety of progestin-only IUDs in migraine with aura

Progestin-only IUDs are **safe and effective** in migraine with aura [^114Yvuko], with no increased ischemic stroke risk or aura exacerbation. They are recommended for women with migraine with aura who require contraception [^112WSCvt].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines **recommend avoiding estrogen-containing contraceptives** in migraine with aura [^116hxHpe] due to stroke risk [^113daFXA], and endorse progestin-only IUDs as safe and effective alternatives [^114Yvuko] [^112WSCvt].

---

## Alternative contraceptive options

Alternative contraceptive options for women with **migraine with aura** include:

- **Progestin-only pills**: Safe and effective alternative to estrogen-containing contraceptives.

- **Copper IUD**: Non-hormonal, safe, and effective [^114Yvuko].

- **Barrier methods**: Condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps.

- **Permanent sterilization**: Tubal ligation or vasectomy.

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

If estrogen-containing contraceptives are considered (e.g. for non-contraceptive indications) [^113daFXA], use the lowest effective dose [^117C3vcA] and monitor closely for neurological symptoms or aura exacerbation; however, estrogen-containing contraceptives **should generally be avoided** in migraine with aura due to stroke risk [^114LjaY2].

### An evidence-based approach to hormonal contraception and headaches [^112DZNVe]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Some controversy exists regarding contraceptive management in women with migraines, particularly migraines with aura. The available scientific literature indicates that combined hormonal contraception is safe with most headache subtypes. However, it should be avoided in women with migraine with aura and women with simple migraines who have other risk factors for stroke. Progestin-only contraceptives, as well as the copper intrauterine device, can be safely used in women with migraines. Accurate classification of a patient's headache type can avoid unnecessary restriction of effective contraceptive methods, particularly those containing estrogen.

### Portia [^113daFXA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in females who experience headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura. Additionally, women over the age of 35 with migraine headaches, with or without aura, should avoid these tablets (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

If a woman using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, it is essential to evaluate the cause and discontinue use if indicated. Consider discontinuation if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during combined oral contraceptive (COC) use, as this may be indicative of a potential cerebrovascular event.

### CGRP-targeted migraine therapies in patients with vascular risk factors or stroke: A review [^115eoNRD]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

A case report describes a 41-year-old woman with episodic migraine without aura who received preventive mAb therapy with erenumab 70 mg. The report notes an acute right-sided thalamic infarction in MRI 34 days after the first dose of erenumab. A CT angiography detected a right-sided near-occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery P1 segment, with a large right posterior communicating artery. It is worth noting that the erenumab injection was only administered on one occasion and the subsequent stroke occurred after the half-life was exceeded. In addition, the patient had been on an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive for approximately 10 years and had taken a triptan to treat her acute migraine attack just before the stroke, which raises the possibility that erenumab may not have been the sole contributing factor.

Two case reports have described reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) in women who were undergoing preventive therapy with fremanezumab and erenumab. The diagnostic workup did not identify any causality for RCVS except for the newly initiated therapies with mAbs.

### Headache as a side effect of combination estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives: A systematic review [^1173hfFF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

We conducted a two-part systematic review of published studies to examine the evidence that combination oral contraceptives can aggravate or cause headaches.

- **Study design**: We used trials with a control group to assess headache risk attributable to oral contraceptive use, and prospective cohort trials to answer important clinical questions about the natural history and treatment response to headaches that occur with oral contraceptive use.

- **Results**: Due to differences in study populations, oral contraceptive formulations, trial endpoints, and trial durations, it was not possible to pool data. However, the evidence supports several conclusions. There is little indication that oral contraceptives have a clinically important effect on headache activity in most women.

- **Conclusion**: Headaches that occur during early cycles of oral contraceptive use tend to improve or disappear with continued use. No evidence supports the common clinical practice of switching oral contraceptives to treat headaches. However, manipulating the extent or duration of estrogen withdrawal may provide benefit.

### Combined hormonal contraception use in reproductive-age women with contraindications to estrogen use [^113NeM76]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use recommend that combined hormonal contraceptives (i.e. birth control pills, contraceptive patch, vaginal ring) should be avoided in women with specific medical conditions due to the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with estrogen use. It is unknown whether women with category 3 (theoretical or proven risk usually outweighs the advantages) or category 4 (unacceptable health risk) contraindications are appropriately avoiding estrogen-containing combined hormonal contraceptives.

- **Objective**: We describe the prevalence of combined hormonal contraceptive use among a sample of reproductive-age women with medical contraindications to estrogen use. Our hypothesis was that women with categories 3 and 4 contraindications would use estrogen-containing contraception less often than women without medical contraindications. We also explored whether inappropriate estrogen-containing contraceptive use is related to contraceptive provider characteristics.

- **Study design**: Data are from the baseline survey of the MyNewOptions study, which included privately insured women residing in Pennsylvania aged 18–40 years, who were sexually active and not intending pregnancy in the next year. Women were surveyed about their medical conditions, contraceptive use, and characteristics of their contraceptive provider. Women were considered to have a contraindication to combined hormonal contraceptives if they reported a category 3 or category 4 contraindication: hypertension, smo

### Maxalt-MLT [^115NpAar]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Maxalt® and Maxalt-MLT® are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults and in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years old.

- **Limitations of use**: Maxalt should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with Maxalt, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before Maxalt is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Maxalt is not indicated for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine [see Contraindications (4)]. Maxalt is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. The safety and effectiveness of Maxalt have not been established for cluster headaches.

Maxalt is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults and in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age.

- **Additional limitations of use**: Use only following a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. Maxalt is not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for the treatment of cluster headaches.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^117EDtQ2]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Age at entry**: Adult subjects participating in clinical trials should be between 18 and 65 years of age at entry. Only people who are at least 18 years old can provide informed consent. The inclusion of subjects older than 65 years is encouraged in post-marketing surveillance studies. After age 65, those with migraine are more likely to have, and be taking medications for, coexisting conditions than a younger population, which can confound assessments of safety and drug-drug interactions. Adverse health-related outcomes due to coexisting disease may be difficult to separate from a complication of the treatment under investigation.

- **Sex**: Males and females with migraine are eligible to participate in clinical trials of acute migraine medications. Migraine is at least three times more prevalent in females than in males. Special caution should be taken to avoid enrolling women who may be pregnant or lactating, unless they are the target of the trial. Partners of fertile-age women should practice effective contraception (refer to Section 2.3 for information about menstrual migraine).

- **Concomitant drug use**: Trials allowing participants to treat conditions other than migraine should pre-specify the permitted uses of concomitant therapies (i.e. open or restricted). The use of contraceptive medication should also be pre-specified. In phase II clinical trials, subjects should not be allowed to treat conditions other than migraine unless pha

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116vNnhh]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks**:
	- **Subject selection**:
		- **Migraine definition**:

Recommendation: Eligible subjects should fulfill the diagnostic criteria for migraine according to the most recent version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) of the IHS.

Comments: Clinical trials of acute treatments for migraine can include subjects who have migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and both migraine types, but the ICHD diagnostic criteria should be fulfilled to avoid population heterogeneity. In trials focusing on the acute treatment of migraine with aura, subjects with both migraine types can be included, as aura symptoms are recognizable, the attack types are distinguishable, and most people who have migraine with aura also have attacks of migraine without aura. Refer to Section 2.1 for more information about migraine with aura. In trials enrolling participants with a history of both types of attacks, the type of the treated attack should be classified according to ICHD criteria based on the clinical features captured in a diary. Note that this requirement may be impractical when subjects are instructed to treat early, because early treatment of migraine can modify the clinical features of an attack and thereby prevent analysis by type. Refer to Section 2.2 for more information about early intervention trials. In some instances, after efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in subjects with confirmed diagnoses of migraine without aura and migraine with aura, trials targeting subjects with probable migraine may be conducted.

### Contraindications to hormonal contraception among postpartum women in Texas [^114ezGPs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Of the 1,700 women enrolled in the study, 1,452 (85.4%) completed the 6-month survey and were included in these analyses. The most commonly reported contraindications included migraine with aura (12.4%), hypertension (4.8%), and gall bladder disease (1.7%); all other contraindications were reported by less than 1.0% of the sample. Among participants, 19.1% (278/1,452) had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to combined hormonal contraception (2.3% [34/1,452] category 3 only) and 5.4% (78/1,452) had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to DMPA (5.3% [77/1,452] category 3 only). Only 0.8% (11/1,452) of the sample had any category 3 or 4 contraindication to progestin-only pills and 0.6% (9/1,452) to the implant. A total of 19.1% (278/1,452) of the sample had any contraindication to hormonal contraception (2.3% [34/1,452] category 3 only).

### Variability of clinical features in attacks of migraine with aura [^112aU7L2]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

There is significant variability in the clinical presentation of migraine, both among patients and between attacks in an individual patient. We examined the clinical features of migraine with aura in a large group of patients enrolled in a clinical trial, comparing retrospective migraine attack characteristics reported upon enrollment in the trial with those recorded prospectively in the trial.

- **Methods**: Patients with migraine (n = 267) with typical visual aura in more than 30% of their attacks were enrolled from 16 centers for a clinical trial. Upon enrollment, patients provided a detailed retrospective description of the clinical features of their attacks of migraine. During the trial, clinical symptoms in migraine attacks starting with aura were recorded prospectively in 861 attacks.

- **Results**: Retrospectively reported visual aura symptoms were variable and often overlapping. The most common symptoms were dots or flashing lights, wavy or jagged lines, blind spots, and tunnel vision. Multiple patients reported more than one visual phenomenon. Approximately half of the patients reported nonvisual aura symptoms; the most common were numbness and tingling, followed by difficulty in recalling or speaking words. A significant percentage of patients also reported a change in olfaction. There were several inconsistencies between the features of prospectively recorded and retrospectively reported attacks. Headache, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were all less common in prospectively recorded attacks compared with retrospective reporting. Nausea was prospectively

### Migraine and menopause - a narrative review [^115dER7k]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

This narrative review addresses common clinical questions and concerns of both physicians and patients about migraine during and after the perimenopausal transition, specifically: (1) How does the perimenopausal transition affect migraine prevalence, and does this vary by migraine type? (2) Does the magnitude of stroke risk associated with migraine increase with hormone therapy (HT)? and (3) What are best practices regarding migraine treatment in perimenopausal women?

Methods: We searched PubMed from 2010 through the present. Search terms included migraine, menopause, and HT. Articles were included if they were in English and had full-text availability. In addition, key references identified in the search articles were included.

Discussion and conclusion: Many women are informed that their migraines will disappear postmenopause; there are some data to support this, but a specific time frame has not been evidenced. Stroke risk in women with migraine with aura is small in absolute terms but important at the population level because migraine is so prevalent. The risk becomes clinically important in the context of additional stroke risk factors, which increase with aging, such as hypertension. Estrogen in combined hormonal contraception increases the risk of an ischemic stroke; however, the lower amount of estrogen in HT may not contribute to a meaningful increase in stroke risk. HT is a preventative sex-specific treatment for female migraineurs for the menopausal transition.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^1165UkGN]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Menstrual migraine**: In menstruating females, the peak incidence of migraine occurs in the interval beginning 2 days before and extending through the first few days of menstruation. The Appendix of ICHD-3 provides criteria for pure menstrual migraine and menstrually-related migraine. For both disorders, attacks occur on days −2 to + 3 of menstruation in at least two out of three menstrual cycles. For pure menstrual migraine, attacks occur at no other time of the month, while in menstrually-related migraine, attacks may occur at other times. Pure menstrual migraine is less common than menstrually-related migraine; in one study, only 7% of females had pure menstrual migraine, while 34.5% had menstrually-related migraine.

	- Migraine attacks occurring in association with menstruation are generally noted to be severe, of long duration, and associated with higher relapse rates. Acute treatment trials might therefore investigate the efficacy of a new therapy by comparing its rate of relapse with those of standard treatments in subjects with menstrually-related migraine, pure menstrual migraine, or both conditions. If the effect of an acute treatment on pure menstrual migraine is to be investigated, accurate diagnosis is essential; it is recommended that subjects record migraine attacks and menstrual periods prospectively in a headache diary for two to three cycles before entering the trial and that investigators apply the strict definition provided above to distinguish them from subjects with menstrually-related migraine. Three months of prospective diary information may be needed.

### Onzetra Xsail [^116w2Zhx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Onzetra Xsail is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. It functions as a serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) for this purpose.

- **Limitations of use**: Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. It is not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine attacks and not for the treatment of cluster headache.

If a patient does not respond to the first migraine attack treated with Onzetra Xsail, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before treating subsequent attacks. Onzetra Xsail is not intended for the prevention of migraine attacks, and its safety and effectiveness have not been established for the treatment of cluster headache.

### Hormonal influences in migraine - interactions of oestrogen, oxytocin and CGRP [^115N6txp]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine is ranked as the second highest cause of disability worldwide and the first among women aged 15–49 years. Overall, the incidence of migraine is threefold higher among women than men, though the frequency and severity of attacks vary during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause. Reproductive hormones are clearly a key influence on the susceptibility of women to migraine. A fall in plasma oestrogen levels can trigger attacks of migraine without aura, whereas higher oestrogen levels seem to be protective. The basis of these effects is unknown.

In this review, we discuss what is known about sex hormones and their receptors in migraine-related areas in the CNS and the peripheral trigeminovascular pathway. We consider the actions of oestrogen via its multiple receptor subtypes and the involvement of oxytocin, which has been shown to prevent migraine attacks. We also discuss possible interactions of these hormones with the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) system in light of the success of anti-CGRP treatments. We propose a simple model to explain the hormone withdrawal trigger in menstrual migraine, which could provide a foundation for improved management and therapy for hormone-related migraine in women.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: A secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1121ZhyB]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

In the chronic migraine trial, the mean (SE) number of baseline monthly aura days ranged from 6.5 (0.5) to 7.5 (0.4) days among patients with one or more aura days during baseline. The change from baseline in monthly aura days did not substantially differ among treatment groups.

- **Safety**: Overall safety profiles were similar across treatment groups, regardless of aura history. In patients without a history of aura, 49.7% (n = 280) in the placebo group versus 46.4% (n = 343) in the erenumab group reported an adverse event (AE) during the double-blind treatment phase. In patients with a history of aura, the AE rates were 47.9% (n = 230) in the placebo group versus 47.7% (n = 315) in the erenumab group. Most AEs reported were mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuations due to AEs during the double-blind treatment phase were low in both subgroups but slightly higher in patients with a history of aura who received erenumab (2.3% [n = 15] versus 1.4% [n = 10]).

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate [^116M9p3e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adverse reactions have been noted in clinical trials of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) tablets without concomitant estrogen treatment. It is essential to acknowledge that these trials were conducted under varying conditions, making direct comparison of adverse reaction rates between different drugs challenging. Such rates may not reflect those observed in general practice. Please see the BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS for more details.

- **Genitourinary system**: Reported reactions include abnormal uterine bleeding (irregular, increase, or decrease), changes in menstrual flow, breakthrough bleeding, spotting, amenorrhea, and changes in cervical erosion and cervical secretions.

- **Breasts**: Breast tenderness, mastodynia, or galactorrhea have been reported.

- **Cardiovascular**: Thromboembolic disorders, including thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism, have been noted.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Reported effects include nausea and cholestatic jaundice.

- **Skin**: Sensitivity reactions, such as urticaria, pruritus, edema, and generalized rash, have occurred. Additionally, acne, alopecia, and hirsutism have been reported.

- **Eyes**: Neuro-ocular lesions, such as retinal thrombosis and optic neuritis, have been observed.

- **Central nervous system**: Reported reactions include mental depression, insomnia, somnolence, dizziness, headache, and nervousness.

- **Miscellaneous**: Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, and angioedema, have occurred. Other reactions include rash (allergic) with and without pruritus, change in weight (increase or decrease), pyrexia, edema/fluid retention, fatigue, and decreased glucose tolerance.

### Migraine and risk of haemorrhagic stroke in women: prospective cohort study [^1146dmZS]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Our data contrast with a previous report from the Women's Health Study, which indicated that migraine with aura was not associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke following a mean of nine years of follow-up. The pattern of association suggests that this discrepancy is caused by the difference in length of follow-up; the increased risk for haemorrhagic stroke among women with migraine with aura becomes apparent only after longer follow-up (mean of 13.6 years in the present study), similar to a pattern observed for ischaemic vascular events.

While several studies and two meta-analyses have evaluated the association of migraine, specifically migraine with aura, with ischaemic stroke, data on the association between migraine and haemorrhagic stroke are sparse. One case-control study found an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke for people with a family history of migraine (odds ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 3.90). However, in those with active migraine, the increased risk was more apparent for people with migraine without aura (1.84, 0.77 to 4.39). Another study of 430 women aged 15–44 with stroke used two control groups (their matched neighbors and hospital controls) to evaluate the association between migraine and haemorrhagic stroke. Compared with the neighbor control group, women with migraine who did not use oral contraceptives had an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (1.8, 1.2 to 2.7). The increased risk was not apparent when the hospital control group was used as a reference, which might relate to biases when using hospital-based controls.

### The influence of estrogen on migraine: a systematic review [^113ySQzn]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

Menstrual migraine affects approximately 50% to 60% of female migraineurs, but knowledge regarding the role of hormones, specially estrogen, appears incomplete. The objective of this systematic review was to determine the role of hormones on menstrual migraine.

- **Evidence acquisition**: MEDLINE (January 1966 through September 1, 2005) and EMBASE Drugs and Pharmacology (January 1991 through September 1, 2005) were searched for articles published in the English language. The keywords used were migraine, estrogen, menstrual migraine, pure menstrual migraine, true menstrual migraine, menstrually-associated migraine, menstrually-related migraine, pregnancy, breast-feeding, perimenopause, menopause, nitric oxide, and estrogen receptors. A total of 643 unique articles were reviewed for relevance, scientific rigor, and generalizability. For each relevant citation, the bibliography was reviewed to identify additional sources of pertinent data.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The influence of estrogen on migraine is evident by a 3-fold greater prevalence among women compared with men, and by significant changes in migraine incidence with changes in female reproductive status. Menstrual migraines are usually more resistant to treatment, generally not associated with aura, of longer duration, and associated with more functional disability compared with attacks at other times of the month. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggest central and peripheral roles for estrogen in the pathophysiology of menstrual migraine, with potential interactions with excitatory circuits, including serotonergic components.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^116e4Jvx]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine often remits during pregnancy, but if treatment is continued, the potential for harm to the fetus demands special consideration. Despite relatively poor efficacy, paracetamol should be used as the first-line medication for acute treatment of migraine in pregnancy. NSAIDs can be used only during the second trimester. Triptans should be used only under the strict supervision of a specialist, as the safety data available are limited and originate from post-marketing surveillance; most data relate to the use of sumatriptan. For nausea associated with migraine in pregnancy, metoclopramide can be used.

Preventive migraine medications are best avoided during pregnancy owing to the potential for fetal harm. However, if preventive therapy is considered clinically indicated because of frequent and disabling migraine attacks, the best available safety data support the use of propranolol or, if propranolol is contraindicated, amitriptyline. Both should be used under specialist supervision to adequately monitor any potential fetal harm. Topiramate, candesartan, and sodium valproate are contraindicated; sodium valproate is known to be teratogenic, so it must not be used, and the use of topiramate and candesartan is associated with adverse effects on the fetus.

Migraine medication therapy in the postpartum period also requires caution because of potential risks to the infant. Paracetamol is the preferred acute medication, although ibuprofen and sumatriptan are also considered safe. If preventive medication is required, propranolol is the recommended choice.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: A secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112uBqMG]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

This post hoc secondary analysis of four randomized clinical trials found that erenumab reduced migraine frequency and acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM) days in patients with migraine with and without a history of aura. The safety profile of long-term erenumab treatment was similar in patients with and without a history of aura and was comparable to that of placebo over 12 weeks, with no increased emergence of adverse events over time. These findings suggest that erenumab may be safe and effective for this patient population.

### Brain lesions and cerebral functional impairment in migraine patients [^114dZPAx]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Migraine is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, mainly in the subpopulation of women with migraine with aura who are younger than 45 years, particularly those that use estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. However, migraine should be considered a benign condition as the absolute increase in stroke risk is small. Migraine is also associated with a high prevalence of cerebral white matter hyperintensities, occurring in the deep and periventricular white matter as well as infratentorial, mainly pontine. The pathogenesis and clinical significance of these hyperintensities are unclear. We do not know whether migraine may be considered a progressive disorder in a subset of patients because of the accumulation of these hyperintensities over time.

Studies on the relationship between migraine and cognitive functioning have yielded conflicting results. Two recent studies have provided reassuring news for migraine patients. A population-based twin study showed that a lifetime migraine diagnosis was not associated with cognitive deficits in middle-aged subjects. Additionally, a long-term prospective study assessing cognitive and memory changes in aging individuals with and without a history of migraine showed that migraineurs do not exhibit more decline on cognitive tests over time versus controls. Migraine is certainly not a recognized risk factor for (vascular) dementia.

### Cumulative exposure to estrogen may increase the risk of migraine in women [^111CZhoG]. Cephalalgia (2024). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common disorder, particularly affecting women during their reproductive years. This female preponderance has been linked to exposure to female sex hormones.

- **Methods**: We used self-reported data from women born in 1943–1965 and enrolled in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study to examine the differences between women with migraine and women without migraine in a prospective design. The study focused on exposure to both endogenous and exogenous female sex hormones.

- **Results**: In total, 62,959 women were included in the study, of whom 24.8% reported previous migraine (n = 15,635). Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we found that higher age at menarche reduced the risk of migraine (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.95–0.98) and that oral contraceptive use and parity increased the risk of migraine (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.06–1.18 and HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.29–1.46, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: Older age at menarche appears to reduce migraine risk, whereas oral contraceptive use and having children appear to increase the risk. Further research is required to investigate the causality of these associations.

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: A review [^116fUG59]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Menstrual migraine, a common umbrella term that covers the definitions of pure menstrual migraine and menstrually-related migraine, describes a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura that commonly occurs on or between days −2 to +3 of menstruation in at least two out of three consecutive menstrual cycles. Menstrual migraine without aura is estimated to affect up to one-quarter (18%–25%) of female migraineurs. In populations from headache clinics, the proportion of women affected is estimated to be even higher, ranging from 22% to 70%.

In women diagnosed with menstrual migraine, perimenstrual attacks are associated with significantly longer attack durations, greater work disability, reduced pharmacological response compared with non-menstrual attacks, and the presence of non-neurological symptoms, mainly dysmenorrhea, which increase the burden of the disease. The management of menstrual migraine is not vastly different from the management of non-menstrual migraine. However, consideration must be given to the longer attack duration, often requiring several consecutive days of treatment and additional treatment for headache recurrence, as patients may be relatively refractory to medications effective for non-menstrual attacks.

Two replicate, randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating sumatriptan-naproxen sodium demonstrated excellent efficacy in the treatment of a single menstrual migraine attack associated with dysmenorrhea. The studies included 312 and 311 participants in the intention-to-treat (full analysis set), respectively, who were randomly assigned to treatment groups.

### Migraine with aura and risk of cardiovascular and all cause mortality in men and women: Prospective cohort study [^116ajZnv]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Overall, using total mortality, our model suggests that at age 50, men and women with migraine with aura had a median loss of 1.5 and 1.4 years of life, respectively, compared with those without headache (see appendix 3 on bmj.com).

At age 50, the absolute risk of all-cause mortality was low but still considerably higher for men than for women. For example, the 10-year risk for men aged 50 was 6.8% in those with no headache and 8.0% in those with migraine with aura; the corresponding values for women were 3.0% and 3.6%. At age 70, the absolute 10-year risk had risen to 40.6% and 46.1% for men and 24.1% and 27.9% for women (see appendix 4 on bmj.com).

### SIGN 155 pharmacological management of migraine: A national clinical guideline [^111XenaK]. SIGN (2023). High credibility.

For preventative measures specifically related to migraine prophylaxis with anticonvulsants, the SIGN 2023 guidelines recommend informing female patients about the following considerations before starting treatment with sodium valproate:

- **Potential exposure**: There is a risk of potentially harmful exposure to valproate before a woman is aware of her pregnancy.

- **Effective contraception**: The necessity to use effective contraception is emphasized.

- **Further advice**: Patients should seek additional advice on migraine prophylaxis if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy.

### Use of combined hormonal contraceptives among women with migraines and risk of ischemic stroke [^114LjaY2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Migraine with aura and combined hormonal contraceptives are independently associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, little is known about whether there are any joint effects of migraine and hormonal contraceptives on the risk of stroke.

- **Objective**: We sought to estimate the incidence of stroke in women of reproductive age and examine the association among combined hormonal contraceptive use, migraine type (with or without aura), and ischemic stroke.

- **Study design**: This study used a nationwide healthcare claims database and employed a nested case-control study design. Females aged 15–49 years with first-ever stroke during 2006 through 2012 were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification inpatient services diagnosis codes. Four controls were matched to each case based on age. Migraine headache with and without aura was identified using inpatient or outpatient diagnosis codes. Combined hormonal contraceptive use was identified using the National Drug Code from the pharmacy database. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for ischemic stroke by migraine type and combined hormonal contraceptive use.

- **Results**: From 2006 through 2012, there were 25,887 ischemic strokes among females ages 15–49 years, for a cumulative incidence of 11 strokes per 100,000 females. Compared to those with neither migraine nor combined hormonal contraceptive use, the odds ratio of ischemic stroke was highest among those with migraine with aura using c.

### Dasetta 1/35 [^112mokmE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Headache**: The onset or exacerbation of migraine, or the development of a headache with a new, recurrent, persistent, or severe pattern, requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.

- **Bleeding irregularities**: Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Nonhormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in any case of abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^115puMDR]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients with migraine and self-reported aura were mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 15 patients (100 mg: n = 7, 2.5%; 300 mg: n = 3, 1.0%; placebo: n = 5, 1.7%). Serious TEAEs occurred in 18 patients (100 mg: n = 6, 2.1%; 300 mg: n = 5, 1.7%; placebo: n = 7, 2.4%). Compared to the established safety and tolerability profile of eptinezumab, no new safety signals were identified specifically in this subgroup of patients self-reporting a history of aura.

### Estrogen-dependent effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan on cortical spreading depression in rat: Modelling the serotonin-ovarian hormone interaction in migraine aura [^111zRjC9]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is the likely culprit of the migraine aura. Migraine is sexually dimorphic and thought to be a "low 5-HT" condition. We sought to decipher the interrelation between serotonin, ovarian hormones, and cortical excitability in a model of migraine aura.

- **Methods**: Occipital KCl-induced CSDs were recorded for one hour at parieto-occipital and frontal levels in adult male (n = 16) and female rats (n = 64) one hour after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) or NaCl. Sixty-five oophorectomized females were treated with estradiol- (E2) or cholesterol- (Chol) filled capsules. Two weeks later, we recorded CSDs after 5-HTP/NaCl injections before or 20 hours after capsule removal.

- **Results**: 5-HTP had no effect in males but decreased CSD frequency in cycling females, significantly so during estrus, at parieto-occipital (-3.5 CSD/h, p < 0.001) and frontal levels (-2.5 CSD/h, p = 0.014). In oophorectomized rats, CSD susceptibility increased during E2 treatment at both recording sites (+5 CSD/h, p = 0.001 and +3 CSD/h, p < 0.01) but decreased promptly after E2 withdrawal (-4.7 CSD/h, p < 0.001 and -1.7 CSD/h, p = 0.094). The CSD inhibitory effect of 5-HTP was significant only in E2-treated rats (-3.4 CSD/h, p = 0.006 and -1.8 CSD/h, p = 0.029). Neither the estrous cycle phase nor E2 or 5-HTP treatments significantly modified CSD propagation velocity.

- **Conclusion**: 5-HTP decreases CSD occurrence in the presence of ovarian hormones, suggesting its potential efficacy in migraine with aura prophylaxis in females. Elevated E2 levels increase CSD susceptibility.

### Safety of hormonal contraceptives among women with migraine: A systematic review [^115jBCtr]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Migraine is common among women of reproductive age and is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are also associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. The use of hormonal contraception among women with migraine might further elevate the risk of stroke among women of reproductive age.

- **Objective**: To identify evidence regarding the risk of arterial thromboembolism (stroke or myocardial infarction) among women with migraine who use hormonal contraceptives.

- **Methods**: We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from database inception through January 2016. We included studies that examined women with migraine overall or separated by subtype (with or without aura). Hormonal contraceptives of interest included combined hormonal methods (COCs, patch, and ring) and progestin-only methods (progestin-only pills, injectables, implants, and progestin intrauterine devices).

- **Results**: Seven articles met inclusion criteria. All were case-control studies of fair to poor quality reporting on the use of COCs or oral contraceptives (OCs) not further described, and all reported stroke outcomes. Four studies demonstrated that, among women with migraine (not separated by subtype), COC use was associated with approximately two to four times the risk of stroke compared with nonuse. The only study to examine specific migraine subtypes found an elevated risk of stroke among women with migraine with aura, and this risk was similar regardless of OC use, although these odds ratios were not reported.

### Comparing perimenstrual and nonperimenstrual migraine attacks using an e-diary [^115x5C3B]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is thought to be the underlying mechanism of the migraine aura, is also suggested to be affected by estrogen levels. High estrogen levels were shown to increase CSD susceptibility, whereas estrogen withdrawal and low estrogen levels appeared to decrease the risk for CSD, which may explain why perimenstrual migraine attacks are less likely to be associated with aura in women with MRM. The observed more pronounced photophobia during perimenstrual migraine attacks seems noteworthy in that light because previous studies suggested photophobia to be associated with visual aura. A greater visual cortex hyperexcitability in migraine with aura may induce abnormal processing of light sensitivity and may be the link between symptoms of photophobia and CSD susceptibility.

Women with MRM did not have a higher PMS prevalence compared to women with non-MRM, in contrast to what some small diary-based pilot studies suggested. The prevalence of PMS in our large cohort of women with migraine is comparable to the prevalence in the general population, which ranges between 5% and 20%. Our finding corresponds with previous studies reporting PMS in 10%–30% of women with migraine, and we did not find a difference in PMS between women with and without MRM. However, as there is important overlap in symptomology between PMS and the prodromal phase of migraine, it is conceivable that women with MRM are less likely to differentiate between these two phenomena. Importantly, we did find slightly higher PMS symptom scores and functional impairment scores in women with…

### Identification and characterization of migraine in pregnancy: A Norwegian registry-based cohort study [^1149gEfz]. Cephalalgia (2024). Low credibility.

Migraine is common in women of reproductive age. The episodic manifestation of migraines, along with the use of acute and preventive pharmacological treatments, presents challenges in studying drug safety during pregnancy. To enhance such studies, the aim was to develop algorithms for identifying and characterizing migraines in electronic healthcare registries and to assess the level of care.

- **Methods**: We linked four registries to detect pregnancies from 2009 to 2018 and employed three algorithms for migraine identification: i) diagnostic codes, ii) triptans dispensed, and iii) a combination of both. The severity of migraines was assessed using dispensed drugs as proxies. ICD-10 diagnostic subcodes of migraine (G43) were used to allocate four subtypes: complicated and/or status migrainosus, with aura, without aura, and other/unspecified.

- **Results**: A total of 535,089 pregnancies in 367,908 women with available one-year lookback data were included. The prevalence of migraines identified varied between 2.9% to 4.3% before pregnancy and 0.8% to 1.5% during pregnancy, depending on the algorithm used. Pregnant women with migraines were mostly managed in primary care.

- **Conclusions**: Primary care data combined with drug dispensation records were crucial for identifying migraines in electronic healthcare registries. Data from secondary care and drug dispensations allow for better characterization of migraines. Together, these algorithms may contribute to enhanced perinatal pharmacoepidemiological studies by addressing confounding by maternal migraine indication.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^1138K8G4]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

Migraine with aura is a distinct diagnosis characterized by the presence of one or more fully reversible focal neurologic symptoms, which are usually followed by headache and associated migraine symptoms. Most patients with migraine with aura report visual disturbances, such as visual scintillations and scotoma, that spread gradually over ≥ 5 minutes, last 5‒60 minutes, and precede headache onset within 60 minutes. Migraine with aura reportedly comprises approximately one-third of all migraine diagnoses and has been associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease.

Eptinezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody specific for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. In the pivotal PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 trials, eptinezumab, at the approved dose levels of 100 mg and 300 mg, met the primary efficacy endpoint, statistically significantly reducing mean monthly migraine days over weeks 1–12 in patients with migraine, with sustained efficacy occurring as early as day 1 after infusion. Given the high prevalence of migraine with aura, the associated medical risks, and the scarcity of published data specific to this population, a post hoc subgroup analysis of pooled data from the PROMISE trials was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in patients who self-reported a history of aura.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^113jG2tR]. Cephalalgia (2022).

Patients were randomized to receive eptinezumab 30 mg (PROMISE-1 only), 100 mg, 300 mg, or placebo administered intravenously every 12 weeks. Patients in PROMISE-1 received up to four treatments (48 weeks), while patients in PROMISE-2 received up to two treatments (24 weeks).

This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in the subgroup of patients who self-reported a history of aura at screening in either study. It included only those patients who received approved eptinezumab dose levels (i.e. 100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo. Outcome measures included changes in migraine frequency (i.e. monthly migraine days or MMDs), migraine responder rates (≥ 50% and ≥ 75%) over Weeks 1–12 and 13–24, percent of migraine attacks with aura, acute medication days, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Patients from PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 were pooled for all analyses except for the change from baseline in MMDs due to the differences in patient populations at baseline.

Monthly migraine days were derived from eDiary data and were based on 4-week intervals. A 50% responder was a patient who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs, and a 75% responder was a patient who achieved a ≥ 75% reduction in MMDs. These reductions were evaluated by comparing the baseline frequency of migraine days to the migraine frequency in 4-week intervals. Results from the 4-week intervals were combined to produce 12- and 24-week responder endpoints.

In the daily eDiaries, patients indicated whether they experienced aura symptoms as discussed with the investigator during screening.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: A secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^116Q48bW]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Migraine with aura occurs in as many as one-third of patients with migraine, with prevalence estimated at 20%-40% of all individuals with migraine. However, most of these patients do not experience aura with every migraine attack. Currently, no well-established treatments are available to abort or prevent aura symptoms, and therapeutic responses to acute therapy, specifically sumatriptan, may differ in migraine with aura compared to migraine without aura. The evidence is mixed on the association of aura with preventive treatments for migraine. Cortical spreading depression-like events are widely considered to be the underlying substrate of a migraine aura. Thus, it is unclear whether monoclonal antibodies, which are generally believed to be substantially restricted to the periphery, would be equally effective in migraine with aura versus without aura. Given the importance of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the regulation of vascular tone and the association between migraine with aura and cardiovascular disease, well-established safety data on patients with migraine with aura are needed.

Erenumab, known in the US as erenumab-aooe, is a human anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody developed for migraine prevention. Erenumab has demonstrated clinical efficacy in both episodic and chronic migraine, reducing both monthly migraine days (MMDs) and acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM) use. To understand the efficacy and safety profiles of erenumab in patients with migraine with aura, we conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^112YRjXE]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

In this subgroup analysis of patients with migraine and a self-reported history of aura, efficacy results were consistent with the full population results of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2, with patients experiencing reductions in migraine frequency (4 [EM] to 8 [CM] fewer MMDs vs. baseline), proportion of migraine attacks with aura (decrease from baseline of ∼5 percentage points), and acute medication use (4 fewer acute medication days per month). Additionally, the tolerability profile of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported history of aura was consistent with what was previously reported in the full EM and CM populations. These findings suggest that eptinezumab may be clinically useful in the migraine with aura subpopulation.

Eptinezumab decreased the percentage of migraine attacks with aura relative to baseline (percentage-point decreases of 5.0 and 4.7) and to a larger extent than placebo (percentage-point decrease of 3.1), suggesting a small treatment effect on aura frequency beyond reducing migraine frequency. The effects of eptinezumab on the severity of aura and specific aura presentation were not specifically evaluated in the PROMISE studies, and only limited data with respect to effects on aura have been reported for the entire CGRP monoclonal antibody drug class. A single report of a post hoc analysis of data from three phase 3 clinical studies indicated that galcanezumab reduced both the frequency of prodromal symptoms relative to placebo (in patients with EM and with CM) and the number of migraine headache days with aura.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^114aHDb8]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

This post hoc subgroup analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for migraine prevention in patients with migraine and self-reported aura.

- **Methods**: PROMISE-1 (NCT02559895; episodic migraine) and PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153; chronic migraine) were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated eptinezumab for migraine prevention. In both studies, the primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12. Patients in this analysis included those who self-reported migraine with aura at screening.

- **Results**: Of patients with episodic migraine, approximately 75% reported a history of aura at screening; of patients with chronic migraine, approximately 35% reported a history of aura. Changes in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12 were –4.0 (100 mg) and –4.2 (300 mg) with eptinezumab versus –3.1 with placebo in patients with episodic migraine with aura, and were –7.1 (100 mg) and –7.6 (300 mg) with eptinezumab versus –6.0 with placebo in patients with chronic migraine with aura. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 56.0% (100 mg), 57.4% (300 mg), and 55.4% (placebo) of patients.

- **Conclusions**: The preventive migraine efficacy of eptinezumab in patients in the PROMISE studies who self-reported aura was comparable to the overall study populations, demonstrating a similarly favorable safety and tolerability profile.

### Migraine and its major subtypes - with and without aura are associated with polygenic scores for autism [^111QfR6i]. Cephalalgia (2025). High credibility.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience a wide array of neurological, psychiatric, and medical comorbidities, yet little attention has been given to the potential link between ASD and migraine, one of the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide. This study aimed to investigate whether a genetic predisposition for ASD is linked to migraine and its major subtypes, with and without aura. Additionally, potential moderators and mediators of the association between ASD and migraine were explored.

- **Methods**: Polygenic scores (PGS) for ASD were constructed based on the genome-wide association study by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, using the UK Biobank cohort dataset comprising 337,386 participants, analyzed with PRSice-2. Regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of ASD PGS with migraine and its major subtypes, with and without aura. Sex was explored as a potential moderating factor. The mediation analyses considered variables such as education, personality trait neuroticism, body mass index (BMI), and four categories of comorbidities: psychiatric, vascular, neurologic, and others.

- **Results**: ASD PGS were significantly and positively associated with migraine (odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02–1.05, p < 0.002), migraine without aura (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.07, p < 0.002), and migraine with aura (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.07, p < 0.002). No moderating effect of sex on the association between ASD PGS and migraine was observed. As for potential mediators, only the personality trait neuroticism significantly impacted the association.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^111xYHDW]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

The full methodologies of PROMISE-1 (NCT02559895) and PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153) have been published; key elements are reviewed here. Both studies were conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable local regulatory requirements. Independent ethics committee or institutional review board approval was obtained for each study site, with all patients providing written informed consent prior to study participation.

Both studies were phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that evaluated the preventive efficacy, tolerability, and safety of eptinezumab in adults with migraine. PROMISE-1 enrolled patients with episodic migraine (EM) and PROMISE-2 enrolled patients with chronic migraine (CM). Migraine was defined using the International Classification for Headache Disorders (ICHD) definitions for migraine broadly.

Patients separately reported any experience of aura with their migraine, being asked if they experience aura at the screening visit (and if it was ever experienced without headache pain). To improve the accuracy of self-reporting, investigators confirmed each patient's understanding of aura during the screening visit and provided additional description and/or explanation if needed. Educational materials pertaining to aura were also provided as part of electronic diary (eDiary) training.

### Estrogens, migraine, and stroke [^117C3vcA]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies suggest the existence of close but complex relationships between estrogens, migraine, and stroke in women before menopause. Migraine, particularly without aura, is strongly influenced by estrogens, as illustrated by the frequency of onset at puberty, of menstrual migraine, and of improvement during pregnancy. Migraine, particularly with aura, is a risk factor for ischemic stroke with a relative risk of 3, further increased by tobacco smoking and oral contraceptive use. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying these close relationships remains unknown.

In practice, given the very low absolute risk of stroke in young women, there is no systematic contraindication to oral contraceptive use in young female migraineurs. However, there is a firm recommendation for no smoking and for the use of low-estrogen-content pills or progestogens only, particularly in cases of migraine with aura.

### Oestrogen and attacks of migraine with and without aura [^111nfDH9]. The Lancet Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

During women's reproductive years, migraine is three times more common than in men of a similar age. Although this female preponderance is commonly assumed to be associated with the additional trigger of fluctuating sex hormones of the menstrual cycle, few studies have been done to confirm or refute this. This review is confined to the relation between oestrogen and attacks of migraine. The evidence for an association between oestrogen "withdrawal" and attacks of migraine without aura is presented, as well as evidence for an association between high oestrogen states and attacks of migraine with aura. Only clinical data are presented here.

### Zomig [^1114qfko]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Zomig is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.

- **Limitations of use**: Only use Zomig if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to Zomig treatment for the first migraine attack, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before Zomig is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Zomig is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of Zomig have not been established for cluster headache.

Zomig is a serotonin (5-HT)1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.

- **Limitations of use**: Use only following a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine. Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache.

### Subject and clinician experience with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [^113qk4X6]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

Because the use of intrauterine contraception is now expanding, this article reports early US clinical experience with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG IUS) and assesses subjects' and clinicians' judgment of the adequacy of product information and the overall level of product satisfaction to provide insight to new providers of the LNG IUS.

- **Study design**: Multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase IIIb study. Investigators had no prior experience with the LNG IUS. Subjects and investigators completed surveys and questionnaires at 3, 6, and 12 months.

- **Results**: A total of 509 women, aged 18 to 45 years, were enrolled in this study between July 2000 and June 2002, and 506 (99.4%) received an LNG IUS after the first (488/506, 95.9%) or second (18/20, 90%) insertion attempt. Insertion was rated as "easy" by 91.8% of investigators. The continuation rate at 12 months was 79%. Primary reasons for premature discontinuation were expulsion (4.5%) and menstrual cycle problems (3.8%). Most subjects (84.5%) indicated a high level of satisfaction with the LNG IUS.

- **Conclusion**: Over 95% of women had successful insertions of the LNG IUS at the first attempt, and less than 1% were unsuccessful after two attempts. Both clinicians and subjects were highly satisfied with product information and their experience with the LNG IUS. One-year continuation rates were comparable to those of other reversible methods.

### Practice guideline update summary: Pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: Report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^112b6LRE]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for migraine, especially in pediatric and adolescent patients concerning pharmacologic prophylaxis, the AAN/AHS 2019 guidelines recommend counseling patients of childbearing potential about the potential of topiramate to decrease the efficacy of oral combined hormonal contraceptives, particularly at doses greater than 200 mg daily, when offering topiramate for migraine prevention. Patients of childbearing potential should be advised to discuss optimal contraception methods with their healthcare provider during treatment when offering topiramate or valproate for migraine prevention.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^11688k3a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for migraines, specifically with respect to migraine prophylaxis, the ACP 2025 guidelines recommend using an informed decision-making approach. It is important to discuss the benefits, harms, costs, patient's values, and preferences, including financial burden and mode of administration. Considerations should also include contraindications, pregnancy and reproductive status in females, clinical comorbidities, and availability when selecting a pharmacologic treatment for the prevention of episodic migraine.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: Post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^1159rbWs]. Cephalalgia (2022). High credibility.

This post hoc subgroup analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for migraine prevention in patients with migraine and self-reported aura.

- **Methods**: PROMISE-1 (NCT02559895; episodic migraine) and PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153; chronic migraine) were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated eptinezumab for migraine prevention. In both studies, the primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12. Patients in this analysis included those who self-reported migraine with aura at screening.

- **Results**: Of patients with episodic migraine, approximately 75% reported a history of aura at screening; of patients with chronic migraine, approximately 35% reported a history of aura. Changes in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12 were -4.0 (100mg) and -4.2 (300mg) with eptinezumab versus -3.1 with placebo in patients with episodic migraine with aura, and were -7.1 (100mg) and -7.6 (300mg) with eptinezumab versus -6.0 with placebo in patients with chronic migraine with aura. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 56.0% (100mg), 57.4% (300mg), and 55.4% (placebo) of patients.

- **Conclusions**: The preventive migraine efficacy of eptinezumab in patients in the PROMISE studies who self-reported aura was comparable to the overall study populations, demonstrating a similarly favorable safety and tolerability profile.

### Duration, frequency, recency, and type of migraine and the risk of ischaemic stroke in women of childbearing age [^111vaAki]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Migraine is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke in women of childbearing age. Migraine with aura poses a higher risk than migraine without aura.

- **Objective**: To investigate further the effect of duration, frequency, recency, and type of migraine on the risk of ischaemic stroke.

- **Methods**: Additional analyses of a previously reported multicentre case-control study of the relation between stroke and migraine in women aged 20–44 years.

- **Results**: Among 86 cases of ischaemic stroke and 214 controls, the adjusted risk of ischaemic stroke was significantly associated with: (1) migraine of more than 12 years duration, odds ratio (OR) 4.61 (1.27–16.8); (2) initial migraine with aura, OR 8.37 (2.33–30.1); (3) particularly if attacks were more frequent than 12 times per year, OR 10.4 (2.18–49.4). In no case did correction for oral contraception usage significantly alter these odds ratios. Increasing risk of ischaemic stroke was related to a change to increased frequency of headaches (trend p ≤ 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: These data support earlier reports of a relation between ischaemic stroke and migraine with aura. The risk seems particularly high in those whose initial migraine type involved aura occurring more than 12 times per year.

### New directions in migraine [^117AxcCQ]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common, episodic neurological disorder characterized by severe headaches. In about one-third of cases, it is preceded by a focal, transient neurological phenomenon termed the 'aura'. Whether migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO) are distinct or overlapping entities is somewhat contested, but it is not uncommon for patients to experience both forms of migraine. Migraine affects up to 18% of women and 6% of men, with a peak incidence between 25 and 55 years of age. The disease has long fascinated clinicians and scientists, with descriptions of migraine-like symptoms appearing in antiquity. Only recently have the pathogenic mechanisms started to be unraveled. This is particularly true for MA, which is perhaps a more homogeneous and tractable condition for study than MO, because the phenotype of MA is well-defined and genetics likely play a greater role.

The migraine aura is likely caused by 'cortical spreading depression' (CSD), a wave of intense neuronal and glial depolarization followed by a period of inactivity, slowly progressing over the cortex. The trigeminal system (TGVS), consisting of the meningeal and superficial cortical blood vessels that are innervated by the trigeminal nerve, is strongly implicated in the initiation of the headache pain. The TGVS projects to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in the brainstem, which in turn projects to higher-order pain centers. Animal models provide evidence that CSD could be linked to activation of the TGVS, thus providing a hypothetical triggering mechanism for the disorder.

### Migraine with and without aura in relation to the menstrual cycle and other hormonal milestones: A prospective cohort study [^112BLEgR]. Cephalalgia (2023). Low credibility.

Previous studies showed that the perimenstrual window is associated with an increased susceptibility to migraine attacks without aura but had conflicting results regarding attacks with aura.

- **Methods**: We performed a longitudinal E-diary study among 526 premenopausal women with migraine. Differences in the occurrence of perimenstrual migraine attacks between women with migraine with aura and without aura were assessed using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. Additionally, participants completed a questionnaire about the influence of hormonal milestones on migraine frequency.

- **Results**: The prevalence of menstrual migraine did not differ between women with migraine without aura and those with migraine with aura (59% versus 53%, p = 0.176). The increased risk of migraine attacks without aura during the perimenstrual window was similar for women with migraine without aura (OR[95%CI]:1.53 [1.44–1.62]) and those with migraine with aura (1.53 [1.44–1.62]). The perimenstrual window was not associated with an increased risk of migraine aura attacks (1.08 [0.93–1.26], p = 0.314). Women with migraine with aura more often reported increased migraine frequency during pregnancy and breastfeeding compared to women with migraine without aura, but not during hormonal contraception use.

- **Conclusion**: Sex hormone levels seem to differently affect the trigeminovascular system (migraine headache) and the susceptibility to cortical spreading depolarization (aura). Exclusively, migraine attacks without aura should be interpreted as perimenstrual attacks.

### Combined oral contraceptives in women with menstrual migraine without aura [^115j5eBC]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two regimens of combined oral contraception (COC), both containing 20 μg of ethinyl estradiol (E(2)) and 3 mg of drospirenone, in improving the severity of pure menstrual migraine without aura. A prospective, randomized study was conducted involving patients attending the gynecology department at the University of Siena for consultation regarding appropriate contraception.

- **Patient demographics**: Women aged 20 to 35 years (n = 60) suffering from pure menstrual migraine without aura participated in this study.

- **Interventions**: Three months of contraceptive use with ethinyl E(2) 20 μg/drospirenone 3 mg were administered in two different regimens: Group A received 21 active pills plus 7 placebo pills, while Group B received 24 active pills plus 4 placebo pills.

- **Main outcome measures**: Monthly evaluation of the duration and severity of patients' daily headache attacks was performed.

- **Results**: Both study groups demonstrated a significant reduction in the intensity and duration of menstrual migraine. However, patients in Group B (24/4 COC) reported a more significant reduction in intensity and a shorter duration of their menstrual migraine compared to Group A (21/7 COC).

- **Conclusions**: The 24/4 COC regimen is recommended as the preferred treatment for patients suffering from pure menstrual migraine without aura.

### SPL drug information for medroxyprogesterone acetate [^1121Ryxm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of medroxyprogesterone PO (also known as Provera, Depo-Provera, Depo-SubQ Provera):

- **Depressive episodes**: Use caution in women with a history of depression.
- **Diplopia, proptosis, migraine**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as medroxyprogesterone has been associated with these adverse events.
- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Use extreme caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease.
- **Exacerbation of porphyria**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing porphyria.
- **Exacerbation of SLE**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing SLE.
- **Fluid retention**: Use caution in patients with asthma, congestive HF, nephrotic syndrome or other renal disease, or cardiac disease.
- **Hyperglycemia**: Use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.
- **Migraine attacks**: Use caution in patients with a history of migraine.
- **Seizures**: Use caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: A secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1176Prwa]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Migraine with aura may respond differently to therapies than migraine without aura. Individuals with migraine with aura have an elevated vascular risk, necessitating a safety assessment of migraine preventive treatments in this patient subgroup.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy and safety profiles of erenumab in patients with migraine with aura.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This post hoc secondary analysis evaluated four double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials conducted in treatment centers across North America, Europe, Russia, and Turkey between August 6, 2013, and November 12, 2019. Participants were adults aged 18 to 65 years with episodic migraine or chronic migraine and were randomized to receive either erenumab or placebo.

- **Interventions**: One or more doses of erenumab (70 mg or 140 mg once per month) or placebo were administered by subcutaneous injection in the double-blind treatment phase. During the extension phases, open-label or dose-blinded active treatment with erenumab, 70 mg or 140 mg, was administered once per month by subcutaneous injection.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Efficacy assessments included change from baseline monthly migraine days (MMDs) and monthly acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM) days. Safety endpoints included patient incidences of adverse events. Subgroups of patients were categorized according to their history of aura.

- **Results**: Of the 2,682 patients who were randomized in the four trials, 1,400 (52.2%) received one or more doses of erenumab, 70 mg or 140 mg, and 1,043 (38.9%) received placebo.

### Guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: Fourth edition [^116XHMJM]. Cephalalgia (2019). Low credibility.

- **Stratification**: There is usually no need for stratification in acute treatment trials. However, stratification may be considered when an imbalance between the treatment groups or a significant factor could influence the results of a trial. Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects in different treatment groups, especially in smaller trials. Stratified randomization is sometimes used to circumvent potential imbalances. The EMA recommends that stratification variables usually be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value.

	- In controlled trials for migraine, the use of stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically demonstrated effects on primary efficacy endpoints. Stratification variables used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, headache intensity at baseline, migraine type (with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given the preponderance of females with migraine, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for imbalances in treatment groups.

- **Intention to treat**: Randomized controlled trials of acute treatments for migraine should follow the principle of intention to treat (ITT). This implies that analyses should include all randomized subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of the treatment they received.

### Loryna [^116nQWAQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The adverse reactions seen across the two indications overlapped and are reported using the frequencies from the pooled dataset. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were headache/migraine (6.7%), menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia) (4.7%), nausea/vomiting (4.2%), breast pain/tenderness (4%), and mood changes (mood swings, depression, depressed mood, and affect lability) (2.2%).

- **Pmdd clinical trials**: Safety data from trials for the indication of PMDD are reported separately due to differences in study design and setting in the contraception and acne studies compared to the PMDD clinical program. Two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (one parallel and one crossover designed) for the secondary indication of treating the symptoms of PMDD evaluated the safety and efficacy of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol during up to three cycles among 285 women aged 18–42, diagnosed with PMDD, and who took at least one dose of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol.

Common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of users) were menstrual irregularities (including vaginal hemorrhage [primarily spotting] and metrorrhagia) (24.9%), nausea (15.8%), headache (13.0%), breast tenderness (10.5%), fatigue (4.2%), irritability (2.8%), decreased libido (2.8%), increased weight (2.5%), and affect lability (2.1%).
