## Question

Should I withold SGLT2i in uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SGLT2 inhibitors should be withheld during a urinary tract infection and how to manage therapy in that context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the balance of cardiorenal benefits versus infection risk. Then, I should verify what randomized trials and real-world cohorts say about UTI risk and severity with SGLT2 inhibitors. Next, I will review guideline positions and FDA labeling for practical guidance. After that, I need to consider special populations and risk modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation for holding, treating, and resuming therapy, and I should double-check for any exceptions like euglycemic ketoacidosis or severe illness that might change management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk–benefit frame. SGLT2 inhibitors confer robust reductions in heart failure hospitalization, cardiovascular death, and kidney disease progression across diverse populations, including those with and without diabetes, which materially shifts the threshold for stopping therapy due to adverse events like infections [^117HNuYc] [^113VrdGn]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether the infection signal meaningfully changes this calculus, especially for severe UTI outcomes that drive morbidity and discontinuation decisions [^111VyW5E].

> Next, I should review the infection risk data carefully. Meta-analyses of randomized trials show a consistent increase in genital mycotic infections with SGLT2 inhibitors, but the signal for bacterial UTIs is small and inconsistent, with some analyses showing no significant increase overall and a modest signal limited to specific agents or doses, such as dapagliflozin 10 mg, while others show a slight uptick that remains clinically manageable [^115bnhYS] [^1142eoC3]. Wait, let me verify the real-world severe UTI data because that is most actionable. Multiple large cohort meta-analyses indicate SGLT2 inhibitors are not associated with increased risk of severe UTI and may even have a lower risk versus some comparators, which contradicts earlier pharmacovigilance concerns and supports continuation in many cases [^115qxEJA] [^111Vr34m] [^112z4u7F].

> I will now examine outcomes after incident UTI to see if stopping the SGLT2 inhibitor helps or harms. Observational target-trial emulation and matched cohorts show that discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors after a UTI is associated with higher risks of cardiovascular and kidney events without reducing recurrent UTI, whereas continuing therapy is associated with lower mortality and fewer kidney complications, suggesting net harm from stopping [^111BMCp8] [^113u3bjn] [^116LBpaJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought stopping might reduce recurrence, but the data actually show similar recurrence risk with continued use and worse cardiorenal outcomes with discontinuation, so I should correct that assumption and favor continuation when feasible [^111BMCp8].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The ACC expert consensus advises that the threshold to discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors for genital or urinary infections should be high given their outcome benefits, and that if stopped, the threshold to restart should be low once the infection is treated, with counseling on perineal hygiene and prompt treatment of symptoms [^113KJpTn]. The VA/DoD guideline similarly notes that a history of UTI is not a contraindication and emphasizes risk mitigation and monitoring rather than routine discontinuation [^111QH2BG]. I need to ensure I align with FDA labeling, which warns about serious UTIs and advises prompt evaluation and treatment; importantly, labels do not mandate automatic discontinuation for uncomplicated UTI, supporting individualized decisions rather than reflex holds [^116TgYNr] [^111TaFTo].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers. Older adults, women, and those with recurrent UTIs have higher baseline infection risk, yet even in these groups, large observational datasets suggest no excess severe UTI risk with SGLT2 inhibitors and potential cardiorenal benefit from continuation, though vigilance is warranted and hygiene counseling is essential [^115qxEJA] [^113SB2k9]. Hold on, I should verify whether poor glycemic control amplifies risk; some observational data suggest higher GU infection risk with very high A1c, but other population-based analyses found no difference by A1c strata, so the signal is mixed and should be contextualized rather than used as a blanket reason to stop therapy [^113Bf9Jn] [^1155ZMca].

> Now, I should translate this into a practical approach. For an uncomplicated, lower-tract UTI without systemic instability, I would not routinely withhold the SGLT2 inhibitor; instead, I would treat the infection per standard pathways, reinforce hydration and perineal hygiene, and monitor symptoms, because stopping does not reduce recurrence and may forfeit cardiorenal benefit [^111BMCp8] [^117HNuYc]. But wait, what if the patient is systemically ill, hemodynamically unstable, or has pyelonephritis or urosepsis? In those scenarios, I should hold the SGLT2 inhibitor temporarily while providing acute care, then reassess and resume once the patient is clinically stable, afebrile, tolerating oral intake, and completing appropriate antimicrobial therapy, given concerns around volume status, acid–base disturbances, and drug exposure during severe illness [^116nrwm4] [^116TgYNr].

> I should double-check for concurrent risk states that might change management. If there is concern for euglycemic ketoacidosis, active volume depletion, or major surgery, guidelines support holding SGLT2 inhibitors preemptively and resuming after stabilization, which is a separate issue from UTI per se but can coexist during acute illness and warrants a cautious pause [^113XVPnH] [^113nekPp]. Let me reconsider the bottom line: for most patients with a routine UTI, continue the SGLT2 inhibitor, treat the infection promptly, and resume normal dosing once improved; for severe or complicated infections, hold temporarily and restart after clinical stability to preserve the substantial cardiorenal benefits of this class [^117HNuYc] [^111BMCp8].

---

In general, **do not routinely withhold SGLT2 inhibitors for uncomplicated UTIs** [^113KJpTn]; treat the infection and continue therapy, as the risk of severe UTI is not increased [^115qxEJA] and cardiorenal benefits persist [^111BMCp8]. Hold or temporarily stop SGLT2 inhibitors only for **severe or complicated UTIs** (pyelonephritis, urosepsis, or recurrent infections) [^116TgYNr] until the patient is clinically stable and infection is controlled. Routine discontinuation for mild UTIs is unnecessary and may cause harm by losing cardiorenal protection [^111BMCp8].

## Clinical evidence on SGLT2 inhibitors and UTI risk

- **Genital mycotic infections**: SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of genital mycotic infections (vulvovaginitis, balanitis) [^115bnhYS], especially in women and uncircumcised men, but these are usually mild and respond to standard antifungal therapy [^1137AW7L] [^111TaFTo].

- **Urinary tract infections**: The risk of bacterial UTIs with SGLT2 inhibitors is modest and inconsistent across trials; some show a slight increase [^1142eoC3], others no difference [^112aURs3], and meta-analyses suggest no significant increase in severe UTIs [^115qxEJA] [^111Vr34m].

- **Severe UTIs**: Large trials and meta-analyses show no significant increase in pyelonephritis or urosepsis with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo or other glucose-lowering drugs [^114joB4A] [^115qxEJA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend **continuing SGLT2 inhibitors during uncomplicated UTIs**, with **temporary holding reserved for severe or complicated infections** (pyelonephritis, urosepsis, or recurrent infections) [^117HNuYc] [^111VyW5E]. Routine discontinuation for mild UTIs is not advised, as the cardiorenal benefits outweigh the modest infection risk [^113KJpTn].

---

## Clinical scenarios: when to withhold SGLT2 inhibitors

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) | Continue SGLT2 inhibitor; treat the infection [^111BMCp8] |
| Complicated UTI (pyelonephritis, urosepsis) | Temporarily withhold until clinically stable and infection controlled [^113gmpE2] |
| Recurrent UTIs (≥ 3/year) | Consider temporary withholding; reassess risk-benefit [^notfound] |
| Severe infection or sepsis | Temporarily withhold until resolved [^113gmpE2] |

---

## Clinical outcomes of continuing vs. withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during UTI

Continuing SGLT2 inhibitors during uncomplicated UTIs **does not increase the risk of severe infections** [^115qxEJA] and preserves cardiorenal benefits [^111BMCp8]. Conversely, withholding during uncomplicated UTIs offers no clear benefit and may lead to **loss of cardiorenal protection** [^111BMCp8].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Uncomplicated UTIs**: Continue SGLT2 inhibitors; treat the infection with standard antibiotics and monitor [^112aURs3].

- **Complicated UTIs**: Temporarily withhold until the patient is clinically stable and the infection is controlled; then resume [^116TgYNr].

- **Patient education**: Teach recognition of UTI symptoms and prompt seeking of care [^114joB4A].

- **Hygiene measures**: Emphasize perineal hygiene and hydration to reduce infection risk [^117HNuYc].

---

## Conclusion and clinical takeaways

- **Routine withholding**: Not recommended for uncomplicated UTIs; continue SGLT2 inhibitors and treat the infection [^111BMCp8].

- **Temporary withholding**: Reserve for severe or complicated UTIs (pyelonephritis, urosepsis, recurrent infections) until stable [^113gmpE2].

- **Risk-benefit**: The cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors outweigh the modest UTI risk; individualize decisions in recurrent or severe infections [^113KJpTn].

In sum, **do not routinely stop SGLT2 inhibitors for uncomplicated UTIs**; treat the infection and continue therapy, reserving temporary cessation for severe or complicated cases.

Revisions in Treatment Guidelines for DKD Management

Based on the outcomes of the CREDENCE trial in patients with CKD, the ADA 2020 and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2019 consensus statements strongly recommend (strength of recommendation A and 1B, respectively) as a current first-line standard of care SGLT2i in people with T2DM and DKD with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and particularly in those with > 300 mg/g albuminuria, with or without ASCVD, provided they have an adequate renal function.

Safety Concerns and Contraindications With SGLT2i

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are increasingly being recognized as antihyperglycemic agents for people with T2DM having established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for CVD, and for those with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. However, healthcare providers need to be cautious and vigilant about the specific safety concerns while prescribing them. Regulatory agencies, including the US FDA, the European Medicines Associations (EMA), and Health Canada have issued safety warnings for several AEs. These include AKI, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections (UTI), bone fractures, lower limb amputations, and acute and chronic pancreatitis. The association of acute and chronic pancreatitis with SGLT2i was reported in the safety review by Health Canada, which concluded that there may be a link between the use of SGLT2i and the risk of acute pancreatitis. However, there was only limited evidence to suggest a link with chronic pancreatitis. Table 3 summarizes the most common AEs associated with the use of SGLT2i.

Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Lower Limb Amputations: Across four empagliflozin outcome trials, lower limb amputation event rates were 4.3 and 5.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo group and the empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg dose group, respectively, with a HR of 1.05 (95% CI) (0.81, 1.36). In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial with empagliflozin, in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, and empagliflozin 10 mg treatment arms, respectively.

### Sodium glucose co-transport 2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind controlled trials [^116iKKcz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The discovery of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, with a novel mechanism independent of insulin secretion or sensitization, bring about a new therapeutic approach to the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors at different doses in randomized double blind clinical trials.

Methods

This meta-analysis was conducted by including randomized double-blind controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of their antidiabetic drug exposure history but with an inadequate glycemic control. All the effect sizes were computed using the random effects model. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (OR) were computed for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Additional analyses like sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were also performed.

Results

The pooled analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in mean changes in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (SMD = −0.78%, 95% CI, -0.87 to −0.69), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (SMD = −0.70 mg/dl, 95% CI, -0.79 to −0.61), body weight (overall SMD = −0.59 kg, 95% CI, -0.65 to −0.52) and blood pressure from baseline with SGLT2 inhibitors based therapy. Consistently a significant number of patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors achieved HbA1c < 7% (OR = 2.09, 95% CI, 1.77 to 2.46). SGLT2 inhibitors based therapy was associated with adverse events like genital and urinary tract infections.

Conclusion

All studied doses of SGLT2 inhibitors, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic agents, consistently improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, a small percentage of patients suffer from genital and urinary tract infections.

SGLT2i therapies should be prescribed with caution in people requiring a rapid reduction in insulin dose, due to insulinopenia, which may increase DKA risk. *Decisions should be based upon recent eGFR measurement, rather than historical tests. ‡ SGLT2i therapies may be initiated in people with eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Individuals already treated with canagliflozin or empagliflozin who demonstrate renal decline may continue treatment until eGFR reaches < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Dapagliflozin should be discontinued for those who demonstrate eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Urinary symptoms, due to glucosuria, can be an issue for people prescribed SGLT2i medicines. However, UTIs are relatively rare and these medicines may be prescribed for people with a history of UTIs. ◆Monitor HbA1c levels regularly and cease SGLT2is if elevated levels continue, following treatment initiation. SGLT2i treatments are not currently recommended for use alongside loop diuretics. However, this may be subject to change as the evidence-base evolves. EMPA-REG and CANVAS CV outcome trials included subgroups of people with T2DM who were receiving loop diuretics and ongoing trials aim to evaluate co-prescribing of these agents. † SGLT2i treatment should be suspended in individuals with acute illness until fully recovered

The tool aims to support clinicians in selecting appropriate people with T2DM for SGLT2i therapies, in line with the current evidence base and guidelines.

### Urinary tract and genital infections in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115bnhYS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the effects of different sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and genital infections in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Materials and Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to October 9, 2016 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the occurrence of UTIs and genital infections in patients with T2DM treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-regression was performed to assess explanatory factors that might influence effect size.

Results

A total of 52 RCTs involving 36 689 patients were eligible for our meta-analysis. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin were associated with a higher risk of genital infections than placebo, with ORs ranging from 3.21 (95% CI 2.08–4.93) for dapagliflozin 2.5 mg to 5.23 (95% CI 3.86–7.09) for canagliflozin 300 mg. Only dapagliflozin 10 mg led to significantly more UTIs than placebo. The increased risk of UTIs and genital infections seemed to have a dose-response relationship for dapagliflozin only. No factors that had a significant modification effect on these infectious events were detected in meta-regression analysis.

Conclusions

The present study found that canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin were associated with a significantly higher risk of genital infections compared with placebo and other active treatments. Only dapagliflozin had a dose-response relationship with UTIs and genital infections.

### Rationale and design of the renal lifecycle trial assessing the effect of dapagliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes in severe chronic kidney disease [^114Nm4mw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, limited data are available on the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in KTRs. It is important to investigate this issue in this specific population to obtain a solid evidence-based rationale for treating (or not) these patients with SGLT2 inhibitors. Data obtained in CKD patients cannot automatically be extrapolated to KTRs, as mechanisms leading to disease progression may be different between these groups. However, preliminary data on SGLT2 inhibitors suggest efficacy in the KTR population. Lim et al. showed in a retrospective study that KTRs with T2DM who had been treated with SGLT2 inhibitors had a better prognosis with respect to all-cause mortality, death-censored graft failure and doubling of serum creatinine compared with KTRs with T2DM not treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, no safety issues emerged in this study. Initially there was a concern that these drugs would cause an increased risk for urinary tract infections, which could pose a particular risk for KTRs, given the unphysiological anatomy of their urinary tract and the use of immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, the exclusion criterion of two or more urinary tract/genital infections in the last 6 months was implemented in our study protocol. However, the study by Lim et al. found no increased risk for urinary tract infections and only a mildly increased risk for genital mycotic infections. This is in line with a meta-analysis that included safety data for most large-scale RCTs with SGLT2 inhibition in cardiovascular as well as kidney disease. This meta-analysis only showed an increased risk for genital infections, with a number needed to harm of 41, but not for urinary tract infections. In general, genital infections usually can be easily treated by antimycotic agents and therefore safety does not seem to be compromised. Yet these safety data should also be interpreted with caution, being derived from non-KTR populations.

Hospitalized heart failure — sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitor initiation and safety: "Early initiation of an SGLT inhibitor can be considered any time after admission in patients who are hemodynamically stable with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 20 mL/min/m²". "SGLT inhibitors should not be initiated in patients with evidence of hypovolemia and should trigger reassessment of diuretic requirements". They are "associated with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis" and "are thus not approved in type 1 diabetes"; in patients with "T2DM, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis is rare, but signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia should be monitored, and blood glucose levels should be reassessed after the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors". The text adds, "Glucosuria increases the risk of urinary tract and genital mycotic infections, especially in patients with T2DM", and highlights access considerations: "Out-of-pocket cost is currently a concern… including SGLT inhibitors… Thus, affordability should be routinely determined before discharge".

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^115qxEJA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective:

There is limited knowledge about severe urinary tract infections associated with SGLT2i, despite this being the basis for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning. We aim to provide real-world evidence to clarify this relationship further.

Data source:

A literature review was performed in PubMed and Embase for cohort studies published up to August 2024 using PICO-consistent terms.

Study selection and data extraction:

Cohort studies in English involving new users of SGLT2i that compare SGLT2i with glucagon-like receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), DPP4i, and other glucose-lowering medications and report severe urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data synthesis:

The random-effect model determined the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for severe UTI. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to identify sources of heterogeneity. In 11 cohort studies involving 679 617 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a median age of 64 (interquartile range [IQR] = 56–72) and 42% (IQR = 39%-51%) females, it was found that the use of SGLT2i was associated with a reduced risk of severe UTI compared with both composite glucose-lowering medications (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60–0.88) and DPP4i (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.43–0.54). There was no significant difference in the risk compared with GLP-1RA (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.78–1.14).

Relevance to patient care and clinical practice:

The lack of increased risk for severe UTI reassures physicians when assessing benefit-risk to continue SGLT2i after a severe UTI. This may enhance patient adherence and improve diabetes management. Furthermore, our findings show no significant risk increase in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who would benefit significantly from SGLT2i.

Conclusion:

SGLT2i does not appear to pose a greater risk of severe UTI than other oral glucose-lowering medications. This contributes to the existing literature on UTI, accounting for the event's severity. However, more data are needed to assess the potential association between SGLT2i and life-threatening UTI events.

### Efficacy, safety and regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors: focus on canagliflozin [^115fo7vK]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing, with a burden of 382 million patients worldwide at present (more than the entire US population). The International Diabetes Federation anticipates an increase up to 592 million patients by 2035. Another major problem arises from the fact that just 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at target glycaemic control with currently available medications. Therefore, a clear need for new therapies that aim to optimize glycaemic control becomes evident. Renal sodium-linked glucose transporter 2 inhibitors are new antidiabetic drugs with an insulin-independent mechanism of action. They pose one remarkable advantage compared with already established antidiabetics: increasing urinary glucose excretion without inducing hypoglycaemia, thereby promoting body weight reduction due to loss of ~300 kcal per day. This review focuses on canagliflozin, which was the first successful compound of this class to be approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in 2013. Clinical trials showed promising results: enhancing glycaemic control was paralleled by reducing body weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Nevertheless, some safety concerns remain, such as genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and cardiovascular risks in vulnerable patients, which will be closely monitored in several post-authorization safety studies.

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study, we found that SGLT2Is were associated with a higher risk of MEGI, compared with GLP-1RAs, among male patients with T2D. The HR for MEGI formation was 1.65 (95% CI, 1.59–1.71). The cumulative incidence of MEGI increased over a 3-year follow-up period with prolonged medication use. Moreover, regardless of age, kidney function, and diabetes control, the risk of MEGI was consistently higher in the SGLT2I group than in the GLP-1RA group. Additionally, the comparable levels of glycemic control and changes in kidney function observed in both the SGLT2I and GLP-1RA groups suggest that the mechanisms contributing to the increased incidence of MEGI with SGLT2I use are independent of these factors. The results from sensitivity analyses remained consistent across various statistical approaches, follow-up periods, and databases. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that SGLT2Is may carry a higher risk of MEGI than GLP-1RAs in patients with T2D. The estimated number needed to harm was 150, which provides a clinically interpretable measure of risk and may aid in shared decision-making. Clinicians should counsel patients with T2D about the potentially increased risks of MEGI associated with the use of SGLT2Is.

SGLT2Is manage glycemic control by inhibiting glucose reabsorption, thereby increasing glucose excretion to urine via the kidneys. Glucosuria has been proposed as a key mechanism underlying the increasing risk of UTIs. Furthermore, in 2015, the FDA announced that SGLT2Is might elevate the risk of serious UTIs. However, the association between SGLT2Is and UTIs remains controversial. Some studies, have demonstrated an association between the use of SGLT2Is and an increased risk of UTIs. Conversely, many studies, have found no significant difference in UTI prevalence when comparing SGLT2Is with placebos or other antiglycemic medications. Therefore, it remains a matter for debate whether patients with T2D who are at risk of complicated UTIs should discontinue SGLT2Is.

### Sodium glucose co-transport 2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind controlled trials [^112BhfVt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, in patients with type 2 diabetes, all studied doses of SGLT2 inhibitors either as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic agents improved glycemic control consistently. Furthermore SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a significant reduction in body weight and blood pressure. However, a small percentage of patients suffer from genital and urinary tract infections. Yet, SGLT2 inhibitors appear to be safe as the number of hypoglycemic events and the number of patients who discontinued therapy were similar between SGLT2 inhibitor treated groups from placebo treated patients. Finally, further investigations with long term duration of therapy are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Adverse events

The incidence of adverse drug reactions of special interest (polyuria, volume depletion-related events, urinary tract infection (UTI), genital infection, and hypoglycemia) was 2.1, 1.6, 2.1, 2.6, and 7.9%, respectively. These events were mild or moderate in intensity, with more than 90% occurring in the first 24 weeks. UTI or genital infection occurred more frequently in women than in men. Signs or symptoms suggestive of UTI or genital infection responded to standard treatment typically without stopping of SGLT2i therapy. No event of pyelonephritis was found. No diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurred during study period but one major episode of hypoglycemia after SGLT2i treatment which judged to be non-medicated related. Accumulative rate of non-severe hypoglycemia increased from 11.9% at baseline to 19.8% at the last follow-up (median time 16 months). No discontinuations were due to hypoglycemia. A comparison of total adverse events in the elderly and younger patients showed no difference between two groups of patients (9.2% vs. 10.6%, p value = 0.596).

The lack of increased risk for severe UTI reassures physicians when assessing benefit-risk to continue SGLT2i after a severe UTI. This may enhance patient adherence and improve diabetes management. Furthermore, our findings show no significant risk increase in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who would benefit significantly from SGLT2i.

Conclusion

SGLT2i does not appear to pose a greater risk of severe UTI than other oral glucose-lowering medications. This contributes to the existing literature on UTI, accounting for the event's severity. However, more data are needed to assess the potential association between SGLT2i and life-threatening UTI events.

### A survey of the FDA's adverse event reporting system database concerning urogenital tract infections and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 Inhibitor use [^116KKEEQ]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis of RCTs in 2016 showed that canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin were associated with a significantly higher risk of genital infections compared with placebo and other active treatments; however, this conclusion is derived from the results of RCTs. In our real-world study, we also found that canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and their combination have a risk of UTIs, which are consistent. Similarly, from the available data, we are still unable to judge whether the above drugs have differences in the incidence of UTIs. Therefore, we recommend that the medical staff should pay attention to the UTIs problem when using SGLT-2i.

Although female patients, particularly those aged 16–64 years, are significantly more likely to experience UTIs than male patients, urinary infections frequently occur in both genders and across all age groups, and specific situations such as pregnancy, use in the elderly, menstruation, catheterization, diabetes, and other opportunities to induce infection are especially relevant. The results of our study confirmed that the incidence of SGLT-2i-associated UTIs in women was significantly higher than that in men. After analyzing the reasons, we believe that this effect may be related to the following factors: (1) women have special physiology and anatomy since the urogenital tract environment and pH value cause UTIs to occur more easily; (2) female urogenital tract blood circulation is different from that of men, i.e. when using the same doses, there may be a difference in the local blood drug concentration; and (3) the symptoms are mild or asymptomatic after early genitourinary infection in women and are often ignored and cannot be treated promptly. Considering all of the above factors, our results confirm that stratification of isolates from unselected patients on the basis of gender can improve reasonable SGLT-2i use and reduce the incidence of ADRs. However, patient age is not a significant factor in determining SGLT-2i-associated UTIs in our research.

### Risk factors for genital infections in people initiating SGLT2 inhibitors and their impact on discontinuation [^114aGSch]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are an increasingly important oral medication class in type 2 diabeteswith their use climbing dramatically in recent years. They result in a broadly similar amount of glucose lowering compared with other oral agents but can also reduce blood pressure and result in modest weight loss. In addition to their glucose lowering effects, large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated reduction in cardiovascular and renal outcomes in high-risk groups with type 2 diabetes, as well as benefit in patients with heart failure whether or not they have type 2 diabetes. They can also be used as adjuvant therapy to insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

SGLT2i reduce hyperglycemia in people with diabetes by increasing urinary excretion of glucose. This induced glycosuria increases the risk of genital infectionsand both clinical trials and observational studies demonstrate a 2.5–6-fold increase in genital infections in people using SGLT2i compared with controls. A number of factors have been shown to be associated with risk of genital infection in the general population, in particular, female sex and diabetes, especially when glycemic control is poor. However, there has been limited investigation of the risk factors for genital tract infection in those initiating SGLT2i therapy, or of the impact of infection on treatment discontinuation outside of a trial setting.

We aimed to determine the factors associated with the risk for developing a genital infection while on SGLT2i treatment and the impact of these infections on treatment discontinuation.

### Efficacy, safety and regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors: focus on canagliflozin [^112od9JT]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising new class of antidiabetic drugs currently approved in Europe, the US and Japan. They allow weight-reducing and effective glycaemic control combined with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The medication can be used in any stage of the disease independently of existing co-medications. Furthermore, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in addition to insulin therapy in type 1 diabetic patients is conceivable, for example, to improve their glycaemic profile and avoid hyperglycaemia. However, whether SGLT2 inhibitor therapy also improves the clinical consequences of diabetes, such as micro- or macrovascular late complications, cannot be answered at present owing to immature clinical data, and provides some uncertainty of this class of drugs. Caution with these drugs should be exercised in elderly patients (tendency to dehydration and urinary-, genital infections), patients with recurrent urinary tract or genital infections and patients with reduced renal function (reduced efficacy).

### Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin (Qtern) [^113vjHGE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Heart Failure

In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Subjects with a prior history of heart failure and subjects with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment.

Consider the risks and benefits of QTERN prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk of heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of QTERN.

5.4 Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating QTERN in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. QTERN is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)].

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors… [^111srhA9]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors are a class of prescription medicines that are FDA-approved for use with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. Medicines in the SGLT2 inhibitor class include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin. They are available as single-ingredient products and also in combination with other diabetes medicines such as metformin. SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood sugar by causing the kidneys to remove sugar from the body through the urine. The safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors have not been established in patients with type 1 diabetes, and FDA has not approved them for use in these patients.

3.6 Subgroup analysis

Figure 3 displays subgroup analyses of mortality comparing SGLT2i and DPP‐4i users. Significant reductions in mortality with SGLT2i were observed among females, patients under 65 years, those with HbA1c ≥ 7%, and in patients without CVD or without IHD. In contrast, no significant mortality differences were observed among males, older adults, patients of other races, those with higher BMI, lower HbA1c, or reduced eGFR.

FIGURE 3
Subgroup analysis of mortality comparing SGLT2i versus DPP‐4i users. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown for each subgroup. The vertical dashed line indicates the null value (HR = 1). BMI, body mass index; CVD, cardiovascular disease; DPP‐4i, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HbA1c, haemoglobin A1c; IHD, ischaemic heart disease; SGLT2i, sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitor.

For the outcome of MACE (Figure S6), there is no significant difference between SGLT2i and DPP‐4i users in any subgroup. For MAKE (Figure S7), SGLT2i shows greater benefit in specific subgroups, particularly among patients under 65 years, White patients, those with HbA1c ≥ 7% but < 8%, and those without CVD or IHD. For all‐cause hospitalisation (Figure S8), SGLT2i is generally favoured, with significant reductions observed among males, White and African American patients, individuals with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², those without CVD or IHD, and those with HbA1c ≥ 7%.

### SGLT2 inhibitors-the new standard of care for cardiovascular, renal and metabolic protection in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^1137AW7L]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Genital mycotic infections (vulvovaginitis and balanitis) can occur during SGLT2i treatment, with infections being more common in women than men and usually arising early in treatment. Severe bacterial urinary tract infections (such as pyelonephritis and urosepsis) are rare, and analysis of trial data and real-world evidence does not support a causal link with SGLT2i treatment. Standard topical or oral antifungal or antibiotic treatments are generally sufficient to manage minor genital infections and most people can continue taking their SGLT2i medication. Glucosuria may cause urinary symptoms, including more frequent voiding, and people with diabetes should receive education regarding the importance of post-micturition genital hygiene and hydration.

Over the past decade, clinical experience, data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and real-world evidence have helped to enhance understanding of the risks associated with SGLT2is, particularly the rare but severe AEs such as Fournier's gangrene (FG), a perineal tissue infection, and lower limb amputations (LLAs). Yet, there is still uncertainty surrounding these potential side effects. Continued placement of historical warnings regarding FG and LLAs on the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)/Department of Health (DoH) website as well as those in the British National Formulary (BNF) add further uncertainty for HCPs concerning actual risk levels for people who might otherwise be suitable for treatment. The MHRA, DoH and BNF statements are based upon outdated data, which have since been superseded by reassuring clinical outcomes from large scale CVOT and kidney disease trials conducted in high-risk populations. These studies showed that the incidence of FG was low and not confined to the active treatment arm, with higher incidence in the placebo arm in some trials (DAPA-CKD; DECLARE). Recent combined post hoc analysis from RCTs conducted in people with T2DM and high CV risk and/or CKD, the CANVAS Program and CREDENCE, showed that canagliflozin treatment did not affect the risk of non-genital skin and soft tissue infections compared with placebo. People living with diabetes are inherently at elevated risk for LLA events. Excess amputations were reported in one CVOT and were not replicated across subsequent trials. Everyone with T2DM should be educated regarding the importance of preventative foot care and regular comprehensive assessment of lower limbs must be included in clinical reviews. Risk factors for LLAs include prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy, although these groups may gain advantage through the lowering of CVD risk associated with SGLT2is. The Nuffield Department of Population Health Renal Studies Group meta-analysis stressed that the disease-modifying effects and absolute benefits of SGLT2i treatment outweighed any serious hazards of ketoacidosis or limb amputation. Awareness of the key signs and symptoms is critical so that prompt and appropriate action can be taken when required for all people with T2DM. In addition, the osmotic diuretic effects of SGLT2i therapies may be advantageous for people who have limb-dependent oedema, even with active ulceration. Discussion with the local diabetes foot multidisciplinary team (MDT) is warranted if SGLT2is are considered suitable in this situation. Experts across the field are currently working to develop a Delphi consensus statement regarding the diabetic foot, which will help in guiding appropriate use of medicines in high-risk individuals. It is hoped that the consensus will be available during the early part of 2024.

SGLT-2 inhibitors — patient preferences and tolerability — patient preferences are similar regarding this treatment; the patient focus group noted that medication and blood glucose monitoring (BGM) adherence could be burdensome, so an oral medication taken once daily without regard to food and without frequent BGM requirements might be preferable over other options; taking a single medication for multiple benefits is anticipated to be viewed favorably by most patients, though some patients might experience intolerable polyuria or recurrent genitourinary infections leading to treatment discontinuation.

### Association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes after urinary tract infection [^112tVsea]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The observed survival benefit aligns with cardiovascular outcome trials such as Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA‐REG OUTCOME), the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS), and the Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE–TIMI 58), which demonstrated all‐cause mortality reductions with SGLT2i, albeit with variability in effect size and consistency. Meta‐analyses further support a class‐wide mortality benefit, especially for empagliflozin. Our study adds evidence for mortality reduction in a post‐UTI context, a phase marked by heightened systemic stress but often underrepresented in trials. Notably, survival benefit was seen even among patients without prior CVD, suggesting that SGLT2i may mitigate early pathophysiological processes — such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction or autonomic imbalance — triggered by infection. Subgroup analyses showed stronger effects among women, younger individuals, and those without baseline CVD, who may retain greater physiological reserve. The early separation in survival curves (Figure 2A) underscores the potential value of timely SGLT2i initiation. Although not designed to establish superiority, the comparison with DPP‐4i argues against deferring SGLT2i initiation during recovery.

### Glucuretic effects and renal safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113bqX1X]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States, the European Union and other countries. Dapagliflozin increases renal glucose excretion in an insulin-independent manner, and its mechanism of action is complementary to those of other antidiabetes medications. When used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes medications or insulin, dapagliflozin improves glycemic measures in patients with T2DM. Dapagliflozin treatment is also associated with weight reduction and a decrease in blood pressure, both of which may be beneficial in patients with T2DM. Because of its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin has a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, dapagliflozin is well tolerated, with the frequency of most adverse events similar to that seen with placebo. Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in dapagliflozin-treated groups compared with placebo groups. In the clinical development program, more cases of newly diagnosed bladder cancer were reported for patients treated with dapagliflozin (0.17%) compared with placebo or comparator (0.03%). Although there were not enough cases to determine causality, dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer. Dapagliflozin may decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function. Renal function should be monitored before initiation of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m². No cardiovascular safety signals have been detected for dapagliflozin, and a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study is ongoing. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that dapagliflozin is a promising new treatment option for T2DM.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in older adults — SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HbA1c by ~0.8%, can reduce weight, and do not cause hypoglycemia; empagliflozin and canagliflozin have been shown to decrease major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, and the progression of CKD; these compounds cause an obligate increase in urine volume and an increase in urogenital candida infections, and because adverse effects related to volume depletion were more frequent in older patients treated with canagliflozin, recommendations limit the dosage to 100 mg/d in such patients.

### Risk of infections with SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP4 inhibitors: a population-based cohort study using antibiotic dispensing data [^113ieTQi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

People with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of infections, including pneumonia, skin infections, and urinary tract infections. Sodium–glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2) have been associated with an increased risk of genital infections, but some evidence suggests they may reduce the risk of severe infections. However, data on antibiotic use for milder infections in this population are limited.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Does initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, compared with dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP4) inhibitors, affect antibiotic use following hospital discharge in individuals with type 2 diabetes?
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

Initiators of SGLT2 inhibitors had lower numbers of antibiotic dispensings and lower cumulative defined daily doses compared with initiators of DPP4 inhibitors.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

These findings suggest that the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors may be associated with a lower risk of infections in people with type 2 diabetes. This potential benefit adds to the understanding of the broader effects of these treatments beyond glycemic control and could inform clinical decision‐making in diabetes management.

### Empagliflozin and linagliptin (Glyxambi) [^114quRym]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

There have been reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving empagliflozin. Treatment with empagliflozin increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when GLYXAMBI is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin. Therefore, a lower dosage of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with GLYXAMBI.

5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with GLYXAMBI presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue GLYXAMBI, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.7 Genital Mycotic Infections

Empagliflozin increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^116v7hYc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This real-world study provides insights into the FDA's 2015 communication regarding SGLT2i and severe urinary tract infections, indicating that SGLT2i does not appear to increase the risk of severe UTIs compared with other glucose-lowering therapies. This is important as SGLT2i is considered by the ADA as the preferred treatment for T2DM, providing significant improvements in cardiovascular health compared with older-generation glucose-lowering medications.

The findings have important clinical implications, reassuring physicians and reducing treatment discontinuation after a severe UTI event, ultimately enhancing adherence, particularly for patients on the low-risk end. Also, it facilitates the assessment of benefits and risks for prescribing SGLT2i to CKD patients in greater need of its protective effects and enhances guideline implementation.

Unlike older-generation glucose-lowering therapies, SGLT2i effectively and preferably treats T2DM while providing cardioprotective benefits that may prevent decompensation during acute events. They may also have immunomodulatory effects, potentially explaining the reduced association in CKD.

As adverse events are a common reason for non-adherence, improving this aspect could help reduce the need for exogenous insulin, lower hospitalization rates, and decrease overall mortality.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^114WsZ8X]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

This study is important for 2 main reasons. First, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are hospitalized due to pyelonephritis or urosepsis face a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. Second, studies on general urinary tract infections may not have a universally agreed-upon standard for diagnosis and sometimes need to differentiate between UTI with unspecific symptoms and asymptomatic bacteriuria based on subjective clinical judgment. Hospitalization outcomes may be less susceptible to reporting or detection bias, for instance, severe UTI diagnosed by blood and urine bacterial cultures associated with sepsis criteria.

### Dapagliflozin versus glipizide as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin: a randomized, 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled noninferiority trial [^113efipS]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Although initially effective, sulfonylureas are associated with poor glycemic durability, weight gain, and hypoglycemia. Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), reduces hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion independent of insulin and may cause fewer of these adverse effects. We compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dapagliflozin with the sulfonylurea glipizide in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.

Research Design and Methods

This 52-week, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled, noninferiority trial randomized patients with type 2 diabetes (baseline mean HbA(1c), 7.7%), who were receiving metformin monotherapy, to add-on dapagliflozin (n = 406) or glipizide (n = 408) up-titrated over 18 weeks, based on glycemic response and tolerability, to ≤ 10 or ≤ 20 mg/day, respectively.

Results

The primary end point, adjusted mean HbA(1c) reduction with dapagliflozin (-0.52%) compared with glipizide (-0.52%), was statistically noninferior at 52 weeks. Key secondary end points: dapagliflozin produced significant adjusted mean weight loss (-3.2 kg) versus weight gain (1.2 kg; P < 0.0001) with glipizide, significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 5% body weight reduction (33.3%) versus glipizide (2.5%; P < 0.0001), and significantly decreased the proportion experiencing hypoglycemia (3.5%) versus glipizide (40.8%; P < 0.0001). Events suggestive of genital infections and lower urinary tract infections were reported more frequently with dapagliflozin compared with glipizide but responded to standard treatment and rarely led to study discontinuation.

Conclusions

Despite similar 52-week glycemic efficacy, dapagliflozin reduced weight and produced less hypoglycemia than glipizide in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin. Long-term studies are required to further evaluate genital and urinary tract infections with SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Sodium glucose Co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: targeting the kidney to improve glycemic control in diabetes mellitus [^117Hj4wc]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

UTI events after 24 weeks were reported in 8.3–10.3% of empagliflozin patients versus 8.0% of those on placebo, and the rates of genital infection events were 2.3–2.7% for empagliflozin and 0.9% for placebo. A pooled analysis of safety data from four 24-week phase 3 trials (n = 2,477) examined the effect of empagliflozin on UTIs and genital infections. The percentage of patients with events consistent with a UTI was similar across all groups (7.5% and 9.3% for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, vs. 8.2% for placebo); however, more patients receiving empagliflozin reported events consistent with genital infection (4.2% and 3.6% for empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg, respectively, vs. 0.7% for placebo). Both types of event were more common in women than in men, and were more common in patients with a history of UTI or genital infection. Nevertheless, of those who reported events consistent with UTI or genital infection, most experienced only one episode; the episodes were generally mild in severity, and very few led to study discontinuation [4 cases of UTI (placebo: 1 case; empagliflozin: 2 cases, 10 mg and 1 case, 25 mg); 3 cases of genital infection (empagliflozin: 1 case, 10 mg; 2 cases, 25 mg)].

### Safety of ipragliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: pooled analysis of phase II / III / IV clinical trials [^115hPkEa]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The lack of excess UTI and increased incidence of genital infections with ipragliflozin vs placebo are consistent with results from a meta-analysis of 77 randomised controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors which showed no significant risk in UTIs vs control (2526/29,086 vs 1278/14,940; risk ratio [RR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.98–1.12), but an increased risk of genital infections (1521/24,017 vs 216/12,552; RR 3.30, 95% CI 2.74–3.99). A recent safety announcement issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned that cases of Fournier's gangrene, a rare but serious genital infection, have also been reported with SGLT2 inhibitors. In our analysis, no case of Fournier's gangrene was reported, and TEAEs related to genital infection were generally mild and rarely led to treatment discontinuation.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113jtLEs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are described as having well-documented cardiovascular benefits in stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with type 2 diabetes and in heart failure (HF); semaglutide reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in overweight or obese patients with stable ASCVD but has not been studied early after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). SGLT-2 inhibitors may increase risks including urinary tract infection, genital mycotic infection, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury, and due to perioperative ketoacidosis risk canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should be stopped ≥ 3 days and ertugliflozin ≥ 4 days before scheduled surgery including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After myocardial infarction (MI), efficacy and safety have been evaluated in 2 large trials; in patients without diabetes or HF and with acute MI and impaired left ventricular systolic function, dapagliflozin did not reduce cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, and empagliflozin did not significantly reduce all-cause death or first HF hospitalization, although empagliflozin reduced HF hospitalizations in this population. No new safety concerns were identified, and use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor does not need to be deferred at hospital discharge in patients with an indication.

### Risk of urogenital bacterial infection with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: a retrospective cohort study using a claims database [^115JhBos]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several potential reasons for the observed decrease in UTI incidence among patients with diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors in this study. Clinicians may have expanded their advice to patients using SGLT2 inhibitors, advocating increased hydration to mitigate UTI risks. Given the widespread concern among clinicians regarding the increased UTI risk among users of SGLT2 inhibitors, there may have been a tendency to refrain from prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients at an elevated risk of UTIs. Although we made substantial efforts to address this issue by extensively adjusting for UTI risk factors, the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors cannot be entirely ruled out. Moreover, while SGLT2 inhibitors may possess a greater glucose-lowering effect compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, the disease severity remains unknown due to the absence of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values in this database. Additionally, the database included a limited number of older individuals, who are typically at a higher risk for UTIs. Subgroup analyses of UTI focusing on older individuals showed similar results across different sex and age groups, indicating the potential relevance of the findings for high-risk populations. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first to identify an association between SGLT2 inhibitors and genital bacterial infections, although it is well-documented that genital mycotic infection is a common adverse effect of SGLT2 inhibitor use. High glucose concentrations in urine are known to accelerate the growth rate of Escherichia coli. SGLT2 inhibitors facilitate both sodium and glucose excretion in the proximal tubules, potentially reducing skin hypertonicity by lowering tissue sodium content. These mechanisms could potentially compromise the skin barrier, heightening susceptibility to soft tissue infection. However, a pooled post hoc analysis from two randomized trials showed that canagliflozin did not increase the risk of non-genital soft tissue infections compared to placebo (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85–1.11). Additionally, several retrospective cohort studies using a claims database showed no significant association between SGLT2 inhibitor use and FG. Consistent with these findings, our results did not indicate an association between SGLT2 inhibitor use and the risk of perineal soft tissue infections.

### SGLT1 and SGLT1 inhibitors: a role to be assessed in the current clinical practice [^114RPer3]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a complex disease of increasingly common occurrence worldwide. Attaining optimal glycemic control is the main challenge to prevent the development of diabetes-related complications and/or to stop their progression. In recent years, the pharmacologic toolkit for the treatment of diabetes has considerably expanded, thus paving the way to more pathophysiology-oriented therapies. For instance, the sodium-glucose cotransporters SGLT2 and SGLT1 have been in the spotlight because of better knowledge of their physiology and therapeutic potential. At present, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitors are widely applied in current clinical practice as an effective and well-tolerated treatment that increases the urinary excretion of glucose, less is known about the use of SGLT1 inhibitors. SGLT1s are of primary importance in the small intestine, an organ that does not express SGLT2, while in the kidney they are expressed in the late renal proximal tubules, where it reabsorbs the glucose escaped from the upstream SGLT2. Hence, SGLT1-mediated glucose reabsorption in the kidney is increased when the tubular glucose load overwhelms the capacity of SGLT2 or when the latter is inhibited. The role of SGLT1 in intestinal and renal glucose transport makes the transporter a potential target for antidiabetic therapy. Here, we briefly report the evidence on LX2761, a new inhibitor against SGLT1 and SGLT2 in vitro, which acts in vivo as a selective inhibitor of SGLT1 in the gastrointestinal tract. LX2761 improves glycemic control without the glycosuria-related side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly genitourinary tract infections. However, whether it represents a valid therapeutic option for all patients with diabetes or is more appropriate for specific phenotypes, e.g., patients with concomitant diabetes and chronic kidney disease, who may benefit less from the renal mechanism of selective SGLT2 inhibitors, remains to be tested in large randomized controlled trials.

### Advances in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. IV. sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, part 2: mechanisms for myocardial protection, adverse effects, and perioperative implications [^113JWnY2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

This second part of a two-part review on the cardiovascular pharmacology of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) describes the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how these drugs improve outcomes in heart failure and myocardial infarction and discusses their adverse effects and perioperative implications for patients with or without diabetes undergoing major surgery. The mechanism(s) by which SGLT2i exert beneficial cardiovascular actions are incompletely understood at present, but they are most likely multifactorial in origin, as no single factor has been proven definitive when considered alone. SGLT2i increase the risk of genital mycotic infections and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with diabetes, but the drugs do not cause severe hypoglycemia requiring intervention, urinary tract infection, hypovolemia, or acute kidney injury, among other postulated adverse outcomes. Perioperative euglycemic DKA (euDKA) is rare, but vigilance for its occurrence is required when an anion gap metabolic acidosis develops despite normal or only modestly elevated glucose concentration. Current guidelines recommend withholding SGLT2i for at least 48 hours to minimize the risk of DKA before elective major surgery in patients with but not without diabetes. The guidelines further emphasize the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for DKA and euDKA when SGLT2i therapy cannot be stopped because of urgent or emergent surgery so that appropriate treatment can be promptly initiated to prevent morbidity and mortality.

5.2 Debated safety issues

There are different uncertainties as regards the risk of BKAs, bone fractures, infections and ketoacidosis, which were not scrutinized in CVD‐REAL studies. Genital and urinary tract infections were associated with all members of the class and predictable on the basis of the mechanism of action; although the true rate in clinical practice is still uncertain, the high reporting frequency in the postmarketing phase calls for real‐time pharmacovigilance monitoring. 50 The overall evidence suggests that SGLT2‐Is increase the risk of genital mycotic infections by four to five times according to the largest MA, 51 although they are usually mild to moderate, can be adequately treated with standard medical therapy, and drug discontinuation is not required. Conversely, gathered evidence is not consistent for an increased risk of urinary infections, with MAs showing mixed results. 52 However, clinicians should be aware that severe infections have been described, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis, especially in patients with urinary tract outlet obstruction.

The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was publicly disseminated by the FDA, which released a warning in May 2015 based on 20 case reports (both in type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM patients), and by the European Medicines Agency in June 2015, which identified a total of 147 cases of DKA in patients treated with SGLT2‐Is. A recent literature review analysed RCTs, cohort studies, case reports and pharmacovigilance database studies 53: DKA incidence was less than 1/1000 in RCTs (in line with data from an MA 54) and 1.6/1000 person‐years in cohort studies. In case reports and in pharmacovigilance databases, duration of SGLT2‐I treatment before DKA onset was extremely variable; overall, DKA is a rare adverse event during SGLT2‐I therapy, with fatal episodes representing 1.6% of all reported cases. 55 The latest cohort investigations compared SGLT2‐Is with DPP4‐Is and found an increased risk with SGLT2‐I exposure, 56 especially in patients with diabetic microvascular complications and in those taking diuretics. 57

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^116TgYNr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue FARXIGA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting FARXIGA.

Withhold FARXIGA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume FARXIGA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue FARXIGA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

FARXIGA can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating FARXIGA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Figure 2 displays four‐year Kaplan–Meier survival curves comparing SGLT2i and DPP‐4i users. For the primary outcome, SGLT2i users had significantly lower mortality (log‐rank p < 0.001). Regarding secondary outcomes, SGLT2i users experienced fewer MAKE (p = 0.001), no significant difference in MACE (p = 0.116), and significantly lower all‐cause hospitalisation rates (p = 0.029), further supporting their favourable outcomes.

### Genitourinary tract infections in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors: JACC review topic of the week [^111VyW5E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have been shown to reduce adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, all-cause mortality, and heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure, as well as adverse renal outcomes. However, concerns regarding the heightened risk of genitourinary (GU) infections, particularly urinary tract infections, remain a significant barrier to their wider adoption. Addressing these misconceptions using existing evidence is needed to ensure proper risk-benefit assessment and optimal utilization of this efficacious therapy. This review aims to provide a balanced perspective on the evidence-based cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2is and the associated risk of GU infections. We also summarize and propose clinical practice considerations for SGLT2i-associated GU infections focusing on patients with cardiovascular disease.

### Association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes after urinary tract infection [^11348UFG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate whether initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) within 3months after a urinary tract infection (UTI) is associated with improved long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i).

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network (2016–2023). Adults with T2DM who initiated SGLT2i or DPP-4i within 90days after a UTI or pyelonephritis diagnosis were identified. Propensity score matching (1:1) was applied to balance baseline covariates. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events (MAKE), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalisation, dialysis dependence, emergency department (ED) visits, and sepsis. Outcomes were assessed over a 4-year period using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results

After matching, 2129 patients were included in each group. Compared with DPP-4i, SGLT2i use was associated with lower risks of mortality (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45–0.77), MAKE (HR 0.78), hospitalisation (HR 0.89), dialysis dependence (HR 0.43), sepsis (HR 0.75), and ED visits (HR 0.88). No significant difference was found for MACE (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79–1.04).

Conclusions

In patients with T2DM recovering from UTI, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with lower risks of mortality, kidney complications, and infection-related outcomes compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. These findings support the safety and clinical benefit of continuing or initiating SGLT2i during the post-infectious phase, even after a recent urinary tract infection.

5 CONCLUSION

In this real‐world cohort study of patients with T2DM recovering from UTI, the use of SGLT2i within 3 months was associated with significantly lower risks of mortality, kidney complications, and hospitalisation compared with DPP‐4i. Despite historical concerns regarding infection risk, SGLT2i use did not increase adverse infectious outcomes. These findings support early post‐UTI initiation of SGLT2i as a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with T2DM.

ADVERSE EVENTS

Despite the numerous noted benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, there are several potential adverse events of which clinicians should be cognizant. Identification of any high-risk baseline features in a patient will allow a clinician to guide therapy accordingly. Side effects and high-risk populations are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Potential side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors

Genitourinary tract infections

The most cited adverse events with SGLT2 inhibitors are urinary tract infections and genitourinary infections, a common issue seen in patients on chronic steroids for treatment of autoimmune diseases. By blocking glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubules, SGLT2 inhibitors increase the amount of glucose in the urinary tract, which can foster an environment for bacterial growth. A meta-analysis identified a trend toward increased UTI with SGLT2 inhibitor use [relative risk (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.99–1.15] and a significant increase in the risk of genital infection (RR 3.75, 95% CI 3.00–4.67). The initiation of canagliflozin was associated with both increased vaginal colonization of candida species as well as increased symptomatic candida infections in women with diabetes. There have also been reports of Fournier gangrene associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use. Interestingly, the study by Wang et al. only identified one UTI among 38 lupus patients over a 6-month period despite standard-of-care concomitant immunosuppressive agents arguing that SGLT-2 inhibitors may not add to urogenital infection risk in patients despite ongoing use of immunosuppression.

Diabetic ketoacidosis

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a known risk with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors through the stimulation of ketogenesis as well as possibly decreased renal clearance of ketone bodies. Atypically, DKA in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use can present with normal blood sugars. As a result, any patient with symptoms of DKA such as nausea, vomiting or malaise should have SGLT2 inhibitor held until the presence of acidosis can be ruled out. These medications are typically avoided in patients with type 1 diabetes or any history of DKA; there have been successful reports of their use, but serious concerns remain. Patients should be cautioned to skip SGLT2 inhibitor dose on days they are fasting (e.g. due to scheduled surgery or illness).

1 INTRODUCTION

Infections remain a frequent and clinically significant complication in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), primarily due to persistent hyperglycaemia, immune dysregulation, and endothelial dysfunction which together impair host defence mechanisms. Among these, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute pyelonephritis are especially common and may trigger prolonged inflammatory responses, metabolic instability, and organ vulnerability in diabetic patients. The period following such infections — often termed the "vulnerable recovery phase" — has been associated with increased risks of systemic complications, renal function deterioration, and cardiovascular events. Despite growing awareness of this transitional window, there remains limited evidence to guide the selection of optimal antihyperglycaemic agents that can safely support recovery while minimizing long‐term adverse outcomes.

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as a preferred therapeutic class for patients with T2DM, owing to their demonstrated benefits in reducing cardiovascular mortality, slowing kidney disease progression, and improving heart failure outcomes in multiple randomised controlled trials. These organ‐protective effects are thought to arise from pleiotropic mechanisms, including natriuresis, modulation of tubuloglomerular feedback, reduction in oxidative stress, and anti‐inflammatory activity. However, due to their known association with genital and urinary tract infections, clinicians have exercised caution regarding their use in patients with a recent history of UTI. While meta‐analyses suggest that the risk of serious infections such as urosepsis remains low with SGLT2i, the perceived infection‐related risk may influence prescribing decisions in real‐world settings. Consequently, many clinicians delay or avoid initiating SGLT2i in the post‐UTI period, potentially foregoing the opportunity for cardiometabolic benefit.

SGLT2 inhibitors — infectious safety concerns — include that an increased risk for genital mycotic infections has been seen with all SGLT2 inhibitors, and perineal hygiene should be discussed with all individuals placed on these agents; although these infections are usually not serious and tend to resolve with a brief course of antifungal agents, careful education and monitoring should occur in patients at high risk including the immunocompromised. Although there have been spontaneous postmarketing reports of pyelonephritis and urosepsis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, large clinical trials have shown no difference in the rates of any urinary tract infections between SGLT2 inhibitors and placebo, and rare postmarketing reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum led the FDA to request a warning be added to SGLT2 inhibitor prescribing.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D and associated comorbidities-differentiating within the class [^112i5hwt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

There was a mixed picture for urogenital infections in SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs. While there was a consistent signal for increased risk of genital infections with all three agents, which was also seen in previous trials, none of the CVOTs showed an increase risk of urinary tract infection (UTI), although a signal was seen with empagliflozin when looking at female patients alone. Other studies have shown inconsistent results for UTI risk with SGLT2 inhibitors, with four recent meta-analyses finding no evidence for increased risk of UTI with any agent in the class, with the possible exception of high dose (10 mg) dapagliflozin. Nevertheless, prescribers should be advised that current product labels contain a warning about possible UTI events.

To summarise the SGLT2 CVOT data, despite the recent CANVAS Program and DECLARE-TIMI 58 results, empagliflozin remains the only member of the SGLT2 inhibitor class thus far having proven a significant reduction in CV death (38% RRR) in a dedicated and robust CVOT that was designed, and powered, to test for superiority in CV outcomes versus placebo. Furthermore, the reduced risk of CV death with empagliflozin was consistent across pre-specified analyses. By contrast, there was no significant reduction in CV death versus placebo with either canagliflozin, in the CANVAS Program, or dapagliflozin, in DECLARE-TIMI 58, and this was true whether analysing each study population as a whole or only the patients with baseline symptomatic atherosclerotic CVD. However, HHF and renal endpoints suggested that all SGLT2 inhibitors provided a benefit for these outcomes, although these analyses were exploratory only in the CANVAS Program and DECLARE-TIMI 58 due to the hierarchical statistical testing plan design. Safety outcomes also showed differences, with increased risk of lower limb amputation and bone fracture in the CANVAS Program, but not EMPA-REG OUTCOME or DECLARE-TIMI 58, although an increased risk of genital infections was consistent across the class, and prescribers should be advised of the possibility of rare DKA events with all three agents.

### Urinary tract infection and continuation of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in diabetic patients [^111BMCp8]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

To investigate the impact of incident urinary tract infection (UTI) and subsequent sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors discontinuation on clinical outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

This territory-wide cohort study analysed patients with T2DM prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors from January 2015 to June 2022. Primary outcomes included primary cardiovascular composite outcomes (heart failure hospitalization, stroke, myocardial infarction, or all-cause mortality) and primary renal composite outcomes (50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], end-stage renal failure, or all-cause mortality). The secondary outcome was recurrent UTI. A target trial emulation was applied to estimate the impact of discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors.

Results

Among 61 606 eligible patients, 3921 (6.36%) had at least one UTI incidence during follow-up. Patients with incident UTI exhibited a higher risk of primary cardiovascular composite outcomes [hazards ratio (HR): 3.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.88–3.51] and primary renal composite outcomes (HR: 2.51, 95% CI: 2.32–2.72) compared to those without UTI. Following a UTI, 32.31% of patients discontinued SGLT2 inhibitors. Discontinuation was associated with a higher cardiovascular (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.20–1.53) and renal (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.21–1.51) risks compared to continued use, while the risk of recurrent UTI was similar (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.22–4.29).

Conclusions

New-onset UTI was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events in patients with T2DM prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors. Discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors after a UTI was linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes but was not associated with fewer recurrent UTI.

### Urinary incontinence in US adults aged ≥ 55 years with type 2 diabetes and indications for SGLT2is: NHANES 2013–2020 [^112Y2C9X]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Although evidence of increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) with SGLT2i use has been mixed, it is important to clarify this association in older adults, who are more likely to develop complicated infections. A recent study of nursing home residents initiating SGLT2is found that approximately 10% were hospitalized for a UTI within 6 months. In general, older women are more likely to have recurrent UTIs with potential complications of pyelonephritis and urosepsis, while older men with pre-existing prostate issues have greater risk of UTIs and prostatitis, resulting in urinary catheterization. Further research is needed to understand how urinary incontinence may interact with possible UTI risk with SGLT2is.

Our study also highlights the importance of potential sex differences in SGLT2i use and adverse events. Given the nearly two-times higher prevalence of urinary incontinence in women compared with men, it is likely that women will suffer more of the adverse urinary effects from SGLT2is. Indeed, in the Korean adverse event reporting system, women were overwhelmingly more likely to report urinary events compared with men. Additionally, female genitalia are more susceptible to infection, and vulvovaginal mycotic infections are common in women taking SGLT2is. Women may also be more likely to use urinary pads for their incontinence, and pads substantially increase the risk of urogenital infections; a recent opinion piece stated that people using pads for urinary incontinence should not receive SGLT2is. Lower rates of SGLT2i prescribing for women and older adults have been reported in several studies; it is unclear what factors are driving differential rates of prescribing by sex and age. Attention is needed to understand how the higher prevalence of incontinence among women impacts their SGLT2i use and whether differential use of SGLT2is by sex affects pre-existing cardiovascular sex disparities in type 2 diabetes.

Dapagliflozin reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by up to 5 mmHg, with no significant increase in heart rate or occurrence of orthostatic hypotension.

Rates of hypotension, dehydration, and hypovolemia were similar in dapagliflozin groups (1–2%) to those in the placebo/comparator groups (0–1%). Dapagliflozin treatment was not associated with an increased risk of acute renal toxicity or deterioration of renal function. The dapagliflozin Summary of Product Characteristics advises against its use in patients receiving loop diuretics or who are volume depleted, and recommends appropriate monitoring if volume depletion is likely to occur.

Symptoms suggestive of genital infection, such as cutaneous fungal infections, and lower urinary tract infection (UTI) were common adverse events with dapagliflozin and were reported more frequently compared with placebo/comparator. Genital infection occurred in 2–13% of patients receiving dapagliflozin compared with 0–5% of those receiving placebo/comparator, with women affected more commonly than men. Most cases were not severe and responded well to standard therapy. Lower UTIs also occurred more frequently with dapagliflozin (3.0–12.5%) than with placebo/comparator (0–9.0%). None of these events were serious, and all cases resolved with standard antibiotic therapy. The pooled safety analysis (n = 4,545) reported that genital infections and UTIs were more common with dapagliflozin than placebo, and between-group differences were less marked for UTIs (genital infection: 4.1–5.7% dapagliflozin vs. 0.9% placebo; UTIs: 3.6–5.7% dapagliflozin vs. 3.7% placebo).

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a case study in translational research [^112bagyU]. Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the most recently approved class of diabetes drugs. Unlike other agents, SGLT2 inhibitors act on the kidney to promote urinary glucose excretion. SGLT2 inhibitors provide multiple benefits, including decreased HbA 1c, body weight, and blood pressure. These drugs have received special attention because they decrease the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and slow progression of diabetic kidney disease (1–3). Balanced against these impressive benefits, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved prescribing information describes a long list of side effects: genitourinary infections, ketoacidosis, bone fractures, amputations, acute kidney injury, perineal necrotizing fasciitis, and hyperkalemia. This review provides a physiological perspective to understanding the multiple actions of these drugs complemented by a clinical perspective toward balancing benefits and risks.

The included studies were published from 2018 to 2024, with 9 published from 2020 onwards. Four were conducted in the United States, 2 in Europe, 1 in Canada, and 3 in Asia. One study included both US and European patients. All studies included patients with T2DM. Five included severe UTI as the primary outcome. The median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] = 56–72). The proportion of females in the studies was 42% (IQR = 39%-51%).

The median duration of follow-up was 10.5 months (range = 1–36 months). Baseline HbA 1c was greater than 7% in all reported studies, and diabetes complications were reported in 5 studies. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics and limitations of the included studies.

Summary of Study Characteristics.

In 11 studies, 45% compared SGLT2i with GLP-1RA and 55% compared SGLT2i with other glucose-lowering medications. The number of cases was 1636 among 177 732 patients treated with SGLT2i. In patients treated with GLP-1RA, 714 severe UTI cases were reported among 148 090 patients, and 3221 severe UTI cases were reported among 353 795 patients in the comparator group of various glucose-lowering medications. The SGLT2i did not show an increased risk of severe UTI than GLP-1RA (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.72–1.21, P = 0.60, I² = 81%). The SGLT2i class was associated with a reduced risk of severe UTI compared with DPP4i (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.43–0.54, P < 0.001, I² = 20%) and compared with other glucose-lowering medications (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.66–0.89, P < 0.001, I² = 0%). The overall effect size with all comparators favored the SGLT2i (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60–0.88, P < 0.001, I² = 87%) (Figure 2).

### Dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis of safety data from phase IIb / III clinical trials [^1146D4K4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical trials show that SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of genital infections; however, clinical data on the associated risk of UTIs are less consistent. In our analysis, no increase in the risk of UTIs was observed with dapagliflozin vs placebo. The proportions of patients reporting UTIs were 15.1%, 14.5% and 15.0% with empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg and placebo, respectively. 13 The incidence rates of UTIs were 7.7, 6.8 and 6.4 per 100 patient‐years with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo, respectively. 14

The incidence of genital infection was higher with dapagliflozin vs control in the present analysis, and this is consistent with other analyses of dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin. 2, 12, 13, 14, 19, 27 A meta‐analysis comparing all SGLT2 inhibitors with placebo observed a 4 to 6 times increased risk of genital infection with SGLT2 inhibitor use. 28

### Urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes treated with dapagliflozin [^112aURs3]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Urinary tract infection is common in patients with type 2 diabetes. Possible causative factors include glucosuria, which is a result of treatment with sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Dapagliflozin is an investigative SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated glycemic benefits in patients with diabetes. Data from dapagliflozin multi-trial safety data were analyzed to clarify the association between glucosuria and urinary tract infection.

Methods

Safety data from 12 randomized, placebo-controlled trials were pooled to evaluate the relationship between glucosuria and urinary tract infection in patients with inadequately controlled diabetes (HbA1c > 6.5%-12%). Patients were treated with dapagliflozin (2.5, 5, or 10mg) or placebo once daily, either as monotherapy or add-on to metformin, insulin, sulfonylurea, or thiazolidinedione for 12–24weeks. The incidence of clinical diagnoses and events suggestive of urinary tract infection were quantified.

Results

This analysis included 3152 patients who received once-daily dapagliflozin (2.5mg [n = 814], 5mg [n = 1145], or 10mg [n = 1193]) as monotherapy or add-on treatment, and 1393 placebo-treated patients. For dapagliflozin 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, and placebo, diagnosed infections were reported in 3.6%, 5.7%, 4.3%, and 3.7%, respectively. Urinary glucose levels, but not the incidence of urinary tract infection, increased progressively with dapagliflozin dosage. Most identified infections were those considered typical for patients with diabetes. Discontinuations due to urinary tract infection were rare: 8 (0.3%) dapagliflozin-treated patients and 1 (0.1%) placebo-treated patient. Most diagnosed infections were mild to moderate and responded to standard antimicrobial treatment.

Conclusions

Treatment of type 2 diabetes with once-daily dapagliflozin 5 or 10mg is accompanied by a slightly increased risk of urinary tract infection. Infections were generally mild to moderate and clinically manageable. This analysis did not demonstrate a definitive dose relationship between glucosuria and urinary tract infection.

### Overcoming disparities in using SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal protection in persons with and without type 2 diabetes [^115JjNgB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Gender-based disparities are particularly pronounced, where women are more likely to experience a delay in being prescribed an SGLT2i. For example, a nationwide Danish longitudinal cohort study in people with a dual diagnosis of T2D and CVD found that women were 24% less likely to start SGLT2i therapy than men, even after adjusting for confounding factors. These differences were especially stark among women with ischemic heart disease and HF compared to their male counterparts. Concerns about higher discontinuation rates for women due to an increased risk of urogenital infections have been raised, although this remains insufficiently studied. Given the glucosuria inducing effects of SGLT2i, there is an increased risk of urogenital infections. However, there are mixed results regarding the gender differences in urogenital infections associated with SGLT2i use. In a meta-analysis exploring the incidence of reproductive tract infections among the different SGLT2i in individuals with T2D, men had greater odds ratio of reproductive tract infections compared to women, though the underlying reason for this discordance could not be explained. In the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, although urinary tract infections (UTIs) were more common in women than men in the study, there was no difference in incidence of UTIs between individuals treated with dapagliflozin vs placebo regardless of sex. Other studies have shown a higher incidence of UTIs, genital mycotic infections, and genitourinary symptoms in women compared to men. A shared decision-making process that includes counseling on personal hygiene to reduce the risk of genitourinary infections and treatment of mild urogenital infections without the discontinuation of SGLT2i may help mitigate the delays in initiation and interruption of SGLT2i use.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116FDAZh]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective and reversible inhibitor of sodium-glucose linked transporter type 2 (SGLT2), which mediates approximately 90% of active renal glucose reabsorption in the early proximal tubule of the kidney. Dapagliflozin significantly reduces glucose reabsorption and decreases serum glucose concentration in an insulin-independent manner. The decrease of glucose reabsorption by dapagliflozin has also been associated with a reduction in body weight. Furthermore, the drug modestly reduces blood pressure levels through weight loss and its action as osmotic diuretic. Dapagliflozin has been approved as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who cannot tolerate metformin or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, with the exception of pioglitazone due to the theoretical increased risk of bladder cancer. The drug should not be prescribed in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or in patients at risk for developing volume depletion. Dapagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of genital and lower urinary tract infections, but these infections are usually mild to moderate and respond to standard antimicrobial treatment. Based on current evidence, dapagliflozin is a useful drug for patients with T2DM with a favorable safety profile. However, further research regarding the effects of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes is needed.

Real-world research has emerged after the drug postmarketing, and its influence in the pharmaceutical industry will not be underestimated. It is characterized by selecting treatment based on the patient's actual condition and willingness and conducting long-term evaluation. The sample size is generally larger and the focus is on meaningful outcome treatment. Our statistical results are just based on real-world research. In contrast, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are usually selected for study under strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The representativeness and external authenticity of RCTs have certain limitations.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and the risk of genitourinary infections at HbA1c ≥ 10%: a population health-based retrospective review [^1155ZMca]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Evidence has shown a 3- to 5-fold increase in the risk of genitourinary infections with their use due to inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption, resulting in glucosuria. Increased glucosuria is thought to increase the risk of genitourinary infections at a greater degree in patients with a significantly elevated HbA1c (≥ 10%), and initiation of SGLT2i is often delayed in these patients. While a limited body of evidence exists indicating that A1c level is not an independent risk factor for SGLT2i-induced genitourinary infection, pragmatically this concern remains a barrier to SGLT2i utilization.

Objective

Evaluate the real-world genitourinary (GU) infection rate in patients receiving SGLT2i with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 10% compared to patients with a baseline HbA1c < 10%.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated data from 5542 adult patients treated between January 2013 and January 2023, who were prescribed an SGLT2i. Data collected included sex, age, race/ethnicity, renal function, date of SGLT2i start, number of SGLT2i orders, name and dose of SGLT2i, HbA1c, and a predetermined set of diagnosis codes related to bacterial and fungal genitourinary infections. The primary outcome was the overall GU infection rate after SGLT2i initiation within groups of baseline HbA1c of ≥ 10% and < 10%, and the secondary outcome was total GU infections within these same groups.

Results

The primary outcome was equivalent between those with HbA1c < 10% and HbA1c ≥ 10% (0.0064 ± 0.0565 vs 0.0030 ± 0.0303 infection per month [mean ± standard deviation]; P < 0.0001 for both lower and upper bounds). There was no statistically significant difference in total GU infections between the same groups (0.027 ± 0.21 vs 0.015 ± 0.14, P = 0.11). Female gender and prior recurrent infection were associated with increased GU infection after SGLT2i.

Conclusion and Relevance

A baseline HbA1c ≥ 10% was not significantly associated with an increased risk of GU infection following the initiation of SGLT2i compared to those with a baseline HbA1c of < 10%.

### Comparison of effectiveness among different sodium-glucose cotransoporter-2 inhibitors according to underlying conditions: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113VrdGn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2) inhibitors were initially introduced as a class of antihyperglycemic medications for patients with diabetes. In addition to their fundamental role as diabetic agents, such as lowering glycated hemoglobin, body weight, and blood pressure, they have demonstrated promising effects in reducing cardiovascular and renal outcomes among patients with diabetes across numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs).,

Furthermore, a growing body of evidence shows that SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce cardiovascular and renal events regardless of the presence of diabetes, baseline kidney function, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Recent meta‐analyses of large RCTs showed the consistent effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the risks of composite renal outcome, acute kidney injury (AKI), the composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), cardiovascular death, all‐cause death, and hospitalizations for HF across the included population. These findings supported the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HF or chronic kidney disease (CKD), irrespective of the diabetic status or the kidney disease causes.

Nonetheless, because the existing RCTs compared SGLT2 inhibitors with placebo, the hierarchical assessment of superiority among SGLT2 inhibitors has not yet been ascertained. Limited data from a retrospective cohort study suggested that dapagliflozin, compared with empagliflozin, was associated with lower risk of HF in patients with diabetes. Although a few network meta‐analyses reported almost similar efficacy profiles across SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal outcomes in patients with or without diabetes and those with CKD or HF, comprehensive assessments according to various patient backgrounds are yet to be determined.

Moreover, it is essential to consider the safety profile of each SGLT2 inhibitor when selecting a specific agent within the class. However, proper selection remains uncertain without the comparative safety evidence. Because adverse events of SGLT2 inhibitors, such as genital infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), and hypovolemia, can lead to treatment discontinuation, the comparative safety profiles should be investigated.

To address these important knowledge gaps, in this network meta‐analysis, we aimed to pool various populations (ie, with or without diabetes, with or without CKD, and HF phenotype: HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF] or HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) from previous RCTs and indirectly compare the efficacy and safety of each SGLT2 inhibitor, with potential important clinical implications in specific agent selection according to diabetes, CKD, or HF phenotypes.

### Association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes after urinary tract infection [^113u3bjn]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To evaluate whether initiating sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) within 3 months after a urinary tract infection (UTI) is associated with improved long‐term outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), compared with dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP‐4i).

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network (2016–2023). Adults with T2DM who initiated SGLT2i or DPP‐4i within 90 days after a UTI or pyelonephritis diagnosis were identified. Propensity score matching (1:1) was applied to balance baseline covariates. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included major adverse kidney events (MAKE), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalisation, dialysis dependence, emergency department (ED) visits, and sepsis. Outcomes were assessed over a 4‐year period using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan–Meier analysis.

Results

After matching, 2129 patients were included in each group. Compared with DPP‐4i, SGLT2i use was associated with lower risks of mortality (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45–0.77), MAKE (HR 0.78), hospitalisation (HR 0.89), dialysis dependence (HR 0.43), sepsis (HR 0.75), and ED visits (HR 0.88). No significant difference was found for MACE (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79–1.04).

Conclusions

In patients with T2DM recovering from UTI, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with lower risks of mortality, kidney complications, and infection‐related outcomes compared with DPP‐4 inhibitors. These findings support the safety and clinical benefit of continuing or initiating SGLT2i during the post‐infectious phase, even after a recent urinary tract infection.

### Empagliflozin, linagliptin, metformin hydrochloride (trijardy XR) [^116Z6jZe]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6%, 18.4%, and 17.0%, respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Lower Limb Amputations: Across four empagliflozin outcome trials, lower limb amputation event rates were 4.3 and 5.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo group and the empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg dose group, respectively, with a HR of 1.05 (95% CI) (0.81, 1.36). In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial, in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, and empagliflozin 10 mg treatment arms, respectively. TRIJARDY XR is not indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.

### Efficacy, safety and regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors: focus on canagliflozin [^1178nCTr]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Prevalence of diabetes mellitus is inc6reasing, with a burden of 382 million patients worldwide at present (more than the entire US population). The International Diabetes Federation anticipates an increase up to 592 million patients by 2035. Another major problem arises from the fact that just 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at target glycaemic control with currently available medications. Therefore, a clear need for new therapies that aim to optimize glycaemic control becomes evident. Renal sodium-linked glucose transporter 2 inhibitors are new antidiabetic drugs with an insulin-independent mechanism of action. They pose one remarkable advantage compared with already established antidiabetics: increasing urinary glucose excretion without inducing hypoglycaemia, thereby promoting body weight reduction due to loss of ~300kcal per day. This review focuses on canagliflozin, which was the first successful compound of this class to be approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in 2013. Clinical trials showed promising results: enhancing glycaemic control was paralleled by reducing body weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Nevertheless, some safety concerns remain, such as genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and cardiovascular risks in vulnerable patients, which will be closely monitored in several post-authorization safety studies.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — contraindications, cautions, and adverse effects to monitor — include the following. Contraindications include history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to drug, pregnancy or breastfeeding, on dialysis, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (dapagliflozin), ESRD (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin), and severe renal impairment (empagliflozin). Cautions include to discontinue at least 3 days before a planned surgery to prevent postoperative ketoacidosis; if HbA1c is well controlled or there is a history of frequent hypoglycemic events, wean or stop sulfonylurea or glinide and consider reducing total daily insulin dose by ~20% when starting therapy; consider diuretic dose reduction due to intravascular volume contraction; and use with caution in patients with prior amputation, severe peripheral neuropathy, severe peripheral vascular disease, or active diabetic foot ulcers or soft tissue infections; note a possible increased risk of bone fractures with canagliflozin. Adverse effects to monitor are genital fungal infections, urinary tract infections, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, and lower limb ulcerations and soft tissue infections.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our real-world study indicated a lower risk of nephrolithiasis in Thai patients with T2D who were prescribed SGLT2is as a treatment option, with no significant increased risk of UTI. These findings inform prescribing practice of SGLT2is in T2D patients to prevent nephrolithiasis in clinical practice.

### Sotagliflozin (Inpefa) [^114uY4EL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue INPEFA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INPEFA.

Withhold INPEFA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume INPEFA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue INPEFA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

INPEFA can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Before initiating INPEFA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors, including INPEFA, increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INPEFA may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with INPEFA.

### Insights into SGLT2 inhibitor treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy: focus on the mechanisms [^116ZZN7w]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

In light of the current challenges associated with SGLT2i, we reviewed some of the guidelines and provided some insight into future strategies for the use of SGLT2i. The use of SGLT2i is strongly recommended in patients with HFrEF and with or without T2DM, patients with T2DM and coronary heart disease, patients with T2DM were over 50 years old who had risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, and patients with albuminuric renal disease with or without T2DM. The benefits of SGLT2i on these patients have been well documented and reduce the risk of HF hospitalization. Moreover, we may avoid some possible complications by individualized medications and appropriate periodic examinations. For patients with suspected ketoacidosis symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dyspnoea during SGLT2i use, blood and urine ketone body analysis should be performed in time. Patients who use SGLT2i should be advised to pay attention to perineal hygiene. For patients with urinary tract infection during medication use, SGLT2i administration should be paused, and anti-infective therapy should be given. SGLT2i should be discontinued in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. Patients taking SGLT2i and diuretics together need to monitor their blood pressure. Canagliflozin is contraindicated in patients with lower extremity vascular stenosis or with osteoporosis. For renal insufficiency, patients with glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² should be treated with low-dose SGLT2i or not treated with SGLT2i.

Withhold XIGDUO XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume XIGDUO XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue XIGDUO XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.3 Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating XIGDUO XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^111Vr34m]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The SGLT2i does not appear to present a greater risk of severe UTI when compared with other oral glucose-lowering medications. In addition, a decreased association was observed among specific patient subgroups, including individuals with CKD, women under the age of 65, and those without a history of prior UTI. Nonetheless, the study does not eliminate the possibility of UTI or severe UTI as complications in diabetic patients who are administered oral glucose-lowering medications. Instead, it indicates that SGLT2i may not exacerbate this risk.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114joB4A]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Safety

When selecting a therapy for an individual patient, hypoglycemia risk is usually a key driver. In clinical trials, empagliflozin has not been associated with hypoglycemia, with no increase in risk of confirmed hypoglycemia except when used with background sulfonylurea or fixed-dose insulin. When empagliflozin was given as monotherapy, or as add-on to stable metformin, pioglitazone (with or without metformin), or metformin plus sulfonylurea, no confirmed hypoglycemic AEs that required assistance were reported.

For clinical practice, a key question is the proportion of patients likely to discontinue the drug because of AEs. Across a pooled analysis of all empagliflozin randomized clinical trials, including 3695 patients who received placebo, 3806 empagliflozin 10 mg, and 4782 empagliflozin 25 mg, a similar percentage in each treatment group discontinued because of an AE (5.0%, 5.3%, and 5.6% in the empagliflozin 10, 25 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). The AEs most commonly associated with empagliflozin at either dose have been urinary tract infections and genital mycotic infections. For genital mycotic infections, the association with empagliflozin is clear, with these AEs occurring in 4.7% of the empagliflozin 10 mg group, 5.6% of the 25 mg group, and 1.1% of the placebo group in the pooled analysis. For urinary tract infections, the association is less clear: across the pooled analysis, the incidence was similar across groups, but an increased risk has been recorded in some of the individual trials; for example, with monotherapy, events consistent with urinary tract infection were reported in 5% of the placebo group, 7% of the empagliflozin 10 mg group, and 5% of the empagliflozin 25 mg group. In the pooled analysis, urosepsis was reported in 0.1%, 0.1%, and < 0.1% of the placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg groups, respectively, and pyelonephritis was reported in 0.1%, < 0.1%, and < 0.1% of the respective groups, suggesting no increased risk. However, 19 cases of urosepsis and pyelonephritis that started as urinary tract infections in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors were identified among events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database. All cases were hospitalized, and two needed hemodialysis. The database included events reported between March 2013 and October 2014, and as empagliflozin was not available in the US until September 2014, it is not surprising that the reported cases occurred with canagliflozin (n = 10) or dapagliflozin (n = 9), and the FDA has added warnings and precautions to the labeling for all SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Patients should be advised about signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections, as well as about seeking medical advice, so they can be treated promptly, if appropriate.

This meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The planned analysis was registered at the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42024579358).

Data Source

Cohort studies investigating the safety or adverse events of SGLT2i in new users with T2DM were identified by searching the PubMed and Embase databases. All eligible studies in English published up to August 2024 were considered. Literature searches used specific keywords related to SGLT2i. The complete search strategies incorporated index terms, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), and text words for the search in question are presented in.

Inclusion Criteria

This meta-analysis included studies that met the following criteria. Patients with T2DM without any restrictions on age, sex, country, sample size, or ethnicity included in prospective or retrospective cohort studies that compare SGLT2i with other glucose-lowering medications and report severe UTI adverse events, urosepsis, pyelonephritis, and hospitalization due to UTI as a primary or secondary outcome.

Baseline information from the active and control groups had to be comparable, preferably by propensity score matching. Comorbidities or diabetes complications should be reported.

The observation group received new treatment with SGLT2i as a class or as individual agents compared with new users of active comparators, DPP4i, glucagon-like receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), or other guideline-directed glucose-lowering therapy.

Exclusion Criteria

The following criteria were established for the exclusion of studies in this meta-analysis: RCTs were excluded to ensure a focus on real-world data, as participants in RCTs are generally selected from a highly specific population. The analysis did not include systematic reviews, meta-analyses, pharmacovigilance disproportionality analyses, case reports, case studies, case series, letters, opinions, audits, protocols, and methodological papers. We excluded studies that lacked a control group, studies that did not report hospitalizations due to UTI, studies that demonstrated notable differences in follow-up duration between groups, and studies that did not employ propensity score matching or exhibited significant demographic disparities were also excluded. Furthermore, studies with potential immortal or lead-time bias were not considered.

These exclusion criteria were implemented to enhance the robustness and relevance of the analysis.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113SB2k9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor safety considerations are as follows: SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well tolerated among older adults, but they may cause clinically significant volume depletion and should be used cautiously in older adults who are frail or prone to orthostasis. They cause a higher rate of genital mycotic infections and may need to be discontinued if burdensome, are associated with a small increase in urinary tract infections warranting caution in people with recurrent or severe infections, and because they increase urine volume, symptoms of urinary incontinence should be queried before and after initiation. Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis is a rare but potentially serious phenomenon reported more often in long-term care, with infection being the most common trigger. There are emerging data suggesting increased osteoporotic bone fractures, and clinicians should consider minimizing use in older adults at high fracture risk.

### A survey of the FDA's adverse event reporting system database concerning urogenital tract infections and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 Inhibitor use [^1163mdzG]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The primary aim of our study is compared the frequency of UTIs for each SGLT-2i. Analysis of FAERS ADR signal data mining confirmed a statistically significant association between SGLT-2i use and UTIs. There is no difference among canagliflozin, canagliflozin/metformin, dapagliflozin, dapagliflozin/metformin, empagliflozin, empagliflozin/linagliptin, and empagliflozin/metformin in causing UTIs. In addition, the data strongly suggest that female patients are more likely than male patients to experience UTIs when using an SGLT-2i. Large, well-organized epidemiologic studies are needed to confirm these findings.

5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving INVOKANA. Treatment with INVOKANA increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INVOKANA may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including INVOKANA. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with INVOKANA presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue INVOKANA, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.7 Genital Mycotic Infections

INVOKANA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat appropriately.

### SGLT2i: beyond the glucose-lowering effect [^112DjZiz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

It should be emphasized that SGLT2i can significantly delay the progression of renal failure but cannot treat diabetic nephropathy. Some studies have found that SGLT2i can also cause a transient decline in renal function and return to normal within a few weeks. Clinical attention should be paid to this issue.

Safety evaluation of SGLT2i

SGLT2i have a unique glucose-lowering effect, which plays a protective role in many organs, but adverse reactions also need to be highlighted. The more common complications include adverse reactions related to glucose-lowering therapy and urinary glucose (such as genitourinary infection and ketoacidosis) and off-target adverse reactions (including fracture, lower limb amputation risk and tumor).

Statistically, the incidence of reproductive tract infection, generally mild-to-moderate infection, after treatment with SGLT2i is 4.8%. Due to differences in anatomical structure, the incidence rate of females is higher than that of males. The mechanism through which SGLT2i increase the incidence of reproductive tract infection may be by promoting glucose excretion through urine, increasing the concentration of glucose in the genitourinary tract, and increasing the risk of bacterial and fungal infection. Therefore, attention should be paid to genitourinary tract hygiene when using SGLT2i. For genitourinary tract infection or recurrent infection within half a year, SGLT2i should be used cautiously or not recommended. However, some major outcome trials suggest that SGLT2i are not associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Wilding et al. suggested that it might be the disease that increases the chances of infection, not the drug, and that the benefits of the SGLT2i seem to outweigh these risks of infection.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis of safety data from phase IIb / III clinical trials [^117WdpQF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a newer class of antihyperglycaemic agents that not only lower blood glucose levels, body weight and systolic blood pressure, but have also recently demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) safety. 1, 2 The safety of these agents is of keen interest to physicians treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Common adverse events (AEs) have been associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors such as genital infection, urinary tract infection (UTI) and polyuria. 3

Dapagliflozin is a highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor that lowers blood glucose levels in an insulin‐independent manner by suppressing renal glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion. 4, 5, 6 In phase III trials, dapagliflozin was efficacious and well tolerated in the early and late stages of T2DM, with no major imbalances in safety events observed between the dapagliflozin and control arms. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

Although the CV safety of SGLT2 inhibitors has been confirmed in recent outcome trials, pooled analyses of these agents have previously shown differing overall safety profiles. Empagliflozin was well tolerated with no increase in the risk of hypoglycaemia (except in patients on background sulphonylureas) and UTI and volume depletion (except in patients aged ≥ 75 years, where a higher incidence was observed with both empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg) compared with placebo. 12, 13 Low rates of bone fractures, AEs consistent with decreased renal function and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were observed in the empagliflozin and placebo groups. 12, 13 Small increases in serum creatinine and small decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were noted across the overall pool of patients, with larger changes in the empagliflozin groups compared with placebo. Genital infections were more frequent with empagliflozin vs placebo. Canagliflozin was associated with a slightly higher incidence of hypoglycaemia vs the comparator. Also, higher incidences of genital infections, UTI and AEs related to volume depletion were observed with canagliflozin vs comparator. 14 The incidence rates of fractures and DKA were low in the canagliflozin and comparator groups. 14

SGLT-2 inhibitors — risk mitigation, perioperative management, and kidney function — patients at increased risk of adverse effects include those at baseline increased risk for genitourinary infections or diabetic ketoacidosis; additionally, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be held for at least 3 days before surgery to decrease the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis; SGLT-2 inhibitors might increase the risk of hypotension and dehydration, and antihypertensive or diuretic medications or both might require adjustment; a reversible decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after initiation might occur, but therapy can be continued unless the decline is significant and persistent; the glucose-lowering effect is attenuated when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m², but renal protective benefits are retained with lower eGFR with evidence supporting safety if eGFR is at least 20 mL/min/1.73 m²; select SGLT-2 inhibitors are indicated for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and heart failure (HF), and primary and specialty care providers are empowered to prescribe these agents for appropriate patients.

### A complete review of empagliflozin: most specific and potent SGLT2 inhibitor used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1127s8mN]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the latest class of drugs to be introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They reduce hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion and exert favorable effects beyond glucose control with consistent body weight, blood pressure, and serum uric acid reductions. Empagliflozin is a potent SGLT2 inhibitor used to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. It has the highest SGLT2 specificity among all the clinically used or currently tested SGLT2 inhibitors. Low risk of hypoglycemia, absence of weight gain and demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction support its consideration as a first line medication in addition to metformin for patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Mostly reported adverse events are genital mycotic infections, while urinary tract infections and events linked to volume depletion are rather rare. This review covers the complete information on empagliflozin including the history of its development, synthesis, pharmacology and different methods which have been reported for its analysis.

### SGLT2 inhibition in diabetes mellitus: rationale and clinical prospects [^117GcHGc]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

This Review covers the rationale, physiological consequences and clinical application of pharmacological sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in whom renal glucose reabsorption might be upregulated, orally active, selective SGLT2 inhibitors improve glycaemic control to a therapeutically useful extent. Chronic administration of several SGLT2 inhibitors dose-dependently lowers HbA(1c) levels by 0.5–1.5% without causing hypoglycaemia. The unique mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors-which does not hinge upon β-cell function or tissue insulin sensitivity-means that they can exert their antihyperglycaemic effects in combination with any other oral antidiabetic drug as well as insulin. Available phase III studies confirm a good tolerability profile. Weight loss owing to urinary calorie leakage may be less than expected, but the negative energy balance offers a valuable clinical benefit. Offloading of sodium can assist blood pressure control. The progressive loss of efficacy in patients with reduced glomerular function will have to be balanced against the possibility of renal protection. The safety issues of genitourinary infections and cancer risk requires careful, proactive monitoring and analysis of robust exposure data, particularly in elderly, frail patients and in patients with impaired kidney function and/or high cardiovascular/cancer risk, who represent an increasing fraction of the population with diabetes mellitus.

### The current role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus management [^1139vHCq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, complex metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia causing from insufficient insulin signaling because of insulin resistance or defective insulin secretion, and may induce severe complications and premature death. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral drugs used to reduce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM, including empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, dapagliflozin and canagliflozin. The primary objective of this article is to examine the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of the four SGLT2 inhibitors approved by the US FDA. SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion via inhibiting SGLT2 to decrease renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and reduce the renal threshold for glucose. Rather than stimulating insulin release, SGLT2 inhibitors improve β-cell function by improving glucotoxicity, as well as reduce insulin resistance and increase insulin sensitivity. Early clinical trials have confirmed the beneficial effects of SGLT2 in T2DM with acceptable safety and excellent tolerability. In recent years, SGLT2 inhibitors has been successively approved by the FDA to decrease cardiovascular death and decrease the risk of stroke and cardiac attack in T2DM adults who have been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, treating heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction, and treat diabetic kidney disease (DKD), decrease the risk of hospitalization for HF in T2DM and DKD patients. SGLT2 inhibitors are expected to be an effective treatment for T2DM patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease. SGLT2 inhibitors have a similar safety profile to placebo or other active control groups, with major adverse events such as Ketoacidosis or hypotension and genital or urinary tract infections.

### Risk of urogenital infections in people with type 2 diabetes initiating SGLT2is versus GLP-1RAs in routine clinical care: a Danish cohort study [^113Fnxx9]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Anticipated risks of urinary tract infections (UTI) and genital tract infections (GTI) associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) may prevent their use in clinical practice. We investigated whether initiation of SGLT2is, compared with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), was associated with an elevated risk of UTI and GTI in people with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

In this cohort study emulating a target trial, we included all adult metformin users initiating SGLT2is or GLP-1RAs in Denmark in 2016–2021 and used inverse-probability of treatment (IPT) weighting to balance potential confounders. We estimated IPT-weighted risk and risk ratios of community- or hospital-treated UTI and GTI, performing both intention-to-treat and on-treatment analyses.

Results

This study included 52,414 SGLT2i initiators and 27,023 GLP-1RA initiators with a median follow-up of 2.9 to 3.9 years. The estimated risks of UTI within the first year were nearly identical: 10.0% for SGLT2is and 10.2% for GLP-1RAs in intention-to-treat analyses corresponding to a risk ratio of 0.98 (95% CI 0.94, 1.03). For GTI, the 1-year risks were elevated under SGLT2i therapy at 2.0% vs. 0.7% (risk ratio 2.95 [95% CI 2.52, 3.44]). During the 5-year follow-up, the relative UTI risk remained almost constant (0.96 [95% CI 0.94, 0.99]) whereas the GTI risk ratio with SGLT2is decreased to 1.64 (95% CI 1.49, 1.80).

Conclusions

In routine clinical care, SGLT2i initiation is not associated with increased risk of UTI compared with GLP-1RA initiation. However, early GTI risk is up to threefold larger in SGLT2i users.

### The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists on cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1156okCA]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2008, the US FDA suggested that new antidiabetic therapies be evaluated for associated alterations of cardiovascular risk, given concerns that specific glucose‐lowering drugs might worsen cardiovascular outcomes (CVOs). 24, 25 Empagliflozin was the first novel SGLT‐2 inhibitor with results on cardiovascular outcomes. The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial (Table 1), which randomized patients to receive 10 mg empagliflozin, 25 mg empagliflozin, or placebo once daily, was a multi‐center trial that included 7020 adults at high cardiovascular risk (based on history of cardiovascular disease) and with glycated hemoglobin between 7.0% and 9.0% (or 10.0% if on stable glucose‐lowering therapy). 26 The primary outcome of EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, which was a composite of cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, and non‐fatal stroke, was significantly less likely to occur in the pooled empagliflozin group (10.5%) compared to the placebo group (12.1%, P = 0.04). The secondary outcome, cardiovascular death, occurred in 12.8% of patients in the empagliflozin group compared to 14.3% of the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). 26 Interestingly, there was not a significant change in the rate of myocardial infarction or stroke between the two groups; hospital admission for heart failure, however, was significantly less likely in the empagliflozin group (occurring in 2.7%) vs the placebo group (4.1%, P = 0.002). 26 After the first 12 weeks of the trial, during which glucose‐lowering therapy was held stable, those in the empagliflozin group had glycated hemoglobin levels about 0.5 percentage points lower than those in the control group, with little difference between the 10 and 25 mg/day groups. 26 At 4 years, the difference between the empagliflozin groups and the placebo groups was about 0.3%, although adjustment of antiglucose medications was allowed after week 12. 26 Rates of serious adverse events, adverse events, and overall rates of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis were similar between the empagliflozin groups and the placebo group, although adverse, severe adverse and serious adverse events, genital infections, and urinary tract infections were significantly more in the pooled empagliflozin group compared to the placebo group. 26

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors and severe urinary tract infections: real-world meta-analysis of cohort studies [^115uNtJ5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is a meta-analysis of cohort studies that included severe UTIs as the primary outcome concerning SGLT2i treatment in patients with T2DM compared with other medications.

The results of this meta-analysis show that SGLT2is are not associated with severe UTI despite their glucosuric effect. The overall risk was lower than the composite comparators and did not differ when compared with GLP-1RA. The lower risk of severe UTI was also observed in subgroup analysis of patients without prior UTI, less than 64 years old, and with no diabetes complications. Notably, the sex composition of the studies did not influence the findings.

Compared with other medications, patients with CKD experienced a modest but significantly lower risk of severe urinary tract infections when treated with SGLT2i.

This is a noteworthy observation, given the historical concerns about increased severe UTI risk with SGLT2i by the FDA. The debate about the risk of UTIs with SGLT2i is ongoing. However, studies consistently show no association. This study contributed evidence showing that meta-analyses of observational studies can reveal differences in severe and rare adverse events, such as severe UTI, while accurately reflecting real-world conditions of SGLT2i use. It is important to note that urinary tract infections are still common in clinical settings; however, our results focus explicitly on hospitalizations and the severity of UTI.

Several meta-analyses have examined the general association of urinary tract infections. However, regardless of severity, they typically focused on general UTI as their outcome. - Based on serious UTI signals, the FDA communication presents a contrasting perspective to most studies and meta-analyses. Similar to observational studies, signals by the FDA are also analyzed using real-world data but with reduced bias risk. Therefore, to examine the signals by the FDA, our study specifically delved into the association of SGLT2i with severe UTI reported by high-quality observational studies.

One of the significant challenges in diagnosing UTI in clinical studies or clinical settings is the need for a standard reference. The UTI mainly stems from subjective symptoms occurring in line with objective laboratory results, and this standard reference is crucial, especially when the patient presents with unspecific symptoms at an older age.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and mycotic genital or urinary tract infections in heart failure [^113KJpTn]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) improve clinical outcomes in persons with heart failure (HF). This class of agents has been consistently associated with an increased risk of mycotic genital infections (MGIs), and in some, but not all trials, urinary tract infections (UTIs). Other medications widely used for cardiac conditions do not cause MGIs and UTIs, so cardiologists and their supporting teams will be encountering clinical questions that they previously did not have to address. This review provides clinicians with practical recommendations about SGLT2i use in individuals with HF as related to the associated MGI and possible UTI risks. Overall, given the benefit of SGLT2is in clinical outcomes, the threshold for not initiating or discontinuing SGLT2is due to concerns for MGIs or UTIs should be high for persons with HF. Likewise, when SGLT2is are discontinued for such concerns, the threshold for reinitiation should be low.

### Gender differences in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease: a real-world database study [^111e1nvY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, another potential factor contributing to the lower prescription rate of SGLT2 inhibitors in women may be the preconceived notion that women are more prone to urinary tract infections. In this study, women had a higher prevalence of a history of urinary tract infections. However, stratified analyses demonstrated that the lower prescription rate in women persisted regardless of a history of urinary tract infections. Although our study did not demonstrate a clear association between a history of urinary tract infections and lower prescription rates of SGLT2 inhibitors in women, it is nevertheless true that concerns about urinary tract infections may contribute to physicians' reluctance to prescribe these agents to women.

In line with our findings, previous studies have reported similar associations between gender and the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors. For example, in a large cohort study of 934 737 patients with diabetes in the United States, the prescription rates during 2015–2019 were evaluated, and the adjusted OR for women compared with men was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82–0.85) in multivariable analyses. Similarly, among 174 443 US patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes, CKD, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the adjusted OR for women compared with men for receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor prescription in 2020 was 0.588 (95% CI, 0.519–0.666). The adjusted OR observed in our study (0.58 [95% CI, 0.55–0.62]) is consistent with these findings, reinforcing the evidence of gender disparities in the prescription of SGLT2 inhibitors across different populations.

Genitourinary Infections and Acute Kidney Injury

Given the mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors improve hyperglycaemia, an increased incidence of genital and or urinary tract infections secondary to the increased glycosuria is possible. Consistently across each of the trials, the rate of genital tract infection was higher in those using SGLT2 inhibitors and the rate of urinary tract infections was only significantly higher in the VERTIS-CV study. Similar real-world findings have been identified in people with T2D using SGLT2 inhibitors compared with other classes of medication for diabetes. There was a significantly lower rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use in the DECLARE-TIMI and EMPA-REG trials, and a trend to reduced AKI incidence in all other CVOTs to date. These findings are also supported by recent real-world analyses of people with T2D using this class of medication.

Bone Fractures and Limb Amputation

The frequency of either bone fractures or limb amputation was only statistically significantly higher in the CANVAS study, and not significantly different in any other CVOT. As canagliflozin has significantly lower selectivity for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, some authors have suggested this may explain the increased fracture risk. However, there is no clear biological mechanism which would support this suggestion, as the SGLT1 protein has not been observed in bone. Moreover, as the CREDENECE study also included canagliflozin and did not demonstrate an increased fracture risk, many believe this observation is simply a result of chance.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a bench to bedside review [^114J2hnf]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

For the group of patients with very high HbA1c at screening, who were assigned open-label empagliflozin 25 mg in addition to their background metformin, HbA1c fell by a mean ± standard error (SE) of −3.2 ± 0.2% from a baseline mean of 11.1 ± 0.2%. Improvement was also seen in FPG, with a mean ± SE reduction of −3.02 ± 0.57 mmol/L, from a baseline mean of 11.30 ± 0.43 mmol/L. The group also had reductions from baseline in body weight (mean ± SE −1.91 ± 0.59 kg) and systolic blood pressure (mean ± SE −2.4 ± 1.6).

In this trial, AEs were reported by 57.1%, 49.5%, and 58.7% of patients on empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, and placebo, respectively. Hypoglycemia (defined as plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL, and/or requiring assistance) was reported in very low proportions of patients (1.8% in the empagliflozin 10-mg arm, 1.4% in the empagliflozin 25-mg arm, and 0.5% in the placebo arm), and none of the cases required assistance. AEs consistent with UTIs were reported in low proportions across the treatment arms (5.1%, 5.6%, and 4.9% in the empagliflozin 10-mg, 25-mg, and placebo arms, respectively). Rates of AEs associated with genital infection were also low with empagliflozin, but appeared more frequent than with placebo (3.7% and 4.7% in the 10-mg and 25-mg empagliflozin arms vs. none in patients receiving placebo).

Myocardial infarction

Apart from 3 trials, thirteen studies evaluated the occurrence of myocardial infarction (SGLT2 inhibitors, 19,747 patients, 200 events; placebo, 16,949 patients, 186 events). SGLT2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of myocardial infarction (RR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.78–1.16; p = 0.65; moderate SOE), which was consistent with SGLT2 inhibitor subtypes (RR dapagliflozin: 0.95; 95% CI 0.74–1.23; p = 0.71; RR canagliflozin: 0.97; 95% CI 0.71–1.33; p = 0.87; RR empagliflozin: 0.62; 95% CI 0.11–3.37; p = 0.58) (Additional file 1: Figure S4).

Secondary outcomes

Urinary tract infection rate

Apart from 1 trial, fifteen studies including 21,174 patients evaluated the urinary tract infection rate (SGLT2 inhibitors, 12,332 patients, 657 events; placebo, 8842 patients, 395 events). The pooled evidence showed significantly lower urinary tract infection rate in the placebo group than in the SGLT2i group (RR: 1.17; 95% CI 1.03–1.32; p = 0.01; moderate SOE). When divided into different SGLT2i interventions, dapagliflozin significantly increased the risk of urinary tract infection (RR dapagliflozin: 1.56; 95% CI 1.15–2.11; p = 0.004), while no significant differences were found for canagliflozin (RR canagliflozin: 1.09; 95% CI 0.93–1.28; p = 0.27) or empagliflozin (RR empagliflozin: 1.11; 95% CI 0.86–1.45; p = 0.42) (Additional file 1: Figure S5).

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibition: therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112kmUcm]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Results from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the risk of microvascular complications can be reduced by intensive glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, only about half of patients with diagnosed diabetes achieve recommended glycaemic goals. New therapies with complementary mechanisms of action that are independent of insulin secretion or action may provide additional therapeutic options to enable patients to achieve glycaemic control. The kidney plays an important role in glucose homeostasis, primarily by the reabsorption of filtered glucose. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), located in the proximal convoluted tubule, is responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption by the kidney. SGLT2 inhibitors offer a novel approach to treat T2DM and reduce hyperglycaemia by increasing urinary excretion of glucose. Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor recently approved in Europe for the treatment of T2DM, improves glycaemic control in patients with T2DM when used as monotherapy or when added to other diabetes medications, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, and insulin. As a class, SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated and have a low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia. An increase in signs, symptoms, and other events suggestive of genital and, in some studies, urinary tract infections has been reported with SGLT2 inhibitors. Results from ongoing and future clinical trials will help define the role for this new class of investigational compounds, with its unique mechanism of action, as a treatment option for reducing hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM.

Secondary Outcome

Studies involving individuals under 64 years old showed a decreased risk of severe UTI (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.50–0.87, P < 0.001, I² = 89%). However, severe UTI in older age did not differ from the active comparator (Figure 3).

Including more than 50% of females did not affect the results; both female groups (> 50% or < 50%) showed a lower association for severe UTI with SGLT2i compared with the active comparators (Figure 4).

Subgroup analysis for studies that did not include patients with prior UTI demonstrated a lower risk (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.48–0.81, P < 0.001, I² = 85%). Studies excluding complicated diabetes demonstrated a lower risk (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.55–0.86, P < 0.001, I² = 77%). The CKD patients may also have a lower risk of severe UTI compared with the composite glucose-lowering medication (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60–0.95, P < 0.001, I² = 86%). However, the groups did not differ from GLP-1RA.

Meta-Regression

Meta-regression analysis of the overall studies showed that the comparator intervention is the primary source of heterogeneity, explaining 65% of the heterogeneity between studies (R² = 65%, Q = 8, df = 1, P = 0.005).

The independent variables, female proportion, diabetes complications, sample size, prior UTI, follow-up time, the percentage of patients with CKD, and the year of the study were not identified as the source of heterogeneity.

Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the combined effect values remained consistent before and after excluding any study for the above outcomes. This consistency suggests that the study results were stable.

Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale included moderate to good-quality studies. The median JBI score is 8 (IQR = 7–9), indicating a low risk of bias.

SGLT2 Inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors comprise an emerging, novel class of antihyperglycemic drugs that inhibit glucose reabsorption in the kidney and increase excretion of glucose in the urine. This new, orally administered treatment strategy directly lowers plasma glucose concentration in an insulin-independent manner with a low risk of hypoglycemia. A common adverse effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is an increased incidence of urinary tract and genital infections. Thus, special caution is warranted in elderly patients at higher risk of such infections, e.g. those with urinary incontinence.

The SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin was recently approved in the United States by the FDA for the treatment of T2DM. Another SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, has been approved in the European Union but not in the United States. Additional SGLT2 inhibitors are currently under review by the FDA.

A 102-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study evaluated dapagliflozin (2.5, 5, or 10 mg) or placebo added to metformin in 546 patients with T2DM. The mean change from baseline in HbA1c level was +0.02% for placebo compared with −0.48% (P = 0.0008), −0.58% (P < 0.0001), and −0.78% (P < 0.0001) for dapagliflozin 2.5, 5, and 10 mg, respectively. All dapagliflozin groups had sustained reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and bodyweight. Recorded hypoglycemic events were infrequent and not severe in nature. An increase in reported urinary tract infections and genital infections was observed for all dapagliflozin groups compared with placebo.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at an increased risk of genital urinary (GU) infections, with the risk increasing with higher A1Cs. Given the broad adoption of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in patients with T2D, both providers and patients need to be aware of common adverse effects associated with these medications, specifically GU infections. However trials involving SGLT2is looked at patients with an average A1C of less than 9%, and thus, the incidence of GU infections may not truly reflect the general diabetic population.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to assess the association between GU infections in patients started on SGLT2is and A1C levels.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted on patients seen in an adult, primary care clinic, at New York City Health and Hospitals, South Brooklyn Health. Men and nonpregnant, nonlactating women > 18 years old with a diagnosis of T2D who were initiated on an SGLT2i between January 2018 and January 2023 were included in the analysis. The primary endpoint is to compare the risk of GU infections in patients with T2D who were started on SGLT2is, regardless of dose, with hemoglobin A1C of > 9% to those with hemoglobin A1C < 9% at baseline.

Results

Three hundred and twenty-eight patients were eligible based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of GU infections that occurred in patients with a baseline A1C > 9% compared with those with an A1C < 9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05–2.88; P = 0.041).

Conclusions and Relevance

Type 2 diabetes patients initiated on SGLT2is may experience an increased risk of GU infection, especially in those patients with an A1C of 9% or greater. Further research is necessary to validate and expand upon these findings.

Introduction

In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a drug safety communication regarding the increased risk of serious urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is).

The impact of the glucosuric effect on UTI risk is debated. Previous meta-analyses show an insignificant association between SGLT2i use and UTI but are not entirely ruled out.

In a meta-analysis of 86 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) enrolling 50 880 patients, the risk of urosepsis was insignificant with SGLT2i vs placebo. Still, a wide 95% confidence interval (CI) interpreted the results as inconclusive (Relative Risk = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.57–3.48, I² = 0%).

Evidence concerning hospitalization due to severe UTI is limited. This definition aligns with the FDA's characterization of serious UTI. The findings from pharmacovigilance analysis formed the basis for the FDA warning issued in 2015. Therefore, our objective is to investigate the relationship between SGLT2i and severe UTI.

The extensive observational studies collected over the years have helped clarify the association, particularly for patient groups often excluded from RCTs, older populations, women, and high comorbidities. Therefore, our meta-analysis includes observational studies over the years, explicitly analyzing severe UTI events.

According to studies, significant improvements in cardiovascular outcomes associated with SGLT2i could significantly reduce overall cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations due to heart failure, particularly in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. - A review published by the European Society of Cardiology addressed the controversial issue of cardiovascular safety concerning older glucose-lowering medications, such as dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), which are not recommended as a first-line treatment option for diabetic patients with heart failure. In addition, sulfonylureas may increase the risk of heart failure, potentially leading to hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia. It is well known that the early stages of sepsis can present as hypoglycemia and may be linked to the severity of the disease, resulting in poorer hospitalization outcomes.

SGLT2i safety

SGLT2i safety data are extrapolated from trials that were not powered to detect individual adverse events. In a large meta-analysis, SGLT2i was associated with increased genital mycotic infections but not bacterial urinary tract infections. Genital mycotic infections are more common in women and manageable with antifungal therapy. Studies suggesting risks of Fournier's gangrene are limited by low event rates.SGLT2i decreases available carbohydrate and drives metabolism towards more efficient ketone-based energy sources, leading to weight loss, decreased tissue adiposity, and increased serum concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate. Diabetic ketoacidosis, including euglycemic ketoacidosis, is more likely to develop among patients with certain risk factors, such as insulin dependence or acute stress states. A cohort study in the USA identified a twofold increase in ketoacidosis among new users of SGLT2i compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i). Amputation, fracture, and acute kidney injury have also been reported. A risk of leg and foot amputation reported in CANVAS (amputation event rate of 6.3 per 1000 patient-years, p < 0.001) was ultimately not observed in CREDENCE. The US FDA subsequently recalled a black box amputation warning for canagliflozin. Similarly, a risk of fracture reported in CANVAS (15.4 fracture events per 1000 patient-years, p < 0.001) was not observed in other SGLT2i trials. Finally, pooled analyses suggest SGLT2i is indeed associated with decreased risk of acute kidney injury. Volume depletion was proposed as a mechanism for amputation, fracture, and acute kidney injury, although the relative increase in urinary volume related to SGLT2i is transient.

Clinical practice guidelines now recommend SGLT2i for patients with type 2 diabetes with DKD and eGFR of ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. It is reasonable to temporarily hold SGLT2i when predisposed to volume depletion or ketoacidosis, such as surgery, fasting states, or acute illnesses. History of urinary tract infection is not a contraindication to SGLT2i. In the absence of clear risk factors, the potential cardiovascular and kidney benefits justify SGLT2i therapy for most patients with DKD.

Discussion

The WHO definition of pharmacovigilance is the scientific activity of discovering, evaluating, understanding, and preventing adverse drug effects or other drug-related problems. Pharmacovigilance runs through the entire life cycle of drug development. In the postmarketing surveillance phase, the important challenge of pharmacovigilance is how to collect and analyze observational data for the drugs and obtain a more persuasive power. The conclusion is that the ADR signals are generated and tested. Therefore, choosing a rapid and effective signal detection method can provide valuable signals for drug risk management and clinical evaluation to facilitate the timely and accurate detection of dangerous drugs that seriously endanger human health and minimize its harm to humans.

This study draws the conclusion that SGLT-2i use does have adverse reactions with regards to UTIs. In December 2015, the FDA reported 19 cases of life-threatening blood infections and kidney infections that started as UTIs with the SGLT-2i reported to the FAERS from March 2013 through October 2014. All 19 patients were hospitalized, and a few required admission to the intensive care unit or dialysis to treat kidney failure. Clinical studies have confirmed that compared with placebo or other antidiabetic drug administration, SGLT-2i use caused UTIs that were mild or moderate in intensity. However, only one study showed that SGLT-2i use did not increase the risk of UTIs, except for high-dose (10 mg/day) dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM.
