## Question

is elevated tibc seen in iron deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an elevated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is seen in iron deficiency and what that implies for interpretation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the guidelines and reviews say about elevated TIBC as a marker of iron deficiency. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic basis for why TIBC rises in iron deficiency. Next, I will review diagnostic performance data for TIBC versus other markers. After that, I need to consider inflammatory states where TIBC behaves differently. Then, I should think through mixed or atypical presentations. Finally, I will synthesize practical interpretation guidance and a clinical bottom line with appropriate caveats and supporting references [^116Ln8KB] [^111vsMJh].

> Let me first confirm the direct answer from the evidence: yes, an elevated TIBC is classically associated with iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation, and several authoritative sources treat it as a serum marker supportive of iron deficiency alongside low ferritin and low transferrin saturation, so the association is real and clinically useful when interpreted in the right context [^116Ln8KB] [^111vsMJh].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure the mechanism makes sense. When iron stores fall, hepatic synthesis of transferrin increases to scavenge scarce iron, which raises TIBC and lowers transferrin saturation; this fits with the broader framework of iron homeostasis where hepcidin, inflammation, and erythropoietic drive modulate iron flux and availability, so an elevated TIBC in uncomplicated iron deficiency reflects adaptive upregulation of iron transport capacity [^111Ekzn2] [^111sFJG3].

> Next, I should review diagnostic performance carefully. A comparative analysis found TIBC to have excellent discrimination between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease; I initially thought this study showed TIBC clearly outperformed soluble transferrin receptor, but wait, let me verify the ROC details: the order was TIBC > soluble transferrin receptor, yet with no statistically significant difference between them, which means TIBC performs at least as well as sTfR in that specific dataset rather than unequivocally better, and that nuance matters for practice [^1155i1DV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing the critical caveat of inflammatory states. In anemia of inflammation or chronic disease, inflammatory cytokines suppress transferrin production and raise hepcidin, so both serum iron and TIBC tend to be low, which limits the utility of transferrin saturation and inverts the usual TIBC signal we expect in pure iron deficiency; this is why in inflamed patients we adjust ferritin thresholds upward and de-emphasize TIBC in isolation [^111wSktU] [^1116hpFo].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or mixed. I should confirm whether normal TIBC can still occur in true iron deficiency; indeed, in a series with marrow-proven iron deficiency, nearly half had TIBC values still within the normal range, underscoring that a normal TIBC does not exclude iron deficiency, and in coexisting inflammation plus iron deficiency, TIBC may be blunted or normal despite depleted stores, complicating interpretation and favoring integrative panels or second-line markers [^115LDMYR] [^1155i1DV].

> I will now synthesize interpretation guidance without a table and keep it clinically grounded. In classic, noninflamed iron deficiency, ferritin is low, transferrin saturation is low, and TIBC is typically elevated; in anemia of chronic disease, ferritin is often normal or high due to its acute-phase behavior, transferrin saturation is low, and TIBC is low; in mixed iron deficiency with inflammation, ferritin may be intermediate, transferrin saturation remains low, and TIBC can be normal or only slightly increased, so I need to corroborate with clinical context, CRP, and adjusted ferritin thresholds to avoid misclassification [^111wSktU] [^113DECq2] [^114JLXDd].

> Next, I should review practical workarounds when inflammation muddies the waters. Let me consider alternatives: soluble transferrin receptor and the sTfR/log ferritin index can help detect iron deficiency in inflammatory states; reticulocyte hemoglobin content provides an early readout of functional iron restriction; and a short therapeutic trial of oral iron with a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L in about two weeks is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency when labs are equivocal; I need to ensure I also check CRP to contextualize ferritin and TIBC in these decisions [^111Ekzn2] [^111svRYK] [^114J4SK1] [^113DECq2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also safeguard against misinterpretation of transferrin saturation when transferrin is low from malnutrition or inflammation, since a low TIBC can artifactually bump calculated saturation; this is another reason to avoid overreliance on single parameters and to read TIBC, ferritin, and transferrin saturation together with inflammatory markers and the clinical picture [^114JLXDd] [^111wSktU].

> Putting this all together, I can now state the conclusion with the right nuance. Elevated TIBC is characteristic of iron deficiency and can be a valuable marker, particularly in noninflamed states and when differentiating iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic disease; however, in inflammatory conditions TIBC is generally low, and in mixed or some marrow-proven iron deficiency cases TIBC may be normal, so I should double-check ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP, and consider sTfR, reticulocyte hemoglobin, or a therapeutic iron trial to confirm iron deficiency when results are ambiguous [^111vsMJh] [^111wSktU] [^115LDMYR] [^113DECq2].

Yes, **elevated TIBC is a hallmark of iron deficiency** [^111sFJG3] because the liver increases transferrin production to maximize iron transport when stores are low [^116Ln8KB]. This rise in TIBC **helps distinguish iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease** [^1155i1DV], where TIBC is normal or low due to inflammation-driven hepcidin effects [^111wSktU] [^111Ekzn2]. TIBC is most useful when interpreted with ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116VTxiw], and may be less reliable in chronic inflammation [^111wSktU] or liver disease [^111Ekzn2].

---

## Physiological basis of elevated TIBC in iron deficiency

- **Transferrin production**: The liver increases transferrin synthesis when iron stores are low, raising TIBC [^111sFJG3] [^116Ln8KB].
- **Iron transport capacity**: Higher transferrin increases iron-binding capacity, reflected as elevated TIBC [^116Ln8KB] [^111Ekzn2].
- **Compensatory mechanism**: This response aims to maximize iron delivery to tissues despite low stores [^111vsMJh].

## Laboratory findings in iron deficiency anemia

Typical laboratory profile in **iron deficiency anemia**:

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Typical finding in IDA** |
|-|-|
| Serum ferritin | Low (< 15 µg/L) [^116Ln8KB] [^113DECq2] |
| Serum iron | Low [^116Ln8KB] [^111sFJG3] |
| Transferrin saturation | Low (< 20%) [^116Ln8KB] [^111vsMJh] |
| Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) | Elevated [^116Ln8KB] [^1155i1DV] |
| Serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) | Elevated [^116Ln8KB] [^111Ekzn2] |
| Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Retic-Hb) | Low [^116Ln8KB] [^111svRYK] |
| Red cell distribution width (RDW) | Elevated [^116Ln8KB] [^111Y5frp] |

---

Elevated TIBC is a consistent feature of **iron deficiency anemia**, reflecting increased transferrin production and greater iron-binding capacity [^1155i1DV].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated TIBC

Elevated TIBC **helps differentiate iron deficiency anemia from other anemias**, particularly anemia of chronic disease (ACD) [^1155i1DV]. In ACD, TIBC is typically normal or low due to inflammation-induced hepcidin, which reduces iron availability and suppresses transferrin synthesis [^111wSktU] [^111Ekzn2].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While elevated TIBC is useful for identifying iron deficiency, **several limitations should be considered**:

- **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation [^111wSktU] can suppress transferrin synthesis, potentially masking elevated TIBC in iron deficiency anemia [^111Ekzn2].
- **Liver disease**: Liver dysfunction [^116VTxiw] can alter transferrin production, affecting TIBC levels [^111Ekzn2].
- **Nutritional status**: Malnutrition [^114JLXDd] can influence transferrin synthesis and TIBC levels [^111Ekzn2].

Therefore, **interpret TIBC alongside other iron parameters** — such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation — to accurately diagnose iron deficiency anemia [^111vsMJh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the **role of TIBC in diagnosing iron deficiency anemia** [^113ed3k8]; the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommends confirming iron deficiency with iron studies, including TIBC, before initiating further investigations [^116Ln8KB]. Additionally, a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within 2 weeks) strongly suggests absolute iron deficiency, even if iron studies are equivocal [^114J4SK1].

---

Elevated TIBC is a hallmark of **iron deficiency anemia**, reflecting increased transferrin production and iron-binding capacity [^111sFJG3]. It is a useful marker for distinguishing iron deficiency anemia from other types of anemia, particularly anemia of chronic disease [^111wSktU]. However, TIBC should be interpreted alongside other iron parameters and clinical context to ensure accurate diagnosis and management [^116VTxiw].

Iron deficiency is considered to be present if ferritin is less than 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT is less than 20%. It has been considered uncommon in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease), but this may be attributable to difficulties using the usual iron parameters in this setting. Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant in inflammatory states, ferritin levels are often elevated independent of iron status; therefore, a higher cutoff (less than 100 µg/L) is needed to define iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in these settings. In inflammatory states, serum iron and total iron-binding capacity are generally low, limiting the utility of TSAT for diagnosing IDA. This may be explained by the potential for inflammation to dysregulate iron homeostasis.

The key regulator of iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a peptide that is produced primarily by hepatocytes. Increased hepcidin levels decrease iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes. In inflammatory states, hepcidin levels generally increase as a response to inflammatory cytokines, and the net effect is decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. Patients with inflammatory disorders and iron deficiency exhibit lower levels of hepcidin than those with "pure" anemia of inflammation; consequently, hepcidin levels can help distinguish between IDA and other anemias where there is no iron deficiency. The serum hepcidin level may be more reliable than ferritin or TSAT for identifying iron deficiency. For example, in patients discharged from the intensive care unit, a low hepcidin level (less than 20 µg/L) identified iron deficiency in 37% of patients.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^116Ln8KB]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is commonly assessed using automated cell counters that measure changes in red blood cells characteristic of the condition, such as reduced mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) — hypochromia — and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis. MCH is considered a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less influenced by storage factors and the specific counting machine used. A reduction in MCH is observed in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID), and it may provide greater sensitivity for detecting iron deficiency compared to MCV. However, the presence of chronic disease, thalassemia, or vitamin B12/folate deficiency can diminish the sensitivity of both microcytosis and hypochromia in diagnosing iron deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for identifying iron deficiency is limited, as similar changes also occur in various haemoglobinopathies, such as thalassemia, where MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anemia. These changes are also seen in sideroblastic anemia and some instances of anemia associated with chronic disease. To avoid unnecessary gastrointestinal investigations, it is recommended to perform hemoglobin electrophoresis in individuals presenting with microcytosis and normal iron studies, especially if there is a relevant ethnic background.

Serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron levels, elevated total iron-binding capacity, raised red blood cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte hemoglobin (Retic-Hb), and an increased percentage of hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency when there is no inflammation present. An SF level of less than 15 µg/L indicates absent iron stores.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^111Ekzn2]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding spectacular advances in our understanding of iron metabolism and homeostasis, our diagnostic approach to iron disorders still relies mainly on three historical tests: serum iron, transferrin (or total iron binding capacity), and ferritin. Transferrin saturation (Tsat), or the ratio of serum iron to total iron binding capacity, and serum ferritin, coupled with genetic testing and non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging measurements of liver iron content, define the nature and severity of iron loading in both hemochromatosis and thalassemia. Other useful markers are the level of serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTFRC), related to the expansion of erythropoiesis or iron deficiency, the sTFRC/log ferritin ratio for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in inflammation, and the Tsat/log hepcidin ratio to suspect IRIDA.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits can measure serum hepcidin levels. However, this does not provide any additional information to serum ferritin, as the two variables are tightly related. Some researchers propose determining hepcidin levels to choose the better therapeutic route of administration of iron supplementation (oral vs. intravenous), as well as its correct timing and schedule. However, besides being subject to circadian oscillations, hepcidin levels change rapidly in response to activating and inhibitory signals, making their measurement useful in only a limited number of conditions. A kit to measure human serum ERFE concentration is available for research purposes.

### Oral iron supplements for children in malaria-endemic areas [^112X1PKv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia relies mainly on the measurement of a person's haemoglobin, iron, and ferritin. The measurement of haemoglobin alone is not sufficiently sensitive due to overlapping values in iron-replete and iron-deficient individuals, and is not specific because of the numerous causes of anaemia in developing countries. Ferritin is the most commonly accepted measure of iron status. However, there is a complex interaction between infection, inflammation (even when subclinical), and ferritin.

Infection and inflammation increase ferritin, which is an acute phase reactant. The increase is proportional to the baseline ferritin levels and available iron stores. It decreases only slowly after the resolution of infection and remains elevated in the convalescent phases of infection. Thus, in developing countries, it is difficult to interpret ferritin levels and their use as a biomarker of iron deficiency may underestimate the true prevalence of iron deficiency.

Other biomarkers or combinations of biomarkers have been suggested for the assessment of iron deficiency in locations with a high prevalence of infection. These include the serum transferrin receptor, zinc protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, and the ratio of serum transferrin receptor to serum ferritin, as well as the adjustment of ferritin to C‐reactive protein or alpha1‐acid glycoprotein levels, or both.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^116vibru]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

We recommend taking a detailed history, as it may provide important clues as to the cause(s) of IDA in the individual case (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that initial investigation of confirmed IDA should include urinalysis or urine microscopy, screening for coeliac disease (CD), and in appropriate cases, endoscopic examination of the upper and lower GI tract (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong). CD is found in 3%–5% of cases of IDA, and we recommend that it should be routinely screened for serologically, or on small bowel biopsy at the time of gastroscopy (evidence quality — high, consensus — 84%, statement strength — strong).

Age, sex, Hb concentration, and mean cell volume are all independent predictors of risk of GI cancer in IDA, and need to be considered as part of a holistic risk assessment. It follows that the cancer risk in iron deficiency without anaemia is low (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

There are insufficient grounds at present to recommend faecal immunochemical testing for risk stratification in patients with IDA. The evidence base is evolving rapidly, however, and on that basis, this guidance may therefore change (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — weak).

We recommend that in men and postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed IDA, gastroscopy and colonoscopy should generally be the first-line GI investigations. In those not suitable for colonoscopy, CT colonography is a reasonable alternative.

### Marginal iron deficiency without anemia impairs aerobic adaptation among previously untrained women [^113Tx9Hu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency without anemia has been shown to reduce both muscle-tissue oxidative capacity and endurance in animals; however, the consequences of iron deficiency in humans remain unclear. We investigated the effects of iron supplementation on adaptation to aerobic training among marginally iron-depleted women. We hypothesized that iron supplementation for 6 weeks would significantly improve iron status and maximal oxygen uptake (VO₂max) after 4 weeks of aerobic training.

- **Design**: Forty-one untrained, iron-depleted, nonanemic women were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg FeSO₄ or a placebo twice daily for 6 weeks in a double-blind trial. All subjects trained on cycle ergometers 5 days per week for 4 weeks, beginning on week 3 of the study.

- **Results**: Six weeks of iron supplementation significantly improved serum ferritin and serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations and transferrin saturation without affecting hemoglobin concentrations or hematocrit. Average VO₂max and maximal respiratory exchange ratio improved in both the placebo and iron groups after training; however, the iron group experienced significantly greater improvements in VO₂max. Both iron-status and fitness outcomes were analyzed after stratifying by baseline sTfR concentration (> and ≤ 8.0 mg/L), which showed that the previously observed treatment effects were due to iron-status and fitness improvements among subjects with poor baseline iron status.

Our findings strongly suggest that iron deficiency without anemia, but with elevated sTfR status, impairs aerobic adaptation.

### Iron deficiency in young basketball players: Is a 100 μg/L ferritin cut-off appropriate for iron supplementation? Results of a randomized placebo-controlled study [^111TwXSA]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is one of the most common contributing factors that may affect sports performance, although screening, diagnosis, and supplementation have not yet been standardized related to athletes. Compared to the general population, athletes have a higher demand for oxygen transport and energy production, in which iron plays a key role. For basketball players, both good cardiovascular endurance and mental concentration are necessary for success. The dynamic part of basketball playing requires good aerobic capacity. However, several other skills are required to make sudden changes of direction at high speed, such as strength, power, and agility. In this combined (endurance and non-endurance) team sport, although the significance of an optimal nutritional status is potentially highly important, relevant studies are not yet available.

The main causes of ID are the higher iron demand and loss with lower intake and absorption. In athletes, all four mechanisms are pronounced due to extreme physical burden and special nutrition habits, including the intake of supplements, vitamins, and minerals. Young and/or female athletes are at a higher risk of ID as a result of increased iron requirements due to menstruation, growth, and development. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose ID in the preclinical stage, called iron deficiency without anemia (IDNA), to prevent performance decrement. ID in female athletes has been studied extensively, though there are only limited data to indicate that IDNA also occurs in young male athletes. There is no guideline for iron supplementation in these cases.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A complete blood cell (CBC) count for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count, and leucocyte count. To differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic, normocytic, or microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia.

In clinical practice, it must be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with coexisting drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This demonstrates that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in IDA but are typically normal in ACD.

The RDW indicates how much the erythrocytes differ in size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within the normal range in thalassemia.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: Expert review [^113ed3k8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

In specific circumstances involving iron deficiency anemia, particularly concerning patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend establishing the cause of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in these patients. It is essential to determine whether the cause is inadequate intake or absorption, or due to a loss of iron, which typically occurs from gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment should focus on addressing active inflammation to enhance iron absorption and reduce iron depletion.

### Data-driven physiologic thresholds for iron deficiency associated with hematologic decline [^111vFXg5]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency contributes to approximately 50% of anemia prevalence worldwide, but reference intervals for iron status tests are not optimized for anemia diagnosis. To address this limitation, we identified the serum ferritin (SF) thresholds associated with hematologic decline in iron-deficient patients and the SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with hematologic improvement. Paired red blood cell and SF measurements were analyzed from two adult cohorts at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) from 2008–2011 (N = 48,409) and 2016–2018 (N = 10,042).

Inter-patient measurements in the first cohort were used to define optimal SF thresholds based on the physiologic relationship between SF and red cell measurements. Intra-patient measurements (1–26 weeks apart) in the second cohort were used to identify SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with an increase in red cell measurements. The identified optimal SF thresholds varied with age, sex, and red cell measure.

Thresholds associated with approximately 5% decline in red cell index were typically in the range of 10–25 ng/mL. Thresholds for younger women (18–45 years) were approximately 5 ng/mL lower than for older women (60–95 years) and approximately 10 ng/mL lower than for men. Thresholds from which a subsequent increase in SF was associated with a concomitant increase in red cell measure showed similar patterns: younger women had lower thresholds (approximately 15 ng/mL) than older women (approximately 25 ng/mL) or men (approximately 35 ng/mL).

These results suggest that diagnostic accuracy may be improved by setting different SF thresholds for younger women, older women, and men.

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before the initiation of VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

- **Liver testing**: Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO and monthly after initiation for the first six months, then monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if ALT or AST elevations greater than three times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than two times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food. VAFSEO should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. VAFSEO can be administered without regard to the timing or type of the diet.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115gs2r8]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

For patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining an anemia workup if hemoglobin levels are below normal. This includes red blood cell indices such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration.

A more extensive workup should include serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Clinical utility of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content in the diagnosis of iron deficiency [^111svRYK]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Determination of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) provides an early measure of functional iron deficiency because reticulocytes are the earliest erythrocytes released into blood and circulate for only 1 to 2 days. The CHr in 78 patients undergoing bone marrow examination was measured to assess its clinical utility for the diagnosis of iron deficiency. Twenty-eight patients were iron deficient based on the lack of stainable iron in the aspirate. The diagnostic power of CHr is limited in patients with high mean cellular volume (MCV) or red cell disorders such as thalassemia. However, when patients with MCV more than 100 fL are excluded, receiver operator curve analysis of CHr, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and MCV demonstrates that CHr has the highest overall sensitivity and specificity of these peripheral blood tests for predicting the absence of bone marrow iron stores.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: Expert review [^112Wp2b8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with portal hypertension, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend initiating oral iron supplementation for patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to replenish iron stores. Administer intravenous (IV) iron therapy to patients with ongoing bleeding that does not respond to oral iron therapy.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD, and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia. However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish. Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). Yet, guidelines often lack agreement on test cut-off values for these parameters. Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation, and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation according to inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. However, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured. Should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L−1 or if patients are symptomatic? Moreover, no standard CRP cut-off values are provided. Although a CRP level of 5 mg L−1 is the most common threshold, this is not recognized in most guidelines.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly concerning patients with IBD, the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend considering the administration of RBC transfusion in patients with anemia who have hemoglobin levels of 7 g/dL if symptoms or particular risk factors are present. This should be followed by subsequent IV iron supplementation.

### Monoferric [^115wwb21]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Monoferric for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were evaluated in two randomized, open-label, actively-controlled clinical trials involving a total of 3,050 patients with IDA of various etiologies. Trial 1 included patients with IDA who had intolerance to oral iron, an unsatisfactory response to oral iron, or a clinical need for rapid repletion of iron stores. Trial 2 included patients with IDA who had non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD). In these two 8-week trials, patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose. Monoferric was intravenously administered as a single dose of 1,000 mg.

- **Iron deficiency anemia in patients who had intolerance to oral iron or who had unsatisfactory response to oral iron**: In Trial 1 (NCT02940886), 1,512 adult patients with IDA caused by different etiologies, who had documented intolerance or lack of response to oral iron, or screening hemoglobin (Hb) measurement sufficiently low to require repletion of iron stores, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose. Adult patients aged ≥ 18 years with baseline Hb ≤ 11 g/dL, TSAT < 20%, and s-ferritin < 100 ng/mL were eligible for enrollment. The median age of patients was 44 years (range 18–91), and 89% were women.

The efficacy of Monoferric was established based on the change in Hb from baseline to week 8. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for the change in Hb from baseline to week 8.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: What do we need to know [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion.

However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous. There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards, such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF, among noninflamed, outpatient populations.

The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff from 30 years ago does not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity and was performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes.

### Jesduvroq [^115WBDrq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Before initiating Jesduvroq, it is critical to correct and exclude other causes of anemia, such as vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, and bleeding. Assess iron status in all patients both before and during treatment. Supplemental iron therapy should be administered when serum ferritin is less than 100 ng/ml or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during therapy.

- **Liver testing**: Before starting Jesduvroq, assess serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels. If the patient develops signs or symptoms suggestive of liver disease during treatment, repeat the liver tests.

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing to use the lowest effective dose of Jesduvroq to minimize the need for red blood cell transfusions. Avoid targeting a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. Jesduvroq can be taken with or without food, irrespective of the concurrent use of iron or phosphate binders. Ensure Jesduvroq tablets are swallowed whole; they should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. The timing or type of dialysis does not affect Jesduvroq administration. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it coincides with the next scheduled dose.

### Are hematinic deficiencies the cause of anemia in chronic heart failure [^111wu8WB]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF) is common, with prevalence varying between 14.4% and 55%, and is more frequent in patients with more severe heart failure. Patients with CHF who have anemia experience a poorer quality of life, higher hospital admission rates, and reduced exercise tolerance. We explored the relation between hematinic levels and hemoglobin (Hb) levels and exercise tolerance in a group of patients with CHF.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from 173 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), 123 patients with symptoms of heart failure but preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function ("diastolic dysfunction"), and 58 control subjects of similar age. Each underwent echocardiography, a 6-minute walk test, and blood tests for renal function and Hb and hematinic levels (vitamin B12, iron, and folate). We classified patients as having no anemia (Hb level > 12.5 g/dL), mild anemia (Hb level from 11.5–12.5 g/dL), or moderate anemia (Hb level < 11.5 g/dL).

- **Results**: Of the patients with LVSD, 16% had moderate anemia and 19% had mild anemia. Among patients with preserved LV function, 16% had moderate anemia and 17% had mild anemia. Four control subjects had a Hb level < 12.5 g/dL. Of all patients, 6% were vitamin B12 deficient, 13% were iron deficient, and 8% were folate deficient. There was no significant difference between patients with LVSD and the diastolic dysfunction group. In patients with LVSD, the average Hb level was lower in New York Heart Association class III than in classes II and I. The distance walked in 6 minutes correlated with Hb level in both groups.

### Feraheme [^114BXkfB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Feraheme for the episodic treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were assessed in three randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials: Trial 62745–7 (referred to as CKD Trial 1) (NCT 00255437), Trial 62745–6 (referred to as CKD Trial 2) (NCT 00255424), and Trial 62745–5 (referred to as CKD Trial 3) (NCT 00233597). These trials involved Feraheme administered as a rapid intravenous injection, which is a prior method of administration that is no longer approved. An uncontrolled follow-up phase allowed patients with persistent iron deficiency anemia to receive two additional 510 mg intravenous injections of Feraheme. The major efficacy results from the controlled phase of each study are referenced in Table 5.

In all three trials, patients with CKD and iron deficiency anemia were randomized to treatment with either Feraheme or oral iron. Feraheme was administered as two 510 mg undiluted intravenous injections. Oral iron, specifically ferrous fumarate, was administered as a total daily dose of 200 mg elemental iron daily for 21 days. The major trial outcomes focused on the change in hemoglobin levels from baseline to Day 35. CKD Trial 1 and 2 enrolled patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, while CKD Trial 3 enrolled patients undergoing hemodialysis.

### Screening, diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: Putting the 2016 European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines into clinical practice [^114L59rA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Practical recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure, the current 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend that evaluation of iron status should be considered in the diagnostic work‐up of all newly diagnosed HF patients (class of recommendation I, level of evidence C). A practical recommendation of the working group is that iron status should also be evaluated in patients with existing CHF, particularly if they are symptomatic despite receiving optimal background HF medications. In addition, as part of routine follow‐up, consideration should be given to the re‐evaluation of iron status 1–2 times per year, as well as after hospitalization for HF.

Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are widely available blood markers for evaluating iron status. Their use for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is recommended by the 2016 ESC HF guidelines. Ferritin is an intracellular iron‐storage protein secreted by iron‐storing tissues (e.g. liver and reticuloendothelial system). Serum ferritin concentrations are a surrogate marker of stored iron quantity. TSAT (defined as % of transferrin that has iron bound to it) is used as a marker of the availability of circulating iron to supply metabolizing cells. TSAT value is calculated by dividing the serum iron concentration by the total iron‐binding capacity (TIBC).

The 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend treating iron deficiency based on a serum ferritin level < 100 µg/L, or 100–299 µg/L when TSAT < 20%. Two different cut‐offs are used because ferritin levels may become elevated in the presence of inflammation which is often observed in patients with heart failure.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients, the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia.

In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require a blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113jDSob]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin (Hb) levels typically normalize with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). However, IDA can recur in a minority of patients during long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent iron deficiency anaemia (reIDA) is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

After restoring Hb and iron stores with IRT, it is advised that the blood count be monitored periodically, potentially every 6 months initially, to detect reIDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the treatment section. If the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should be addressed appropriately. However, most individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative bi-directional endoscopy (BDE), no evidence of coeliac disease (CD), no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favorable, and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for reIDA. In an era of limited resources, we suggest checks at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

Further investigation is warranted if there is evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Indicators of this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss, chronic unexplained diarrhoea, and persistently elevated inflammatory markers.

### Discriminating between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease using traditional indices of iron status vs transferrin receptor concentration [^1155i1DV]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We compared the ability of soluble serum transferrin receptor (TfR) concentration, quantified using the R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) enzyme-linked immunosorbent TfR assay, with other, more traditional indicators of iron status: total iron binding capacity (TIBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), percent transferrin saturation (%TS), RBC distribution width (RDW), and serum iron concentration (SIC), for discriminating between patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) or anemia of chronic disease (ACD).

The TfR concentration was determined in 72 serum samples selected from men and nonpregnant women, classified biochemically on the basis of ferritin concentration as having IDA (n = 41) or ACD (n = 31). By using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of the various indicators of iron status that we evaluated for discriminating between IDA and ACD decreased in the following order: TIBC > TfR > MCV > (%TS = RDW) > SIC. There was no significant difference between the diagnostic accuracy of TIBC and TfR. Thus, the routine measurement of TfR offers no advantage over TIBC for discriminating between people with biochemically defined IDA or ACD.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relation to other clinical parameters, including patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload, documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices, as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### The contribution of iron deficiency to the risk of peripartum transfusion: a retrospective case control study [^11139bpb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). High credibility.

The primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients with iron deficiency in pregnancy (ferritin < 30 μg/L, TSAT < 20%, or last documented MCV < 80 fL when previously normal) or anemia in pregnancy (Hb < 110 g/L in 1st or 3rd trimester or < 105 g/L in 2nd trimester) in cases and controls.

- **Secondary objectives**: Determine the rate of suboptimal care as defined by the following quality indicators:
	1. Unaddressed anemia in pregnancy: Defined by anemia (as described above) without either the measurement of a ferritin or transferrin saturation and total iron binding capacity, or without iron treatment documented in the antepartum record; and absence of a known red cell disorder as documented in the laboratory information system or antenatal record. The standard of care in Canada is to offer hemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography to at-risk women.
	2. Identified but uncorrected iron deficiency in pregnancy: Clear iron deficiency (ferritin < 30 μg/L) without documentation of commencing oral iron replacement at a dose of at least 30 mg of elemental iron or administration of intravenous iron.
	3. Identified but uncorrected iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy: Clear iron deficiency anemia (ferritin < 30 μg/L and anemia as defined above) without documentation of commencing oral iron replacement at a dose of at least 30 mg of elemental iron or administration of intravenous iron.
	4. Mild anemia: Hb 100–109 g/L in 1st and 3rd trimester, Hb 100–104 g/L in 2nd trimester.
	5. Moderate anemia: Hb 90–99 g/L in pregnancy.

Hb < 90 g/L postpartum.

### Iron deficiency in adults: A review [^111vsMJh]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (e.g. chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency.

The most common causes of iron deficiency are:

- **Bleeding**: Menstrual and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- **Impaired iron absorption**: Atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, and bariatric surgical procedures.
- **Inadequate dietary iron intake**
- **Pregnancy**

In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia, and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%) and HF (37%-61%).

### Disordered iron homeostasis in chronic heart failure: Prevalence, predictors, and relation to anemia, exercise capacity, and survival [^117UGN6E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to comprehensively delineate iron metabolism and its implications in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

Iron deficiency is an emerging therapeutic target in CHF. In this study, iron and clinical indexes were quantified in 157 patients with CHF.

- **Iron homeostasis**: It was deranged in both anemic and non-anemic subjects. This was characterized by diminished circulating (transferrin saturation) and functional (mean cell hemoglobin concentration) iron status, despite seemingly adequate stores (ferritin). While iron overload and elevated iron stores were rare (1%), iron deficiency (transferrin saturation < 20%) was evident in 43% of patients.

- **Relation to clinical indicators**: Disordered iron homeostasis related closely to worsening inflammation and disease severity. It strongly predicted lower hemoglobin levels independently of age, sex, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and creatinine. The etiologies of anemia varied with disease severity. An iron-deficient substrate (anemia of chronic disease and/or iron-deficiency anemia) was evident in 16%, 72%, and 100% of anemic NYHA functional class I or II, III, and IV patients, respectively. Although anemia of chronic disease was more prevalent than iron-deficiency anemia, both conditions coexisted in 17% of subjects.

- **Impact on exercise capacity and survival**: Iron deficiency was associated with lower peak oxygen consumption and higher ratios of ventilation to carbon dioxide production. It also identified those at an enhanced risk for death.

### Threshold ferritin and hepcidin concentrations indicating early iron deficiency in young women based on upregulation of iron absorption [^114BVQ7A]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

- **Determination of iron absorption**: In all studies, we measured iron absorption after an overnight fast (no food intake after 8 PM, no drink intake after 12 AM) using a standardized stable-isotope technique in which the incorporation of oral ⁵⁷Fe-, ⁵⁸Fe- or ⁵⁴Fe into erythrocytes was measured 14 days after administration. We measured height and weight using standardized methods. An overnight fasting venous blood sample was collected in the morning to measure ferritin, hepcidin, and C-reactive protein either at baseline screening (8 studies) or just before meal administration (16 studies). The test meals (see Supplementary Material) were administered between 7 and 9 AM under standardized conditions and close supervision. All meals were extrinsically labelled with ferrous sulfate, added just before feeding. No food or fluid intake was allowed for at least 3 hours after test meal intake. Fourteen days after test meal administration, another fasting morning venous blood sample was collected for isotopic measurements.

- **Blood analyses**: All hematological and biochemical measurements were performed at the time of each study. Hemoglobin was measured on the day of venipuncture using a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Indianapolis, USA) or Hemocue (HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden). Plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Hepcidin was measured using an immunoassay (DRG GmbH, Marburg, Germany). Ferritin (n = 368 observations) and C-reactive protein (n = 322 observations) concentrations were measured using a multiplex sandwich ELISA.

### Injury-associated anemia and iron homeostasis following orthopaedic trauma: A prospective observational study of 844 patients [^113Kinmo]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of injury-associated anemia and functional iron deficiency following operative fracture care.

- **Methods**: The study design was a prospective cohort study conducted at a Level 1 academic trauma center. Patient selection criteria included all operative fracture patients who presented between April 2022 and August 2023. Laboratory tests for anemia were performed on post-operative day one, including complete blood count, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), transferrin, and ferritin levels. Values were enumerated to capture the previously unknown incidence of injury-associated anemia.

- **Results**: A total of 844 patients were screened following operative fracture management (mean age: 52 years, SD 22, 58% male). Injury-associated anemia was present in 94.7% (median hemoglobin: 10.0 [IQR: 8.5–11.1]) of the eligible patients. Moreover, 72.5% of patients with anemia did not meet the transfusion requirements. Serum ferritin levels exceeded 50 ng/mL in 89.8% of patients overall and 96.9% in those with all other iron studies low. Patients with fractures in multiple extremities demonstrated 52% higher odds of elevated ferritin levels than patients with isolated fractures after controlling for transfusions and sex (adjusted OR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.06–2.17, p = 0.02).

### Dynamic control of hepatic Plasmodium numbers by hepcidin despite elevated liver iron during iron supplementation [^116jjGdC]. Microbes and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in malaria endemic areas is complicated as iron supplementation increases malaria risk, while malaria decreases iron absorption. Here, we measured the influence of hepcidin expression and non-heme iron during iron supplementation on hepatic Plasmodium berghei numbers in anemic and non-anemic mice. Despite elevated hepatic non-heme iron on the high iron diet, elevated hepcidin expression is associated with less parasite-bioavailable iron and lower hepatic parasite loads in anemic, iron-deficient mice after both two and six weeks of supplementation. A marginal trend towards lower parasite hepatic numbers was seen in non-anemic, iron-replete mice. In a transgenic model of severe anemia, mice with a deletion in Sec15l1, which reportedly have normal liver iron and normal hepcidin expression, showed no changes in liver parasite numbers, blood stage numbers, or outcome in the lethal Plasmodium yoelii model. In summary, during iron supplementation, lower hepatic malaria numbers are regulated more by hepcidin than by the absolute level of non-heme hepatic iron.

### Intravenous iron therapy for non-anaemic, iron-deficient adults [^115Y5XQc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies and has a number of physiological manifestations. Early, or non-anaemic, iron deficiency can result in fatigue and diminished exercise capacity. Oral iron preparations have a high incidence of intolerable side effects and are ineffective in certain forms of iron deficiency. Consequently, intravenous iron preparations are increasingly used in the treatment of non-anaemic iron deficiency. The newer, more stable iron preparations, in particular, purport to have a lower incidence of side effects and are now used across a range of different patient populations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intravenous iron therapy in the treatment of adults with non-anaemic iron deficiency.

- **Search methods**: On 18 October 2019, we electronically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two further databases, and two trials registries. We hand-searched the references of full-text extracted studies and contacted relevant study authors for additional data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared any intravenous iron preparation to placebo in adults. We excluded other forms of comparison such as oral iron versus placebo, intramuscular iron versus placebo, or intravenous iron studies where other iron preparations were used as the comparator. We also excluded studies involving erythropoietin therapy or obstetric populations.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.

Iron deficiency anemia may arise from various causes, including hemorrhoids, peptic ulcer disease, celiac disease, colonic diverticulosis, intestinal hookworm infection, chemical- and radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, ulcerative colitis, sideroblastic anemia, Helicobacter pylori infection, and chronic gastritis. Additionally, it can be associated with small bowel adenocarcinoma, pregnancy, lead poisoning, intraoperative blood loss, Heyde's syndrome, ankylostomiasis, phlebotomy, gastric cancer, colon cancer, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, Crohn's disease, and menstruation. Medications such as oxymetholone may also be a contributing factor.

Chronic heart failure

Evidence of some degree of iron deficiency, as defined by an SF < 100 µg/L and/or a transferrin saturation of < 20%, is found in 40%–70% of cases with CHF. The causes are multifactorial, with malabsorption, malnutrition, and GI blood loss (potentially exacerbated by anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) all potentially contributing. Additionally, the chronic inflammatory state present in many patients with CHF can lead to increased hepcidin release by the liver, resulting in reduced iron absorption and mobilization.

Patients with CHF should be screened for iron deficiency by measuring ferritin and transferrin saturation. Endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract should be considered if they have evidence of absolute iron deficiency (see the Definitions section) to exclude treatable GI causes. Decisions about the need for and safety of endoscopic evaluation should ideally be made in conjunction with the cardiology team.

The majority, however, have FID rather than absolute iron deficiency. Nevertheless, both forms of ID are associated with reduced functional capacity, impaired quality of life, and poorer prognosis in CHF. Patients who meet the above criteria for iron deficiency in this condition should, therefore, be considered for intravenous IRT, as this has been shown to have prognostic benefits in meta-analyses. No prognostic benefit has been demonstrated for oral iron, and this is best avoided as in CHF it may be poorly absorbed due to gut edema and is frequently associated with side effects. Specific guidelines should be consulted for details.

### High serum transferrin receptor level in anemia of chronic disorders indicates coexistent iron deficiency [^115LDMYR]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Blood transferrin receptor (TR) level is largely determined by the quantum of erythropoiesis and by intracellular iron content of the cells of the erythroid lineage. Hence, a high serum TR level has been found to be useful in distinguishing iron deficiency anemia (IDA) from anemia of chronic disorders (ACD). To examine its potential role in the diagnosis of concomitant iron deficiency in ACD, we determined serum TR levels in 130 cases of ACD, in 25 cases of IDA, and in 40 normal adults. As expected, all patients with IDA had significantly higher serum TR levels compared to the normal subjects (4.2–19.2 microg/dL vs. 1.3–3.0 microg/dL) (P < 0.002). In 11 out of 25 cases of IDA, the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was in the normal range although bone marrow iron store was absent and serum TR levels were high, thereby highlighting the superiority of TR level in diagnosing iron deficiency compared to TIBC.

Although 54% (70 out of 130) of ACD patients had normal or low serum TR levels (0.9–3.0 microg/dL) as expected, in 46% (60 out of 130) of ACD patients, serum TR levels were high (3.2–11.0 microg/dL). Mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, and transferrin saturation were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the latter group of patients compared to the former, and these parameters resembled those in IDA patients. Additionally, serum iron was lower and TIBC was higher in this group of ACD patients compared to those with normal or low serum TR. All these features point to an "IDA-like" profile of ACD patients with high TR and support the possibility of coexistent iron deficiency.

### How we diagnose and treat iron deficiency anemia [^1156eU7K]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is anemic, with the majority due to iron deficiency (ID). In adults, ID is associated with fatigue in the absence of anemia, restless legs syndrome, and pica. In neonates, it can lead to delayed growth and development, while adolescents may experience decrements in learning and behavioral abnormalities.

In the absence of a clear cause, a search for a source of bleeding is indicated. No single test is diagnostic of ID unless the serum ferritin is low or the percent transferrin saturation is low with an elevated total iron binding capacity.

Oral iron is considered front-line therapy except for conditions such as gastric bypass, heavy uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. However, oral iron has many unpleasant side effects, resulting in low patient adherence. For patients intolerant of, or unresponsive to, oral iron, intravenous (IV) administration is the preferred route.

While early formulations were associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), newer formulations are much safer, with SAEs occurring very infrequently. Full replacement doses can be administered in a matter of minutes to a few hours. Nevertheless, there remains a reluctance to use IV iron due to misunderstanding the safety of the available formulations. IV iron is safe and effective in all clinical circumstances, including pregnancy.

The preponderance of published evidence suggests IV iron therapy is underutilized, and we believe that IV iron should be moved forward in the treatment of ID and iron deficiency anemia.

### Effect of low-dose ferrous sulfate vs iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in young children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia: A randomized clinical trial [^117QVBmY]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) affects millions of persons worldwide and is associated with impaired neurodevelopment in infants and children. Ferrous sulfate is the most commonly prescribed oral iron despite iron polysaccharide complex possibly being better tolerated.

- **Objective**: To compare the effect of ferrous sulfate with iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in infants and children with nutritional IDA.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This double-blind, superiority randomized clinical trial involved infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional IDA (assessed by history and laboratory criteria). It was conducted in an outpatient hematology clinic at a US tertiary care hospital from September 2013 through November 2015; the 12-week follow-up concluded in January 2016.

- **Interventions**: Participants received 3 mg/kg of elemental iron once daily as either ferrous sulfate drops or iron polysaccharide complex drops for 12 weeks.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin levels over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included complete resolution of IDA, defined as hemoglobin concentration > 11 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume > 70 fL, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent > 25 pg, serum ferritin level > 15 ng/mL, and total iron-binding capacity < 425 μg/dL at the 12-week visit. Changes in serum ferritin level and total iron-binding capacity, along with any adverse effects, were also measured.

- **Results**: Of 80 randomized infants and children (median age, 22 months; 55% male; 61% Hispanic white; 40 per group), 59 completed the trial (28 [70%] in the ferrous sulfate group; 31 [78%] in the iron polysaccharide complex group).

### Raised serum ferritin concentration in hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome is not a marker for iron overload [^1174B32g]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

A 43-year-old Caucasian man was hospitalized following exposure to formaldehyde. His hemoglobin, serum iron concentration, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation were within the laboratory reference ranges, but his serum ferritin concentration was elevated (1650 μg/L; reference range 25–300 μg/L). Serum transaminase activities, copper, ceruloplasmin, and lead concentrations were normal. A liver biopsy showed normal liver architecture and no evidence of iron overload. There was no history of alcohol abuse. He did, however, have a family history of hemochromatosis in a pattern suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance and a personal history of bilateral rheumatoid factor-negative arthritis affecting his ankles and knees, which had resolved spontaneously after 6 months, and of bilateral cataract removal the previous year.

A diagnosis of hemochromatosis was made on the basis of the strong family history and the presence of persistent hyperferritinemia, despite the absence of evidence of iron overload. Venesection (450 mL) was performed monthly for 6 months but was stopped when the patient became symptomatic with microcytic, iron-deficient anemia in the absence of any other source of bleeding. At this time, his hemoglobin was 10.0 g/dL (12.5–17.5 g/dL), transferrin saturation 4% (20%-55%), while his serum ferritin remained elevated at 1,728 μg/L. Venesection was stopped; he was treated with iron supplements until he was iron replete, and his serum ferritin concentrations remained elevated throughout.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116VTxiw]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, which reflects an increase in hepatic iron content. Hemochromatosis can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers (transferrin saturation, ferritin) are widely available, and the majority of patients with hemochromatosis are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Certain high-risk groups should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of hemochromatosis, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function undergo iron studies at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm, which is an adaptation from the version used in the previous American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines, can provide further direction regarding testing and treatment for hemochromatosis.

The initial approach to diagnosis is through indirect markers of iron stores, namely transferrin saturation or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin. Transferrin saturation is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in Black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age.

Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis.

In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended, beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Iron status of the free-living, elderly Framingham Heart Study cohort: an iron-replete population with a high prevalence of elevated iron stores [^1166TELi]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Although iron deficiency commonly occurs in vulnerable groups, such as women of reproductive age, infants, and children, less is known about the iron nutriture of the elderly. Our objective was to evaluate the iron status of a noninstitutionalized, elderly US population, with a particular focus on two concerns unique to the elderly: potential confounding effects of chronic disease on iron measures and increased occurrence of elevated iron stores.

Multiple iron measures, including serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, mean cell volume, and hemoglobin, were used to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID), iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and other measures of iron nutriture in 1,016 elderly white Americans aged 67–96 years from the Framingham Heart Study. "Diseased" subjects were defined as those with possible pathologically altered iron measures due to inflammation, infection, elevated liver enzymes, hereditary hemochromatosis, or cancer. The effect of altered iron status on various prevalence estimates was assessed.

The elderly subjects had a low prevalence of ID (2.7%), IDA (1.2%), and depleted iron stores (3%; SF 300 microg/L in men and SF > 200 microg/L in women), of which only 1% was attributable to chronic disease. The prevalence of ID, IDA, and depleted iron stores was unaffected by the presence of chronic disease.

In conclusion, the Framingham Heart Study cohort is an iron-replete elderly population with a high prevalence of elevated iron stores.

Pathophysiology of iron deficiency anemia in IBD

The cause of anemia in patients with IBD is multifactorial. The two most frequent etiological forms are iron deficiency anemia (IDA), resulting from iron deficiency secondary to blood loss through the ulcerations of the intestinal mucosa, reduced iron absorption, and reduced intake; and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), first described by Cartwright in 1946. ACD is characterized by normal or reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reduced serum iron, reduced total iron binding capacity (TIBC), normal to elevated serum ferritin level, and reticuloendothelial system (RES) stores that are elevated relative to total body iron. While vitamin B12-folate deficiency and drug-induced anemia (sulfasalazine, thiopurines, methotrexate, calcineurin inhibitors) are less widespread, these possibilities should also be considered.

The human body stores approximately 3–4 grams (40–50 mg/kg) of iron, while desquamation of the epithelial cells of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, bile ducts, and urinary tract, along with blood loss during menstruation, accounts for daily losses of around 1–2 mg. Mammalian iron homeostasis is controlled exclusively by means of iron absorption from the duodenum (and to a lesser extent in the proximal jejunum) in both the healthy and inflamed state, and is tightly regulated by hepcidin. Hepcidin gene expression is up-regulated during inflammation.

### The effect of alcohol consumption on the prevalence of iron overload, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia [^115Ag2t1]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Our aim was to investigate the relationship between alcohol consumption and iron overload, iron deficiency, or iron deficiency anemia in the U.S. population.

- **Methods**: Adult participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not consume alcohol (n = 8839) were compared with participants who consumed 1 to 2 (n = 915) alcoholic drinks/day during the preceding 12 months. We examined the following markers of iron overload: elevated serum transferrin-iron saturation (TS) level (> 45%, > 50%, and > 60%), elevated serum ferritin level (> 300, > 400, > 500, and > 600 ng/mL), and combinations of both elevated serum TS and ferritin levels. Iron deficiency was defined as the presence of at least two of the following: serum ferritin level ≤ 1.24 micromol/L. Iron deficiency anemia was defined as the presence of both iron deficiency and anemia.

- **Results**: Compared with nondrinkers, the prevalence of all markers of iron overload was significantly elevated among those who consumed more than two alcoholic drinks/day after adjusting for potential confounders. Consumption of any amount of alcohol was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of iron deficiency anemia.

- **Conclusions**: Consumption of up to two alcoholic drinks/day seems to be associated with reduced risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia without a concomitant increase in the risk of iron overload. Consumption of more than two alcoholic drinks/day is associated with a significant elevation in markers of iron overload.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: Diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^114JLXDd]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Circulating iron bound to transferrin (TIBC, total iron-binding capacity by transferrin) reflects the amount of iron available for metabolizing target cells. Importantly, neither serum iron nor serum transferrin alone should be used as biomarkers of iron status. Instead, transferrin saturation (Tsat) — the percentage of transferrin that has iron bound to it (ratio of serum iron to TIBC × 100) — is recommended. Reduced Tsat (< 20%) is considered a surrogate of insufficient iron available for metabolizing cells. With malnutrition accompanying chronic diseases, liver synthesis and blood transferrin levels may be low, which can artificially increase Tsat, disproportionate to the actual iron content.

When serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg/L, which is frequent in patients with chronic diseases and pro-inflammatory activation, diagnosing iron deficiency (ID) becomes more complex. Such values are usually associated with normal or slightly increased intracellular iron stores, and the diagnosis of absolute ID cannot be made. However, if there is restricted iron delivery to target cells, indicated by reduced Tsat (< 20%), functional ID can be diagnosed.

### Iron deficiency predicts impaired exercise capacity in patients with systolic chronic heart failure [^1148Cfv6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Iron is an indispensable element of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochromes, and, beyond erythropoiesis, is involved in oxidative metabolism and cellular energetics. Hence, iron deficiency (ID) is anticipated to limit exercise capacity. We investigated whether ID predicted exercise intolerance in patients with systolic chronic heart failure (CHF).

- **Methods and results**: We prospectively studied 443 patients with stable systolic CHF (age 54 ± 10 years, males 90%, ejection fraction 26 ± 7%, New York Heart Association Class I/II/III/IV 49/188/180/26). ID was defined as serum ferritin < 100 μg/L or serum ferritin 100–300 μg/L with serum transferrin saturation < 20%. Exercise capacity was expressed as peak oxygen consumption (VO₂) and ventilatory response to exercise (VE-VCO₂ slope). ID was present in 35 ± 4% (± 95% confidence interval) of patients with systolic CHF. Those with ID had reduced peak VO₂ and increased VE-VCO₂ slope as compared to subjects without ID (peak VO₂: 13.3 ± 4.0 versus 15.3 ± 4.5 mL•min•kg, VE-VCO₂ slope: 50.9 ± 15.8 versus 43.1 ± 11.1, respectively, both P < .001, P < .05). In multivariable models, the presence of ID was associated with reduced peak VO(2) (β = -0.14, P < .01) and higher VE-VCO(2) slope (β = 0.14, P < .01), adjusted for demographics and clinical variables. Analogous associations were found between serum ferritin, and both peak VO(2) and VE-VCO(2) slope (P < .05).

- **Conclusions**: ID independently predicts exercise intolerance in patients with systolic CHF, but the strength of these associations is relatively modest.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. An increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis. This increases the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are:

- **Impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei**: This occurs during terminal erythropoiesis, causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes due to nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony.
- **Altered red cell hydration**: This increases cell volume.
- **Altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane**.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions or malabsorption syndromes like short-gut syndrome.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from an inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as hemoglobin levels two standard deviations below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (e.g. pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (e.g. menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), use of certain drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetic factors (e.g. iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (as seen in chronic kidney disease).

- **Epidemiology**: In the United States, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5% to 18.0%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. It is also a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease, and IDA is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113DECq2]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

In summary, an SF < 15 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency (specificity 0.99). A cut-off of 45 µg/L provides a respectable specificity of 0.92, and figures below this may warrant consideration of GI investigation, especially in the context of a chronic inflammatory process with anaemia.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive, such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias, and Hb E — and most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log₁₀ ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.

A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA, but it is dependent on compliance. A ≥ 10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective, and difficult to justify in most cases.

After excluding thalassaemia carriage, low Retic-Hb provides evidence of iron restriction and should be considered in the laboratory work-up of anaemia, particularly where there is chronic renal impairment. Retic-Hb is reported to be a more reliable marker of iron restriction than sTfR in healthy blood donors. An early indicator of response to iron therapy in IDA is provided by a rising Retic-Hb on day 4, similar to the observation of a falling percentage of hypochromic red cells.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114J4SK1]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

In the screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, particularly regarding diagnostic criteria, the BSG 2021 guidelines recommend recognizing that a good response to iron therapy, indicated by a hemoglobin rise of ≥ 10 g/L within a two-week timeframe in anemic patients, is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.
