## Question

my advanced ms patient is stable does specialized green-lion root help with fatigue

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "specialized green-lion root" helps with fatigue in advanced, stable multiple sclerosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "green-lion root" actually refers to and whether it appears in the provided evidence base. Then, I should verify whether any guideline or trial in the packet evaluates this specific agent for MS fatigue. Next, I will review which complementary therapies do have evidence for fatigue in MS, so I can offer safer, evidence-aligned alternatives. Finally, I will consider safety, interactions, and practical counseling points, and conclude with a clear recommendation based on the available data.

> Let me first confirm the identity of "green-lion root". Wait, let me verify whether this name appears anywhere in the provided references. I do not see any mention of "green-lion root" in the AAN CAM guidelines, the EAN palliative care guidance, or the systematic reviews and trials included here, which makes me suspect this may be a colloquial or brand name rather than a standard botanical, or it may not be covered by the evidence base in this packet at all.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check for possible synonyms or look-alike names that could be confused with it. I see ginkgo biloba, Siberian ginseng, and ashwagandha discussed in the materials, but none of these are labeled as "green-lion root", and there is no indexed entry for "green-lion root" in the guideline tables or trial summaries, so I cannot attribute fatigue benefits to this specific agent based on the provided sources [^111A7mfi] [^112hsPyM] [^116oZVCz].

> Next, I should review what the guidelines actually say about complementary therapies for MS fatigue, so I can anchor the discussion in evidence. The AAN guideline indicates that ginkgo biloba is possibly effective for fatigue over about 4 weeks, but it is established as ineffective for cognition, and clinicians should counsel on uncertain quality control and potential interactions with disease-modifying therapies, which underscores the need for caution with unregulated supplements [^111A7mfi] [^116FHtAa]. Magnetic therapy is rated as probably effective for fatigue, though data are mixed and not uniformly positive across studies, so expectations should be tempered [^117MEc87] [^115r11ej]. Conversely, a low-fat diet with fish oil supplementation is probably ineffective for fatigue in MS, and bee sting therapy is possibly ineffective with safety concerns, so these should not be recommended for fatigue reduction [^112dkXh1] [^117S1LNM] [^115Uy1Nb].

> I will now examine pharmacologic options with some evidence, because if fatigue is clinically significant, we should prioritize interventions with at least modest, reproducible signals. Amantadine has the most consistent, albeit small, benefit signal in older and smaller studies, though a high-quality crossover trial found no superiority of amantadine, modafinil, or methylphenidate over placebo, so medication choices should be individualized and monitored closely for adverse effects and expectations [^116WXA9a] [^112wGAd8]. The EAN palliative care guideline suggests considering amantadine, 4-aminopyridine, or cannabinoids in severe MS, balancing availability, comorbidities, and adverse effects, which can guide shared decision-making in advanced disease [^111umLXJ].

> Let me consider nonpharmacologic strategies with stronger or more consistent evidence, since these are often first-line and safer. Energy conservation and fatigue management education programs show short-term improvements in fatigue impact and quality of life, and CBT-based programs like FACETS demonstrate sustained benefits with booster sessions, making them reasonable referrals in stable patients who can engage in group or structured programs [^114br1Kr] [^113SNJfJ] [^114WYAfi]. Exercise, particularly resistance training, has emerging evidence for meaningful fatigue reduction in MS, and mindfulness-based approaches are also endorsed for fatigue management in severe MS, aligning with a multimodal, patient-centered plan [^116JQtws] [^117MbM1Q].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on high-efficacy disease-modifying therapy? Could that be influencing fatigue? I should confirm that highly effective DMTs can modestly improve fatigue in some cohorts, suggesting that optimizing disease control may contribute to fatigue relief in a subset, though this does not replace symptomatic management and should be framed as part of a comprehensive approach rather than a standalone fatigue treatment [^113B65ZG] [^114xb1Eb].

> I need to ensure safety counseling is explicit. Since "green-lion root" is unidentified in the provided evidence, I cannot confirm its safety, dosing, or interaction profile with MS therapies, and the AAN explicitly notes that the safety and efficacy of many CAM agents, and their interactions with DMTs, are unknown, so using an uncharacterized supplement risks harm or interference with effective treatments [^1179LMsk] [^113bKG7x]. Given the lack of data, I should advise avoiding this product and document the discussion, while offering to review the exact product name, ingredients, and manufacturer to check for known safety issues or drug–supplement interactions.

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Based on the provided references, there is no evidence that "specialized green-lion root" improves fatigue in MS, and I cannot recommend its use. Instead, I would prioritize evidence-supported options such as energy conservation or CBT-based fatigue programs, consider resistance training or other structured exercise, and, if medication is needed, discuss a cautious trial of amantadine or consider EAN-suggested options in severe MS, all while screening for reversible contributors to fatigue and coordinating with the patient's neurology team to avoid interactions with DMTs [^114br1Kr] [^113SNJfJ] [^114WYAfi] [^116JQtws] [^116WXA9a] [^112wGAd8] [^111umLXJ].

## Evidence-based interventions for MS fatigue

Several interventions have **evidence for MS fatigue** and may be considered:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Energy conservation therapy | High | Effective in reducing fatigue impact and improving quality of life [^114br1Kr] |
| Exercise (aerobic, resistance, aquatic) | Moderate | Effective in reducing fatigue and improving quality of life [^116JQtws] [^112uPXhT] |
| Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) | Moderate | Effective in reducing fatigue severity and impact [^114WYAfi] [^113SNJfJ] |
| Amantadine | Moderate | Small but significant benefit in fatigue reduction [^116WXA9a] |
| Modafinil | Low | Conflicting evidence; some studies show benefit, others do not [^111tc1VV] [^112wGAd8] |

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

- **Unknown safety profile**: Without clinical data, risks, side effects, and contraindications are unknown.

- **Potential interactions**: Herbal products can interact with MS disease-modifying therapies and other medications.

- **Quality control issues**: Herbal products are not standardized, leading to variability in potency and contamination risk.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and European Academy of Neurology (EAN) provide **evidence-based guidance** for MS fatigue management, emphasizing:

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Energy conservation, exercise, and CBT are recommended [^114br1Kr] [^117MbM1Q].

- **Pharmacological options**: Amantadine may be considered; modafinil has conflicting evidence [^116WXA9a] [^112wGAd8].

- **Avoidance of unproven therapies**: Therapies without evidence, such as "specialized green-lion root", are not recommended.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no evidence** supporting "specialized green-lion root" for MS fatigue. I recommend:

- **Confirm the product**: Please provide the exact name, botanical identity, or a link so I can verify safety and interactions.

- **Use evidence-based therapies**: Consider energy conservation, exercise, CBT, or medications like amantadine or modafinil under medical supervision [^114br1Kr] [^116JQtws] [^114WYAfi] [^112wGAd8].

- **Consult your neurologist**: Discuss any complementary therapy before use to avoid interactions and ensure safety.

If you can clarify the product, I will gladly review it further.

### Complementary and alternative medical therapies in multiple sclerosis – the American Academy of Neurology guidelines: a commentary [^113WCBhY]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) is common, but its use has been limited by a lack of evidence-based guidance.

Methods

In March 2014, the American Academy of Neurology published the most comprehensive literature review and evidence-based practice guidelines for CAM use in MS. The guideline author panel reviewed and classified articles according to the American Academy of Neurology therapeutic scheme, and recommendations were linked to the evidence strength.

Findings

Level A recommendations were found for oral cannabis extract effectiveness in the short term for spasticity-related symptoms and pain and ineffectiveness of ginkgo biloba for cognitive function improvement in MS. Key level B recommendations included: Oral cannabis extract or a synthetic cannabis constituent, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is probably ineffective for objective spasticity improvement in the short term; Nabiximols oromucosal cannabinoid spray is probably effective for spasticity symptoms, pain, and urinary frequency, but probably ineffective for objective spasticity outcomes and bladder incontinence; Magnetic therapy is probably effective for fatigue reduction in MS; A low-fat diet with fish oil supplementation is probably ineffective for MS-related relapses, disability, fatigue, magnetic resonance imaging lesions, and quality of life. Several Level C recommendations were made. These included possible effectiveness of gingko biloba for fatigue; possible effectiveness of reflexology for MS-related paresthesias; possible ineffectiveness of the Cari Loder regimen for MS-related disability, symptoms, depression, and fatigue; and bee sting therapy for MS relapses, disability, fatigue, magnetic resonance imaging outcomes, and health-related quality of life.

Implications

Despite the availability of studies evaluating the effects of oral cannabis in MS, the use of these formulations in United States may be limited due to a lack of standardized, commercial US Food and Drug Administration-regulated preparations. Additionally, significant concern about prominent central nervous system-related adverse effects with cannabis was emphasized in the review.

### Carnitine for fatigue in multiple sclerosis [^112pVHQQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fatigue is reported to occur in up to 92% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and has been described as the most debilitating of all MS symptoms by 28% to 40% of MS patients.

Objectives

To assess whether carnitine (enteral or intravenous) supplementation can improve the quality of life and reduce the symptoms of fatigue in patients with MS-related fatigue and to identify any adverse effects of carnitine when used for this purpose.

Search Methods

A literature search was performed using Cochrane MS Group Trials Register (09 September 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) "The Cochrane Library 2011, issue 3", MEDLINE (PubMed) (1966–09 September 2011), EMBASE (1974–09 September 2011), and www.clinicaltrials.gov for ongoing trials retrieval. Reference lists of review articles and primary studies were also screened. A hand search of the abstract book of recent relevant conference symposia was also conducted. Personal contact with MS experts and a manufacturer (Source Naturals, United States) of carnitine formulation was contacted to determine if they knew of other clinical trials. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Full reports of published and unpublished randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials of any carnitine intervention in adults affected by multiple sclerosis with a clinical diagnosis of fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from the eligible trials was extracted and coded using a standardized data extraction form and entered into RevMan 5. Discrepancies were to be resolved by discussion with a third reviewer, however this was not necessary. The quality items to be assessed were method of randomization, allocation concealment, blinding (participants, investigators, outcome assessors and data analysis), intention-to-treat analysis and completeness of follow up.

Main Results

The search identified one ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial (expected completion 2013) and one completed randomized, active-comparator, cross-over trial. In the completed study, adult patients with relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS were exposed to both acetyl L-carnitine 2 grams daily and amantadine 200 mg daily The effects of carnitine on fatigue are unclear. There was no difference between carnitine and amantadine for the number of patients withdrawing from the study due to an adverse event (relative risk ratio 0.20; 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.55) and no patients experienced a serious adverse event in either treatment group. Mortality and quality of life were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence that carnitine for the treatment of MS-related fatigue offers a therapeutic advantage over placebo or active comparators. Results of the ongoing trial are eagerly anticipated in order to provide clarity.

### Fatigue in multiple sclerosis: can we measure it and can we treat it? [^113cX4LL]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, after over 100 years of inquiry its definition, measurement and understanding remains elusive. This paper describes the challenges clinicians and researchers face when assessing and treating MS patients, as well as our understanding of neural mechanisms involved in fatigue. Challenges for the future are discussed.

### A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled feasibility trial of flavonoid-rich cocoa for fatigue in people with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis [^117Eh95J]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The impact of flavonoids on fatigue has not been investigated in relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

Objective

To determine the feasibility and estimate the potential effect of flavonoid-rich cocoa on fatigue and fatigability in RRMS.

Methods

A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled feasibility study in people recently diagnosed with RRMS and fatigue, throughout the Thames Valley, UK (ISRCTN69897291). During a 6-week intervention participants consumed a high or low flavonoid cocoa beverage daily. Fatigue and fatigability were measured at three visits (weeks 0, 3 and 6). Feasibility and fidelity were assessed through recruitment and retention, adherence and a process evaluation.

Results

40 people with multiple sclerosis (10 men, 30 women, age 44 ± 10years) were randomised and allocated to high (n = 19) or low (n = 21) flavonoid groups and included in analysis. Missing data were < 20%and adherence to intervention of allocated individuals was > 75%. There was a small effect on fatigue (Neuro-QoL: effect size (ES) 0.04, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.48) and a moderate effect on fatigability (6min walk test: ES 0.45, 95% CI -0.18 to 1.07). There were seven adverse events (four control, three intervention), only one of which was possibly related and it was resolved.

Conclusion

A flavonoid beverage demonstrates the potential to improve fatigue and fatigability in RRMS.

### Effectiveness of energy conservation treatment in reducing fatigue in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114br1Kr]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To systematically review the effects of energy conservation management (ECM) treatment for fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS), and to study the effect of ECM treatment on restrictions in participation and quality of life (QoL).

Data Sources

PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Knowledge were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials.

Study Selection

To select potential studies, 2 reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality of the studies included. If meta-analysis was not possible, qualitative best-evidence synthesis was used to summarize the results.

Data Synthesis

The searches identified 532 studies, 6 of which were included. The studies compared the short-term effects of ECM treatment and control treatment on fatigue and QoL; 1 study reported short-term and midterm effects on participation, but found no evidence for effectiveness. Meta-analyses (2 RCTs, N = 350) showed that ECM treatment was more effective than no treatment in improving subscale scores of the (1) Fatigue Impact Scale: cognitive (mean difference [MD] = -2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.32 to -1.50), physical (MD = -2.99; 95% CI, -4.47 to -1.52), and psychosocial (MD = -6.05; 95% CI, -8.72 to -3.37); and (2) QoL: role physical (MD = 17.26; 95% CI, 9.69–24.84), social function (MD = 6.91; 95% CI, 1.32–12.49), and mental health (MD = 5.55; 95% CI, 2.27–8.83). Limited or no evidence was found for the effectiveness of ECM treatment on the other outcomes in the short-term or midterm. None of the studies reported long-term results.

Conclusions

The systematic review results provide evidence that in the short-term, ECM treatment can be more effective than no treatment (waiting controls) in reducing the impact of fatigue and in improving 3 QoL scales-role physical, social function, and mental health-in fatigued patients with MS. More RCTs that also study long-term results are needed.

### Towards new perspectives: a scoping review and meta-synthesis to redefine brain health for multiple sclerosis [^113kicXZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Preserving and optimizing brain health via lifestyle modifications and positive behaviour change are increasingly recognized as important factors in long‐term MS management. However, significant message variability and heterogeneity is apparent. Physical activity and smoking cessation remain the most widely recognized behavioural changes amongst plwMS, probably due to their well‐established benefits to MS symptomatology, quality of life and clear associations with disease susceptibility and advancement.

Recommendations for specific dietary patterns were most diverse and often (n = 5, 21%) coupled with maintaining a healthy weight which is identified as important to manage mobility and symptoms such as fatigue. Undoubtedly, consumer awareness of this conflicting dietary information is troubling and exposure to mixed messages may negatively influence behaviour change and/or more general beliefs about dietary management whilst living with MS. A greater focus that ensures consistency of messaging is needed to promote behaviour change through a lived experience, particularly when it comes to dietary guidance. Therefore, and to lead by example, it must be acknowledged that, despite four evidence sources encouraging supplemental vitamin D, recent results from two vitamin D supplement trials have shown that high dose vitamin D does not reduce MS disease activity.

### Multiple sclerosis-related fatigue [^116h6mcD]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Fatigue is a significant factor in the lives of many MS patients and the most commonly reported symptom in many studies. Fatigue is an important symptom to consider because it affects patients' social lives, occupations, and activities of daily living. Efforts to predict fatigue have been mixed, but it appears to be related to overall quality of life and mood. From a pathophysiologic perspective, fatigue in MS is multifactorial and complex, involving dysregulation of the immune system, changes in the nervous system related to the disease process, neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter changes, and other factors such as physical deconditioning, sleep disturbance, pain, and medication side effects. Various attempts to assess fatigue have been made, and many measures are now available for use in clinical practice and research. In clinical practice, these measures help guide treatment considerations. Recent research has provided valuable strategies to ameliorate fatigue in MS, and although many patients continue to experience fatigue despite interventions, many receive substantial relief. Nonpharmacologic approaches-considered the first step in treatment-include exercise programs, cooling, dietary considerations, and energy conservation strategies. For patients who continue to experience significant fatigue, several medications (although not specifically approved for use in the reduction of MS-related fatigue) have proved effective in this regard. The first-line agents include amantadine for mild fatigue and modafinil for more severe cases. Second-line agents include pemoline and antidepressant medications. Other pharmacologic agents have also shown some promise.

### Education for fatigue management in people with multiple sclerosis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vm4iX]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The current evidence shows a small beneficial effect of various education programmes on fatigue severity and impact. Whilst the included programmes varied substantially in content, duration and mode of delivery, they seem to present a feasible and safe approach to reduce fatigue in patients with MS. Since most evaluated programmes showed some benefit on fatigue, adaptations of programmes to fit into different models of clinical MS patient care also seem feasible.

### Amantadine for fatigue in multiple sclerosis [^114oYvsp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The effective management of fatigue has an important impact on the patient's functioning, abilities, and quality of life. Although a number of strategies have been devised for reducing fatigue, treatment recommendations are based on a limited amount of scientific evidence. Many textbooks report amantadine as a first-choice drug for MS-related fatigue because of published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showing some benefit.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of amantadine in treating fatigue in people with MS.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane MS Group Trials Register (July 2006), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (January 1974 to July 2006), bibliographies of relevant articles and handsearched relevant journals. We also contacted drug companies and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo or other drugs-controlled, double-blind trials of amantadine in MS people with fatigue.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers selected studies for inclusion in the review and they extracted the data reported in the original articles. We requested missing and unclear data by correspondence with the trial's principal investigator. A meta-analysis was not performed due to the inadequacy of available data and heterogeneity of outcome measures.

Main Results

Out of 13 pertinent publications, 5 trials met the criteria for inclusion in this review: one study was a parallel arms study, and 4 were crossover trials. The number of randomised participants ranged between 10 and 115, and a total of 272 MS patients were studied. Overall the quality of the studies considered was poor and all trials were open to bias. All studies reported small and inconsistent improvements in fatigue, whereas the clinical relevance of these findings and the impact on patient's functioning and health related quality of life remained undetermined. The number of participants reporting side effects during amantadine therapy ranged from 10% to 57%.

Authors' Conclusions

The efficacy of amantadine in reducing fatigue in people with MS is poorly documented, as well as its tolerability. It is advisable to: (1) improve knowledge on the underlying mechanisms of MS-related fatigue; (2) achieve anagreement on accurate, reliable and responsive outcome measures of fatigue; (3) perform good quality RCTs.

### Education for fatigue management in people with multiple sclerosis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112G3nvk]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an incompletely understood disease of the central nervous system that usually manifests in young adulthood. Disease progression is largely unpredictable, and patients may experience a wide range of symptoms. Fatigue is a symptom related to various chronic and neurological illnesses, for example cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, traumatic brain injury and MS. In MS, fatigue is one of the most common symptoms affecting 75%–95% of patients at least once in their life. Current definitions include a subjective lack of physical/mental energy or both, which is perceived by the individual or the caregiver to interfere with usual or desired activities, an overwhelming sense of tiredness, lack of energy or feelings of exhaustion. The feeling of physical tiredness and lack of energy is distinct from sadness or weakness. Fatigue is considered to be the most disabling symptom by many people with MS, more important than mobility restrictions or pain. Therefore, fatigue is a common reason for unemployment and often a cause for social withdrawal. Nevertheless, fatigue may affect patients very differently; and its causes are yet poorly understood.

### Fatigue in multiple sclerosis [^113PhpMe]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

In summary, MS-related fatigue can be a severe problem causing interference with home and vocational activities. There are multiple factors that can contribute to fatigue in MS, and it is important for the patient, family, and clinician to be aware of potential confounders that may worsen fatigue. Clearer understanding about the etiology of fatigue is necessary. Additional larger, randomized, clinical trials are needed to evaluate etiology, pathophysiology, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Given the varying nature of fatigue and the limited evidence that fatigue in MS patients is highly dependent on self-perceived scores, additional research into the effect of psychosocial and psychological interventions is recommended. A multidisciplinary approach to fatigue is encouraged when treatments are considered for maximum benefit.

### Summary of evidence-based guideline: complementary and alternative medicine in multiple sclerosis: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^117MEc87]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Magnetic therapy in multiple sclerosis (MS) is evaluated across controlled trials, showing fatigue benefits but insufficient evidence for other outcomes, with Level B counseling language. The search "identified 6 studies (1 Class I, 2 Class II, and 3 Class III)". A Class I "12-week RCT (N = 41, RRMS) reported significantly less fatigue (MFIS)", and a secondary measure showed "FSS mean [SD]: placebo 4.7 [1.6], treatment 3.5 [1.3]", with "no change in depression or disability (EDSS)". An underpowered Class II trial "(N = 30; RRMS/progressive MS) found no significant change after Bonferroni correction" using a wristwatch-size device "(10–24 hours/day for 2 months)", and another underpowered Class II trial "(N = 50; RRMS, SPMS, PPMS) found no significant difference in fatigue… 4 sessions per week for 8 weeks (intensity 37.5 mT and a sequence of pulses at 4–7 Hz)". Overall, "Magnetic therapy is probably effective for reducing fatigue in RRMS (1 Class I, 1 Class II) and probably ineffective for reducing depression in RRMS over 15 weeks (1 Class I). Data are inadequate to support or refute the effect of magnetic therapy on reducing MS-related disability… or on improving cognition, mobility, sensation, or vision". The practice recommendation states, "Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that magnetic therapy is probably effective for reducing fatigue (Level B) and probably ineffective for reducing depression (Level B)", and tolerability noted "most studies reported no AEs. One study reported headache, spasms, and burning sensation".

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

To assess the risk of bias of included studies, the guidance from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was followed.

Two authors (SK, AG) independently assessed and scored the included studies' methodological quality to identify any potential sources of bias. Criteria for appraisal of studies were internal validity and low risk of bias through selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Study validity was determined by categorizing individual studies into low, high and unclear risk of bias. As recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, a two‐part tool, addressing six domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues) was used, the first part describing what has been reported in the study and the second part assessing the related risk of bias (low, high or unclear). Domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) and selective outcome reporting (avoidance of reporting bias) were addressed using a single entry for each study. Furthermore, blinding of participants, staff and outcome assessors (avoidance of performance bias and detection bias) was assessed. Assessment of risk of bias across studies followed the instructions provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (chapter 8.7), that is, low risk of bias across studies was defined if the majority of studies providing information for a comparison stemmed from studies at low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias across studies if the majority of studies were rated as low or unclear risk of bias, and high risk of bias across studies if one or more studies with high risk of bias importantly influenced the summary results.

Data synthesis

For the primary outcomes (fatigue severity and impact), meta‐analyses were performed because studies were considered to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous, in terms of participants, interventions and outcomes. Meta‐analyses were performed using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan Web. For the secondary outcomes (depressive symptoms, QoL and coping/self‐efficacy), meta‐analyses were performed if sufficient data were available. Studies were only included in meta‐analyses if means and standard deviations of outcomes for both intervention and control groups were reported. If this was not the case, results were reported narratively.

### Effects of exercise on fatigue and quality of life in multiple sclerosis: a network meta-analysis and systematic review [^116JQtws]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of various physical therapy interventions on fatigue and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases through April 1, 2025. Eligible RCTs compared different exercise interventions in MS patients, focusing on fatigue and quality of life outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used as the effect size, and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was applied to rank interventions. Subgroup and heterogeneity analyses were also performed.

Results

This network meta-analysis included 31 randomized controlled trials involving 1,232 patients with multiple sclerosis. Exercise interventions were overall superior to conventional treatment in alleviating fatigue, with resistance training showing the most significant effect (SMD = - 0.91, p = 0.023). Subgroup analyses indicated that resistance training significantly reduced fatigue in both relapsing-remitting MS and female patients. Interventions lasting more than eight weeks, particularly resistance training and hippotherapy, demonstrated greater benefits. No overall improvement in quality of life was observed; however, female patients experienced significant improvement following resistance training.

Conclusions

Resistance training appears to be the most effective intervention for improving fatigue and quality of life in MS patients, especially in women and during long-term programs. Hippotherapy and coordination training also show promise but require further high-quality trials for validation.

### Is there a role for novel supplements in the management of fatigue in rheumatic diseases? [^116t4Tm7]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Fatigue is a common symptom of rheumatic diseases and frequently persists even when patients are in a near-remission state. In seeking options to manage troublesome symptoms such as fatigue, complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are often used by patients despite a lack of evidence base behind such treatment strategies. CAM use is further promoted by social media and 'influencer' marketing without rigorous process to ensure scientific accuracy. One mechanism of recent interest in the CAM market is enhancing cellular pathways of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), purported to restore mitochondrial function. However, clinical trials of NAD+ pathway supplements lack rigorous trial design, many declare conflicts of interest, and safety data is limited. Ultimately, CAM use by our patients is unavoidable. To adequately inform patients about CAM, we need to keep updated on both the latest scientific literature and social media trends. In so doing, we can then propose to patients how standard-of-care therapies, evidence-based lifestyle modifications and CAM might safely and effectively integrate to form a treatment plan.

The conclusion states bee sting therapy is "possibly ineffective for reducing MS-related relapses, disability, fatigue, total MRI lesion burden, new gadolinium-enhancing lesion volume, or HRQOL (RRMS, SPMS; 1 Class II)". The practice recommendation specifies, "Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that bee sting therapy is possibly ineffective for reducing relapses, disability, fatigue, total MRI lesion burden, new gadolinium-enhancing lesion volume, or HRQOL (Level C)". Reported adverse events included "itching (4 subjects)" and "flu-like symptoms (5 subjects)", and the clinical context warns that "Bee stings can be associated with anaphylactic reaction and possible death".

### High dose thiamine improves fatigue in multiple sclerosis [^114wrRra]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

The majority of the patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience fatigue. Some observations indicate that fatigue and related manifestations concomitant with MS could be associated with an intracellular mild thiamine deficiency. We recruited 15 patients with MS who also experience fatigue and assessed the severity of the fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scale. Although blood thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate levels were within normal limit in all the patients, high-dose thiamine therapy administered orally or parenterally led to an appreciable improvement of the fatigue. The absence of apparent decrease in blood thiamine despite the presence of symptoms referable to a mild thiamine deficiency suggests that these patients may have a dysfunction of the mechanisms of intracellular transport or structural enzymatic abnormalities. The administration of large quantities of thiamine was effective in reversing the fatigue in MS, suggesting that the abnormalities in thiamine-dependent processes could be overcome by diffusion-mediated transport at supranormal thiamine concentrations.

### Fatigue in multiple sclerosis-a brief review [^113qQSUg]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Fatigue is the most common and debilitating symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) and is believed to be distinctly different from fatigue seen in other chronic conditions. It can affect a patient's mood, sleep and have a detrimental effect on their quality of life. In the recent years much literature has emerged in an attempt to elucidate the potential causes and treatment of this common symptom. This review article aims to examine the most recent theories on the pathophysiology of fatigue in MS as well as its association with sleep and depression. We describe the pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to its treatment and propose a multidisciplinary, patient enabled and individualised manner to the management of fatigue in MS.

Fatigue severity

The meta‐analysis of fatigue severity directly after the intervention including eight studies with 878 patients favoured the intervention with an SMD of −0.28 (95% CI −0.53 to −0.03), I² = 65%. Therefore, this meta‐analysis suggested that patient education programmes may slightly reduce fatigue severity in patients with MS directly after the intervention (low certainty evidence, see Figure 3a). Additionally, but not included in the meta‐analysis, Kos et al. did not find significant changes for fatigue severity directly after the intervention compared to placebo.

FIGURE 3
Fatigue severity (a) directly after the intervention, (b) 2–4 months after the intervention and (c) at long‐term (8–14 months) follow‐up.

At the 2–4‐month follow‐up, data of six studies (660 patients overall) were available and favoured the intervention with an SMD of −0.18 (95% CI −0.40 to 0.04), I² = 35%. Education programmes may therefore slightly reduce fatigue severity in patients with MS after 2–4 months (moderate certainty evidence, see Figure 3b).

Insufficient data were available for meta‐analysis at 6–8‐months' follow‐up. van Kessel et al. and colleagues reported a reduction of fatigue severity (intervention group, IG 10.37 (SD 6.37); control group, CG 12.49 (SD 5.24)).

At long‐term follow‐up, data of two studies were available for meta‐analysis. Here, studies with data of 143 patients favoured the intervention with an SMD of −0.03 (95% CI −0.36 to 0.30), I² = 0% (see Figure 3c). Interestingly, Kos et al. reported a reduction of fatigue in the intervention group compared to the control group after 6 months, whilst no change in fatigue severity was documented directly after the intervention.

### Light therapy for multiple sclerosis-associated fatigue: a randomized, controlled phase II trial [^117KrwCe]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bright white light therapy (LT) can improve fatigue in several disease states but has not been studied in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Objective

To determine whether controlled home-based LT is feasible, tolerable, and well-adhered to in MS-associated fatigue.

Methods

A randomized, controlled trial of twice-daily 1-h bright white LT (BWLT) (10,000 lx, active arm) versus dim red LT (DRLT) (< 300 lx, control arm) was performed. Adults with MS-associated fatigue were enrolled for 10 weeks: 2-week baseline, 4-week intervention, 4-week washout.

Results

41 participants were enrolled; 35 were randomized (average age 42 years, 80% female; BWLT n = 20; DRLT n = 15). 31 were in the intention to treat analysis. The average duration of LT sessions was similar between groups (BWLT 60.9 min, DRLT 61.5 min, p = 0.70). The most commonly reported adverse event was headache. There were no events that led to discontinuation. Baseline fatigue was severe in both arms (each 53/63 points on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), p = 0.92). FSS was lower following BWLT (FSS 45.8 post-LT, p = 0.04; 44.9 post-washout, p = 0.02 intra-group compared to baseline FSS) and DRLT (FSS 46.7 post-LT, p = 0.03; 43.9 post-washout, p = 0.002 intragroup compared to baseline FSS). There was no difference between BWLT and DRLT groups in the magnitude of reduction of FSS scores (p = 0.81 after LT; p = 0.77 after washout for between group comparisons). Similarly, MS quality of life metrics improved in both arms but were not significantly different between groups after LT (p = 0.22) or washout.

Conclusions

LT is safe, feasible, and well-tolerated in people with MS-associated fatigue. Improvement in both light spectra likely indicates a strong placebo effect for the DRLT group.

Lifestyle modifications and supportive therapies

Lifestyle modifications play a crucial role in managing progressive MS. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended although studies have shown mixed results. A meta-analysis suggested that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a reduced risk of MS disease activity. A more recent double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that oral cholecalciferol (100,000 IU every two weeks) significantly reduced disease activity in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).

Regular exercise, including aerobic activities, strength training, and stretching, has been shown to improve fitness, mobility, and reduce fatigue in individuals with progressive MS. Exercise training has been shown to improve walking performance and reduce fatigue. Stress management techniques, such as mindfulness meditation, yoga, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), are also effective in reducing stress and improving quality of life.

Quitting smoking was associated with slower disability progression in MS patients. Supportive therapies, such as occupational therapy (OT), speech and language therapy, and psychological support, are essential for maintaining independence and addressing the mental health challenges associated with MS. Internet-based CBT self-management has emerged as a promising and cost-effective intervention for treating MS-related fatigue and improving broader outcomes like distress.

After Bonferroni correction, only the difference in paresthesia reduction remained significant, and reflexology is possibly effective for reducing MS-associated paresthesias over 11 weeks; however, data are inadequate to support or refute the use of reflexology for pain, HRQOL, disability, spasticity, fatigue, cognition, bowel/bladder function, depression, anxiety, or insomnia in MS. Clinicians might counsel patients with MS that reflexology is possibly effective for reducing paresthesias (Level C).

### Ponesimod compared with teriflunomide in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis in the active-comparator phase 3 OPTIMUM study: a randomized clinical trial [^111ZGrkn]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How does the efficacy of ponesimod compare with that of teriflunomide in a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator superiority study based on relapse rate, fatigue, magnetic resonance imaging–defined disease activity, tissue loss, and disability accumulation in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, over 108 weeks?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial, ponesimod was significantly superior to teriflunomide in reducing the annualized relapse rate (−30.5%), Fatigue Symptom and Impact Questionnaire–Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis symptom score (−3.57), and combined unique active lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (−56%).

Meaning

In this study, efficacy of ponesimod was superior to teriflunomide, and ponesimod had a safety profile consistent with sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators without any new safety signals.

### Education for fatigue management in people with multiple sclerosis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152cxsz]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This systematic review and meta‐analysis that followed Cochrane methodology was reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019146246), along with its published protocol.

The aim was to include all individual and cluster‐randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including studies using a cross‐over design, that evaluated the effect of patient education programmes on MS‐related fatigue. Studies using other study designs were not considered since randomly allocated control groups are needed to control for changes in fatigue not mediated by the intervention (e.g. changes in temperature, therapist attention or natural course). No restrictions concerning language or publication status were used.

Studies, irrespective of setting, evaluating adults with a neurologist‐confirmed MS diagnosis of any type (e.g. relapsing–remitting, secondary or primary progressive), according to common diagnostic criteria (e.g.) were included. In studies also including other patient groups apart from people without MS, results for the subgroup of MS patients were used. If these data were not available, studies were included only if at least 80% of participants were people with MS. Participants were also required to have confirmed fatigue at baseline, assessed with any validated fatigue scale (e.g. Fatigue Scale of Motor and Cognitive Functions or Fatigue Scale.

### Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosis-related outcomes [^111rX4xM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although the exact pathogenesis remains unknown, the leading theory is that it results from immune system dysregulation. Approved disease-modifying therapy appears to modulate the immune system to improve MS-related outcomes. There is substantial interest in the ability of dietary interventions to influence MS-related outcomes. This is an update of the Cochrane Review 'Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosis' (Farinotti 2003; Farinotti 2007; Farinotti 2012).

Objectives

To assess the effects of dietary interventions (including dietary plans with recommendations for specific whole foods, macronutrients, and natural health products) compared to placebo or another intervention on health outcomes (including MS-related outcomes and serious adverse events) in people with MS.

Search Methods

On 30 May 2019, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD). We checked reference lists in identified trials and requested information from trial authors to identify any additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included any randomized controlled trial (RCT) or controlled clinical trial (CCT) examining the effect of a dietary intervention versus placebo or another intervention among participants with MS on MS-related outcomes, including relapses, disability progression, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Planned primary outcomes were number of participants experiencing relapse and change in disability progression, according to a validated disability scale at the last reported follow-up. Secondary outcomes included MRI activity, safety, and patient-reported outcomes. We entered and analysed data in Review Manager 5.

Main Results

We found 41 full-text articles examining 30 trials following full-text review. Participants were adults with MS, defined by established criteria, presenting to MS clinics in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Study design varied considerably, although all trials had at least one methodological issue leading to unknown or high risk of bias. Trials examined: supplementation to increase polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (11 trials); a variety of antioxidant supplements (10 trials); dietary programmes (3 trials); and other dietary supplements (e.g. acetyl L-carnitine, biotin, creatine, palmitoylethanolamide, probiotic, riboflavin) (6 trials). In three trials comparing PUFAs with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), the evidence was very uncertain concerning difference in relapses (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.20; 3 studies, 217 participants; 75% in the PUFA group versus 74% in the MUFA group; very low-certainty evidence). Among four trials comparing PUFAs with MUFAs, there may be little to no difference in global impression of deterioration (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.03; 4 studies, 542 participants; 40% in the PUFA group versus 47% in the MUFA group; low-certainty evidence). In two trials comparing PUFAs with MUFAs (102 participants), there was very low-certainty evidence for change in disability progression. None of the PUFA versus MUFA trials examined MRI outcomes. In one trial comparing PUFAs with MUFAs (40 participants), there were no serious adverse events; based on low-certainty evidence. In two trials comparing different PUFAs (omega-3 versus omega-6), there may be little to no difference in relapses (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.66; 2 studies, 129 participants; 30% in the omega-3 versus 29% in the omega-6 group; low-certainty evidence). Among three trials comparing omega-3 with omega-6, there may be little to no difference in change in disability progression, measured as mean change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.30; 3 studies, 166 participants; low-certainty evidence). In one trial comparing omega-3 with omega-6, there was likely no difference in global impression of deterioration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.91; 1 study, 86 participants; 29% in omega-3 versus 29% in omega-6 group; moderate-certainty evidence). In one trial comparing omega-3 with omega-6 (86 participants), there was likely no difference in number of new T1- weighted gadolinium-enhancing lesions, based on moderate-certainty evidence. In four trials comparing omega-3 with omega-6, there may be little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.31; 4 studies, 230 participants; 6% in omega-3 versus 5% in omega-6 group; low-certainty evidence). In four trials examining antioxidant supplementation with placebo, there may be little to no difference in relapses (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.64; 4 studies, 345 participants; 17% in the antioxidant group versus 17% in the placebo group; low-certainty evidence). In six trials examining antioxidant supplementation with placebo, the evidence was very uncertain concerning change in disability progression, measured as mean change of EDSS (MD -0.19, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.11; 6 studies, 490 participants; very low-certainty evidence). In two trials examining antioxidant supplementation with placebo, there may be little to no difference in global impression of deterioration (RR 0.99, 95% 0.50 to 1.93; 2 studies, 190 participants; 15% in the antioxidant group versus 15% in the placebo group; low-certainty evidence). In two trials examining antioxidant supplementation with placebo, the evidence was very uncertain concerning difference in gadolinium-enhancing lesions (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.88; 2 studies, 131 participants; 11% in the antioxidant group versus 16% in the placebo group; very low-certainty evidence). In three trials examining antioxidant supplementation versus placebo, there may be little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR. 0.72, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.08; 3 studies, 222 participants; 3% in the antioxidant group versus 4% in the placebo group; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There are a variety of controlled trials addressing the effects of dietary interventions for MS with substantial variation in active treatment, comparator, and outcomes of interest. PUFA administration may not differ when compared to alternatives with regards to relapse rate, disability worsening, or overall clinical status in people with MS, but evidence is uncertain. Similarly, at present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether supplementation with antioxidants or other dietary interventions have any impact on MS-related outcomes.

### Energy conservation for fatigue management in multiple sclerosis: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^112v43wT]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop and test the feasibility of an energy conservation programme to manage fatigue in multiple sclerosis.

Design

A pilot randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Community setting.

Subjects

People with multiple sclerosis reporting fatigue.

Interventions

An energy conservation programme was compared to a peer support group. Both interventions were delivered in group format with 2-hour sessions once a week for five weeks. Patients' views about the interventions were sought in discussion groups one week post intervention.

Main Measures

The primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment and adherence. Other outcome measures were the Fatigue Impact Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, MS-Impact Scale-29, MS Self-efficacy Scale, Beck's Depression Scale-Fast Screen and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Outcomes were administered at baseline, post intervention, 6-week and 3-month follow-up.

Results

Almost 30% of the people approached to take part in the study did not commit to participation because of transport/time issues. Twenty-three patients took part in the study. Three patients dropped out, one reporting adverse effects. A power calculation indicated that a sample of 56 (28 per group) would be required for a main randomized controlled trial. Patients valued peer support and those in the energy conservation group described the programme as useful, but reported difficulties completing some practice activities.

Conclusion

An energy conservation programme in the community is feasible and welcomed by people with multiple sclerosis. However, future research needs to consider longer follow-ups and practical issues to improve recruitment rate by accommodating to patients' needs.

### Metabolic response to epigallocatechin-3-gallate in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a randomized clinical trial [^112D8v5L]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Muscle weakness and fatigue are common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS). Green tea catechins such as (-)epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) are known to improve energy metabolism at rest and during exercise.

Objective

We tested the hypothesis that EGCG improves energy metabolism and substrate utilization in patients with MS.

Design

Eighteen patients (8 men) with relapsing-remitting MS (expanded disability status scale score < 4.5, all receiving glatiramer acetate) participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial at a clinical research center. All patients received EGCG (600 mg/d) and placebo over 12 wk (4-wk washout in between). After each intervention, fasting and postprandial energy expenditure (EE), as well as fat oxidation (FAOx) and carbohydrate oxidation (CHOx) rates, were measured either at rest or during 40 min of exercise (0.5 W/kg). At rest, blood samples and microdialysates from adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were also taken.

Results

At rest, postprandial EE and CHOx, as well as adipose tissue perfusion and glucose supply, were significantly lower in men but higher in women receiving EGCG compared with placebo. During exercise, postprandial EE was lower after EGCG than after placebo, indicating an increased working efficiency (men > women). After placebo, exercise EE was mainly fueled by FAOx in both men and women. After EGCG, there was a shift to a higher and more stable CHOx during exercise in men but not in women.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that EGCG given to patients with MS over 12 wk improves muscle metabolism during moderate exercise to a greater extent in men than in women, possibly because of sex-specific effects on autonomic and endocrine control.

### Long-term effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the management of fatigue in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, controlled trial versus standard care [^116YBDed]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms affecting 75%–86% of people with MS. In 80% of cases, fatigue is experienced during the first year following diagnosis. It is considered by 65% of patients to be one of the three most disabling symptoms, before difficulties with walking, balance, bowel and bladder disorders. It is described as the worst symptom of the disease by 50% of patients. It is worsened by relapses and can lead to professional career changes, temporary work stoppages and early retirement.

MS-related fatigue is different from the so-called 'normal' fatigue experienced by healthy people after physical or mental effort. It is defined as 'a subjective lack of physical or mental energy that is perceived by the individual or caregiver to interfere with usual and desired activities'(MS Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines, 1998).

Two types of fatigue have been identified: primary fatigue and secondary fatigue'. rimary' fatigue relates to aspects of fatigue deemed to be directly related to the disease process such as lassitude or asthenia (an overwhelming sense of tiredness not directly related to participation in activity or exercise) or heat-sensitive fatigue (where fatigue is triggered or worsened by heat). 'Secondary' fatigue refers to fatigue that is not unique to MS and is related to common factors (eg, sleep disturbance, medication side effects, anaemia, vitamin deficiency, endocrine diseases, infection, physical exertion). Anxiety/Depression and fatigue influence each other: anxiety and depression make fatigue worse and the effects of anxiety and depression are amplified by fatigue.

Pharmacological treatments are available to treat MS-related fatigue but, in most cases, there is no conclusive evidence on their effectiveness. The recent study by Nourbakhsh et al failed to show superiority over placebo of the three main treatments (amantadine, modafinil and methylphenidate) commonly used to treat MS-related fatigue.

### Recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of depression in patients with multiple sclerosis [^114HeugN]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is frequently associated with depression. Yet there are few clinical trials on treating depression in MS and no agreed recommendations for its assessment and follow-up. We present evidence-based recommendations for several aspects of depression in MS, including screening for depression, recognition of other concomitant psychiatric conditions, suicide risk, disability, fatigue, cognition, adherence to treatment, the effect of drugs used to treat MS on depression and possible pharmacological treatments for depression in MS.

### High / low dose dexamethasone with physical activity for cancer-related fatigue in patients with advanced cancer: a phase II randomized double blind study… [^112ncaHD]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract 110 Background: Cancer-related-fatigue is the most debilitating symptom in patients with advanced cancer. Physical activity improves CRF with lower adherence in advanced cancer. Dexamethasone improves CRF but has long-term side effects. The purpose of the study was to determine whether a brief course of Dex improves adherence to PA for CRF management. Methods: Advanced cancer patients with CRF ≥ 4/10 on Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale were eligible. Patients were randomized to either 4mg of Dex or 8mg of Dex orally BID for 7 days Plus standardized aerobic and resistance exercise for 4 weeks. Change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-Fatigue fatigue subscale from baseline to Day 8 and Day 29 were assessed. Secondary outcomes included changes in fatigue, Sleep Quality, fasting blood glucose, and myopathy.

Similar improvement was found for ESAS Fatigue, MFSI total, and PROMIS –fatigue total. Mixed model analysis showed significant improvement in FACIT-F fatigue scores at Day 8, Day 15, and D. There was no significant difference between the two arms at Day 8 and Day 29 in fatigue scores, myopathy, fasting blood glucose levels, symptom distress, and sleep quality scores. Conclusions: Short course of dexamethasone Plus physical activity resulted in sustained and robust improvement in CRF outcomes for upto 3 weeks after discontinuation of steroids suggesting possible priming effects of steroids helped to sustain physical activity. Further larger studies are justified. Clinical trial information: NCT02491632.

### MS fatigue post high-efficacy treatment [^114xb1Eb]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, HETs may offer clinically meaningful improvements in MS‐related fatigue, particularly in its physical dimension. This supports the hypothesis that fatigue in MS is, at least in part, driven by neuroinflammatory processes that are responsive to immunomodulatory treatment. However, the complexity of fatigue — spanning physical, cognitive, and psychosocial domains — underscores the need for a multidimensional approach to treatment and research.

### Long-term effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the management of fatigue in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, controlled trial versus standard care [^114WYAfi]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Fatigue is a disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). The lack of effective therapeutics has promoted the development of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based fatigue management programmes. However, their efficacy does not sustain over time. We proposed to test the long-term effectiveness of a 6-week fatigue programme supplemented with four booster sessions ('FACETS+') in patients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and fatigue.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, parallel-group trial versus standard care enrolled patients with RRMS and fatigue. Participants were randomised to either FACETS+ plus standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome measure was fatigue impact (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) at 12 months) based on intention-to-treat analyses.

Results

From May 2017 to September 2020, 162 patients were screened; 105 were randomly assigned to FACETS+ (n = 57) or standard care (n = 48) and 88 completed the primary outcome assessment for the MFIS. At month 12, participants showed improved MFIS compared with baseline in the intervention group (mean difference (MD) = 14.0 points; (95% CI 6.45 to 21.5)) and the control group (MD = 6.1 points; (95% CI −0.30 to 12.5)) with a significant between-group difference in favour of the intervention group (adjusted MD = 7.89 points; (95% CI 1.26 to 14.52), standardised effect size = 0.52, p = 0.021). No trial-related serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

A 6-week CBT-based programme with four booster sessions is superior to standard care alone to treat MS-related fatigue in the long term (12 months follow-up). The results support the use of the FACETS+ programme for the treatment of MS-related fatigue.

### Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosis [^112etKcY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical and experimental data suggest that certain dietary regimens, particularly those including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and vitamins, might improve outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Diets and dietary supplements are much used by people with MS in the belief that they might improve disease outcomes and overcome the effectiveness limits of conventional treatments. This is an update of the Cochrane review "Dietary intervention for multiple sclerosis" (first published on The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1).

Objectives

To answer MS patients' questions regarding the efficacy and safety of dietary regimens for MS. Can changes in dietary habits be an effective intervention for MS patients? Are the potential side effects of these interventions known, and have they been measured? Are potential interactions between dietary interventions and other curative or symptomatic treatments known and have they been studied?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (November 2011), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1966 to November 2011), EMBASE (embase.com) (1974 to November 2011) and reference lists of papers found.

Selection Criteria

All controlled trials (randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) on a specific dietary intervention, diet plan or dietary supplementation, except for vitamin D supplementation, compared to no dietary modification or placebo were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected articles, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were entered and analysed in RevMan. Dichotomous data were summarised as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a random-effects model in the presence of heterogeneity (I² > 60%). Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences, determined by the difference between the pre- and post-intervention changes in the treatment and control groups.

Main Results

Six RCTs that investigated PUFAs emerged from the search strategy, accounting for 794 randomised patients.PUFAs did not have a significant effect on disease progression at 24 months. Omega-6 fatty acids (11 to 23 g/day linoleic acid) didn't show any benefit in 144 MS patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63). Linoleic acid (2.9 to 3.4 g/day) had no benefit in 65 chronic progressive MS patients (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.42). Omega-3 fatty acids had no benefit in 292 relapsing remitting MS patients (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03, P = 0.08). Slight potential benefits in relapse outcomes were associated with omega-6 fatty acids in some studies, however these findings were limited by the reduced validity of the endpoints. No judgements about safety or patient-reported outcomes were possible. In general, trial quality was poor. No studies on vitamin supplementation and allergen-free diets were analysed as none met the eligibility criteria, mainly due to lack of clinical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

PUFAs seem to have no major effect on the main clinical outcome in MS (disease progression), but they may tend to reduce the frequency of relapses over two years. However, the data that are available are insufficient to assess a real benefit or harm from PUFA supplementation because of their uncertain quality. Evidence on the possible benefits and risks of vitamin supplementation and antioxidant supplements in MS is lacking. More research is required to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions in MS.

### Effects of β-glucans on fatigue: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129pNTp]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that β-glucans hold promise as a potential intervention for reducing feelings of fatigue among healthy individuals. However, given the limitations identified, including heterogeneity among studies and concerns regarding bias risk and publication bias, further clinical trials are necessary to confirm and validate these findings. Additionally, considering the limited number of studies included in this analysis, larger-scale trials are warranted to provide more robust evidence regarding the efficacy of β-glucans in fatigue management.

### Randomized controlled trial of siberian ginseng for chronic fatigue [^112hsPyM]. Psychological Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic fatigue greatly affects quality of life and is a common reason for consulting a physician. Since conventional therapy is often of limited help, fatigued patients may use herbal treatments. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of Siberian ginseng.

Method

Subjects were recruited from advertisements in Iowa (82%) and members of chronic fatigue syndrome support groups (18%). Potential subjects were required to have substantial fatigue ≥ 6 months with no identifiable cause. The mean change in a fatigue measure was compared for placebo and Siberian ginseng at 1 and 2 months. Comparisons were for all subjects and for subjects with characteristics previously identified in the literature as important for categorizing chronic fatigue.

Results

Ninety-six subjects were randomized to treatment groups, and 76 provided information at 2 months of follow-up. Fatigue among subjects assigned to either placebo or Siberian ginseng was substantially reduced during the study, but differences between treatment groups were not statistically significant in the full sample. Fatigue severity and duration had a statistically significant interaction with response to Siberian ginseng at the P < 0.05 level. Treatment was effective at 2 months for 45 subjects with less severe fatigue (P = 0.04 unadjusted for multiple comparisons) and for 41 subjects with fatigue for ≥ 5 years (P = 0.09 unadjusted for multiple comparisons).

Conclusion

Overall efficacy was not demonstrated. However, the findings of possible efficacy for patients with moderate fatigue suggests that further research may be of value.

### Pharmacological treatments for fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116WXA9a]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Fatigue is the most common symptom of MS patients, affecting > 80% subjects. Medical treatment is an important method for managing fatigue. Currently, although many drugs have been tested in treatment of MS fatigue, the efficacy of these drugs remain largely unclear.

Methods

We researched available literatures in PubMed, Embase, Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library (August 31, 2016). Search terms included multiple sclerosis, fatigue, medication treatments, amantadine, modafinil, aspirin, acetyl-l-carnitine, pemoline, 4-aminopyridine and randomized controlled trial (RCT). Two researchers were required to independently assess the quality of literatures, and finish data extraction. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software.

Findings

A total of 11 RCTs involving 723 patients were included. The therapeutic effects were quantified by different scales, such as Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) or Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Here, meta-analysis suggested that amantadine, not modafinil, was effective for treating the fatigue in MS. Moreover, two studies implied that l-carnitine might have similar therapeutic effect with amantadine. However, the reliability of this finding was greatly weakened by the limited sample sizes. Additionally, current data could not answer whether treatment of MS fatigue using aspirin or 4-aminopyridine was beneficial. Finally, we found that all drugs except pemoline were relatively safe for treating MS fatigue.

Conclusions

Current limited data suggest that amantadine may be the only drug that has relatively sufficient evidences in treatment of fatigue symptoms in MS. Further RCT studies recruiting larger samples sizes are required to validate the therapeutic effect of these candidate drugs.

### A randomized controlled crossover trial of aspirin for fatigue in multiple sclerosis [^115EJk62]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapeutic options for multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue are limited. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to aspirin (ASA) 1,300 mg/day or placebo in a double-blind crossover study. Results favored ASA for the main clinical outcomes: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale scores (p = 0.043) and treatment preference (p = 0.012). There were no significant adverse effects. The results warrant further study and support a role for ASA-influenced mechanisms, perhaps immunologic, in the generation of MS-related chronic fatigue.

### Education for fatigue management in people with multiple sclerosis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115AQHUi]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Search methods

On 30 September 2023, an information specialist at the Department of Oncology, Laboratory of Clinical Research Methodology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milan, Italy, ran a bespoke search for the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed) (from inception to 30 September 2023); Embase (from 1974 to 30 September 2023); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost) (from 1981 to 30 September 2023); PsycINFO (from inception until 30 September 2023); Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS) (Bireme) (from 1982 to 30 September 2023); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The detailed search methods are reported in File S1.

Handling of different study designs

For cross‐over studies, only first period data up to the first point of cross‐over were used to rule out carry‐over effects. For continuous outcomes, only the total number of participants was divided and means and standard deviations were left unchanged. In the case of studies comparing one active intervention with more than one control intervention, the group with the less active control group approach was used (e.g. usual care instead of provision of general information materials).

Measures of treatment effect

For all continuous outcome data, mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used. For pooling data from studies using different measurement scales for the same outcome, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated. All statistical analyses were performed using Revman Web.

Handling of missing data

In the case of missing data, study authors were contacted and missing data, if available, were included in analyses. The answers obtained and the dates of our contacts were recorded.

Assessment of clinical heterogeneity

For the assessment of clinical heterogeneity, extracted data for between‐study variability with respect to participants, interventions and outcome measurements were examined. RevMan Web was used to assess statistical heterogeneity using I² and χ² statistics, and visual inspections of forest plots were used to assess heterogeneity of data. Due to the overall heterogeneity amongst studies, random‐effects models were used for all meta‐analyses.

### Safety and efficacy of memantine for multiple sclerosis-related fatigue: a pilot randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^112AtF5h]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, there is no approved medication for MS-related fatigue.

Objective

In this study, we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of memantine for improving fatigue in patients with MS.

Methods

This was a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Eligible patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) according to the McDonald criteria were randomized to receive either memantine (20 mg/day) or placebo and were assessed at baseline and three months after treatment. The change in the severity of fatigue was determined by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS).

Results

Sixty-four patients were randomly allocated to the memantine (n = 32) and placebo (n = 32) groups. Sixteen patients in the memantine group and 24 patients in the placebo group completed the study. The mean [95% CI] absolute change in MFIS scores from baseline did not differ significantly between the memantine (-5.8 [-12.7 to 1.0]) and placebo (-4.0 [-10.6 to 2.7]) groups (between-group difference: -1.9 [-11.7 to 7.8], P = 0.702). No serious adverse events were reported, except for dizziness and sedation in four patients in the experimental arm, which resulted in discontinuation.

Conclusion

This trial failed to prove any clinical efficacy of memantine for the management of MS-related fatigue. Although memantine was generally well-tolerated, adverse events were among the major causes of dropout in this study.

### Pathophysiological and cognitive mechanisms of fatigue in multiple sclerosis [^1135tDh7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), with a major impact on patients' quality of life. Currently, treatment proceeds by trial and error with limited success, probably due to the presence of multiple different underlying mechanisms. Recent neuroscientific advances offer the potential to develop tools for differentiating these mechanisms in individual patients and ultimately provide a principled basis for treatment selection. However, development of these tools for differential diagnosis will require guidance by pathophysiological and cognitive theories that propose mechanisms which can be assessed in individual patients. This article provides an overview of contemporary pathophysiological theories of fatigue in MS and discusses how the mechanisms they propose may become measurable with emerging technologies and thus lay a foundation for future personalised treatments.

### Comparison of the effect of two types of acupuncture on quality of life in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: a preliminary single-blind randomized controlled trial [^1133CzfB]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effect of two types of acupuncture on the quality of life of individuals with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and provide preliminary evidence regarding the safety of this intervention for this population.

Design

Preliminary single-blind randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Outpatient attendance at rehabilitation unit.

Participants

Fourteen participants with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.

Interventions

Chinese medical acupuncture or minimal acupuncture. Participants received 10 treatments over five weeks.

Measures

Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 29, Fatigue Severity Scale and General Health Questionnaire 12 were measured pre and post intervention. Adverse events and other responses during treatment were recorded prospectively.

Results

Participants receiving minimal acupuncture demonstrated statistically significant greater improvement in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 29 psychological subscale compared with those receiving Chinese medical acupuncture in an intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.04), with mean change in Chinese acupuncture group of 6.0 (SD 13.9) and in minimal acupuncture group of 23.0 (SD 21.0). No other statistically significant difference between the groups was found. No major adverse events were noted. Minor adverse events such as lower limb muscle spasms or pain were noted in some participants in both intervention groups.

Conclusion

Minimal acupuncture resulted in greater improvement of Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 29 psychological subscale compared with Chinese medical acupuncture. No other differences between the groups were found. In view of the small sample these results are not conclusive. This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that acupuncture is safe for people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. A large-scale trial is required to provide more definitive evidence.

### MS fatigue post high-efficacy treatment [^113B65ZG]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 Overall Analysis

The meta‐analysis of 18 longitudinal studies showed an overall improvement in fatigue scores after treatment with highly effective DMTs. The overall standardized mean differences (SMD) pre‐ and post‐initiation of HET was −0.34 (−0.47; −0.21), indicating a small but significant reduction in fatigue scores after treatment (Figure 2). The funnel plot is nearly symmetric, indicating low publication bias (Figure S1). The Egger's test revealed no significant study effect bias (t ‐test = 0.22, p ‐value = 0.8275, bias estimate = 0.0470, SE = 0.2124).

### Symptomatic therapy for underrecognized manifestations of multiple sclerosis [^116PmEdf]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The symptoms that affect individuals with MS are diverse and change over time. Addressing symptoms in a multidisciplinary fashion and helping patients address problems as they occur are the major elements of symptom management. Successful management involves treating not only the more readily recognized manifestations of MS but also the less apparent MS features, including fatigue, cognitive loss, mood disturbance, and pain. Management of these symptoms is reviewed.

### Possible influence of the route of treatment administration on treatment adherence in patients with multiple sclerosis [^1146LEyi]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, demyelinating, and degenerative disease of the central nervous system with an immune-based pathologic origin. The present pilot study aimed to assess whether the change in the route of treatment administration is associated with a variation in adherence and whether there is a change in quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and fatigue.

Methods

Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who were > 18 years of age and who used to receive immunomodulatory parenteral treatment and were ready to change administration route were eligible for the study. Data were collected at baseline and 3 months later. Adherence, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and fatigue were measured via the following questionnaires: Morisky-Green questionnaire on patient-reported medication adherence, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Instrument, Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale.

Findings

The study sample included 30 patients (mean age, 43.2 years; age range, 24–71 years; 60% female and 40% male). There was a significant improvement in adherence (p = 0.048). Mean (SD) physical and mental health quality-of-life summary scores varied from 52.50 (24.15) and 54.13 (21.24) to 67.55 (20.92) and 62.30 (21.75) (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, d = -0.426 and d = -0.643, respectively). In the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, an improvement of the score was observed in effectiveness of the medication (p = 0.0041, d = -0.563), adverse effects of the medication (p < 0.001, d = -0.976), convenience of the medication (p < 0.001, d = -1.235), and global satisfaction (p = 0.006, d = -0.725). Patients had a higher mean (SD) score (45.13 [26.7]) on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale while receiving injectable treatment compared with that obtained with oral treatment (34.86 [23.16]; p = 0.009, d = 0.41).

Implications

When the route of administration changed from injectable to oral, there was an increase in adherence, quality of life, and degree of patient satisfaction with their treatment and a decrease in the degree of fatigue.

### Wellness and the role of comorbidities in multiple sclerosis [^117Gpv2v]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, for which disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are the mainstay treatment approach to reduce inflammatory disease activity and slow worsening disability. In addition to conventional pharmacologic therapy, there is growing interest in the use of lifestyle strategies to support wellness and mitigate disease-related complications in MS. This interest stems from a growing appreciation of the role of certain comorbidities and lifestyle factors on disease activity, disability, mortality, and overall quality of life. While the current literature is not conclusive, there is evidence to suggest a potential role for vitamin D supplementation, tobacco smoking cessation, routine exercise, a plant-based, anti-inflammatory diet, and maintenance of emotional well-being as adjunct therapies to DMTs. In addition to DMTs, lifestyle strategies should be emphasized as part of a management plan focused on overall health and well-being.

### Can vitamin D supplementation prevent bone loss in persons with MS? A placebo-controlled trial [^112MW26X]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Supplementing 20,000 IU vitamin D 3 per week increased serum 25(OH)D by 68 nmol/L, and 32 out of 35 participants in the intervention group reached desired vitamin D levels of ≥ 75 nmol/L. The study medication was tolerated without clinical or biochemical side effects, and even higher doses of vitamin D 3 are probably safe. Supplementation with vitamin D can be achieved equally well with daily as with weekly dosing frequencies.

At baseline, one quarter of our study population had lower than expected BMD for sex and age. Over the 96 week study period, BMD at the hip decreased in both treatment arms, the change being statistically significant in the placebo group. This finding indicates that MS may be a cause of secondary osteoporosis. In healthy individuals, studies have reported no significant bone loss at the hip in women before the perimenopausal years, while men may or may not have a small bone loss before age 50. The general bone loss at the hip, a weight bearing site, may result from decreased physical activity even in fully ambulatory persons with MS, due to fatigue, visual problems, and impaired balance. We observed no change in BMD at the lumbar spine. This finding is in agreement with two recent studies reporting unchanged BMD at the lumbar spine over a period of respectively 96 weeks and 39 months in interferon beta-treated persons with MS. At the non-dominant UD radius, BMD increased significantly in the intervention group, but not in the placebo group. In healthy individuals, BMD at this site has been reported to be stable or increasing up to age 40 in both sexes. BMD at the UD radius, especially in the non-dominant arm, is not dependent on weight bearing activity and therefore is likely to be less affected by mild to moderate MS-related disability.

### The pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the management of fatigue related multiple sclerosis [^112L8z74]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

The clinical aim was to provide up-to-date evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of MS-related fatigue (MSRF). The scientific aim was to prioritise topics for future randomised clinical trials with sufficient power.

Methods

A systematic search of review based research that considered MSRF in adults (18years and over) was undertaken in May 2016. Data from reviews was extracted, critically appraised and synthesised using four specific techniques.

Results

A total of 24 reviews were identified (17 non-pharmacological, 5 pharmacological, 2 combining both), which contained 339 studies on interventions deigned to improve MSRF. The methodological quality of the reviews was identified by an average AMSTAR score of 6.5 (SD = 1.87: 95% CI = 5.75–7.25). No pharmacological intervention had strong evidence for improving MSRF. Limited/conflicting evidence was found for Amantadine and Prokarin and potential benefits for Modafinil were identified. Pemoline and Carnitine contained unclear/no evidence for fatigue management. Non-pharmacological interventions produced mixed conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the intervention to improve MSRF. Education (energy conservation and fatigue management) and exercise had supporting evidence for reducing MSRF but mixed conclusions gathered from subtypes of exercise. Reviews considering psycho-behavioural interventions (CBT and mindfulness) had limited information considering effectiveness. Finally, a single intervention combining physical and cognitive strategies showed more promising results.

Conclusion

Further research into Pharmacological interventions for MSRF is required notably considering the potential of Modafinil. Yoga and energy conservation/fatigue management programs had strong evidence supporting use in management of MSRF. Due to the dissimilar interventions used in combined training the subtype of exercise cannot be recommended. Future research into Amantadine, psycho-behavioural interventions is vital to justify the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. The methodological quality of studies inhibited the ability of this review to provide other recommendations.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome [^1126FSXq]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) affects between 0.006% and 3% of the population depending on the criteria of definition used, with women being at higher risk than men.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 46 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antidepressants, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), corticosteroids, dietary supplements, evening primrose oil, galantamine, graded exercise therapy, homeopathy, immunotherapy, intramuscular magnesium, oral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and prolonged rest.

### Modafinil for fatigue in MS: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study [^111tc1VV]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent, is useful for fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

Patients with MS with stable disability, and a baseline score of 45 or more on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), were eligible for the 5-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The initial daily dose of modafinil was 200 mg for 1 week. Depending on tolerance, the dose was increased by 100 mg every week up to 400 mg/day and remained unchanged between day 21 and day 35. The primary outcome variable was the change of MFIS score at day 35.

Results

A total of 115 patients with MS were enrolled in the study and in the intention to treat analysis. The mean MFIS score at baseline was 63 ± 9 in the placebo group and 63 ± 10 in the modafinil group. MFIS scores improved between day 0 and day 35 in both placebo-treated and modafinil-treated groups, but no significant difference was detected between the two groups. There was no major safety concern.

Conclusions

There was no improvement of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with modafinil vs placebo according to the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale.

### A pragmatic parallel arm multi-centre randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a group-based fatigue management programme (FACETS) for people with multiple sclerosis [^113SNJfJ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fatigue is a common and troubling symptom for people with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a six-session group-based programme for managing MS-fatigue (Fatigue: Applying Cognitive behavioural and Energy effectiveness Techniques to lifeStyle (FACETS)).

Methods

Three-centre parallel arm randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation. Patients with MS and significant fatigue were randomised to FACETS plus current local practice (FACETS) or current local practice alone (CLP), using concealed computer-generated randomisation. Participant blinding was not possible. Primary outcomes were fatigue severity (Fatigue Assessment Instrument), self-efficacy (Multiple Sclerosis-Fatigue Self-Efficacy) and disease-specific quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29)) at 1 and 4 months postintervention (follow-up 1 and 2). Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated (EuroQoL 5-Dimensions questionnaire and the Short-form 6-Dimensions questionnaire).

Results

Between May 2008 and November 2009, 164 patients were randomised; primary outcome data were available for 146 (89%). Statistically significant differences favour the intervention group on fatigue self-efficacy at follow-up 1 (mean difference (MD) 9, 95% CI (4 to 14), standardised effect size (SES) 0.54, p = 0.001) and follow-up 2 (MD 6, 95% CI (0 to 12), SES 0.36, p = 0.05) and fatigue severity at follow-up 2 (MD −0.36, 95% CI (−0.63 to −0.08), SES −0.35, p = 0.01) but no differences for MSIS-29 or QALYs. No adverse events reported. Estimated cost per person for FACETS is £453; findings suggest an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2157 per additional person with a clinically significant improvement in fatigue.

Conclusions

FACETS is effective in reducing fatigue severity and increasing fatigue self-efficacy. However, it is difficult to assess the additional cost in terms of cost-effectiveness (ie, cost per QALY) as improvements in fatigue are not reflected in the QALY outcomes, with no significant differences between FACETS and CLP. The strengths of this trial are its pragmatic nature and high external validity.

Trial registration:

### Efficacy and safety of oral fumarate in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study [^115bWrE2]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Oral fumarate (BG00012) might have dual anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of BG00012 in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

Methods

257 patients, aged 18–55 years, with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were randomly assigned to receive 120 mg once daily (n = 64), 120 mg three times daily (n = 64), or 240 mg three times daily (n = 64) BG00012, or placebo (n = 65) for 24 weeks. During an extension period of 24 weeks for safety assessment, patients treated with placebo received BG00012 240 mg three times daily. The primary endpoint was total number of new gadolinium enhancing (GdE) lesions on brain MRI scans at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. Additional endpoints included cumulative number of new GdE lesions (weeks 4–24), new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions, new T1-hypointense lesions at week 24, and annualised relapse rate. Analysis was done on the efficacy-evaluable population. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00168701.

Findings

Treatment with BG00012 240 mg three times daily reduced by 69% the mean total number of new GdE lesions from week 12 to 24 compared with placebo (1.4 vs 4.5, p < 0.0001). It also reduced number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense (p = 0.0006) and new T1-hypointense (p = 0.014) lesions compared with placebo. BG00012 reduced annualised relapse rate by 32% (0.44 vs 0.65 for placebo; p = 0.272). Adverse events more common in patients given BG00012 than in those given placebo included abdominal pain, flushing, and hot flush. Dose-related adverse events in patients on BG00012 were headache, fatigue, and feeling hot.

Interpretation

The anti-inflammatory effects and favourable safety profile of BG00012 warrant further long-term phase III studies in large patient groups.

### Education for fatigue management in people with multiple sclerosis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154mgsr]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS). Educational interventions have shown potential to reduce fatigue. The aim was to systematically review the current best evidence on patient education programmes for MS-related fatigue.

Methods

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis following Cochrane methodology. A systematic search was conducted in eight databases (September 2023). Moreover, reference lists and trial registers were searched and experts in the field were contacted. Randomized controlled trials were included evaluating patient education programmes for people with MS with the primary aim of reducing fatigue.

Results

In total, 1176 studies were identified and assessed by two independent reviewers; 15 studies (1473 participants) were included. All interventions provided information and education about different aspects of MS-related fatigue with different forms of application, some with components of psychological interventions. Amongst those, the most frequently applied were cognitive behavioural therapy (n = 5) and energy-conservation-based approaches (n = 4). Studies differed considerably concerning mode of intervention delivery, number of participants and length of follow-up. Interventions reduced fatigue severity (eight studies, n = 878, standardized mean difference -0.28; 95% confidence interval -0.53 to -0.03; low certainty) and fatigue impact (nine studies, n = 824, standardized mean difference -0.21; 95% confidence interval -0.42 to 0.00; moderate certainty) directly after the intervention. Mixed results were found for long-term effects on fatigue, for secondary endpoints (depressive symptoms, quality of life, coping) and for subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

Educational interventions for people with MS-related fatigue may be effective in reducing fatigue in the short term. More research is needed on long-term effects and the importance of specific intervention components, delivery and context.

### MS fatigue post high-efficacy treatment [^111qk3Gv]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria: studies of (1) human samples, (2) adults aged 18 years and above, (3) relapsing–remitting MS patients on highly effective DMTs, (4) studies with a validated scoring system for measuring fatigue assessed at baseline and at least 3 months and up to 2 years after commencement of intervention.

Exclusion criteria included: (1) < 18 years of age, (2) progressive forms of MS, (3) mild to moderate effective DMTs, (4) MS mimics (other demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system such as clinically isolated syndrome, radiologically isolated syndrome, neuromyelitis optica, myelin oligodendrocyte disorders), (5) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, (6) no fatigue measurement, and (7) review articles, systematic reviews, meta‐analysis, case reports, and case series.

2.3 Screening

Duplicate citations were deleted from the search results, and the remaining entries were initially screened by title by a single author (C.S.). Subsequently, all abstracts were independently double screened by using the predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria, with any discrepancies resolved through consensus. Finally, the full‐text and supplementary materials of the remaining articles were double‐screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria by two authors (C.S. and R.P.), and relevant data were extracted. If data were missing, authors were contacted via email to request the necessary information for inclusion in the review.

2.4 Data Extraction

Data from individual articles were independently extracted by two operators and any disagreement was resolved by consensus, or if necessary through a third assessor. The following information were extracted: (1) first author, (2) year of publication (3) countries were data was collected (4) study design (5) sample size (6) duration of MS (7) EDSS (8) percentage of females and (9) the specific measure of fatigue used.

2.5 Quality Assessment

Studsy quality was evaluated independently by two authors (C.S. and R.P.) using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale which assessed study quality based on three categories: (1) the selection of participants, (2) the comparability of groups, and (3) the assessment/ascertainment of the outcome of interest.

### Aspirin and multiple sclerosis [^117Mi5Uc]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A subsequent randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial for 52 patients with MS was conducted over a ten-week period to study the effectiveness of ASA and amantadine for alleviating fatigue in MS. Half of the patients were randomly assigned to receive 500 mg ASA orally once daily for the first four weeks, and following a two-week washout period were switched to 100 mg amantadine orally twice a day for the final four weeks; the other half of the patients received the treatments in reverse order. A significant decrease in self-reported fatigue levels measured using the FSS with both ASA and amantadine was found following a baseline measurement. After the first round of treatment, mean FSS scores decreased by 1.1 (from a maximum of 7) for ASA and by 0.8 for amantadine. During the two-week washout period, the mean FSS scores increased back to baseline levels. In the second phase of the study, where patients received crossover treatments, self-reported fatigue scores were once again reduced significantly for each treatment regimen: mean FSS decreased by 0.7 for ASA and by 1.6 for amantadine. The authors noted that both ASA and amantadine were well-tolerated by patients with few and mild side effects, none of which led to participant dropouts. Given the promising results shown by both treatments in these studies, they suggest that ASA and amantadine deserve further consideration as potential treatments to combat fatigue in MS.

### Use of vitamins and dietary supplements by patients with multiple sclerosis: a review [^116tGiaX]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Surveys of patients with multiple sclerosis report that most are interested in modifying their diet and using supplements to potentially reduce the severity and symptoms of the disease. This review provides an updated overview of the current state of evidence for the role that vitamins and dietary supplements play in multiple sclerosis and its animal models, with an emphasis on recent studies, and addresses biological plausibility and safety issues.

Observations

Several vitamins and dietary supplements have been recently explored both in animal models and by patients with multiple sclerosis. Most human trials have been small or nonblinded, limiting their generalizability. Biotin and vitamin D are currently being tested in large randomized clinical trials. Smaller trials are ongoing or planned for other supplements such as lipoic acid and probiotics. The results of these studies may help guide clinical recommendations.

Conclusions and Relevance

At the present time, the only vitamin with sufficient evidence to support routine supplementation for patients with multiple sclerosis is vitamin D. Vitamin deficiencies should be avoided. It is important for clinicians to know which supplements their patients are taking and to educate patients on any known efficacy data, along with any potential medication interactions and adverse effects of individual supplements. Given that dietary supplements and vitamins are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States, it is recommended that vitamins and supplements be purchased from reputable manufacturers with the United States Pharmacopeia designation.

### Systematic review: digital biomarkers of fatigue in chronic diseases [^111koMc7]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fatigue is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms reported by individuals with chronic diseases, profoundly affecting their quality of life and daily functioning. It is defined as extreme and persistent tiredness and reduced energy, which could be mental, physical, or both. Fatigue in chronic diseases is multifaceted and often difficult to quantify and measure due to its subjective nature. It varies greatly between individuals and across different diseases and disease states. In addition to reducing overall functional capacity, abnormal fatigue limits physical activity, disrupts daily routines, and exacerbates other symptoms such as pain and cognitive impairment, creating a vicious cycle that worsens patient health.

In several chronic conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fatigue is a prevalent and disabling symptom. For example, in MS, fatigue affects between 75 and 90% of patients and is often reported as one of the most disabling symptoms. In RA and COPD, fatigue is similarly widespread and contributes to reduced engagement in daily activities and diminished physical function.

### Exploring the efficacy and safety of a novel standardized ashwagandha () root extract (witholytin ®) in adults experiencing high stress and fatigue in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116oZVCz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

A further observation in men was a trend suggesting a between-group difference in changes in MDA concentrations. This was signified by an 85% increase in MDA concentrations from baseline to week 12 in the ashwagandha group and only a 5% increase in the placebo group. As there was substantial variability in MDA concentrations over time in the ashwagandha group at week 12, this finding should be interpreted cautiously. In a previous ashwagandha study, MDA concentrations were reduced by 18% following 6 months of supplementation in healthy adults. In a review by, it was concluded that due to technical problems and inconsistent findings in healthy people and some psychiatric disorders, the reliability of MDA as a biomarker of oxidative stress requires re-evaluation. Despite this, it remains important to continue to investigate if ashwagandha supplementation has pro-oxidant effects in clinical and non-clinical populations.

### Effect of aquatic exercise training on fatigue and health-related quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis [^112uPXhT]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of aquatic exercise training on fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in women with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Design

Randomized controlled trial, 4-week and 8-week follow-up.

Setting

Referral center of a multiple sclerosis society.

Participants

Women (N = 32) diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (mean age ± SD, 32.6 ± 8.0y) were recruited into this study. After undergoing baseline testing by a neurologist, participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention (aquatic exercise) or a control group.

Interventions

The intervention consisted of 8 weeks supervised aquatic exercise in a swimming pool (3 times a week, each session lasting 60min).

Main Outcome Measures

At baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, fatigue and HRQOL were assessed by a blind assessor using the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 questionnaire, respectively. A mixed-model approach to repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to detect within- and between-subject effects.

Results

Findings are based on 21 patients (10 from the exercise group and 11 from the control group) who had data available on outcomes. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups at the baseline. Patients in the aquatic exercise group showed significant improvements in fatigue and subscores of HRQOL after 4 and 8 weeks compared with the control group. Results obtained from the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with those of per-protocol analysis.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that aquatic exercise training can effectively improve fatigue and HRQOL of patients with MS and should be considered in the management of this relatively common public health problem.

### WITHDRAWN: interventions for fatigue and weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness [^111kJpJR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fatigue and unintentional weight loss are two of the commonest symptoms experienced by people with advanced progressive illness. Appropriate interventions may bring considerable improvements in function and quality of life to seriously ill people and their families, reducing physical, psychological and spiritual distress.

Objectives

To conduct an overview of the evidence available on the efficacy of interventions used in the management of fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness by reviewing the evidence contained within Cochrane reviews.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) for all systematic reviews evaluating any interventions for the management of fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 8). We reviewed titles of interest by abstract. Where the relevance of a review remained unclear we reached a consensus regarding the relevance of the participant group and the outcome measures to the overview. Two overview authors extracted the data independently using a data extraction form. We used the measurement tool AMSTAR (Assessment of Multiple SysTemAtic Reviews) to assess the methodological quality of each systematic review.

Main Results

We included 27 systematic reviews (302 studies with 31,833 participants) in the overview. None of the included systematic reviews reported quantitative data on the efficacy of interventions to manage fatigue or weight loss specific to people with advanced progressive illness. All of the included reviews apart from one were deemed of high methodological quality. For the remaining review we were unable to ascertain the methodological quality of the research strategy as it was described. None of the systematic reviews adequately described whether conflict of interests were present within the included studies. Management of fatigueAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) - we identified one systematic review (two studies and 52 participants); the intervention was exercise. Cancer - we identified five systematic reviews (116 studies with 17,342 participants); the pharmacological interventions were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and any drug therapy for the management of cancer-related fatigue and the non pharmacological interventions were exercise, interventions by breast care nurses and psychosocial interventions. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - we identified three systematic reviews (59 studies and 4048 participants); the interventions were self management education programmes, nutritional support and pulmonary rehabilitation. Cystic fibrosis - we identified one systematic review (nine studies and 833 participants); the intervention was physical training. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) - we identified two systematic reviews (21 studies and 748 participants); the interventions were progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise. Multiple sclerosis (MS) - we identified five systematic reviews (23 studies and 1502 participants); the pharmacological interventions were amantadine and carnitine. The non pharmacological interventions were diet, exercise and occupational therapy. Mixed conditions in advanced stages of illness - we identified one systematic review (five studies and 453 participants); the intervention was medically assisted hydration. Management of weight lossALS/MND - we identified one systematic review but no studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review; the intervention was enteral tube feeding. Cancer - we identified three systematic reviews with a fourth systematic review also containing extractable data on cancer (66 studies and 5601 participants); the pharmacological interventions were megestrol acetate and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (this systematic review is also included in the cancer fatigue section above). The non pharmacological interventions were enteral tube feeding and non invasive interventions for patients with lung cancer.COPD - we identified one systematic review (59 studies and 4048 participants); the intervention was nutritional support. This systematic review is also included in the COPD fatigue section. Cystic fibrosis - we identified two systematic reviews (three studies and 131 participants); the interventions were enteral tube feeding and oral calorie supplements.HIV/AIDS - we identified four systematic reviews (42 studies and 2071 participants); the pharmacological intervention was anabolic steroids. The non pharmacological interventions were nutritional interventions, progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise. Both of the systematic reviews on exercise interventions were also included in the HIV/AIDS fatigue section.MS - we found no systematic reviews which considered interventions to manage unintentional weight loss for people with a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis at any stage of illness. Mixed conditions in advanced stages of illness - we identified two systematic reviews (32 studies and 4826 participants); the interventions were megestrol acetate and medically assisted nutrition.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of robust evidence for interventions to manage fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in the advanced stage of progressive illnesses such as advanced cancer, heart failure, lung failure, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia and AIDS. The evidence contained within this overview provides some insight into interventions which may prove of benefit within this population such as exercise, some pharmacological treatments and support for self management. Researchers could improve the methodological quality of future studies by blinding of outcome assessors. Adopting uniform reporting mechanisms for fatigue and weight loss outcome measures would also allow the opportunity for meta-analysis of small studies. Researchers could also improve the applicability of recommendations for interventions to manage fatigue and unintentional weight loss in advanced progressive illness by including subgroup analysis of this population within systematic reviews of applicable interventions. More research is required to ascertain the best interventions to manage fatigue and/or weight loss in advanced illness. There is a need for standardised reporting of these symptoms and agreement amongst researchers of the minimum duration of studies and minimum percentage change in symptom experience that proves the benefits of an intervention. There are, however, challenges in providing meaningful outcome measurements against a background of deteriorating health through disease progression. Interventions to manage these symptoms must also be mindful of the impact on quality of life and should be focused on patient-orientated rather than purely disease-orientated experiences for patients. Systematic reviews and primary intervention studies should include the impact of the interventions on standardised validated quality of life measures.

### Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosis [^112T7Jdf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical and experimental data suggest that certain dietary regimens, particularly those including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and vitamins might improve outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Diets and dietary supplements are much used by people with MS in the belief that they might improve disease outcomes.

Objectives

We performed a Cochrane review of all randomised trials of dietary regimens for MS with the aim of answering MS consumers' questions regarding the efficacy and safety of these interventions.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane MS Group trial register (February 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006, MEDLINE (PubMed) (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006) and the bibliographies of papers found.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing a specific dietary intervention, diet plan or dietary supplementation, with no dietary modification or placebo, were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected articles, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Trial quality was poor, particularly as regards descriptions of randomisation, blinding and adverse event reporting. Some studies had large numbers of drop-outs; dropouts were never included in the analyses.

Main Results

PUFAs did not have a significant effect on disease progression, measured as worsening of Disability Status Scale. Omega-6 fatty acids (11–23 g/day linoleic acid) had no benefit in 75 relapsing remitting (RR) MS patients (progression at two years: relative risk (RR) = 0.78, 95% CI [0.45 to 1.36]) or in 69 chronic progressive (CP) MS patients (RR = 1.67, 95% CI [0.75 to 3.72]. Linoleic acid (2.9–3.4 g/day) had no benefit in CPMS (progression at two years: RR = 0.78, 95% CI [0.43 to 1.42]). Slight decreases in relapse rate and relapse severity were associated with omega-6 fatty acids in some small studies, however these findings are limited by the limited validity of the endpoints. Omega-3 fatty acids had no benefit on progression at 12 months in 14 RRMS patients or at 24 months in 292 RRMS patients (RR = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01 to 3.11], p = 0.22 at 12 months, and 0.82 95% CI [0.65 to 1.03], p = 0.08, at 24 months). The low frequency of reported adverse events suggests no major toxicity associated with PUFA administration. No studies on vitamin supplementation and allergen-free diets were analysed as none met the eligibility criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

PUFAs seem to have no major effect on the main clinical outcome in MS (disease progression), and does not substantially affect the risk of clinical relapses over 2 years. However, the data available are insufficient to assess any potential benefit or harm from PUFA supplementation. Evidence bearing on the possible benefits and risks of vitamin supplementation and antioxidant supplements in MS is lacking. More research is required to assess the effectiveness of diets interventions in MS.

### Symptom management in patients with multiple sclerosis [^116Poe47]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a complex disease associated with a wide variety of different symptoms that can affect the ability of multiple sclerosis patients to carry out normal activities of daily living. Although a myriad of symptoms can afflict these patients, the most commonly reported include fatigue, mood disorders, changes in cognitive function or memory, sensory changes (numbness, pain, vibrations), motor changes (loss of balance, poor coordination, muscle weakness or stiffness), vision changes (double vision, blurred vision, loss of vision) and bladder or bowel dysfunction. Treatments are available that can help minimise some of these symptoms and relieve patient distress. After the diagnosis has been established and a decision taken regarding initiation of immunomodulatory treatments, the majority of management decisions with which the physician will be confronted will concern symptom management. Whereas some symptoms are relatively easily treated, others are more difficult to manage. Management involves rehabilitation, pharmacological treatments and surgical procedures. Successful symptom management is a key determinant of quality of life for the patient and is the basis for improving physical and psychological function.

### Aspirin and multiple sclerosis [^114XGZTp]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

ASA and fatigue

Fatigue is a pervasive and debilitating symptom associated with a marked decrease in the quality of life for patients with MS. The cause of fatigue is not understood. Some possible theories concerning the causes of fatigue have included: elevated body temperature (in RRMS patients), sleep disturbances and depression, proinflammatory cytokines, reduced metabolism and degeneration of cerebral and deep gray matter structures, reduced connectivity, and reduced perfusion of deep gray matter. There are a limited number of approaches used to counter fatigue in MS, for example, amantadine, modafinil, vitamin D analog, treatment for sleep disorder, and exercise. Overall, studies have been conflicting as to the benefits of these modalities, and better management of fatigue is sorely needed.

ASA has been tested as a way to counter fatigue (Table 1). Following observations in a clinical setting that some MS patients seemed to experience a lessening of fatigue while taking ASA for non-MS-related symptoms, a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of 650 mg oral ASA twice daily or placebo for 6 weeks was initiated, where a modest but detectable improvement was found during the treatment phase with ASA. The mean obtained from the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS, range 0–84), which was administered weekly, decreased from 46.3 ± 16.0 at baseline to 38.1 ± 17.0 during ASA administration versus 42.5 ± 18.8 during placebo (ASA versus placebo, P = 0.043). In addition, of the patients completing the crossover components of the study, only 1/26 patients preferred placebo compared to 10/26 of patients preferring ASA treatment (P = 0.012) when responding to the Global Fatigue Change self-assessment. None of the other outcome measures for fatigue assessment revealed statistically significant differences (10-point Visual Analog Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS], MS-Specific Fatigue Scale), but there was a trend towards a greater reduction of fatigue symptoms while taking ASA on the Visual Analog Scale (ASA versus placebo, P = 0.076).

### A multi-domain lifestyle intervention in multiple sclerosis: a longitudinal observational study [^114HBZFs]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Along with diet, other modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, stress management, and sleep quality, seem promising targets in the management of MS symptoms. Physical activity may reduce MS-related fatigue, pain, immobility, cognitive complaints, and moderate-to-vigorous exercise may ameliorate the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative aspects of the disease. Over the years, consistent data show an association between stressful life events and an increased risk of exacerbations of MS. Adequate stress management among MS patients may reduce perceived stress and improve QoL. Decreased sleep quality is frequently reported among MS patients and is associated with other MS-related symptoms, including pain, fatigue, mood disorders, and cognitive dysfunction. Even though individual lifestyle factors show positive associations with fewer MS symptoms, studies on multi-modal lifestyle interventions in MS, where multiple factors are targeted simultaneously, are scarce. The effects of multi-domain lifestyle adaptations on MS symptoms should consequently be studied in large-scale longitudinal studies among MS patients.

Here, we performed a longitudinal, observational study among a large cohort of participants with MS to investigate the effect of multifaceted lifestyle adaptations on impact of MS on daily functioning. Additionally, we investigated QoL, general health, MS-specific symptoms, and lifestyle factors. The online multi-domain lifestyle intervention advocated an adapted MD, while concurrently targeting physical activity, stress, and sleep.

Procedures

Following randomization, patients started treatment with EGCG or placebo capsules 200 mg daily. Divided into 2 doses, they were escalated after 3 months to 400 mg daily, after 6 months to 600 mg daily, after 18 months to 800 mg, and after 30 months to 1,200 mg daily until the end of the study at month 36.

Patients initially treated with placebo and decided to participate in the 12-month OE started treatment with EGCG capsules 200 mg daily, then escalated every 2 weeks with 200 mg, reaching 1,200 mg after 10 weeks. For the patients treated with EGCG, the dosage was maintained during OE, until month 48 if they participated.

Patients received containers with EGCG capsules or placebo sufficient until the next study visit. At each of these visits, drug accountability was performed (number of taken capsules).

Standardized neurologic assessments including EDSSand MS Functional Composite (MSFC), consisting of 9-Hole Peg Test, timed 25-foot walk test, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were performed by a blinded and especially trained examiner at the initial screening (which was at most 1 week before randomization), then every 6 months, and at every unscheduled visit when a relapse was suspected. To avoid any training effect in the PASAT, each participant underwent at least 3 test scorings before study scoring.

At baseline and at month 36, fatigue and depressive symptoms were assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)as well as Becks Depression Inventory I (BDI). An optical coherence tomography (OCT) was also performed every 12 months.

Safety assessments included reporting of adverse events (AEs), medical examinations, and laboratory examinations. Visits were scheduled every 2–3 months and with short-term follow-up in case of pathologic results.

### Safety and efficacy of amantadine, modafinil, and methylphenidate for fatigue in multiple sclerosis: a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover, double-blind trial [^112wGAd8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Methylphenidate, modafinil, and amantadine are commonly prescribed medications for alleviating fatigue in multiple sclerosis; however, the evidence supporting their efficacy is sparse and conflicting. Our goal was to compare the efficacy of these three medications with each other and placebo in patients with multiple sclerosis fatigue.

Methods

In this randomised, placebo-controlled, four-sequence, four-period, crossover, double-blind trial, patients with multiple sclerosis who reported fatigue and had a Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) score of more than 33 were recruited at two academic multiple sclerosis centres in the USA. Participants received oral amantadine (up to 100 mg twice daily), modafinil (up to 100 mg twice daily), methylphenidate (up to 10 mg twice daily), or placebo, each given for up to 6 weeks. All patients were intended to receive all four study medications, in turn, in one of four different sequences with 2-week washout periods between medications. A biostatistician prepared a concealed allocation schedule, stratified by site, randomly assigning a sequence of medications in approximately a 1:1:1:1 ratio, in blocks of eight, to a consecutive series of numbers. The statistician and pharmacists had no role in assessing the participants or collecting data, and the participants, caregivers, and assessors were masked to allocation. The primary outcome measure was the MFIS measured while taking the highest tolerated dose at week 5 of each medication period, analysed by use of a linear mixed-effect regression model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03185065 and is closed.

Findings

Between Oct 4, 2017, and Feb 27, 2019, of 169 patients screened, 141 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of four medication administration sequences: 35 (25%) patients to the amantadine, placebo, modafinil, and methylphenidate sequence; 34 (24%) patients to the placebo, methylphenidate, amantadine, and modafinil sequence; 35 (25%) patients to the modafinil, amantadine, methylphenidate, and placebo sequence; and 37 (26%) patients to the methylphenidate, modafinil, placebo, and amantadine sequence. Data from 136 participants were available for the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome. The estimated mean values of MFIS total scores at baseline and the maximal tolerated dose were as follows: 51.3 (95% CI 49.0–53.6) at baseline, 40.6 (38.2–43.1) with placebo, 41.3 (38.8–43.7) with amantadine, 39.0 (36.6–41.4) with modafinil, and 38.6 (36.2–41.0) with methylphenidate (p = 0.20 for the overall medication effect in the linear mixed-effect regression model). As compared with placebo (38 [31%] of 124 patients), higher proportions of participants reported adverse events while taking amantadine (49 [39%] of 127 patients), modafinil (50 [40%] of 125 patients), and methylphenidate (51 [40%] of 129 patients). Three serious adverse events occurred during the study (pulmonary embolism and myocarditis while taking amantadine, and a multiple sclerosis exacerbation requiring hospital admission while taking modafinil).

Interpretation

Amantadine, modafinil, and methylphenidate were not superior to placebo in improving multiple sclerosis fatigue and caused more frequent adverse events. The results of this study do not support an indiscriminate use of amantadine, modafinil, or methylphenidate for the treatment of fatigue in multiple sclerosis.

### Multiple sclerosis [^111J1LAL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults. Irreversible disability can occur, but life expectancy is generally not affected.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions aimed at reducing relapse rates and disability in people with multiple sclerosis? What are the effects of interventions to improve symptoms during acute relapse? What are the effects of treatments for fatigue, spasticity, and multidisciplinary care on disability in people with multiple sclerosis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 71 systematic reviews, RCTs, and observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following key interventions: amantadine, azathioprine, behaviour modification, botulinum toxin, corticosteroids, exercise, gabapentin, inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation, interferon beta, intrathecal baclofen, intravenous immunoglobulin, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, modafinil, natalizumab, oral drug treatments, parenteral glatiramer acetate, physiotherapy, and plasma exchange.
