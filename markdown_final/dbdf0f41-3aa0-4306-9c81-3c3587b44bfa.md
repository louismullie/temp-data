## Question

When can celecoxib be used for acute pain that is not autoimmune in origin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when celecoxib can be used for acute pain that is not autoimmune in origin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and dosing for acute pain. Then, I should verify the clinical scenarios supported by evidence outside of autoimmune conditions. Next, I will review comparative efficacy versus nonselective NSAIDs and consider pharmacokinetics that affect onset. After that, I need to assess safety, contraindications, and risk-mitigation strategies. Finally, I will synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations and a concise conclusion anchored in guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory foundation. Celecoxib is FDA-approved for "Acute Pain (AP)" in adults, which is distinct from its chronic arthritis indications, and the labeled acute dosing is 400 mg initially, with an optional additional 200 mg on day 1 if needed, followed by 200 mg twice daily as needed on subsequent days, which establishes a clear, on-demand regimen for short-term use [^112nbfBQ] [^115RQ9zj] [^113DXyWa].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical contexts that fit "non-autoimmune acute pain". Evidence supports celecoxib for postoperative pain, where single-dose celecoxib 200–400 mg provides analgesia with NNTs around 2.5–4.2 for at least 50% pain relief over 4–6 hours and delays rescue medication use, with 400 mg performing comparably to ibuprofen 400 mg in indirect comparisons, which is directly relevant to acute, non-autoimmune pain after surgery [^115V1bLB] [^114yJ2ag] [^114zJxSL].

> I should also confirm applicability to musculoskeletal injuries. In acute shoulder tendinitis/bursitis, celecoxib 400 mg followed by 200 mg twice daily reduced pain more than placebo and was comparable to naproxen, supporting use in acute inflammatory soft-tissue conditions that are not autoimmune in origin [^1121qah5]. For acute gout flares, high-dose celecoxib regimens have shown efficacy similar to indomethacin, again a non-autoimmune acute inflammatory pain state, though I need to ensure we frame this as an off-label but evidence-supported use rather than an FDA indication [^114L9hbR] [^112vX21V].

> Hold on, I should verify whether acute low back pain is a supported scenario. NSAIDs, including celecoxib, have modest benefit over placebo for acute low back pain, with small but statistically significant improvements in pain and disability, so celecoxib is a reasonable NSAID option when NSAIDs are indicated and patient-specific risks are acceptable [^111o4mKT] [^114Yy75h].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy versus nonselective NSAIDs. In an ED acute pain trial, celecoxib 200–400 mg and ibuprofen 600 mg produced similar magnitudes of pain reduction at 5 hours, suggesting comparable analgesia in acute settings, although onset may be slower with celecoxib capsules, which can matter for rapid relief needs [^117SYa3m]. Let me consider pharmacokinetics: celecoxib capsules have a relatively slow absorption with a median Tmax around 2.5 hours, whereas acidic NSAIDs like ibuprofen or diclofenac may reach effective levels faster; this helps explain why some guidelines prefer nonselective NSAIDs for rapid-onset needs, though celecoxib's GI-sparing profile can offset this in higher GI-risk patients [^112tMFQa] [^111ZjBs5].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed comprehensively. Celecoxib carries class boxed warnings for cardiovascular thrombotic events and serious GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation; risk increases with dose and duration, and is higher in patients with prior GI events, older age, or concomitant antithrombotics, so I should confirm GI and CV risk before prescribing and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^1152Cysx] [^115QnTHV]. But wait, what if the patient is on low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection? The GI advantage of celecoxib may be attenuated with concomitant aspirin, so I should reconsider the choice or add gastroprotection if NSAIDs are still necessary [^115UFoXf].

> Let me think about specific contraindications and precautions. Celecoxib should be avoided in patients with sulfonamide allergy, prior NSAID-induced asthma or urticaria, active GI bleeding or peptic ulcer disease, advanced renal impairment, or high cardiovascular risk where alternatives exist. In perioperative coronary artery bypass settings, COX-2 inhibitors increase thrombotic events and should not be used for pain around the time of surgery, so I should double-check surgical timing and CV history before prescribing [^1152Cysx] [^113sqXLD].

> I should confirm practical dosing guidance. For acute non-autoimmune pain, start with 400 mg celecoxib, consider 200 mg more on day 1 if pain persists, then 200 mg twice daily as needed, typically for no more than a few days to a week unless the clinical course justifies longer use. This aligns with the FDA acute pain regimen and the principle of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^112nbfBQ] [^115RQ9zj] [^113DXyWa].

> Next, I should review risk-mitigation strategies. In patients with elevated GI risk, combining celecoxib with a PPI is reasonable, though evidence is strongest in chronic arthritis populations. In very high GI/CV risk patients, avoiding NSAIDs altogether may be preferable and acetaminophen or regional techniques should be prioritized, with shared decision-making about trade-offs [^113FvkkB] [^111ZjBs5]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this approach: AAFP and ACP emphasize NSAID selection based on patient risk factors and using the lowest effective dose short term, which supports tailoring celecoxib use to GI/CV/renal risk profiles [^112vYzRo] [^113iZoie].

> Let me synthesize when celecoxib is appropriate for non-autoimmune acute pain. It is appropriate when NSAID therapy is indicated for acute pain such as postoperative pain, acute soft-tissue inflammatory pain, acute low back pain, or acute gout, and when the patient has meaningful GI risk where a COX-2 selective agent may confer relative safety, or when nonselective NSAIDs are not tolerated; it is less ideal when very rapid onset is critical due to slower absorption, in which case a nonselective NSAID or a different route may be preferred [^113TosGu] [^1121qah5] [^111o4mKT] [^114L9hbR] [^111ZjBs5] [^112tMFQa].

> I should double-check that my conclusion matches both labeling and guidelines. Celecoxib is FDA-approved for acute pain in adults, supported by evidence in postoperative and acute musculoskeletal pain, with a favorable GI profile relative to nonselective NSAIDs but a class CV risk signal; therefore, use celecoxib for short-term management of non-autoimmune acute pain when NSAIDs are appropriate and GI risk is a priority, while screening for CV, renal, and bleeding risks and applying the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^112nbfBQ] [^113TosGu] [^111ZjBs5] [^1152Cysx].

---

Celecoxib is appropriate for acute non-autoimmune pain when **GI risk is high** (bleeding, ulcers, or on anticoagulants) [^111ZjBs5] [^11623xWD], **CV risk is moderate** (use lowest dose, shortest duration) [^113HA2oj], and **rapid onset is not critical** (onset ~60 min) [^115V1bLB]. It is effective for acute musculoskeletal pain, dental pain, dysmenorrhea, and postoperative pain [^113TosGu] [^1121qah5], but is **less suitable for fractures** or when very fast relief is needed [^113snEKB] [^112tMFQa]. Use 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg BID as needed [^115RQ9zj]; avoid in severe CV disease, renal failure, or sulfonamide allergy [^1152Cysx].

## Clinical scenarios for celecoxib in acute non-autoimmune pain

Celecoxib is appropriate for acute non-autoimmune pain in the following scenarios:

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Effective for acute musculoskeletal pain, including strains, sprains, and soft tissue injuries [^1121qah5].

- **Dental pain**: Effective for acute dental pain, including post-extraction and post-operative dental pain [^115V1bLB].

- **Primary dysmenorrhea**: Effective for acute menstrual pain [^112nbfBQ].

- **Postoperative pain**: Effective for acute postoperative pain, including orthopedic and general surgery [^113TosGu].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting celecoxib use in acute non-autoimmune pain

Several studies support celecoxib for acute non-autoimmune pain:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Evidence supporting celecoxib use** |
|-|-|
| Musculoskeletal pain | - Comparable efficacy to ibuprofen and naproxen [^117SYa3m] [^1121qah5] <br/> - Lower gastrointestinal risk compared to non-selective NSAIDs [^11623xWD] |
| Dental pain | - Effective for acute dental pain [^115V1bLB] <br/> - Lower gastrointestinal risk compared to non-selective NSAIDs [^111ZjBs5] |
| Primary dysmenorrhea | - Effective for acute menstrual pain [^112nbfBQ] <br/> - Lower gastrointestinal risk compared to non-selective NSAIDs [^111ZjBs5] |
| Postoperative pain | - Effective for acute postoperative pain [^113TosGu] <br/> - Lower gastrointestinal risk compared to non-selective NSAIDs [^111ZjBs5] |

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

The recommended dosing regimen for celecoxib in acute non-autoimmune pain is:

- **Initial dose**: 400 mg orally on the first day [^115RQ9zj].

- **Subsequent doses**: 200 mg orally twice daily as needed on subsequent days [^113DXyWa].

- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [^112nbfBQ].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Celecoxib is contraindicated or requires caution in the following scenarios:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke) [^1152Cysx].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation [^1152Cysx].

- **Renal impairment**: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment [^113snEKB].

- **Sulfonamide allergy**: Contraindicated in patients with known sulfonamide allergy [^1152Cysx].

---

## Comparison with other NSAIDs

Celecoxib offers several advantages over non-selective NSAIDs, including a lower risk of gastrointestinal adverse events [^111ZjBs5] and a comparable analgesic efficacy [^117SYa3m]. However, it may have a higher cardiovascular risk profile compared to some non-selective NSAIDs, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend celecoxib for acute non-autoimmune pain, particularly in patients with **high gastrointestinal risk** or those who cannot tolerate non-selective NSAIDs [^113snEKB]. The American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend NSAIDs, including celecoxib, for acute musculoskeletal pain, with consideration of patient-specific risk factors and preferences [^113iZoie].

---

## Summary of clinical scenarios for celecoxib use in acute non-autoimmune pain

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Effective and safe for acute musculoskeletal pain, particularly in patients with high gastrointestinal risk [^1121qah5].

- **Dental pain**: Effective for acute dental pain with lower gastrointestinal risk compared to non-selective NSAIDs [^115V1bLB].

- **Primary dysmenorrhea**: Effective for acute menstrual pain with lower gastrointestinal risk compared to non-selective NSAIDs [^112nbfBQ].

- **Postoperative pain**: Effective for acute postoperative pain with lower gastrointestinal risk compared to non-selective NSAIDs [^113TosGu].

---

Celecoxib is appropriate for acute non-autoimmune pain — such as musculoskeletal, dental, dysmenorrhea, and postoperative pain — especially when **GI risk is high** or nonselective NSAIDs are not tolerated. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and avoid in severe CV disease, renal failure, or sulfonamide allergy [^112nbfBQ] [^1152Cysx].

Background

This is an update of a review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2008, and updated in Issue 3, 2012. Celecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor usually prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Celecoxib is believed to be associated with fewer upper gastrointestinal adverse effects than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Its effectiveness in acute pain was demonstrated in the earlier reviews.

Objectives

To assess analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of celecoxib for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was to 31 May 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of adults prescribed any dose of oral celecoxib or placebo for acute postoperative pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed studies for quality and extracted data. We converted summed pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) into dichotomous information, yielding the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours. We used this to calculate the relative benefit (RB) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT), for one patient to achieve at least 50% of maximum pain relief with celecoxib who would not have done so with placebo. We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use.

Main Results

Ten studies (1785 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The two new studies in this update had been identified in the earlier update, but data were not available. There remain three potentially relevant unpublished studies for which data are not available at this time. The NNT for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg compared with placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over four to six hours was 4.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4 to 5.6) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.0) respectively. The median time to use of rescue medication was 6.6 hours with celecoxib 200 mg, 8.4 hours with celecoxib 400 mg, and 2.3 hours with placebo. The proportion of participants requiring rescue medication over 24 hours was 74% with celecoxib 200 mg, 63% for celecoxib 400 mg, and 91% for placebo. The NNT to prevent one patient using rescue medication was 4.8 (95% CI 3.5 to 7.7) and 3.5 (95% CI 2.9 to 4.6) for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg respectively. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and were experienced by a similar proportion of participants in the celecoxib and placebo groups. One serious adverse event that was probably related to celecoxib was reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Single-dose oral celecoxib is an effective analgesic for postoperative pain relief. Indirect comparison suggests that the 400 mg dose has similar efficacy to ibuprofen 400 mg.

### Advice from professional societies: appropriate use of NSAIDs [^111sDVr2]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are some of the most commonly used medications due to their well-known analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic actions. Due to their known benefits and inherent risks, there have been multiple guidelines from national professional societies that suggest appropriate use to provide both maximum benefit and mitigate risk of adverse events, particularly in older individuals.

Design

A literature search was undertaken using PubMed and search terms including pain, aging, treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, arthritis, older patient, and guidelines. Practice guideline reviews were conducted from the following sources: American Geriatric Society, American College of Rheumatology, and the European League Against Rheumatism suggesting the appropriate and safer use of NSAIDs, along with references to guidelines product by Osteoarthritis Research International, the American Gastroenterological Association.

Conclusions

Literature-based and professional society guidelines provides clinicians with means optimize efficacy and safety of NSAIDs in clinical practice. Summary recommendations are provided in this review.

2.1 General Dosing Instructions

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of celecoxib and other treatment options before deciding to use celecoxib. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

These doses can be given without regard to timing of meals.

2.2 Osteoarthritis

For OA, the dosage is 200 mg per day administered as a single dose or as 100 mg twice daily.

2.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis

For RA, the dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg twice daily.

2.4 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis

For JRA, the dosage for pediatric patients (age 2 years and older) is based on weight. For patients ≥ 10 kg to ≤ 25 kg the recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily. For patients > 25 kg the recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily.

For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, the contents of a celecoxib capsule can be added to applesauce. The entire capsule contents are carefully emptied onto a level teaspoon of cool or room temperature applesauce and ingested immediately with water. The sprinkled capsule contents on applesauce are stable for up to 6 hours under refrigerated conditions (2°C to 8°C/ 35°F to 45°F).

2.5 Ankylosing Spondylitis

For AS, the dosage of celecoxib is 200 mg daily in single (once per day) or divided (twice per day) doses. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg daily may be worthwhile. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks on 400 mg daily, a response is not likely and consideration should be given to alternate treatment options.

2.6 Management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea

For management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea, the dosage is 400 mg initially, followed by an additional 200 mg dose if needed on the first day. On subsequent days, the recommended dose is 200 mg twice daily as needed.

### Analgesia and COX-2 inhibition [^114DZWH9]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

While non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of therapy for the management of acute pain and rheumatoid arthritis, toxicity associated with chronic administration limits their benefit-to-risk relationship in many patients. A series of studies is reviewed that assesses the relationship between cytokines released at the site of tissue injury and NSAID analgesia, and the in vivo selectivity of a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) in comparison to a dual COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (ketorolac). Three replicate studies in the oral surgery model of acute pain used submucosal microdialysis sample collection for the measurement of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; a product of both COX-1 and COX-2) and thromboxane B2 (as a biomarker for COX-1 activity) with parallel assessments of pain. The time course of PGE2 production was consistent with early release due to COX-1 activity followed by increased production 2–3 hours after surgery, consistent with COX-2 expression. Ketorolac 30 mg at pain onset suppressed both pain and peripheral PGE2 levels. Ketorolac 1 mg either at the site of injury or intramuscularly also produced analgesia but without any effect on peripheral PGE2 levels. Celecoxib selectively suppressed PGE2 but not TxB2 at time points consistent with COX-2 activity, while producing analgesia. These studies demonstrate the ability to assess the time course and selective effects of COX-2 inhibitors in vivo and suggest that suppression of COX-2 mediated PGE2 is temporally related to NSAID analgesia.

### Penetration and efficacy of transdermal NSAIDs in a model of acute joint inflammation [^114pHatW]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Arthritis is the most common musculoskeletal disease, affecting millions of people and pets worldwide. This chronic disease is characterized by symptoms of cartilage loss, synovium inflammation, osteophytosis, reduced range of motion, and pain, which eventually result in joint failure. The etiology of arthritis is multifactorial and linked to inflammation, trauma, aging, obesity, chondrocyte differentiation, and genetic pre disposition. Therapeutics for disease reversal are limited, and consequently the pharmaceutical industry continues to focus on improvement of three critical and currently drug-gable target endpoints: pain, function, and disease progression. Pain and disability are the most common complaints of arthritis patients, symptoms that are primarily managed with NSAIDs

Classic NSAIDs like ibuprofen ((R, S)-2-(4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl)propanoic acid) have analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by non-specific inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2enzymes. Inhibition of COX-1 is hypothesized to cause GI side effects, which occur in approximately 15% of patients and include (but are not limited to) nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. Gastric upset and ulceration are even more pronounced in dogs and cats; therefore, ibuprofen use is discouraged in companion animals.GI adverse events associated with oral ibuprofen use make topical formulation a promising alternative for both human and veterinary medicine. By contrast, celecoxib (4-[5-(4-Methylphenyl)-3(trifluoromethyl) pyrazol-1-yl] benzenesulfonamide) is a COX-2 specific inhibitor that was originally patented by Pfizer under the brand names Celebrex and Celebra and is currently available as a generic under many other brands. Like ibuprofen, celecoxib is used to treat pain and fever and has established clinical efficacy for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute postoperative pain.–Unlike ibuprofen, celecoxib has reduced instances of GI side effects, hypothetically due to its limited COX-1 inhibitory activity. Celecoxib is also linked to increased incidence of major vascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, and is, therefore, unlikely to become an OTC drug like ibuprofen. In summary, NSAID use may result in off-target adverse effects on the GI and cardiovascular systems; therefore, administration via a route that avoids or reduces systemic drug exposure, while achieving targeted pain reduction, is desirable. TD NSAID products may embody these advantageous criteria and have been investigated in a variety of clinical trials with some (eg, Voltaren ® [diclofenac]) commercial success.–

14.4 Ankylosing Spondylitis

Celecoxib was evaluated in AS patients in two placebo- and active-controlled clinical trials of 6 and 12 weeks duration.

Celecoxib at doses of 100 mg twice daily, 200 mg once daily and 400 mg once daily was shown to be statistically superior to placebo in these studies for all three co-primary efficacy measures assessing global pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), global disease activity (Visual Analogue Scale) and functional impairment (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index). In the 12-week study, there was no difference in the extent of improvement between the 200 mg and 400 mg celecoxib doses in a comparison of mean change from baseline, but there was a greater percentage of patients who responded to celecoxib 400 mg, 53%, than to celecoxib 200 mg, 44%, using the Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis response criteria (ASAS 20). The ASAS 20 defines a responder as improvement from baseline of at least 20% and an absolute improvement of at least 10 mm, on a 0 to 100 mm scale, in at least three of the four following domains: patient global pain, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, and inflammation. The responder analysis also demonstrated no change in the responder rates beyond 6 weeks.

14.5 Analgesia, including Primary Dysmenorrhea

In acute analgesic models of post-oral surgery pain, post-orthopedic surgical pain, and primary dysmenorrhea, celecoxib relieved pain that was rated by patients as moderate to severe. Single doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] of celecoxib provided pain relief within 60 minutes.]

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — comparisons of tramadol with acetaminophen and NSAIDs report that an RCT comparing tramadol to acetaminophen showed no statistically significant differences in pain reduction or study withdrawal due to adverse events at seven days. Trials comparing NSAIDs (diclofenac, celecoxib) to tramadol at four and 12 weeks found NSAIDs reduced pain (SMD: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07–0.36) and improved function (SMD: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09–0.37) over tramadol; tramadol was associated with more adverse events and more study withdrawals than NSAIDs, although there was no difference in serious adverse events. RCTs comparing the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen versus NSAIDs alone found no statistically significant difference in pain reduction between groups at 8–12 weeks.

Absorption, distribution, and elimination

In addition to dose, the therapeutic activity and side effects of NSAIDs depend on their absorption, distribution, and elimination; these pharmacokinetic parameters can differ substantially between different NSAIDs. As with any analgesic class, the rate of absorption is a key factor in the selection of an NSAID; those with rapid absorption are preferable for most patients, particularly those with severe or acute pain. For example, celecoxib, which has a relatively slow rate of absorption, can be administered at standard doses to effectively treat osteoarthritis pain, but is not ideal for treatment of acute pain as it takes considerable time for absorption and often requires a loading dose to achieve clinically meaningful analgesia.

The distribution of NSAIDs in injured tissues, blood, and other areas of the body is a particularly crucial consideration for ensuring activity at the site of inflammation, as well as reducing the risk of side effects unrelated to therapeutic activity on COX enzymes throughout the body.NSAIDs can be classified as acidic or non-acidic based on their chemical structure, and the acidity of the drug can have an effect on its distribution. NSAIDs with acidic functional groups (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen) and with a high degree of protein binding have been shown to selectively accumulate and persist at sites of inflammation,–while non-acidic NSAIDs (eg, acetaminophen, celecoxib, rofecoxib) tend to be distributed homogenously throughout the body. Acidic NSAIDs with a high degree of protein binding may remain in inflamed tissues or synovial fluid for a longer time than in the plasma (Figure 4). For example, diclofenac 75 mg (enteric-coated) reaches peak concentrations in the synovial fluid that exceed plasma concentrations at 4 hours after oral administration in patients with arthritis; these high and persistent synovial levels are maintained above or near the expected IC 80 for COX-2 for up to 12 hours after dosing, with rapid disappearance of diclofenac from the plasma, even after repeated dosing. The persistence of certain NSAIDs (eg, diclofenac, ibuprofen) in the synovial fluid is associated with a sustained therapeutic effect despite relatively rapid clearance from the plasma, vascular wall, and kidneys, indicating that accumulation at sites of inflammation may allow for continued anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The localization of COX activity to inflamed tissue and the resulting ability to use lower doses than might otherwise be required also minimizes COX inhibition at sites associated with potential side effects (eg, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal adverse effects).

NSAIDs are an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate pain secondary to osteoarthritis knee pain; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical NSAIDs are recommended before oral treatments because of their lower systemic exposure/toxicity; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical diclofenac 70–81 mg/day should be considered as first-line pharmacological treatment for knee OA - can be effective and generally safer than oral NSAIDs due to reduced systemic exposure and lower dose; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
NSAIDs should not be used for patients with comorbidities due to risk of adverse events; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
NSAIDs should not be used on a long-term basis (> 3 months) due to side effect profile (cardiovascular and gastrointestinal) and lack safety data; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Celecoxib and non-selective NSAIDs are as effective as opioid for knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Due to low effect on pain and physical function, regardless of dose, the potential clinical benefit of opioids does not outweigh the potential harm in patients with knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong

Pharmacological management: NSAIDs — "When not contraindicated, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) should be used to reduce pain and improve function in the treatment of symptomatic hip osteoarthritis", with "Quality of Evidence: High" and "Strength of Recommendation: Strong". The guideline rationale states "Five studies (three moderate quality and two high quality) compared oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) with placebo for treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip and showed improvement in pain and function scores", that "Compared to placebo, all five studies reported on pain and uniformly reported improvement in pain with the use of oral NSAIDs", and that "The Western Ontario McMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score was reported in all studies, all of which reported improvement in WOMAC function with NSAIDs compared to placebo". Head-to-head articles reported "lumiracoxib showed similar efficacy to celecoxib", "celecoxib 200mg/day and 400mg/day showed similar efficacy to naproxen", and "similar efficacy between valdecoxib 10mg and naproxen". Under benefits/harm, "Contraindications that should be considered include, but are not limited to, patients with chronic kidney disease or patients with significant cardiac conditions that may be at an elevated risk of myocardial infarction". Outcome importance notes "The use of non-opioid medications such as NSAIDs for nonoperative treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip is extremely important to minimize the use of opioids". Cost/resource statements note NSAIDs are "widely available and an extremely cost-effective treatment" but "there is limited comparative data on the cost-effectiveness of oral NSAIDs compared to other nonoperative treatments of osteoarthritis of the hip". For implementation, "This recommendation should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice" and "Oral NSAIDs are widely available. Thus, this recommendation should be easily implemented with no apparent barriers to adoption".

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^11581yr4]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act via inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, were discovered more than 100 years ago. They remain a key component of the pharmacological management of acute and chronic pain. The COX-1 and COX-2 isozymes have different biological functions; analgesic activity is primarily (although not exclusively) associated with inhibition of COX-2, while different side effects result from the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2. All available NSAIDs, including acetaminophen and aspirin, are associated with potential side effects, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects, related to their relative selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2. Since all NSAIDs exert their therapeutic activity through inhibition of the COX isozymes, strategies are needed to reduce the risks associated with NSAIDs while achieving sufficient pain relief. A better understanding of the inhibitory activity and COX-1/COX-2 selectivity of an NSAID at therapeutic doses, based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties (eg, inhibitory dose, absorption, plasma versus tissue distribution, and elimination), and the impact on drug tolerability and safety can guide the selection of appropriate NSAIDs for pain management. For example, many NSAIDs with moderate to high selectivity for COX-2 versus COX-1 can be administered at doses that maximize efficacy (~80% inhibition of COX-2) while minimizing COX-1 inhibition and associated side effects, such as gastrointestinal toxicity. Acidic NSAIDs with favorable tissue distribution and short plasma half-lives can additionally be dosed to provide near-constant analgesia while minimizing plasma concentrations to permit recovery of COX-mediated prostaglandin production in the vascular wall and other organs. Each patient's clinical background, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be taken into account when selecting appropriate NSAIDs. New methods are emerging to assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate NSAIDs and their doses/schedules, such as biomarkers that may predict the response to NSAID treatment in individual patients.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^115ozYHB]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The approach to patients with acute pain begins by identifying the underlying cause and a disease-specific treatment. The first-line pharmacologic agent for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain is acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The choice between these two medications depends on the type of pain and patient risk factors for NSAID-related adverse effects (e.g., gastrointestinal, renovascular, or cardiovascular effects). Different NSAIDs have similar analgesic effects. However, cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib) must be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and are more expensive than nonselective NSAIDs. If these first-line agents are not sufficient for mild to moderate pain, medications that target separate pathways simultaneously, such as an acetaminophen/opioid combination, are reasonable choices. Severe acute pain is typically treated with potent opioids. At each step, adjuvant medications directed at the underlying condition can be used. Newer medications with dual actions (e.g., tapentadol) are also an option. There is little evidence that one opioid is superior for pain control, but there are some pharmacologic differences among opioids. Because of the growing misuse and diversion of controlled substances, caution should be used when prescribing opioids, even for short-term treatment. Patients should be advised to properly dispose of unused medications.

### Balancing risks and benefits of cyclooxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^114kmqh8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Choosing NSAID therapy remains confusing and controversial-the challenge for the clinician is to sum all the risks as well as analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy. COX-2 inhibitors are an important scientific advance in pain therapy, and using them in a safe and cost-effective manner is possible when all the competing risks are carefully weighed.

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of celecoxib oral solution (ELYXYB) in acute treatment of episodic migraine with or without aura [^114CxT4W]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Some patients with migraine respond well to simple pain relievers, as measured by 2-hour post-dose pain relief. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Several NSAIDs, including diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, are established as effective in migraine and are recommended treatment options for acute attacks. These non-selective NSAIDs inhibit the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (which play a key role in migraine pathogenesis)through two isoenzymes, cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2. However, up to 60% of patients experience gastrointestinal (GI) AEs with non-selective NSAIDs; these problems include GI bleeding and ulcers, which are related to COX-1 inhibition. However, the analgesic efficacy of NSAIDs is associated with COX-2 inhibition. Furthermore, since migraine is a chronic conditionrequiring episodic treatment, it is important to recognize that the cumulative consumption of non-selective NSAIDs can lead to serious AEs, including GI, cardiovascular, and renal events. Predicated on this, the use of COX-2-selective versus non-selective NSAIDs may provide a therapeutic advantage in the acute management of migraine.

Celecoxib is a COX-2 selective NSAID; it has an analgesic profile similar to other NSAIDs, alongside a more favorable GI profile. A systematic review and meta-analysis of celecoxib capsules in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis found a significantly reduced incidence of GI AEs with celecoxib capsules compared to non-specific NSAIDs such as naproxen (relative risk [RR]: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.55–0.67]). Incidence was also reduced non-significantly when celecoxib was compared to the COX-2-specific NSAID rofecoxib (RR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.49–1.06]). In 2007, Loo et al evaluated 400-mg celecoxib capsules versus 550-mg naproxen sodium in an open-label, randomized, controlled study (N = 60) for acute treatment of patients with migraine. Celecoxib capsules showed similar pain reduction as naproxen, based on Visual Analogue Scale results, as well as significantly reduced gastric pain incidence. However, celecoxib capsules are slow to provide pain relief, with a median T max of 2.5 hours. Because rapid pain relief is an important treatment goal, and due to GI issues with oral NSAIDs, celecoxib capsules have not been approved for the acute treatment of migraine in the U.S.

Therapeutic management of pain

Evolution of analgesics

In the wake of increased understanding of the pathophysiology of pain, various receptors have been identified as potential targets for drug therapy over the years. In the early 1970s, Vane et alproposed the involvement of prostaglandin inhibition as the mechanism of action of aspirin-like drugs. These findings paved the path for development of NSAIDs, targeting the COX-1 enzyme system involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, thereby reducing both pain and associated inflammation. The earliest known marketed NSAIDs were ibuprofen and aspirin, which were followed up by similar compounds, with varying efficacies. Acetaminophen, the safest analgesic till date was developed in 1946, after two synthetic antipyretics, acetanilide and phenacetin, were developed and had significant associated toxicities. In the search for a more effective and safer analgesic, research was focused on the development of the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. However, there were severe concerns of cardiac toxicities observed with these agents, limiting their use.

2.1 General Dosing Instructions

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of celecoxib and other treatment options before deciding to use celecoxib. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

These doses can be given without regard to timing of meals.

2.2 Osteoarthritis

For OA, the dosage is 200 mg per day administered as a single dose or as 100 mg twice daily.

2.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis

For RA, the dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg twice daily.

2.4 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis

For JRA, the dosage for pediatric patients (age 2 years and older) is based on weight. For patients > 10 kg to < 25 kg the recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily. For patients > 25 kg the recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily.

For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, the contents of a celecoxib capsule can be added to applesauce. The entire capsule contents are carefully emptied onto a level teaspoon of cool or room temperature applesauce and ingested immediately with water. The sprinkled capsule contents on applesauce are stable for up to 6 hours under refrigerated conditions (2°C to 8°C/35°F to 45°F).

2.5 Ankylosing Spondylitis

For AS, the dosage of celecoxib is 200 mg daily in single (once per day) or divided (twice per day) doses. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg daily may be worthwhile. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks on 400 mg daily, a response is not likely and consideration should be given to alternate treatment options.

2.6 Management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea

For management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea, the dosage is 400 mg initially, followed by an additional 200 mg dose if needed on the first day. On subsequent days, the recommended dose is 200 mg twice daily as needed.

### Celecoxib… [^116tvu8t]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Celecoxib, sold under the brand name Celebrex among others, is a COX-2 inhibitor and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is used to treat the pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, acute pain in adults, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, painful menstruation, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas in people with familial adenomatous polyposis. It is taken by mouth. Benefits are typically seen within an hour. Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Serious side effects may include heart attacks, strokes, gastrointestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, and anaphylaxis. Use is not recommended in people at high risk for heart disease. The risks are similar to other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Use in the later part of pregnancy or during breastfeeding is not recommended.

Medical uses Celecoxib is indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, acute pain, musculoskeletal pain, painful menstruation, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and to reduce the number of colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis. It may be used in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who are older than two years of age and weigh more than 10 kg. For postoperative pain, it is more or less equal to ibuprofen. For pain relief, it is similar to paracetamol at 3990 mg per day, which is the first line treatment for osteoarthritis. Evidence of effects is not clear as several studies done by the manufacturer have not been released for independent analysis.

Familial adenomatous polyposis It has been used to reduce colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis, but it is not known if it decreases rates of cancer, so it is not a good choice for this reason.
- **Hematologic effects**: Anemia may occur; monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in people on long-term treatment. Celecoxib does not usually affect prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or platelet counts; it does not inhibit platelet aggregation at approved doses. People with a prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding require special precautions. Moderate to severe liver impairment or GI toxicity can occur with or without warning symptoms in people treated with NSAIDs. As a result, in 2018 an FDA advisory panel concluded that celecoxib poses no greater risk for causing heart attacks and strokes than the commonly used NSAIDs ibuprofen or naproxen and recommended that the FDA consider changing its advice to physicians regarding celecoxib's safety.

The COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was removed from the market in 2004 due to its risk. Like all NSAIDs on the US market, celecoxib carries an FDA-mandated "black box warning" for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk. In February 2007, the American Heart Association warned that with respect to "patients with a prior history of or at high risk for cardiovascular disease. use of COX-2 inhibitors for pain relief should be limited to patients for whom there are no appropriate alternatives, and then, only in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary". In 2005, a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors differ, depending on the drug. Other COX-2-selective inhibitors, such as rofecoxib, have significantly higher myocardial infarction rates than celecoxib. In April 2005, after an extensive review of data, the FDA concluded it was likely "that there is a 'class effect' for increased CV risk for all NSAIDs".

To minimize the likelihood that high‑risk patients experience NSAID‑induced serious upper GI events, providers may consider several options, including the addition of a proton‑pump inhibitor (PPI) or misoprostol; in patients at greatest risk alternative treatment is advised; providers could consider the use of a COX‑2 selective NSAID combined with a PPI if treatment with NSAIDs is necessary; evidence comparing non‑selective or relatively COX‑2 selective NSAID plus PPI versus COX‑2 selective NSAID plus PPI in the highest‑risk patients is lacking, and many patients will be at sufficiently high risk to warrant avoidance of NSAIDs.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^1157TStY]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

COX2-selective and nonselective (ns) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used for chronic pain management. There are marked differences in the risk of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) events among different NSAIDs. In 2017, publication of two randomized controlled trials and an individual patient-data meta-analysis provided robust data on the relative GI and CV tolerability profiles of currently available NSAIDs. The PRECISION study showed similar CV-event rates with celecoxib vs naproxen and ibuprofen, but GI tolerability was better for celecoxib. In the CONCERN study of high-GI-risk patients, celecoxib was associated with fewer adverse GI-tract events than naproxen. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference between celecoxib and ns-NSAIDs in the rate of acute myocardial infarction, and celecoxib was the only COX2-selective NSAID with a lower risk of adverse CV and GI events vs ns-NSAIDs. These data add to the body of knowledge about the relative tolerability of different NSAIDs and were used to propose an updated treatment algorithm. The decision about whether to use an NSAID and which one should be based on a patient's risk of developing adverse GI and CV events. Lower- and upper-GI-tract events need to be considered. Celecoxib has a better lower-GI-tract tolerability profile than ns-NSAIDs plus a proton-pump inhibitor. In addition, the latest data suggest that long-term use of celecoxib 200 mg/day may be appropriate for patients at increased CV risk.

Non-selective NSAIDs and Cox-2 selective inhibitors: their role in the management of arthritis

Both non-selective NSAIDs and the newer Cox-2 selective inhibitors are widely prescribed because of their proven ability to reduce inflammation and control pain, and thus optimize function. They are significantly more effective than acetaminophen in terms of managing pain and thus improving quality of life.

The EULAR guidelines of 2003 for OA in the knee recommend that NSAIDs are used if up to 4 × 1000 mg/day paracetamol (acetaminophen) is ineffective, moving to opioid analgesics (e.g. codeine and tramadol) with or without acetaminophen if NSAIDs prove ineffective. Guidelines for RA similarly recommend the use of non-selective NSAIDs/Cox-2 selective inhibitors, as do the 2008 guidelines for OA from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK.

Guidelines, of course, remind us that these treatments should be used with caution in individuals who may be at increased cardiovascular, renal and GI risk. This article reviews the evidence that rheumatologists may use in assessing GI risk in the context of the other risks in individuals with arthritis who are taking non-selective NSAID or Cox-2 selective treatments in order to maximize benefit for the patient.

Despite these risks, NSAIDs play a key role in the management of arthritis conditions. That they are more effective than placebo has been shown by several clinical trials. In one randomized control trial, which compared both celecoxib and diclofenac with placebo in 600 patients over a period of 6 weeks, it was shown that both the non-selective NSAID and the Cox-2 selective inhibitor were better than placebo in managing pain (Fig. 1).

### Co-crystals as a new approach to multimodal analgesia and the treatment of pain [^115k4nzR]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Co-crystal of tramadol-celecoxib (CTC) is the only API–API co-crystal in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of acute pain. CTC is a unique, single-entitythat contains two APIs belonging to well-known and complementary analgesic classes: rac-tramadol.HCl and celecoxib (in a 1:1 molecular ratio [1:1.27 weight ratio]; Figure 2B). Together, these two APIs recruit four of the most relevant mechanisms of action for targeting pain (Figure 4). Tramadol is a centrally acting mu-opioid receptor agonist, as is its active O-desmethyl metabolite (M1). Additionally, the dextrorotatory enantiomer of tramadol is an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, whereas the levorotatory enantiomer of tramadol inhibits noradrenaline reuptake. Tramadol therefore recruits three analgesic mechanisms of action, and the single-entity product is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Celecoxib is a NSAID that preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) over COX-1and is indicated for the relief of chronic pain in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as for acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. Of note, celecoxib may have an improved cardiac safety profile compared with some other COX-2 inhibitors, and moderate doses are non-inferior to ibuprofen or naproxen with regards to cardiovascular safety. Combining tramadol and celecoxib provides both peripherally and centrally mediated analgesia, and has the potential to improve efficacy and safety profiles compared with existing pain therapies.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^115RX6NK]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for knee osteoarthritis are recommended to improve pain and function when not contraindicated (Strength of Recommendation: Strong). Meta-analyses report that non-selective oral NSAIDs compared to controls demonstrated a meaningful reduction in pain and a meaningful improvement in function, and that celecoxib, the only available selective COX-2 oral NSAID on the United States market, demonstrated a meaningful reduction in pain and improved function. The comparison of non-selective and selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs shows no significant difference in effectiveness. Given safety considerations, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a black-box warning for NSAIDs citing an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events and serious gastrointestinal events; providers should consider patient comorbidities, the type of NSAID administered, dose, and duration of administration, and we recommend the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible for the patient. Specific patient contraindications need to be assessed on an individual basis, and although selective COX-2 oral NSAIDs were developed to reduce gastrointestinal adverse events compared to non-selective oral NSAIDs, meta-analysis did not reveal a significant reduction in gastrointestinal adverse events.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^111iD1uK]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain represents a major public health problem worldwide,–with chronic pain affecting approximately 27% of the adult population in Europeand more than 100 million adults in the United States. Undertreated acute pain can be associated with an increased risk of deleterious health consequences (eg, delayed wound healing, immune dysfunction, cardiovascular problems related to the stress response, and respiratory problems, such as pneumonia) and the development of chronic pain. In addition, unrelieved chronic severe pain can negatively impact an individual's quality of life, day-to-day functioning, sleep quality, interpersonal relationships, and work productivity, and is associated with a substantial economic burden.

There are two major options for the pharmacological management of pain: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, and opiate/opioid analgesics.NSAIDs, which are among the most widely used medications worldwide, are often preferred because of their low abuse potential, robust efficacy, and long history of clinical use. Guidelines for pain management tend to be specific to medical conditions or settings. Current guidelines for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis generally recommend the use of oral acetaminophen (or topical NSAIDs for osteoarthritis) for first-line pain management, with other oral NSAIDs recommended in the first-line or second-line setting depending on the specific guideline; some guidelines also recommend opioids, although typically not as first-line therapy.–It has, however, recently been shown that acetaminophen is not measurably effective in acute low back pain (ie, not more effective than placebo). Other work in patients with osteoarthritis demonstrated that ibuprofen was associated with greater improvements compared with acetaminophen in measures of osteoarthritis pain, function, and quality of life. Acetaminophen and other oral NSAIDs are also recommended for acute pain, such as postoperative pain management.

### WITHDRAWN: celecoxib for rheumatoid arthritis [^1116jSWi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic auto-immune disorder, involving persistent joint inflammation. NSAIDs are used to control the symptoms of RA, but are associated with significant gastro-intestinal toxicity, including a risk of potentially life threatening gastroduodenal perforations, ulcers and bleeds. The NSAIDs known as the selective Cox II inhibitors, of which celecoxib is a member, were developed in order to reduce the GI toxicity, but are more expensive.

Objectives

To establish the efficacy and safety of celecoxib in the management of RA by systematic review of available evidence.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to August 2002: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Research Register, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database. The bibliographies of retrieved papers and content experts were consulted for additional references.

Selection Criteria

All eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. No unpublished RCTs were included in this edition of the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted independently by two reviewers. Data was analysed using a fixed effects model. A validated checklist was used to score the quality of the RCTs. The planned analysis was to pool, where appropriate continuous outcomes using mean differences and dichotomous outcomes using relative risk ratios. This was not however possible due to the lack of data.

Main Results

Five RCTs were included (4465 participants); three of the studies also enrolled individuals with OA. The comparators were placebo, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen. The evidence reviewed suggests that celecoxib controls the symptoms of RA to a similar degree to that of the active comparators examined (naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen). When compared to placebo, the percentage of patients showing improvement according to ACR 20 criteria at week 4 were 42/82 (51%) in the twice daily celecoxib 200mg group and 43/82 (52%) in the twice daily celecoxib 400mg group; these were significantly different from the placebo group in which 25/85 (29%) improved. The six month data reviewed support a reduced rate of UGI complications with celecoxib but there is also evidence to suggest that these benefits may not be evident in the long-term and that celecoxib offers no additional benefit in patients who are also receiving cardio-prophylactic low dose aspirin.

Authors' Conclusions

For an individual with RA the potential benefits of celecoxib need to be balanced against the uncertainty that the short-term reduced incidence of upper GI complications are maintained in the long-term and its increased cost in comparison to traditional NSAIDs.

### Acute treatment of migraine with celecoxib oral solution: results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^1158wpbq]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used for migraine, but gastrointestinal tolerability limits use. We previously reported results from the first treatment period of this 2-period, randomized, controlled study comparing DFN-15 — an oral, ready-made liquid solution of a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib — with placebo for the acute treatment of a moderate-severe migraine attack. Herein, we report the effects of treatment for the second treatment period.

Methods

In the first treatment period of this trial, adults with migraine were randomized to double-blind trial treatment of attacks of moderate or severe pain with DFN-15,120 mg or placebo. For the second treatment period, reported herein, participants were re-randomized to treat an attack of any baseline pain intensity (mild, moderate, or severe). Co-primary efficacy endpoints specified for the first attack were not specified for the second attack.

Results

Of the 531 patients who completed the first treatment period, 491 (n = 243 DFN-15; n = 248 placebo; 87% female, mean age 41 years) were re-randomized into the second double-blind treatment period. Baseline pain intensity was mild in 17.2% (85/493) of patients, moderate in 58.4% (288/493) of patients, and severe in 22.9% (113/493) of patients. At 2 hours post-dose, DFN-15 was superior to placebo for freedom from pain (46.2% [110/238] vs 31.1% [76/244], p ≤ 0.001) and the most bothersome symptom (63.4% [121/191] vs 50.0% [98/196], p = 0.010). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 7.1% (35/493) of patients (DFN-15: 6.1% [15/244]; placebo 8.0% [20/249]). Study drug-related TEAEs occurred in 5.1% (25/493) of patients (DFN-15: 4.5% [11/244]; placebo 5.6% [14/249]); nausea (1% [5/493]) and dysgeusia (0.8% [4/493]) were most common. No serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to study drug termination were reported.

Conclusions

DFN-15 was superior to placebo for pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptom when patients treat a migraine attack of any baseline pain intensity. Rates of TEAEs did not differ between treatment groups.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^117CFcb5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as "pain that persists beyond normal tissue healing time, which is assumed to be 3 months". Chronic pain is one of the most prominent causes of disability worldwide and represents a major challenge for public health. Patients with chronic pain report that this has a significant impact on their work and daily function. The presence of inflammation is a common underlying mechanism of chronic pain. Inflammation can occur in the affected organ and/or nerves. Low-grade inflammation, both local and systemic, is also the hallmark of many chronic, progressing, and painful conditions, such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Existing guidelines recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) as the first-line analgesic agent.–However, this is not an ideal choice for chronic inflammatory pain, because paracetamol lacks anti-inflammatory activity and has been shown to be less effective than alternative nonopioid options in chronic conditions involving connective tissue.–In addition, although traditionally seen as a better-tolerated analgesic option, there are safety concerns with the use of paracetamol, particularly at dosages > 3 g/day, for extended periods (eg, several years).–

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^113iZoie]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline — Recommendation 2a suggests that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries with oral NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve physical function, or with oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that oral NSAIDs reduced pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days after treatment and were associated with a greater likelihood of symptom relief, and there was also moderate-certainty evidence that acetaminophen reduced pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days; oral NSAIDs were associated with an increased risk for GI adverse events and oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen did not differ statistically. Clinicians should assess patients' risk factors (for GI and renal) and treatment preferences in choosing between NSAIDs and acetaminophen.

### A randomized, clinical trial comparing oral celecoxib 200 mg, celecoxib 400 mg, and ibuprofen 600 mg for acute pain [^117SYa3m]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Celecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor used to treat pain. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacies of celecoxib and ibuprofen for the treatment of acute pain. The null hypothesis was that no difference between celecoxib and ibuprofen exists.

Methods

The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. After consent, patients rated their pain on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and categorical intensity pain scale. Patients were then randomized to receive 200-mg or 400-mg celecoxib or 600-mg ibuprofen (all orally). Patients were contacted 5 hours after receiving study medication when a second VAS score was recorded, along with categorical pain intensity, pain relief score, side effects, and number of rescue medications taken. The main outcome measures were change in visual analog pain and categorical pain intensity scores, and pain relief scores, at five hours.

Results

One hundred ten patients were evaluated and 105 were enrolled. Thirty-four received celecoxib 200 mg, 32 received celecoxib 400 mg, and 39 received ibuprofen 600 mg. Ninety-one were available for the five-hour VAS and 88 for the five-hour categorical pain intensity and pain relief analysis: The two patients who were unable to read a VAS were excluded, and two enrolled patients withdrew prior to medication. One patient was excluded because his injury was a fracture, and therefore did not meet the inclusion criteria. There was no statistical difference among the treatment groups in age, time from injury to medication, initial VAS score, percent lost to follow-up, or treatment with adjunctive therapy. There was no statistical difference in change of VAS among the groups at five hours: ibuprofen 600 mg (-23.8 mm [95% CI = -31.56 mm to -16.1 mm] [n = 32]), celecoxib 200 mg (-16.1 mm [95% CI = -24.3 mm to -7.98 mm] [n = 31]), and celecoxib 400 mg (-12.4 mm [95% CI = -23.1 mm to -1.8 mm] [n = 30]) (p = 0.16). There was no significant difference between the groups, at five hours, in change of categorical pain intensity (p = 0.11) or pain relief scores (p = 0.059), though the pain relief scale approached significance favoring ibuprofen.

Conclusions

No significant difference exists among emergency department (ED) patients treated for acute pain, at five hours, with celecoxib 200 mg, celecoxib 400 mg, or ibuprofen 600 mg, though the power of the study to detect a change was low, 36%. However, the magnitude of pain relief for celecoxib, coupled with the cost of the medication, questions its use in the immediate ED setting.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^111o4mKT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 7.1% (35/493) of patients (DFN-15: 6.1% [15/244]; placebo 8.0% [20/249]). Study drug-related TEAEs occurred in 5.1% (25/493) of patients (DFN-15: 4.5% [11/244]; placebo 5.6% [14/249]); nausea (1% [5/493]) and dysgeusia (0.8% [4/493]) were most common. No serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to study drug termination were reported.

Conclusions

DFN-15 was superior to placebo for pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptom when patients treat a migraine attack of any baseline pain intensity. Rates of TEAEs did not differ between treatment groups.

PRECISION study — celecoxib versus ibuprofen and naproxen cardiovascular outcomes: The multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trial compared ibuprofen and naproxen with celecoxib in 24,081 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA) with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at high CVD risk, and it also monitored gastrointestinal (GI) and renal events. There were no statistical differences in the primary cardiovascular (CV) outcome measure between celecoxib and ibuprofen or naproxen, supporting noninferiority of moderate doses of celecoxib. Confidence in these findings was limited by drug discontinuation (68.8%), discontinued follow‑up (27.4%), and a lower average daily dose of celecoxib (209 mg) versus ibuprofen (2,045 mg) and naproxen (852 mg). As a result, CV risk or presence of known CVD should be considered when prescribing any NSAID or COX‑2 inhibitor and the use of any of these agents should be avoided in these patients if possible.

### Direct non-cyclooxygenase-2 targets of celecoxib and their potential relevance for cancer therapy [^112Ly6q7]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Celecoxib (Celebrex) was developed as a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor for the treatment of chronic pain. However, it now appears that this compound harbours additional pharmacologic activities that are entirely independent of its COX-2-inhibitory activity. This review presents the recently emerged direct non-COX-2 targets of celecoxib and their proposed role in mediating this drug's antitumour effects.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^111ZjBs5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

GI safety was investigated in the PRECISION trial, which had clinically significant GI events as a secondary outcome and iron-deficiency anemia of GI origin as a tertiary outcome.GI outcomes for the on-treatment population showed that among the three agents studied (celecoxib, naproxen, and ibuprofen), significantly fewer clinically significant GI events occurred in the celecoxib group. Similarly, there was a lower incidence of anemia in celecoxib recipients compared with those receiving ns-NSAIDs.

In the CONCERN study on arthritis patients with both high GI and high CV risk, the cumulative incidence of recurrent upper-GI-tract bleeding (the primary end point) was 5.6% in the celecoxib group compared with 12.3% in the naproxen group (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23–0.82; P = 0.01), and no treatment-related deaths occurred. On the basis of their findings, the authors suggested that naproxen be avoided in high-GI/high-CV-risk patients, "despite its perceived cardiovascular safety".

### Single dose oral celecoxib for acute postoperative pain in adults [^114zJxSL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a review published in The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003. Celecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Celecoxib is believed to be associated with fewer upper gastrointestinal adverse effects than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Its effectiveness in acute pain was demonstrated in the earlier review. Additional studies have now been published for the 400 mg dose, and this updated review provides more robust estimates of efficacy and harm.

Objectives

To assess analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of celecoxib for moderate to severe postoperative pain.

Search Strategy

Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Database. Most recent search: July 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults prescribed any dose of oral celecoxib or placebo for acute postoperative pain were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eight studies (1380 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Studies were assessed for quality and data extracted by two review authors. Summed pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) was converted into dichotomous information yielding the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours, and used to calculate the relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50% pain relief with celecoxib who would not have done so with placebo. Information on use of rescue medication was used to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean (WM) of the median time to use.

Main Results

The NNT for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg compared with placebo for at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours was 4.2 (CI 3.4 to 5.6) and 2.5 (2.2 to 2.9) respectively. The WM of the median time to use of rescue medication was 6.6 hours with celecoxib 200 mg, 8.4 with celecoxib 400 mg, and 2.3 hours with placebo. The WM proportion of participants requiring rescue medication over 24 hours was 74% with celecoxib 200 mg, 63% for celecoxib 400 mg, and 91% for placebo. The NNT to prevent one patient using rescue medication was 4.8 (3.5 to 7.7) and 3.5 (2.9 to 4.6) for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg respectively. One serious adverse event probably related to celecoxib was reported by the trialists.

Authors' Conclusions

Single dose oral celecoxib is an effective means of postoperative pain relief. The 400 mg dose has similar efficacy to ibuprofen 400 mg.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115UFoXf]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain — NSAID selection and safety — Most comparative trials between NSAIDs showed no significant differences in pain relief, and an SR comparing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) NSAIDs with traditional NSAIDs reported no statistically significant difference for pain relief for acute low back pain in four studies and no differences for chronic LBP in a fifth. A large noninferiority trial randomized 24,081 patients to celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen and found the cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with celecoxib was noninferior to the non-selective NSAIDs; limitations included drug discontinuation 68.8%, study dropout 27.4%, most patients 90% had OA, and a dose of celecoxib limited to 200 mg/day with dose escalation allowed for ibuprofen and naproxen. All NSAIDs have a black box warning for increased risk of CV and gastrointestinal (GI) events; if an NSAID is required in a patient with CV risk, naproxen may be a viable option; the use of relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors reduces the risk for GI events, but this benefit is negated if the patient is using aspirin; NSAIDs can also exacerbate heart failure and worsen hypertension and renal function and must be used cautiously or avoided in patients with renal impairment or in elderly patients.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^115vfRkF]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapy for acute sickle cell disease (SCD) pain — For adults and children presenting with acute pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests a short course (5 to 7 days) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to opioids for acute pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). NSAIDs are defined broadly to include selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and patient-specific assessment of harms should guide use and drug/class selection; patients at increased risk of renal toxicity should be identified, and if comorbidities confer significant risk, the mild potential benefit may not outweigh the risk. It is good practice to provide patient-centered education and surveillance related to NSAID toxicity, especially in patients with end-organ comorbidities, given limited long-term safety data and potential vascular, bleeding, and renal risks.

### Role of COX-2 inhibitors in the evolution of acute pain management [^111xCpVA]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

Management of acute postoperative pain remains suboptimal: nearly 80% of patients report moderate to extreme pain following surgery. New pain management paradigms incorporate multimodal analgesia, using a combination of analgesics throughout the perioperative period to control nociceptive and centrally-stimulated pain. Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a role in postoperative pain management, but concerns about increased bleeding and inhibited wound healing and bone fusion have limited their use. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) offer the peripheral pain-relieving benefits of nonselective NSAIDs but with fewer adverse GI effects; they also may have a role in central sensitization. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of celecoxib and rofecoxib for postoperative pain and for preemptive analgesia, and newer agents such as valdecoxib and etoricoxib also have demonstrated efficacy in these settings. In addition to their selectivity for the COX-2 isozyme overall, unique differences among the coxibs, such as in plasma half-life, may impart certain clinical advantages.

### Anti-inflammatory and upper gastrointestinal effects of celecoxib in rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized… [^11623xWD]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Context In vitro studies have shown that celecoxib inhibits cyclooxygenase 2 but not COX-1, suggesting that this drug may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity without adverse upper gastrointestinal tract effects that result from COX-1 inhibition. Objective To test whether celecoxib has efficacy as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic. GI tract endoscopy before and after treatment, compared among treatment groups. Results All dosages of celecoxib and naproxen significantly improved the signs and symptoms of arthritis compared with placebo. Maximal anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity was evident within 2 weeks of initiating treatment and was sustained throughout the 12 weeks. The incidence of endoscopically. twice per day, respectively; and 31% for naproxen.

Conclusion In this study, all dosages of celecoxib were efficacious in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and did not affect COX-1 activity in the GI tract mucosa as evidenced by less frequent incidence of endoscopic ulcers compared. COX-2–specific inhibitors are not expected to interfere with homeostatic prostanoid-dependent processes such as upper gastrointestinal tract mucosal protection and platelet aggregation. The potential clinical benefit of this strategy is important given that patients who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, 15. randomized trials have suggested that endoscopic ulcers are surrogate markers for NSAID-induced complications such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction. 27, 28 Celecoxib has been shown to inhibit COX-2 and spare COX-1 activity in vitro while possessing effective anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties when studied in vivo. 8, 18, 29–31.

### Celecoxib for osteoarthritis [^112yCzN1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and is caused by degeneration of the joint cartilage and growth of new bone, cartilage and connective tissue. It is often associated with major disability and impaired quality of life. There is currently no consensus on the best treatment to improve OA symptoms. Celecoxib is a selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits (pain, function, quality of life) and safety (withdrawals due to adverse effects, serious adverse effects, overall discontinuation rates) of celecoxib in osteoarthritis (OA).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers up to April 11, 2017, as well as reference and citation lists of included studies. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of published articles were contacted.

Selection Criteria

We included published studies (full reports in a peer reviewed journal) of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral celecoxib versus no intervention, placebo or another traditional NSAID (tNSAID) in participants with clinically- or radiologically-confirmed primary OA of the knee or hip, or both knee and hip.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed data extraction, quality assessment, and compared results. Main analyses for patient-reported outcomes of pain and physical function were conducted on studies with low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel.

Main Results

We included 36 trials that provided data for 17,206 adults: 9402 participants received celecoxib 200 mg/day, and 7804 were assigned to receive either tNSAIDs (N = 1869) or placebo (N = 5935). Celecoxib was compared with placebo (32 trials), naproxen (6 trials) and diclofenac (3 trials). Studies were published between 1999 and 2014. Studies included participants with knee, hip or both knee and hip OA; mean OA duration was 7.9 years. Most studies included predominantly white participants whose mean age was 62 (± 10) years; most participants were women. There were no concerns about risk of bias for performance and detection bias, but selection bias was poorly reported in most trials. Most trials had high attrition bias, and there was evidence of selective reporting in a third of the studies. Celecoxib versus placeboCompared with placebo celecoxib slightly reduced pain on a 500-point Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale, accounting for 3% absolute improvement (95% CI 2% to 5% improvement) or 12% relative improvement (95% CI 7% to 18% improvement) (4 studies, 1622 participants). This improvement may not be clinically significant (high quality evidence). Compared with placebo celecoxib slightly improved physical function on a 1700-point WOMAC scale, accounting for 4% absolute improvement (95% CI 2% to 6% improvement), 12% relative improvement (95% CI 5% to 19% improvement) (4 studies, 1622 participants). This improvement may not be clinically significant (high quality evidence). There was no evidence of an important difference for withdrawals due to adverse events (Peto OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.15) (moderate quality evidence due to study limitations). Results were inconclusive for numbers of participants experiencing any serious AEs (SAEs) (Peto OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.36), gastro-intestinal events (Peto OR 1.91, 95% CI 0.24 to 14.90) and cardiovascular events (Peto OR 3.40, 95% CI 0.73 to 15.88) (very low quality evidence due to serious imprecision and study limitations). However, regulatory agencies have warned of increased cardiovascular events for celecoxib. Celecoxib versus tNSAIDsThere were inconclusive results regarding the effect on pain between celecoxib and tNSAIDs on a 100-point visual analogue scale (VAS), showing 5% absolute improvement (95% CI 11% improvement to 2% worse), 11% relative improvement (95% CI 26% improvement to 4% worse) (2 studies, 1180 participants, moderate quality evidence due to publication bias). Compared to a tNSAID celecoxib slightly improved physical function on a 100-point WOMAC scale, showing 6% absolute improvement (95% CI 6% to 11% improvement) and 16% relative improvement (95% CI 2% to 30% improvement). This improvement may not be clinically significant (low quality evidence due to missing data and few participants) (1 study, 264 participants). Based on low or very low quality evidence (downgraded due to missing data, high risk of bias, few events and wide confidence intervals) results were inconclusive for withdrawals due to AEs (Peto OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.27), number of participants experiencing SAEs (Peto OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28), gastro-intestinal events (Peto OR 0.61, 0.15 to 2.43) and cardiovascular events (Peto OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.25). In comparisons of celecoxib and placebo there were no differences in pooled analyses between our main analysis with low risk of bias and all eligible studies. In comparisons of celecoxib and tNSAIDs, only one outcome showed a difference between studies at low risk of bias and all eligible studies: physical function (6% absolute improvement in low risk of bias, no difference in all eligible studies). No studies included in the main comparisons measured quality of life. Of 36 studies, 34 reported funding by drug manufacturers and in 34 studies one or more study authors were employees of the sponsor.

Authors' Conclusions

We are highly reserved about results due to pharmaceutical industry involvement and limited data. We were unable to obtain data from three studies, which included 15,539 participants, and classified as awaiting assessment. Current evidence indicates that celecoxib is slightly better than placebo and some tNSAIDs in reducing pain and improving physical function. We are uncertain if harms differ among celecoxib and placebo or tNSAIDs due to risk of bias, low quality evidence for many outcomes, and that some study authors and Pfizer declined to provide data from completed studies with large numbers of participants. To fill the evidence gap, we need to access existing data and new, independent clinical trials to investigate benefits and harms of celecoxib versus tNSAIDs for people with osteoarthritis, with longer follow-up and more direct head-to-head comparisons with other tNSAIDs.

Oral solution celecoxib — migraine (systematic review and RCTs): A systematic review of three RCTs (n = 682) comparing oral solution celecoxib to placebo found statistically significant improvement in pain freedom at 2 hours favoring celecoxib (RR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.28–2.12; p = 0.0001) and significant improvement in freedom from MBS versus placebo (RR 1.40; 95% CI: 1.12–1.76; p = 0.003). In episodic migraine with or without aura, one RCT (n = 567) demonstrated improvement in pain freedom at 2 hours, while one RCT (n = 984) did not demonstrate a benefit in pain freedom at 2 hours; however, these two RCTs demonstrated statistically significant improvement in freedom from MBS, headache pain relief at 2 hours, and freedom from photophobia and nausea at 2 hours. Low-quality evidence demonstrated no significant difference in treatment AEs, including nausea and dysgeusia.

### Single dose oral celecoxib for postoperative pain [^117G8RSR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Celecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The drug is believed to be associated with fewer adverse effects than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the effectiveness of celecoxib in the treatment of acute pain has not yet been assessed by systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of celecoxib for moderate to severe postoperative pain.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Library Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, Biological Abstracts, PubMed and the Oxford Pain database. Date of the most recent search: May 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults prescribed any dose of oral celecoxib or placebo for acute postoperative pain were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two trials (418 subjects) met the inclusion criteria for this review. The trials were assessed for quality and the data extracted by two independent reviewers. Summed pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) was extracted and converted into dichotomous information yielding the number of patients with at least 50% pain relief over 4–6 hours. These derived results were used to calculate the relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50% pain relief.

Main Results

The number-needed-to-treat for celecoxib 200 mg compared with placebo was 4.5 (CI 3.3 to 7.2). For every 4.5 patients experiencing moderate to severe acute pain treated with celecoxib 200 mg one more will experience at least 50% pain relief that would not have done had they received placebo. The median time to remedication over 24 hours was 5.1 hours with celecoxib 200 mg and 1.5 hours with placebo. Quantitative analysis of adverse effects was not possible but no serious or unexpected adverse effects were reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Single dose oral celecoxib is an effective means of postoperative pain relief, similar in efficacy to aspirin 600/650 mg, and paracetamol 1000 mg. The two trials included used celecoxib 200 mg, a dose 50% less than is recommended for acute pain. More trials are needed to estimate efficacy for recommended dose of 400 mg, and to reinforce current findings for 200 mg, and provide data for pooled quantitative estimates of adverse effects.

### Specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: what have we learned since they came into widespread clinical use? [^115DDHmb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 were introduced into widespread clinical use in 1999. Since that time, celecoxib and rofecoxib have become two of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. Clinical trials using these medications for arthritis and pain have uniformly demonstrated efficacy superior to that of placebo and similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, controversy surrounding the proper place of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in the hierarchy of treatment for arthritis continues, based primarily on their higher cost compared with that of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A decreased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity remains the primary justification for using the more expensive cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in preference to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The renal and cardiovascular effects of rofecoxib and celecoxib have been investigated in relation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to one another. The data with respect to alteration in renal function, lower extremity edema, and hypertension indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors affect the kidney in a manner similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data comparing the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is difficult to interpret because it is not clear that comparable doses have been used in clinical trials. The potential thrombogenic risk of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors remains controversial, and conflicting data exist. It remains important to increase our understanding of the place of these agents in clinical practice from the perspective of efficacy, toxicity, and cost.

14.4 Ankylosing Spondylitis

Celecoxib was evaluated in AS patients in two placebo- and active-controlled clinical trials of 6 and 12 weeks duration.

Celecoxib at doses of 100 mg twice daily, 200 mg once daily and 400 mg once daily was shown to be statistically superior to placebo in these studies for all three co-primary efficacy measures assessing global pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), global disease activity (Visual Analogue Scale) and functional impairment (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index). In the 12-week study, there was no difference in the extent of improvement between the 200 mg and 400 mg celecoxib doses in a comparison of mean change from baseline, but there was a greater percentage of patients who responded to celecoxib 400 mg, 53%, than to celecoxib 200 mg, 44%, using the Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis response criteria (ASAS 20). The ASAS 20 defines a responder as improvement from baseline of at least 20% and an absolute improvement of at least 10 mm, on a 0 to 100 mm scale, in at least three of the four following domains: patient global pain, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, and inflammation. The responder analysis also demonstrated no change in the responder rates beyond 6 weeks.

14.5 Analgesia, including Primary Dysmenorrhea

In acute analgesic models of post-oral surgery pain, post-orthopedic surgical pain, and primary dysmenorrhea, celecoxib relieved pain that was rated by patients as moderate to severe. Single doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] of celecoxib provided pain relief within 60 minutes.

### The burden of acute postoperative pain and the potential role of the COX-2-specific inhibitors [^116UNyBe]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Pain has been recognized as a problem of global proportions, and postoperative pain is one of the most common types of pain. Postoperative pain is acute and, although it is preventable and/or treatable, it is often undertreated. Lack of appropriate analgesic management has significant impact on clinical and economic outcomes. Negative clinical outcomes of inadequately managed acute postoperative pain include extended hospitalization, compromised prognosis, higher morbidity and mortality, and the development of a chronic pain state as a result of neuronal plasticity. Although estimating the economic burden of postoperative pain is difficult, this burden is considerable and results from direct costs due to excess health-care resource use, as well as indirect costs due to reduced patient functionality and productivity. These latter factors also have a significant adverse impact on patients' quality of life and may be associated with the development of depression and anxiety. Thus, improved clinical outcomes are dependent not only on the availability of effective drugs but also on their appropriate utilization. A multimodal approach incorporating different drugs and techniques is effective in reducing postoperative pain but is limited by the currently available therapies. The efficacy of opioids is well established, but there are concerns about dependency, respiratory depression and side-effects, which patients often find intolerable. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective as adjunctive medication in a multimodal regimen but are associated with side-effects, such as platelet dysfunction and renal and gastrointestinal toxicity, that have special clinical significance in patients undergoing surgical procedures. Cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors such as celecoxib, rofecoxib and valdecoxib, were developed to provide the efficacy of non-specific NSAIDs while limiting associated toxicity. These agents have demonstrated analgesic efficacy and an opioid-sparing effect in a variety of surgical procedures, suggesting their value as an alternative to non-specific NSAIDs. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of these drugs on clinical and economic outcomes when used in a programme of postsurgical pain management.

### Direct non-cyclooxygenase-2 targets of celecoxib and their potential relevance for cancer therapy [^115SR3oK]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Celecoxib (Celebrex®) was developed as a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor for the treatment of chronic pain. However, it now appears that this compound harbours additional pharmacologic activities that are entirely independent of its COX-2-inhibitory activity. This review presents the recently emerged direct non-COX-2 targets of celecoxib and their proposed role in mediating this drug's antitumour effects.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^1157H9ZV]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Comparative effectiveness of analgesics across systematic reviews for hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) — Stewart et al. (2018) reported relative reduction in pain from baseline of 34.3% for oral nonselective NSAIDs and 36.9% for COX-2 inhibitors, both statistically better than acetaminophen, which reduced pain by 32.5% (p < 0.001). Jung et al. (2018) (n = 44 studies) ranked etoricoxib highest for improving WOMAC pain, followed by naproxen, acetaminophen, and celecoxib; ibuprofen was not included in any of the studies, and rofecoxib, etoricoxib, and aceclofenac are not commercially available in the U.S. Puljak et al. (2017) found celecoxib was slightly superior to placebo and various alternative NSAIDs in improving pain and function.

### Celecoxib effectively treats patients with acute shoulder tendinitis / bursitis [^1121qah5]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Shoulder tendinitis and subacromial bursitis are acute, painful inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions that may recur as a result of overuse. We investigated the efficacy of celecoxib in managing patients with acute shoulder tendinitis/bursitis.

Methods

In this double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study, patients with acute onset shoulder tendinitis and/or subacromial bursitis were randomized to receive one of: celecoxib 400 mg followed by 200 mg bid, naproxen 500 mg bid, or placebo bid for 14 days. The primary measure of efficacy was the mean reduction in Maximum Pain Intensity at Rest, measured using a 100 mm visual analog scale, from baseline to Days 7 and 14.

Results

Of the 306 patients randomized to treatment, 254 completed the study. On Day 7, the mean reduction from baseline in Maximum Pain Intensity at Rest was significantly greater in the celecoxib group compared with the placebo group (-27.7 ± 2.75 mm vs -18.4 ± 2.63 mm, respectively; p < 0.05). Similarly, on Day 14, the mean reduction from baseline in Maximum Pain Intensity at Rest was greater in the celecoxib group compared with placebo (-35.0 ± 3.06 mm vs -25.0 ± 3.05 mm; p < 0.05). The mean reduction from baseline in Maximum Pain Intensity at Rest was also greater in the naproxen group compared with the placebo group at Day 7 (-26.4 ± 2.70 mm vs -18.4 ± 2.63 mm; p < 0.05), but not on Day 14. Secondary measures of efficacy also showed treatment with celecoxib to be significantly better than placebo treatment and similar to treatment with naproxen. In addition, celecoxib was well tolerated in these patients.

Conclusion

Celecoxib showed comparable efficacy to naproxen in relieving the pain of patients with acute shoulder tendinitis and/or subacromial bursitis.

### Use of nonopioid analgesics and adjunctive agents in the management of pain in rheumatic diseases [^115tLRLq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Antirheumatic analgesic medications generally fall into one of the following categories: acetaminophen, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tramadol, traditional opioids, or adjunctive analgesics. This article does not discuss corticosteroids, opioids, or topical analgesics. Acetaminophen, usually indicated early for mild pain, is often used in combination with other drugs. It has established safety. Traditional NSAIDs are effective in relieving moderate pain in certain inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions. There are many effective choices, but as a class it is fraught with the risk of serious peptic ulcer disease and its complications. Cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitors are NSAIDS that reduce the gastrointestinal risk and platelet-mediated bleeding. All NSAIDs may produce peripheral edema, hypertension, and potentiate warfarin. The evidence that coxibs cause thrombotic heart disease is weak. Tramadol is an alternative to musculoskeletal pain management, particularly in patients with moderate to moderately severe pain who do not respond to or who cannot tolerate acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or opioids. The role of analgesic adjuvants is discussed.

### Single dose oral celecoxib for acute postoperative pain in adults [^113TosGu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a review published in The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4. Celecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor usually prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Celecoxib is believed to be associated with fewer upper gastrointestinal adverse effects than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Its effectiveness in acute pain was demonstrated in the earlier reviews.

Objectives

To assess analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of celecoxib for moderate to severe postoperative pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was to 3 January 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of adults prescribed any dose of oral celecoxib or placebo for acute postoperative pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed studies for quality and extracted data. We converted summed pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) into dichotomous information, yielding the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours, and used this to calculate the relative benefit (RB) and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50% of maximum pain relief with celecoxib who would not have done so with placebo. We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use.

Main Results

Eight studies (1380 participants) met the inclusion criteria. We identified five potentially relevant unpublished studies in the most recent searches, but data were not available at this time. The number of included studies therefore remains unchanged. The NNT for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg compared with placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over four to six hours was 4.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4 to 5.6) and 2.5 (2.2 to 2.9) respectively. The median time to use of rescue medication was 6.6 hours with celecoxib 200 mg, 8.4 with celecoxib 400 mg, and 2.3 hours with placebo. The proportion of participants requiring rescue medication over 24 hours was 74% with celecoxib 200 mg, 63% for celecoxib 400 mg, and 91% for placebo. The NNT to prevent one patient using rescue medication was 4.8 (3.5 to 7.7) and 3.5 (2.9 to 4.6) for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg respectively. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and were experienced by a similar proportion of participants in celecoxib and placebo groups. One serious adverse event probably related to celecoxib was reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Single-dose oral celecoxib is an effective analgesic for postoperative pain relief. Indirect comparison suggests that the 400 mg dose has similar efficacy to ibuprofen 400 mg.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^114NhV5p]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Duration of pain

Duration of pain is a decisive factor guiding the choice of an appropriate analgesic regimen. However, duration of pain should always be correlated with the pain intensity.
Acute pain The primary pain management goal here is early intervention to reduce the pain to acceptable levels. Most of the acute pain is nociceptive and treatment for acute pain involves a combination of paracetamol, opioids and some topical agents. Mild somatic acute pain could be treated with paracetamol, NSAIDs, topical anesthetics and physical treatments such as ice, compression and so on. For acute visceral pain, NSAIDs, opioids, corticosteroids and agents modulating the central neuronal activity (TRPV1 antagonists) may be used, depending on the underlying comorbidity. For moderate-to-severe pain, a combination of opioids and nonopioids could offer optimal pain relief. In cases of pain from trauma or surgical procedures, systemic medication would have to be administered.
Chronic pain Management goals for chronic pain include reducing the suffering due to pain and the associated emotional distress, in addition to increasing the coping ability and psychosocial well-being of the patient, by targeting the hypersensitive nervous system. Multimodal therapy involving a combination of treatments is recommended for treatment of chronic cancer or noncancer pain. The treatment for CNCP could include nonopioids (paracetamol, NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors), opioids, analgesics, TCAs, corticosteroids, muscle relaxants, sedatives and anxiolytics.
Nociceptive pain Nociceptive pain is generally time limited as the pain resolves when the tissue damage heals, but it may also be persistent when associated with inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment for localized pain should be started with the use of topical or oral NSAIDs. Moderate-to-severe pain unresponsive to NSAIDs may be treated with opioids to manage symptoms and control inflammation. Additionally, corticosteroids and immune-modulating agents (biologics) can also be used to manage inflammation in arthritic pain.
Neuropathic pain Peripheral neuropathic pain manifests as stimulus-independent pain or stimulus-evoked pain (pain hypersensitivity triggered by a stimulus following damage to sensory neurons). Neuropathic pain may persist for months or years beyond the normal healing time of any damaged tissues. Evidence from randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and systematic reviews have confirmed the efficacy of TCAs (amitriptyline and nortriptyline), antiseizure medications (pregabalin, gabapentin and carbamazepine) and opioids in the treatment of various neuropathic conditions.–Evidence supports the use of opioids as second- or third-line therapies for neuropathic pain, particularly of peripheral origin (Table S1) (A). However, further confirmation from well-controlled studies is warranted to establish the efficacy of these agents in complex neuropathies.
Mild, moderate and severe pain Treatment recommendations are also dependent on the severity of pain. Acetaminophen and other mild NSAIDs such as aspirin are the preferred treatment for mild chronic pain and may be used to supplement other agents in treating mild-to-moderate pain. However, acetaminophen lacks anti-inflammatory effects, limiting its use in pain associated with inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. NSAIDs are recommended for periodic flare-ups of mild-to-moderate inflammatory or nonneuropathic pain. For management of persistent moderate-to-severe pain, opioid therapy is the most sought-after treatment. Opioids are considered effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain that is not responsive to initial therapies, but not in the treatment of inflammatory, mechanical or compressive pain. Certain strong opioids, however, do not necessarily improve functional or psychological status and should be administered under adequate supervision.–

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of celecoxib oral solution (ELYXYB) in acute treatment of episodic migraine with or without aura [^112Abjq5]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

Patients with migraine lack safe, effective, and rapid-acting oral therapies for acute treatment.
Celecoxib oral solution (ELYXYB) is a new liquid formulation of celecoxib, a COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a more rapid onset of action than available celecoxib capsule formulations.
Selective COX-2 NSAIDs have a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events compared to non-specific NSAIDs.
This phase 3 clinical trial aimed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of celecoxib oral solution in a single, moderate-to-severe migraine attack among 631 patients with migraine.
Two hours after treating the migraine, patients who used celecoxib had statistically significant higher rates of pain freedom (32.8%; P = 0.020) and freedom from their most bothersome migraine symptom (58.1%; P = 0.003) compared to patients treated with placebo (23.5% and 43.9%).
Adverse event rates were similar for both groups, and gastric adverse events were infrequent.
Celecoxib oral solution may provide an additional, convenient option for patients requiring migraine treatment.

### Efficacy and tolerability of celecoxib in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis: a randomized controlled trial [^114L9hbR]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of high-dose celecoxib in the treatment of moderate to extreme pain and inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis.

Methods

A multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial was done with patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with acute gouty monoarthritis or oligoarthritis (onset of pain ≤ 48 h before enrollment). Patients were treated for 8 days with 1 week followup and were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive celecoxib 50 mg bid, celecoxib 400 mg (followed by 200 mg later on Day 1 and then 200 mg bid for 7 days), celecoxib 800 mg (followed by 400 mg later on Day 1 and then 400 mg bid for 7 days), or indomethacin 50 mg tid.

Results

Of 443 patients screened, 402 were randomized and 400 received treatment. Baseline demographics were comparable among treatments. Patients receiving high-dose celecoxib (800/400 mg) experienced a significantly greater reduction in pain intensity on Day 2 compared with low-dose celecoxib 50 mg bid [least squares (LS) mean difference -0.46; p = 0.0014]. For high-dose celecoxib 800/400 mg, the change in pain scores from baseline to Day 2 was comparable with indomethacin 50 mg tid (LS mean difference 0.11; p = 0.4331). There were significant differences in adverse events when the combined celecoxib groups (29.5%) were compared with patients taking indomethacin (43.1%; p = 0.0116). There was no change in median serum creatinine levels for any treatment. There were more discontinuations due to adverse events (8.8% vs 3%; p = 0.0147) with indomethacin than with the combined celecoxib groups.

Conclusion

High-dose celecoxib (800/400 mg) was significantly more effective than low-dose celecoxib (50 mg bid) and comparable to indomethacin in the treatment of moderate to extreme pain in patients with acute gouty arthritis. Further, celecoxib was well tolerated.

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for acute and chronic pain [^116k5w8k]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use and impact on common rheumatic and arthritic conditions is critical to reconciling their appropriate use with their potentially serious adverse effects. NSAIDs have a profound impact on the treatment of connective tissue disorders because of their ability to address the underlying cause with specific benefits of decreasing stiffness and inflammation, and improving mobility. NSAID use is twice as common as opioid use, and inappropriate use of NSAIDs is widespread. NSAID use should be monitored and the impact understood to mitigate the risks. NSAID discontinuation should be evidence based and individualized to specific requirements.

2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals for the individual patient. These doses can be given without regard to timing of meals.

2.1 Osteoarthritis

For relief of the signs and symptoms of OA the recommended oral dose is 200 mg per day administered as a single dose or as 100 mg twice daily.

2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis

For relief of the signs and symptoms of RA the recommended oral dose is 100 to 200 mg twice daily

2.3 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis

For the relief of the signs and symptoms of JRA the recommended oral dose for pediatric patients (age 2 years and older) is based on weight. For patients > 10 kg to < 25 kg the recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily. For patients > 25 kg the recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily.

For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, the contents of a celecoxib capsule can be added to applesauce. The entire capsule contents are carefully emptied onto a level teaspoon of cool or room temperature applesauce and ingested immediately with water. The sprinkled capsule contents on applesauce are stable for up to 6 hours under refrigerated conditions (2 to 8° C/ 35 to 45° F).

2.4 Ankylosing Spondylitis

For the management of the signs and symptoms of AS, the recommended dose of celecoxib is 200 mg daily in single (once per day) or divided (twice per day) doses. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg daily may be worthwhile. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks on 400 mg daily, a response is not likely and consideration should be given to alternate treatment options.

2.5 Management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea

The recommended dose of celecoxib is 400 mg initially, followed by an additional 200 mg dose if needed on the first day. On subsequent days, the recommended dose is 200 mg twice daily as needed.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^114Yy75h]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen)

There is moderate to high certainty evidence of no effect over placebo for both acute and chronic low back pain. A systematic review of 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in Australian and Austrian cohorts of patients with low back pain found a mean difference in pain score of −0.5 (95% confidence interval −2.9 to 1.9). In trials of patients with low back pain, there was no increased risk of harms. However, in RCTs assessing people with osteoarthritis or low back pain, using paracetamol was more likely to cause abnormal liver function tests (though the clinical importance of the changes remains unknown).

Observational data and trials in broader populations using paracetamol for any reason (such as other pain, fever) at standard therapeutic doses show a dose-dependent increase in risk of harms (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal). Data informing these risk estimates are potentially confounded by not adjusting for concomitant use of non-steroidal ani-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and by including participants who were unsuitable for NSAIDs (with cardiac, gastrointestinal, and renal risk factors), who are prescribed paracetamol as an alternative. We observe in practice that paracetamol is typically safe when taken as directed in people without contraindications and is generally safer than anti-inflammatories.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)

NSAIDs include ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, and celecoxib. For acute low back pain, there is moderate certainty evidence of small benefit above placebo (mean difference in pain intensity −0.9 (95% CI −1.1 to −0.7) from six RCTs conducted in Norway, Belgium, France, Australia, and Germany)and a risk ratio of 2.5 (1.2 to 5.2) of gastrointestinal harms (28/702 participants taking NSAIDs compared with 9/465 in the placebo groups). For chronic low back pain, there is low certainty evidence of small average benefits (mean difference −0.7 (−1.1 to −0.3, from six RCTs conducted in Italy, UK, and US).

The available data from RCTs of chronic low back pain do not report increased risk of harm compared with placebo. However, RCTs and observational studies of populations taking NSAIDs for any reason (such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis) showed increased NSAID related adverse events (such as gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal) which escalate with increasing doses and long term use.

### Approaching acute pain in emergency settings; European Society for Emergency Medicine (EUSEM) guidelines-part 2: management and recommendations [^111VWKcy]. Internal and Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that COX-2 inhibitors are used only in a few countries across Europe for the management of acute pain, reflecting perhaps the limited evidence for their use in this setting. Recognize that celecoxib 200 or 400 mg has been suggested to be as effective as ibuprofen 600 mg
in patients with musculoskeletal pain, which suggests that its use is limited in preference to ibuprofen; and parecoxib has demonstrated comparable efficacy to ketoprofen in patients with renal colic
, and IV morphine in patients with abdominal pain.

### Need to develop new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations [^115QnTHV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the management of pain, primary care physicians are often the first to diagnose and treat acute or chronic painful conditions. This places them in an important intersection to manage pain, in which safe and effective therapeutic options are paramount for their patients. For decades, NSAIDs have been routinely prescribed for relief of mild to moderate acute and chronic pain. Yet, safety and tolerability concerns associated with the use of this class of drugs continue to be an issue for patients and clinicians.

Objective

The objective of this review was to discuss the unmet medical needs of patients in the management of pain and inflammation, review the dose-dependent safety data associated with use of NSAIDs, and discuss the need to develop new NSAID formulations to improve safety and tolerability while maintaining efficacy.

Methods

We performed literature searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases through December 2012 for articles in English that reported dose-dependent safety and tolerability data associated with use of NSAIDs.

Results

The risk of serious, dose-dependent adverse events involving the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and kidneys is associated with use of NSAIDs. On the basis of these findings, the US Food and Drug Administration has requested that the package insert for all NSAIDs be revised to include a boxed warning highlighting the potential increased risk of cardiovascular events and the risk of serious, and potentially life-threatening, gastrointestinal tract bleeding. While using lower dosages of a particular NSAID may be associated with lower rates of adverse events, maintaining the clinical efficacy of standard NSAID dosages remains a challenge.

Conclusions

There is a need to develop new and effective NSAID formulations to minimize the safety and tolerability concerns associated with currently available NSAIDs, yet maintain efficacy in management of inflammation and pain.

### Celecoxib for rheumatoid arthritis [^117BX8Hr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic auto-immune disorder that causes widespread and persistent inflammation of the synovial lining of joints and tendon sheaths. Presently, there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis and treatment focuses on managing symptoms such as pain, stiffness and mobility, with the aim of achieving stable remission and improving mobility. Celecoxib is a selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for treatment of people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of celecoxib in people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization trials portal) to May 18, 2017. We also searched the reference and citation lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral celecoxib (200 mg and 400 mg daily) versus no intervention, placebo or a traditional NSAID (tNSAID) in people with confirmed rheumatoid arthritis, of any age and either sex. We excluded studies with fewer than 50 participants in each arm or had durations of fewer than four weeks treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs with durations of 4 to 24 weeks, published between 1998 and 2014 that involved a total of 3988 adults (mean age = 54 years), most of whom were women (73%). Participants had rheumatoid arthritis for an average of 9.2 years. All studies were assessed at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, evidence was assessed as moderate-to-low quality. Five studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Celecoxib versus placeboWe included two studies (N = 873) in which participants received 200 mg daily or 400 mg daily or placebo. Participants who received celecoxib showed significant clinical improvement compared with those receiving placebo (15% absolute improvement; 95% CI 7% to 25%; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.86; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 7, 95% CI 5 to 13; 2 studies, 873 participants; moderate to low quality evidence). Participants who received celecoxib reported less pain than placebo-treated people (11% absolute improvement; 95% CI 8% to 14%; NNTB = 4, 95% CI 3 to 6; 1 study, 706 participants) but results were inconclusive for improvement in physical function (MD -0.10, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.10; 1 study, 706 participants). In the celecoxib group, 15/293 participants developed ulcers, compared with 4/99 in the placebo group (Peto OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.63; 1 study, 392 participants; low quality evidence). Nine (of 475) participants in the celecoxib group developed short-term serious adverse events, compared with five (of 231) in the placebo group (Peto OR 0.87 (0.28 to 2.69; 1 study, 706 participants; low quality evidence). There were fewer withdrawals among people who received celecoxib (163/475) compared with placebo (130/231) (22% absolute change; 95% CI 16% to 27%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.72; 1 study, 706 participants). Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke) were not reported. However, regulatory agencies warn of increased cardiovascular event risk associated with celecoxib. Celecoxib versus tNSAIDsSeven studies (N = 2930) compared celecoxib and tNSAIDs (amtolmetin guacyl, diclofenac, ibuprofen, meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, pelubiprofen); one study included comparisons of both placebo and tNSAIDs (N = 1149). There was a small improvement, which may not be clinically significant, in numbers of participants achieving ACR20 criteria response in the celecoxib group compared to tNSAIDs (4% absolute improvement; 95% CI 0% less improvement to 8% more improvement; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; 4 studies, 1981 participants). There was a lack of evidence of difference between participants in the celecoxib and tNSAID groups in terms of pain or physical function. Results were assessed at moderate-to-low quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency). People who received celecoxib had a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers ≥ 3 mm (34/870) compared with those who received tNSAIDs (116/698). This corresponded to 12% absolute change (95% CI 11% to 13%; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.32; 5 studies, 1568 participants; moderate quality evidence). There were 7% fewer withdrawals among people who received celecoxib (95% CI 4% to 9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86; 6 studies, 2639 participants). Results were inconclusive for short-term serious adverse events and cardiovascular events (low quality evidence). There were 17/918 serious adverse events in people taking celecoxib compared to 42/1236 among people who received placebo (Peto OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.28; 5 studies, 2154 participants). Cardiovascular events were reported in both celecoxib and placebo groups in one study (149 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Celecoxib may improve clinical symptoms, alleviate pain and contribute to little or no difference in physical function compared with placebo. Celecoxib was associated with fewer numbers of participant withdrawals. Results for incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (≥ 3 mm) and short-term serious adverse events were uncertain; however, there were few reported events for either. Celecoxib may slightly improve clinical symptoms compared with tNSAIDs. Results for reduced pain and improved physical function were uncertain. Particpants taking celecoxib had lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers (≥ 3 mm) and there were fewer withdrawals from trials. Results for cardiovascular events and short-term serious adverse events were also uncertain. Uncertainty about the rate of cardiovascular events between celecoxib and tNSAIDs could be due to risk of bias; another factor is that these were small, short-term trials. It has been reported previously that both celecoxib and tNSAIDs increase cardiovascular event rates. Our confidence in results about harms is therefore low. Larger head-to-head clinical trials comparing celecoxib to other tNSAIDs is needed to better inform clinical practice.

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that data for using NSAIDs in patients with musculoskeletal injury is confusing, and evidence is equivocal; the efficacy of NSAIDs in patients with musculoskeletal pain has been suggested to be no better than other oral analgesics such as acetaminophen.
