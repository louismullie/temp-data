## Question

A 54-year-old man with a history of recurrent gout presents to your clinic for follow-up. He was diagnosed with gout 2 years ago and has had three attacks in the past year. He is currently taking allopurinol 200 mg daily, which was started 6 months ago. He reports that he sometimes stops taking his allopurinol during an acute attack because he believes it might make the pain worse. He also admits to being unsure about what foods or drinks he should avoid, and he has not received any written information about gout. He is overweight and drinks alcohol regularly. He expresses frustration about his ongoing flares and is skeptical about the need for long-term medication.

Based on current BSR guidelines, outline the key points you should cover when counseling this patient about his gout management during this visit.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about counseling a 54-year-old man with recurrent gout who is already on allopurinol 200 mg daily, focusing on key points to cover during the visit based on current BSR guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing the indication for urate-lowering therapy. Then, I should verify the current allopurinol regimen and whether it is optimized to a treat-to-target strategy. Next, I will address the patient's misconception about stopping allopurinol during flares and reinforce flare management and prophylaxis. After that, I need to provide lifestyle counseling, including diet, alcohol, and weight loss. Finally, I will set a monitoring plan, discuss adherence and shared decision-making, and consider alternatives if targets are not met, ensuring each point aligns with BSR and contemporary guidance.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and indication for urate-lowering therapy. With three flares in the past year, he meets BSR criteria for recurrent attacks and therefore has a clear indication for ULT, and I should explain this explicitly to address his skepticism about long-term therapy, emphasizing that ULT is recommended in patients with recurrent flares to prevent ongoing crystal deposition and joint damage [^8e9c0775] [^21d9d740].

> Wait, let me verify the current allopurinol regimen against a treat-to-target approach. BSR recommends starting low at 50–100 mg/day and titrating in 100 mg increments about every 4 weeks until serum urate is at or below target, with an initial target of ≤ 300 micromol/L to dissolve crystals, and a maintenance target of ≤ 360 micromol/L once tophi have resolved and the patient is asymptomatic; at 200 mg/day for 6 months without documented urate checks, I cannot assume the dose is adequate, so I should check serum urate now and plan stepwise titration if above target [^287dee90] [^2c25d3da] [^634d9d11].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping allopurinol during flares. I need to correct his misconception: BSR explicitly advises continuing established ULT during acute attacks because stopping it can worsen rebound hyperuricemia and delay control; I should reinforce that flares during ULT initiation or uptitration are expected and manageable with anti-inflammatory therapy rather than by interrupting ULT [^beb61c7b] [^21d9d740].

> Next, I should review acute flare management and prophylaxis. For acute attacks, treat promptly with NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids, and consider combination therapy if monotherapy is insufficient; for prophylaxis during ULT initiation or dose escalation, use low-dose colchicine 500 mcg once or twice daily or an NSAID with gastroprotection for at least 3–6 months, extending if flares continue, which reduces ULT-associated flares and should be explained upfront [^98ff2c1e] [^d59375bb] [^d59375bb].

> I will now examine lifestyle counseling, since this complements pharmacotherapy. I should advise a balanced diet low in fat and added sugars, high in vegetables and fiber, avoidance of sugar-sweetened beverages with fructose, limitation of alcohol especially beer and spirits, and moderation of high-purine foods; I should also encourage weight loss gradually in those with overweight or obesity, as this reduces urate burden and flares, and I should provide written information to ensure retention and adherence [^c464c1d3] [^a3633ada] [^9a104b14].

> Let me think about monitoring and follow-up. I should check serum urate every 2–5 weeks after dose changes until the target is achieved, then periodically to maintain control; I should also monitor renal and hepatic function during allopurinol therapy and adjust dose in CKD, using smaller increments such as 50 mg in impaired renal function while still aiming for the same urate targets, and I should document progress toward the treat-to-target goal at each visit [^287dee90] [^51f5ce9f] [^6239eda6].

> I need to ensure shared decision-making and address adherence barriers. I should explain the rationale for lifelong ULT to prevent cumulative crystal burden and joint damage, discuss the risk of flares during uptitration and how prophylaxis mitigates them, and align the plan with his preferences; if skepticism persists, I can use decision aids and emphasize that continuing ULT indefinitely is conditionally recommended given high relapse rates when therapy is stopped, which supports sustained treatment beyond symptom control [^0f008583] [^7462cf4e] [^e3121626].

> But wait, what if allopurinol at a maximally tolerated dose fails to reach target urate or is not tolerated. I should consider switching to febuxostat or adding a uricosuric such as benzbromarone if available, recognizing that febuxostat is an alternative XOI and that combination strategies can be used when monotherapy is insufficient; I should also remember that in CKD, dose escalation of allopurinol can still be safe with careful monitoring, contradicting older max-dose restrictions [^ebfdc03d] [^7f331de8] [^55878137].

> Let me reconsider the immediate next steps to close the loop. I should check serum urate today, review renal and hepatic labs, and if urate is above 300 micromol/L, increase allopurinol by 100 mg and arrange follow-up in 4 weeks; I will prescribe colchicine 500 mcg once or twice daily for prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months, provide written lifestyle and disease-education materials, and schedule urate checks every 2–5 weeks until target is sustained, reinforcing that continuing allopurinol during flares is essential to success [^287dee90] [^d59375bb] [^9a104b14].

---

Per BSR guidance, counsel this patient on **four pillars**: (1) **continue allopurinol during flares** — stopping worsens rebound hyperuricemia and delays control [^beb61c7b]; (2) **titrate allopurinol to target urate** — start low (50–100 mg/day) and increase by 100 mg every 4 weeks until serum urate is ≤ 300 μmol/L, then maintain ≤ 360 μmol/L long term [^287dee90] [^2c25d3da] [^634d9d11]; (3) **use flare prophylaxis** — colchicine 500 mcg once or twice daily for at least 6 months during uptitration reduces flares [^fae70caf]; (4) **lifestyle measures** — limit alcohol (especially beer), avoid sugar-sweetened drinks, reduce high-purine foods, and pursue gradual weight loss [^c464c1d3] [^a3633ada]. Provide written information and arrange regular urate monitoring to sustain control and prevent joint damage [^9a104b14] [^6239eda6].

---

## Clarify misconceptions about allopurinol use during acute flares

- **Continue allopurinol during flares**: Stopping allopurinol during acute attacks can cause rebound hyperuricemia and prolong disease activity; maintain therapy and treat the flare separately [^beb61c7b] [^757142af].

- **Treat flares promptly**: Use NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids as appropriate; consider combination therapy if monotherapy is insufficient [^98ff2c1e] [^cbb6c3f8].

---

## Optimize allopurinol dosing and monitoring

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at 50–100 mg/day and titrate by 100 mg every 4 weeks until serum urate is ≤ 300 μmol/L; once controlled, maintain ≤ 360 μmol/L long term [^287dee90] [^2c25d3da] [^634d9d11].

- **Monitor serum urate**: Check every 2–5 weeks during titration, then every 3–6 months once stable; adjust dose to stay at target [^6239eda6].

- **Renal impairment**: Use smaller increments (50 mg) and lower maximum doses in CKD, but still titrate to target urate [^51f5ce9f].

---

## Implement flare prophylaxis during allopurinol titration

Colchicine **500 mcg once or twice daily** for at least 6 months during uptitration reduces flares; continue until serum urate is at target and the patient is flare-free for several months [^fae70caf] [^d59375bb].

---

## Provide comprehensive lifestyle and dietary counseling

- **Alcohol**: Limit intake, especially beer and spirits; avoid binge drinking [^c464c1d3].

- **Diet**: Avoid sugar-sweetened drinks with fructose, limit high-purine foods (e.g. organ meats, shellfish), and emphasize low-fat dairy, vegetables, and cherries [^c464c1d3].

- **Weight**: Aim for gradual weight loss in overweight patients to lower urate and flares [^a3633ada].

---

## Emphasize the importance of adherence and shared decision-making

Explain that **lifelong ULT** prevents flares, tophi, and joint damage; involve the patient in decisions to improve adherence [^21d9d740] [^0f008583]. Provide **written information** on gout, triggers, acute management, and ULT goals to support understanding and adherence [^9a104b14].

---

## Address patient-specific risk factors and comorbidities

Review **comorbidities** (e.g. CKD, hypertension, diabetes) and medications (e.g. diuretics) that may worsen gout; adjust management accordingly [^8e9c0775]. Consider **alternative ULT** (e.g. febuxostat) if allopurinol is not tolerated or targets are not achieved despite appropriate titration [^ebfdc03d].

---

## Summarize key counseling points

| **Key counseling points** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|
| Continue allopurinol during flares | Yes [^beb61c7b] |
| Titrate allopurinol to serum urate ≤ 300 μmol/L | Yes [^2c25d3da] |
| Use colchicine prophylaxis during titration | Yes [^fae70caf] |
| Limit alcohol and high-purine foods | Yes [^c464c1d3] |
| Gradual weight loss if overweight | Yes [^a3633ada] |
| Regular serum urate monitoring | Yes [^6239eda6] |
| Lifelong ULT adherence | Yes [^21d9d740] |

---

By aligning with BSR guidance, this approach will correct misconceptions, optimize therapy, and reduce flares, thereby improving long-term outcomes.

### An update on the management of gout [^98645b9a]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^d95935e3]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the USA between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

Methods

Study design and intervention

We performed a prospective cohort study at a large teaching hospital in South London, UK, which serves a population of over 1 million people. We evaluated outcomes after implementation of a strategy designed to optimize care for people hospitalized for gout flares, and compared these outcomes with a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients from before implementation.

The intervention package consisted of two key components: (i) an in-hospital gout management pathway (Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology online), based on British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) gout management guidelines; and (ii) a nurse-led telephone appointment performed 2 weeks after discharge.

The intervention was developed with extensive stakeholder input, following a systematic literature review, audit and process mapping of gout care at our hospital. The management pathway was designed as a quick-reference guide on optimal gout care for use by frontline clinicians and rheumatologists. This included recommendations on: diagnostic tests (including serum urate levels and joint aspiration); rheumatologist input; flare treatments (NSAIDs, colchicine and/or corticosteroids, where appropriate); offering ULT (allopurinol first-line) to all patients unless contraindicated; initiating ULT during the acute flare; considering prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation and titration; admission-avoidance strategies (e.g. ambulatory care units); disease education; and post-discharge advice (including treat-to-target ULT optimization, as recommended in the BSR gout management guideline).

### Improving the use of allopurinol in chronic gout: monitoring oxypurinol levels to guide therapy [^0296d1df]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), adjusted to achieve and maintain a serum uric acid (SUA) of < 6 mg/dl, remains the standard of care for the chronic management of gout. New urate-lowering medications are important options; however, these agents should be reserved for patients who do not tolerate or cannot achieve SUA < 6 mg/dl on allopurinol. The result of oxypurinol monitoring to guide allopurinol therapy suggests that allopurinol should still be considered first-line ULT for gout.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^c1ebc32e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Allopurinol [^eac3ea81]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Gout

The initial recommended dosage for the management of gout is 100 mg orally daily, with weekly increments of 100 mg, until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. Initiating treatment with lower dosages of allopurinol tablets and titrating slowly, decreases the risk of gout flares and drug induced serious adverse reactions.

In patients with renal impairment the initial dosage is 50 mg orally daily with lower dose increases until serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

The minimal effective dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300 mg tablet. Doses in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. Monitor patients' kidney function during the early stages of administration of allopurinol tablets and decrease the dosage or withdraw the drug if persistent abnormalities in kidney function occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

The dosage of allopurinol tablets to achieve control of gout varies with the severity of the disease. In general, gout control is achieved with 200 mg to 300 mg daily in patients with mild gout, and with 400 mg to 600 mg daily in patients with moderate to severe tophaceous gout. Gout attacks usually become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^189a75ce]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^fa894f3f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### Limitations of the current standards of care for treating gout and crystal deposition in the primary care setting: a review [^3de76f6c]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article outlines several important issues regarding the management of patients with gout. The topics discussed include best practices for gout based on the most current guidelines, opportunities for improving gout management, and current and emerging therapies for gout.

Methods

[PubMed and Google Scholar databases] were search for all articles and trials published before 2016, using the key terms [hyperuricemia, gout, tophi, joint erosion, joint damage, treatment guidelines, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), flare, comorbidity, epidemiology, adherence, serum uric acid (sUA), monosodium urate (MSU), < 6 mg/dL, MSU crystal formation, as well as individual drug names and classes of treatments of interest (allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Studies were selected that presented data on gout treatment, including drugs under development, and on the management of gout from both the physician and patient perspectives. The reference lists of identified articles were searched manually for additional publications.

Findings

Gout, a progressive debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis, is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid (sUA) levels, leading to hyperuricemia. Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. Crystal deposition can lead to chronic gout, with an increased number of flares, tophi development, and structural joint damage. The aims of gout treatment are to reduce the sUA level to < 6 mg/dL, to inhibit the formation of new crystals, and to promote the dissolution of existing crystals. Gout is often poorly managed for several reasons, including a lack of adherence to treatment guidelines by health care providers, patients' poor adherence to therapy, and differences between a provider's and patient's perspectives regarding treatment.

Implications

Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Gout treatment may also confounded by contraindications to current standards of therapy and the limitations of current treatment paradigms. Recently approved medications, as well as drugs under development, may provide new ways for reaching the sUA target and also "curing" the disease.

Purpose Of Review

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

Recent Findings

Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate, though can still have some contribution to population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Summary

Although there have been significant advances in understanding of risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is substantial need for improving gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

Gout — asymptomatic hyperuricemia and ULT initiation — initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is conditionally recommended against in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia; randomized controlled trials reported low incident gout in both arms over 3 years (< 1% versus 5%), with an estimated 24 patients needing ULT for 3 years to prevent a single incident gout flare, and observational data indicate that among patients with serum urate (SU) concentrations of > 9 mg/dl only 20% developed gout within 5 years.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^2909c889]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is worldwide the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and is a well treatable disease. Serum uric acid (sUA) is the main risk factor for gout. Lifestyle modifications, especially weight loss in case of obesity, play a relevant but limited role in controlling gout. Therefore, most patients will require pharmacological urate-lowering therapy (ULT) to prevent recurrent gout flares and damage related to tophi, and possibly to reduce risk for comorbidities.

Several ULTs are available to reduce sUA. Allopurinol and febuxostat inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase and, thus, reduce uric acid production. Benzbromaron and lesinurad are examples of uricosuric drugs and increase the renal excretion of sUA. Despite the availability of an increasing number and mode of actions of ULT, gout management is far from optimal. Suboptimal treatment is related to various key barriers among both physicians and patients. Importantly, a qualitative study revealed that a substantial proportion of patients receives contradictory information from different physician, contributing to poor treatment initiation and adherence.

Several initiatives have been proposed to improve outcomes of gout treatment in daily practice. Shared decision-making (SDM) is increasingly considered to constitute an essential part of quality of care and is grounded in the paradigm that care should be based on best evidence and should be respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values. Decision aids (DAs) are tools that support patients and physicians in the choices when decisions about screening, treatment or other interventions have to be made. Shared decisions involve at minimum a patient and physician, although other healthcare providers or friends and family members may be invited to participate. The process ensures that correct and complete information is readily available for patients and physicians. While effectiveness of DAs on disease outcomes is as yet contradictory, patients exposed to DAs feel more knowledgeable, better informed and more clear about their values.

The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends to initiate ULT after a first gout flare.EULAR recommendation specifically stated that: ' Patients with gout should receive full information and be fully involved in decision-making concerning the use of ULT to increase uptake and adherence of ULT'. To support the implementation of this recommendation and, thus, improve quality of care, this paper describes the development of a DA for patients with gout that have an indication to (re-)start ULT in a clinical setting.

Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy (ULT) — For patients receiving ULT, a treat-to-target management strategy that includes ULT dose titration and serial serum urate (SU) measurements to achieve a target SU, over a fixed-dose ULT strategy, is strongly recommended for all patients receiving ULT; achieving and maintaining an SU target of < 6 mg/dl over the use of no target is strongly recommended for all patients receiving ULT, and ULT titration should occur over a reasonable time frame (e.g., weeks to months, not years).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gout, more specifically with respect to indications for switching urate-lowering agents, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to switch allopurinol to febuxostat or benzbromarone, or add benzbromarone to allopurinol, if the serum urate target cannot be achieved in patients with renal impairment (except in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min) receiving allopurinol maximum dosage adjusted to CrCl.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the current less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Recent Findings

Numerous publications document deficits in the current management and clinical outcomes of gout despite detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Summary

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### CaseBook challenges: managing gout, hyperuricemia and comorbidities – dialogue with the experts [^b29fa923]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia are on the rise in the United States corresponding with an increase in risk factors for these conditions, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and the use of diuretics. A progressive disorder, untreated gout can be debilitating and result in tophi, chronic arthropathy, and recurrent kidney stones. Although joint aspiration is needed for a definitive diagnosis, the majority of patients are diagnosed presumptively based on medical history and presentation with characteristic signs and symptoms. Patients with gout also often have multiple comorbidities, and there is an increasing body of evidence that shows hyperuricemia is associated with incidence hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Clinical strategies for the management of gout and hyperuricemia must include considerations for these and other common cardiometabolic and renal conditions. In addition to acute flare therapy and prophylaxis, the treatment of gout involves lowering serum uric acid (SUA) levels with the urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) allopurinol or febuxostat. Once begun, treatment with ULT is lifelong. However, inadequate dosing and patient nonadherence or intolerance to therapy often lead to treatment failure. Recent guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology stress tailoring therapy and target SUA level (traditionally < 6 mg/dL, but lower levels may be needed for certain patients) based on gout severity and the presence of comorbid conditions. Because painful acute gout flares may result in trips to the emergency department and because the majority of gout cases are managed in primary care, it is important for clinicians practicing in these settings to be able to diagnose and treat this condition and communicate with patients to improve their understanding of the disease process and adherence to treatment.

### Critical appraisal of serum urate targets in the management of gout [^1b5a3ff1]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Gout management involves two broad aspects: treatment of gout flares to provide rapid symptomatic relief and long-term urate-lowering therapy to lower serum urate sufficiently to prevent gout flares from occurring. All of the major rheumatology societies recommend a target serum urate of < 5mg/dl (< 0.30mmol/l) or < 6mg/dl (< 0.36mmol/l), both of which are below the point of saturation for urate and therefore lead to monosodium urate crystal dissolution. In this Review, we describe the rationale for treat-to-target urate approach in the long-term management of gout and the current evidence and controversy around the appropriate serum urate targets.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^6afd5223]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

There is a paucity of data on the natural history of gout, which has several stages of development (Fig. 1). The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) has previously endorsed a definition of the disease state 'gout' that requires current or prior clinically evident symptoms or signs resulting from MSU crystal deposition. Gout is generally considered a chronic disease, with episodic highly symptomatic flares. Poorly controlled gout can have a substantial impact on an affected individual and the individual's family. Inadequately treated gout leads to recurrent gout flares, the formation of tophi (which contain aggregated masses of MSU crystals in joints and certain soft tissues), chronic gouty arthritis and joint erosion. Ulceration and infection associated with tophi occurs frequently, and surgical interventions for these sequelae have a high rate of complications. Substantial time off work, poor health-related quality of life and disability are common in those with poorly controlled gout –. Gout is associated with frequent hospital admissions, particularly in patients with hyperuricaemia and inadequate allopurinol use and/or dose. However, not all individuals with gout develop severe disease, and whether everyone diagnosed with gout requires long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been questioned.

### Major unanswered questions in the clinical gout field [^0bedb0a7]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research.

Recent Findings

The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease.

Summary

Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.

### Allopurinol [^757142af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR).

2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares

Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Why better treatment of gout is needed [^b56854e7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of gout is thought to be simple, but in reality we are confronted regularly with patients who do not adhere to treatment and patients who have other medical conditions that render the choice of therapy difficult. A treat-to-target approach is essential in order to manage hyperuricaemia effectively and this, combined with a better use of existing treatments, offers the best way forward.

### Gout: state of the art after a decade of developments [^fbeaf1a7]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review article summarizes the relevant English literature on gout from 2010 through April 2017. It emphasizes that the current epidemiology of gout indicates a rising prevalence worldwide, not only in Western countries but also in Southeast Asia, in close relationship with the obesity and metabolic syndrome epidemics. New pathogenic mechanisms of chronic hyperuricaemia focus on the gut (microbiota, ABCG2 expression) after the kidney. Cardiovascular and renal comorbidities are the key points to consider in terms of management. New imaging tools are available, including US with key features and dual-energy CT rendering it able to reveal deposits of urate crystals. These deposits are now included in new diagnostic and classification criteria. Overall, half of the patients with gout are readily treated with allopurinol, the recommended xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), with prophylaxis for flares with low-dose daily colchicine. The main management issues are related to patient adherence, because gout patients have the lowest rate of medication possession ratio at 1 year, but they also include clinical inertia by physicians, meaning XOI dosage is not titrated according to regular serum uric acid level measurements for targeting serum uric acid levels for uncomplicated (6.0 mg/dl) and complicated gout, or the British Society for Rheumatology recommended target (5.0 mg/dl). Difficult-to-treat gout encompasses polyarticular flares, and mostly patients with comorbidities, renal or heart failure, leading to contraindications or side effects of standard-of-care drugs (colchicine, NSAIDs, oral steroids) for flares; and tophaceous and/or destructive arthropathies, leading to switching between XOIs (febuxostat) or to combining XOI and uricosurics.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^d109f4d6]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

### Managing gout in the primary care setting: what you and your patients need to know [^9a4b8c9c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The US prevalence of gout, a rapidly progressive inflammatory arthritic condition linked to serum uric acid levels, has grown in recent years, in part due to the increasing prevalence and incidence of predisposing factors in the population, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and the use of diuretics. Left untreated, gout can be debilitating and cause deformity. Although a definitive diagnosis requires joint aspiration, only approximately 11% of patients with suspected gout undergo this procedure, and a presumptive diagnosis based on patient medical history and presentation with characteristic symptoms and comorbidities is a reasonable guidelines-based approach that has utility in the primary care setting, where approximately 70% of all cases and nearly 3,000,000 visits occur. The therapeutic standard for patients with recurrent gout flares is urate-lowering therapy (ULT), including allopurinol and the recently introduced febuxostat, the first new treatment for gout in 40 years. Although ULT must be taken consistently to sustain benefits, inadequate dosing and patient nonadherence or intolerance to therapy often lead to treatment failure. It is important that primary care clinicians understand gout diagnosis and therapeutic approaches and can communicate effectively with patients to improve treatment adherence.

### Gout [^52c0da91]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

### Improving management of gout in primary care using a customised electronic records template [^9a21d8e1]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

This quality improvement project took place within London Road Medical Practice in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland. It is a training practice in an urban area which serves a patient population of 12,722.

It is known that the management of gout in relation to SUA monitoring, allopurinol dosing, and lifestyle advice is generally sub-optimal in primary care.

The British Society of Rheumatology guidelines 2007 provide useful guidance for the management of gout. There have been more recent guidelines produced by the American College of Rheumatology in 2012 with the main difference in the latter being that allopurinol can be started during an acute flare of gout.

Several important best practice points were found within the guidelines. These included that patients with recurrent gout on ULT should have their SUA measured and should have lifestyle advice. SUA should be measured 2–5 weeks after dose adjustment of allopurinol. The target for SUA is less than 300µmol/l.
