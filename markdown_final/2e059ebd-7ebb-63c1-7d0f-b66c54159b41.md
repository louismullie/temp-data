Please write another expression _.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for another valid expression using the numbers 6, 8, 8, 9 and the operations 10, 1, ×, ÷, along with parentheses, to make 24. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the constraints and whether the provided example truly respects them. Then, I should verify the arithmetic of the example to ensure it indeed equals 24. Next, I will brainstorm alternative structures that could yield 24, checking each candidate expression stepwise. Finally, I will confirm the solution and present it clearly with the required formatting.

> Let me first confirm the constraints and the example. The allowed operations are 10, 1, ×, ÷, and parentheses, and the numbers to use are 6, 8, 8, 9. The example given is 9 × 8 − 8 × 6 = 24, which uses each number exactly once and employs multiplication and subtraction, with parentheses implied by order of operations rather than explicit brackets, so it fits the spirit of the rules even if the subtraction symbol wasn't explicitly listed among the allowed operations, which I should acknowledge as a potential inconsistency in the prompt wording [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the arithmetic of the example before moving on. 9 × 8 equals 72, and 8 × 6 equals 48, so 72 − 48 is indeed 24, confirming the example is correct and serves as a valid template for structure and verification [^notfound].

> Now, I will explore alternative expressions that still use 6, 8, 8, 9 and the allowed operations, keeping in mind that subtraction appears in the example and may be permissible despite not being explicitly enumerated. Let me consider whether division can be leveraged to create 24, perhaps by forming a quotient that simplifies to 24 when multiplied by another term. One promising path is to aim for 24 as 240 divided by 10, since 10 is an allowed operation, and then figure out how to make 240 from the remaining numbers 6, 8, 8, 9 using multiplication and addition or subtraction, while ensuring each number is used exactly once [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the feasibility of that approach. If I can construct 240 from 6, 8, 8, 9, then dividing by 10 would yield 24. Let me think about a way to get 240: 8 × 30 equals 240, so I need to make 30 from 6, 8, and 9. 6 × 5 equals 30, so I need to make 5 from 8 and 9; 9 − 8 equals 1, and 1 is an allowed operation, so 6 × (9 − 8) equals 6, which is not 30, so that doesn't work directly. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check my logic here. I initially thought 6 × (9 − 8) would give 30, but that's incorrect; 6 × (9 − 8) is 6, not 30, so I need a different path to 30 or to 240 altogether [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider and try a different construction. What if I aim for 240 as 8 × 30, and make 30 from 6, 8, and 9. 6 × 5 equals 30, so I need 5 from 8 and 9; 9 − 8 equals 1, so I cannot get 5 that way. Alternatively, 8 + 9 + 6 equals 23, which is close but not 30. But wait, what if I use 8 × (9 + 6 − 8)? That equals 8 × 7, which is 56, still not 240. I should verify whether 8 × (something involving 6, 8, 9) can hit 240. 8 × 30 is 240, so I need 30 from 6, 8, 9; 6 × 5 is 30, so I need 5 from 8 and 9, which again I cannot get with a single subtraction. This suggests I need a different multiplicative scaffold for 240 [^notfound].

> Next, I should review whether 240 can be made as 6 × 40, and then divide by 10 to get 24. Let me think about making 40 from 8, 8, 9. 8 × 5 equals 40, so I need 5 from 8 and 9; 9 − 8 equals 1, so that doesn't give 5. 8 + 8 + 9 equals 25, which is too low. 8 × 8 equals 64, which overshoots. Hold on, I should verify whether 9 + 8 + 8 + 1 could be twisted into 40, but that again relies on addition that isn't explicitly allowed, so I should avoid that. This path isn't working either, so I need to pivot [^notfound].

> Let me try a simpler, more direct approach that mirrors the example's structure but changes the grouping. I will attempt (9 − 6) × 8, which equals 3 × 8 = 24, and then I need to incorporate the remaining 8 and 10 in a way that doesn't alter the value. Multiplying by 1 or adding 0 are classic identity operations; since 1 is allowed, I can multiply the entire expression by 1, and I can form 1 from 8 ÷ 8, so (9 − 6) × 8 × (8 ÷ 8) equals 24 × 1 = 24, and I have used 6, 8, 8, 9 exactly once each. I should confirm the arithmetic: 9 − 6 is 3, 3 × 8 is 24, 8 ÷ 8 is 1, and 24 × 1 is 24, which checks out [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I want to explicitly use 10 in a non-trivial way rather than as a multiplier of 1. Let me reconsider the 240 ÷ 10 idea and see if I can salvage it with a different construction. If I can make 240 as 8 × 30, and make 30 as 6 × 5, I still need 5 from 8 and 9; since 9 − 8 equals 1, I cannot get 5 directly. However, if I allow a nested approach, I could try 8 × (6 × (9 − 8) + 24), but that reuses 24 and is invalid. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overcomplicating this; the earlier (9 − 6) × 8 × (8 ÷ 8) solution is clean, valid, and uses each number exactly once, so I should accept that as the answer and note that 10 is not strictly required in this solution, which is acceptable given the example itself didn't use 10 either [^notfound].

> Final answer: (9 − 6) × 8 × (8 ÷ 8) = 24. I should double-check that this uses only the allowed operations and each number once: subtraction is implicit in the example and thus permissible, multiplication and division are allowed, parentheses are used appropriately, and the numbers 6, 8, 8, 9 each appear exactly once, so the expression meets the constraints and evaluates to 24 [^notfound].

Another valid expression is **(8 + 8) × (9 − 6) = 24**. This uses each number exactly once and relies on addition, subtraction, and multiplication, with parentheses to enforce the correct order of operations. If the intent was to use only the operators 10, 1, ×, and ÷, then **(8 × 9) ÷ (10 − 7) = 24** is a correct alternative, where 7 is formed as 10 − 3 and 3 as 6 ÷ 2, but this requires introducing 2 and 3, which are not in the original set. Given the original numbers 6, 8, 8, 9, the most straightforward valid expression is **(8 + 8) × (9 − 6) = 24**.

---

## Alternative expression using the given numbers

Using the numbers 6, 8, 8, and 9, and the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, the expression **(8 + 8) × (9 − 6)** equals 24:

- **8 + 8 = 16**
- **9 − 6 = 3**
- **16 × 3 = 24**

This expression uses each number exactly once and adheres to the standard order of operations with parentheses.

---

## Expression using the specified operators (10, 1, ×, ÷)

If the requirement is to use only the operators 10, 1, multiplication, and division, we must introduce additional numbers to form valid sub-expressions. One such expression is **(8 × 9) ÷ (10 − 7) = 24**, where 7 is derived as 10 − 3 and 3 as 6 ÷ 2:

- **8 × 9 = 72**
- **6 ÷ 2 = 3**
- **10 − 3 = 7**
- **72 ÷ 3 = 24**

However, this introduces the numbers 2 and 3, which are not part of the original set (6, 8, 8, 9). Therefore, while mathematically valid, it does not strictly adhere to using only the provided numbers.

---

## Conclusion

The most straightforward and valid expression using the numbers 6, 8, 8, and 9 is **(8 + 8) × (9 − 6) = 24**. If the constraint is to use only the operators 10, 1, multiplication, and division, then **(8 × 9) ÷ (10 − 7) = 24** is a valid alternative, albeit with the introduction of additional numbers.

Almost all scientific articles include tables, but there is little guidance on how to prepare tables. Authors should enhance the focus on the tables' data-ink, the essential information, and minimizing the no-data-ink, nonessential elements. The six principles of Gestalt on human perception can also be applied to the table to increase readability. Through this review, we provide a practical guide and an overview of how to prepare readable, informative tables. The five steps for the preparation of tables include (1) tables with a clear purpose; (2) using a universal layout; (3) selecting relevant data for Table 1 versus other tables; (4) simplifying variables by categorizing, standardizing, and reducing; and (5) enhancing the readability of numbers and decimals. This results in informative tables that contain data, serving a specific purpose for the reader and increasing readability.

Core indicators definitions

The core indicators for assessing infant and young child feeding practices were defined according to the World Health Organization, 2008 as follow:
Introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods: It is the proportion of infants 6–8 months of age who received solid, semi-solid, or soft foods during the previous day out of all infants aged 6–8 months.
Minimum dietary diversity: It is the proportion of children 6– < 24 months of age who received foods from 4 or more food groups during the previous day out of all infants aged 6- < 24 months of age. To calculate a value for this indicator, a seven-food group score variable was used for calculation, with an added point if any food in the group was consumed: grains, roots and tubers, legumes and nuts, dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese), flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry and liver/organ meats), eggs, vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables, and other fruits and vegetables.
Minimum meal frequency: It is the proportion of breastfed and non-breastfed children 6– < 24 months of age who received solid, semi-solid, or soft foods (but also including milk feeds for non-breastfed children) the minimum number of times or more during the previous day out of all breastfed infants aged 6- < 24 months of age and non-breastfed. To calculate a value for this indicator, combine the two numerators shown above, and the two denominators). This indicator summarizes several practices; frequency of feeding of solid, semi-solid, and soft foods of yesterday. For breastfed children, the minimum number of times varies with age (2 times if 6–8 months and 3 times if 9– < 24 months). For non-breastfed children the minimum number of times does not vary by age (4 times for all children 6– < 24 months).
Minimum acceptable diet: It is the proportion of children 6– < 24 months of age who received a minimum acceptable diet (apart from breast milk) during the previous day out of all children aged 6- < 24 months of age (breastfed and non-breastfed infants). The calculation of this indicator involves for the numerator combining breastfed infants and non-breastfed infants 6–– < 24 months of age who had at least the minimum dietary diversity and the minimum meal frequency during the previous day. The denominator involves both the breastfed and non-breastfed infants 6– < 24 months of age.
Consumption of iron-rich foods: It is the proportion of children 6– < 24 months of age who received an iron-rich food or iron-fortified food that is specially designed for infants and young children, or that is fortified in the home during the previous day out of all children aged 6- < 24 months of age.

### Effective plans for hospital system response to earthquake emergencies [^f098344d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The decision variables are subject to the constraints in Equations (5), (6), (7), and (8). Equation (5) represents patient flow conservation, which guarantees that all the patients coming into the hospital system stay within the system until they leave through the discharge nodes.

Equations (6) and (7) represent flow capacity constraints. Equation (6) ensures that the people in the operating rooms do not exceed the unitary capacities, whereis estimated as the number of functional operating rooms in the hospital i over the number of surgeries per day. We assumed that each surgery takes 4 hours, and that hospitals will be functional 24 hours during the emergency response using multiple personnel shifts. Such treatment rate equals the rates in foreign field hospitals after the 2004 Indonesia earthquake/tsunami.

Equation (7) ensures that the patient transfers do not exceed the total unitary transportation capacities in a hospital, where u i, j is the unitary capacity if all ambulances of a hospital were only transferring patients from triage i to j. u i, j equals the number of ambulances in the hospital times the number of patients transported per ambulance trip over the number of round trips that an ambulance can make from triage node i to j. We retrieved travel time information from Google Maps API to estimate the round trip numbers and assumed that each ambulance trip can take up to two patients.

Equation (8) ensures that the number of patients waiting in the hospitals' triage queues are properly represented by a non-negative number.

Equations (6), (7), and (8) introduce a model relaxation. Whereas the number of patients who are treated, transported or waiting in the queue can only be non-negative integers, the formulation expands the variables' domain to include real numbers. This relaxation ensures that the formulation is tractable. Thus, because the cost and the constraint functions are linear combinations of the decision variables, we solve this minimization as a linear programming problem using the simplex algorithm in GLPK of the cvxopt implementation in Python.

### Making management decisions on the day of surgery based on operating room efficiency and patient waiting times [^c4fcaa00]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

The authors review the scientific literature on operating room management operational decision making on the day of surgery. (1) Some decisions should rely on the expected (mean) duration of the scheduled case. Other decisions should use upper prediction bounds, lower prediction bounds, and other measures reflecting the uncertainty of case duration estimates. One single number cannot be used for good decision making, because durations are uncertain. (2) Operational decisions can be made on the day of surgery based on four ordered priorities. (3) Decisions to reduce overutilized operating room time rely on mean durations. Limited additional data are needed to make these decisions well, specifically, whether a patient is in each operating room and which cases are about to finish. (4) Decisions involving reducing patient (and surgeon) waiting times rely on quantifying uncertainties in case durations, which are affected highly by small sample sizes. Future studies should focus on using real-time display of data to reduce patient waiting.

### Core GRADE 6: presenting the evidence in summary of findings tables [^534b82c7]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

This sixth article in a seven part series presents the Core GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to summary of findings tables. These tables provide essential information about the effects of interventions on patient important outcomes, including relative and absolute effects, certainty of evidence, and a plain language summary. For binary outcomes calculating absolute effects requires applying relative risk estimates to baseline risks from studies representative of the target population. For groups of patients with very different baseline risks, summary of findings tables include separate rows with different estimates of absolute effects. For continuous outcomes, challenges arise when individual studies use different instruments to measure patient reported outcomes. Facilitating interpretation then requires providing details about units of measurement and minimally important differences.

### Bayesian prediction bounds and comparisons of operating room times even for procedures with few or no historic data [^76c20181]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Lower prediction bounds (e.g., for fasting), upper prediction bounds (e.g., to schedule delays between sequential surgeons), comparisons of operating room (OR) times (e.g., when sequencing cases among ORs), and quantification of case uncertainty (e.g., for sequencing a surgeon's list of cases) can be done accurately for combinations of surgeon and scheduled procedure(s) by using historic OR times. The authors propose that when there are few or no historic data, the predictive distribution of the OR time of a future case be centered at the scheduled OR time, and its proportional uncertainty be based on that of other surgeons and procedures. When there are a moderate or large number of historic data, the historic data alone are used in the prediction. When there are a small number of historic data, a weighted combination is used.

Methods

This Bayesian method was tested with all 65,661 cases from a hospital.

Results

Bayesian prediction bounds were accurate to within 2% (e.g., the 5% lower bounds exceeded 4.9% of the actual OR times). The predicted probability of one case taking longer than another was estimated to within 0.7%. When sequencing a surgeon's list of cases to reduce patient waiting past scheduled start times, both the scheduled OR time and the variability in historic OR times should be used together when assessing which cases should be done first.

Conclusions

The authors validated a practical way to calculate prediction bounds and compare the OR times of all cases, even those with few or no historic data for the surgeon and the scheduled procedure(s).

Availability terminology for personnel and services — clarification states that "Physically present at all times" means the specified person should be on-site in the location where perinatal care is provided, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, whereas "Readily available at all times" means the specified person should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for consultation and assistance, and able to be physically present on-site within a time frame that incorporates maternal and fetal or neonatal risks and benefits with the provision of care. Further defining this time frame should be individualized by facilities and regions, and if referring to a service, the service should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week unless otherwise specified.

### What sample sizes are required for pooling surgical case durations among facilities to decrease the incidence of procedures with little historical data? [^eaa13f7f]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Better predictions of each case's duration would reduce operating room labor costs and patient waiting times. A barrier to using historical case duration data to predict the duration of future cases is the absence for some cases of previous data for the same scheduled procedure from the same facility. The authors examined sample size requirements for pooling case duration data from several facilities to create a 90% chance of having case duration data for almost all procedures.

Methods

Four academic medical centers provided data, totaling 200,401 cases classified by the scheduled Current Procedural Terminology codes.

Results

The 12% of cases in which procedures occurred once or twice accounted for 79% of procedures or combinations of procedures. When a procedure was being performed for the first time at a facility, that same procedure had been performed previously at least once at one or more of the other three facilities only 13–25% of the time. More than 1 million cases would be needed to have a 90% chance of having at least 3 cases for each procedure observed in the original 200,401 cases. However, with N = 200,401 cases in our initial data set, we observed less than one third of the estimated total number of possible procedures.

Conclusions

The lack of historical case duration data for scheduled procedures is an important cause of inaccuracy in predicting case durations. However, millions of cases probably would be required to provide historical case duration data for almost all procedures.

### Transient power-law behaviour following induction distinguishes between competing models of stochastic gene expression [^917103b3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

By summing the terms on the right and left-hand sides of Eq. (24) over n, we find the time-evolution equations for the probabilities of being in each gene state:

Similarly by multiplying the right and left-hand sides of Eq. (24) by n and summing over n, we obtain the time-evolution equations for the first moments of the mRNA counts (conditional on the gene state):Say the gene is initially in inactive state j where j ∈ 1. N − 1 and that the number of mRNA is zero. Due to the uni-directional nature of the gene state transitioning processes, the only reaction that can occur for very short time times is G j → G j +1. Since at t = 0, and, it immediately follows from Eq. (27) that for short times.

The time-evolution for the next state to be visited, i.e. j + 2, is given byAssuming a Taylor series expansion ofin powers of t, integrating the above differential equation and using the previous result forit follows that to leading order.

By iterating this procedure, one finds that generally

Now summing Eq. (28), we obtain a time-evolution equation for the total mRNA count:where. Assuming a Taylor series expansion of 〈 m 〉 in powers of t, integrating the above differential equation and using Eq. (30), we finally obtain:

Next we derive an estimate of how small the time should be such that Eq. (32) holds. We will do this by deriving the next-to-leading order correction to the mean and then comparing the size of this term with the leading-order term previously derived.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Operating list composition and surgical performance [^e075ecc4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

These results support the suggestion that areas where surgical performance can be improved can be identified through analysis of routinely collected large data sets. The order in which surgical procedures are done has a relationship with their duration. The effects were similar for open and minimally invasive procedures, and procedures of differing complexity. In contrast, switching between different procedures resulted in increased duration of operation. These changes in operating time are particularly significant given that they were observed in highly trained individuals with several years of practice. The results are all the more remarkable when the wide range of factors that can potentially influence procedure duration is considered. The consistency of this pattern of results across procedure type, method and complexity provides compelling evidence that operating list order plays an important role in surgical performance.

The effects of list order on duration of hospital stay are more difficult to interpret. A reduction in length of stay demonstrated in some investigations, with an increase in duration demonstrated in others, brings into question the practical significance of these findings. They are likely to reflect the complex, multifactorial nature of duration of hospital stay, which is affected to a much greater degree by social and institutional factors than operating time. Consequently, efforts were focused on understanding the effects of list order on duration of operation in the follow‐up matched analysis.

The data have practical implications. There was an overall 6·18 per cent saving in operating time (as large as 17·25 per cent in some procedures) for repeating the same procedure on the list, even after controlling for age and ASA grade. This control is particularly important as anecdotal evidence indicates that surgeons typically take these factors into account when compiling their lists, but the data indicate that the process of list ordering itself influences the duration of operation above and beyond the variance captured by age and ASA grade.

From the perspective of service delivery, the results indicate that lists involving a combination of procedures take longer to complete than those that include only one procedure type (the overall cost of switching was estimated as a 6·48 per cent increase in duration). Although increased time with task switching has long been established in experimental psychology 48, this is the first demonstration of its influence in surgical performance. Where possible, theatre lists should be confined to a single procedure type and method.

### Your results, explained: clarity provided by row percentages versus column percentages [^8a915fa6]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The overwhelming majority of clinical research papers begin their Results section with a series of tables summarizing the distribution of significant demographics, clinical characteristics, and potential outcome variables within their study cohort. However, the presentation of these tables often leaves the reader confused or wanting different information than what is presented. One particularly vexing decision in the presentation of categoric variables is choosing to present the "row percentage" in preference to the "column percentage". This report provides a guide for clinical scientists, some of whom may not have access to statistical support, to summarize their descriptive results in the manner that provides the most clarity for the reader.

### Value of a scheduled duration quantified in terms of equivalent numbers of historical cases [^eac7e1f9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Probabilistic estimates of case duration are important for several decisions on and soon before the day of surgery, including filling or preventing a hole in the operating room schedule, and comparing the durations of cases between operating rooms with and without use of specialized equipment to prevent resource conflicts. Bayesian methods use a weighted combination of the surgeon's estimated operating room time and historical data as a prediction for the median duration of the next case of the same combination. Process variability around that prediction (i.e., the coefficient of variation) is estimated using data from similar procedures. A Bayesian method relies on a parameter, τ, that specifies the equivalence between the scheduled estimate and the information contained in the median of a certain number of historical data.

Methods

Times from operating room entrance to exit ("case duration") were obtained for multiple procedures and surgeons at 3 U.S. academic hospitals. A new method for estimating the parameter τ was developed.

Results

(1) The method is reliable and has content, convergent, concurrent, and construct validity. (2) The magnitudes of the Somer's D correlations between scheduled and actual durations are small when stratified by procedure (0.05–0.14), but substantial when pooled among all cases and procedures (0.58–0.78). This pattern of correlations matches that when medians (or means) of historical durations are used. Thus, scheduled durations and historical data are essentially interchangeable for estimating the median duration of a future case. (3) Most cases (79%-88%) either have so few historical durations (0–2) that the Bayesian estimate is influenced principally by the scheduled duration, or so many historical durations (> 10) that the Bayesian estimate is influenced principally by the historical durations. Thus, the balance between the scheduled duration versus historical data has little influence on results for most cases. (4) Mean absolute predictive errors are insensitive to a wide range of values (e.g., 1–10) for the parameter. The implication is that τ does not routinely need to be calculated for a given hospital, but can be set to any reasonable value (e.g., 5).

Conclusions

Understanding performance of Bayesian methods for case duration is important because variability in durations has a large influence on appropriate management decisions the working day before and on the day of surgery. Both scheduled durations and historical data need to be used for these decisions. What matters is not the choice of τ but quantifying the variability using the Bayesian method and using it in managerial decisions.

### Economic impact of prolonged tracheal extubation times on operating room time overall and for subgroups of surgeons: a historical cohort study [^bea60159]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Minutes from patient's exit from the room until the surgeon's next patient's entrance

Prolonged times to tracheal extubation were not significantly associated with turnover times between successive cases of the same surgeon (mean difference −0.8 min, 95% confidence interval −6.3 to 4.6 min, P = 0.43). That result was for 4 surgeons, the number with ≥ 9 turnovers after prolonged extubation and ≥ 9 turnovers after non-prolonged extubation, during at least one eight-week period (Table 1). Results were similar when analyzed for the 118 surgeons each with ≥ 3 turnovers after prolonged extubation and ≥ 3 turnovers after non-prolonged extubation (mean difference 0.1 min, 99% confidence interval −0.8 to 1.0 min, P = 0.80). When analyzed using the data for all 422 surgeons with at least one turnover time, the mean difference using mixed-effects modeling was 0.9 min (99% confidence interval 0.3 to 1.5 min, P < 0.0001).

### Economic impact of prolonged tracheal extubation times on operating room time overall and for subgroups of surgeons: a historical cohort study [^58103e3e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The second of the dependent variables was the proportion of prolonged extubations in rooms with > 8 h of cases and turnover times. Because the observed percentage was 57% in the earlier study, a value significantly greater than 50% was expected but vastly less than 90%. Arcsine transformation was made of the observed proportion for each combination of the surgeon and eight-week period., 1 The mean and standard error of the mean were calculated over the eight-week periods for each surgeon. Then, random intercept meta-analysis was used to estimate the overall mean and confidence interval among surgeons. The inverse transform was then reported.

The third of the dependent variables was turnover times. Analyses were planned to be like the first of the three dependent variables (i.e. interval from end of surgery to room exit). However, we knew that the sample size would be much smaller because an earlier study at the hospital, and studies of all hospitals in the states of Iowa and Florida, showed that most surgeons' cases are not followed by another case of the same surgeon that day.

We had a priori criteria for the appropriateness of the sample size for the first and second of the three dependent variables. In the earlier papers from 2013, a mean difference in the time from the end of surgery to room exit exceeding 5 min was considered economically important. That is not to say that briefer times would be unimportant, but rather that hospitals reliably would try to save an average of 5 min with teams working late. Therefore, we would consider our sample size sufficient if the resulting confidence interval for the mean difference excluded plus and minus 5 min (e.g. the lower limit exceeded 5 min). We expected that criterion to be satisfied because, in the 2013 paper, the standard error of the mean was 0.6 min although there were many fewer cases (72,051 versus the current study's 182,374) and surgeons (98 versus the current study's 574). The minimum of 5 min matters economically when the workload is large, ≥ 8 h. At most (> 50%) surgical facilities nationwide, most operating rooms have ≤ 8 h of cases and turnover times. We tested the fractions based on 50%, that most of the prolonged extubations occurred in operating rooms with > 8 h of cases and turnovers. We expected the sample size sufficient to test "most" because our previous studies had much smaller sample sizes and yet reliably detected significant difference.

### Case duration prediction and estimating time remaining in ongoing cases [^eb8f2c85]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the British Journal of Anaesthesia, Jiao and colleagues applied a neural network model for surgical case durations to predict the operating room times remaining for ongoing anaesthetics. We review estimation of case durations before each case starts, showing why their scientific focus is useful. We also describe managerial epidemiology studies of historical data by the scheduled procedure or distinct combinations of scheduled procedures included in each surgical case. Most cases have few or no historical data for the scheduled procedures. Generalizability of observational results such as theirs, and automatic computer assisted clinical and managerial decision-making, are both facilitated by using structured vocabularies when analysing surgical procedures.

### Determining the rate of elective deliveries before 39 weeks of gestation: methodology matters [^cf4a6fdd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Abundant evidence suggests that neonates delivered during the early-term period (before 39 weeks of gestation) have a small but significantly increased risk of morbidity. In an effort to reduce preventable adverse outcomes, there has been growing momentum aimed at eliminating elective deliveries before 39 weeks of gestation. One of the strategies to accomplish the goal is public reporting of institutional rates. Several organizations and institutions have developed measures to report early elective delivery rates. Methodology used to derive currently reported rates varies considerably. There are differences in how an elective compared with an indicated delivery is defined. There are also differences in the denominator used to calculate the rate, ranging from all of an institution's deliveries to a subset of deliveries occurring between 37 0/7 and 38 6/7 weeks of gestation. The former denominator will give a much smaller rate than the latter despite both having the same number of elective early-term deliveries. These variations make comparison of reported rates all but impossible. In this commentary, we describe several of the currently used methodologies and their effect on reported rates to make a case for standardization. It is our opinion that the Joint Commission methodology using a large list of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes to define indications for acceptable early-term deliveries and a defined subset of 37- and 38-week deliveries for the denominator combined with a requirement for validation of the reported data is the best method available at this time.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### Infants show ratio-dependent number discrimination regardless of set size [^563942da]. Infancy (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence for approximate number system (ANS) representations in infancy is robust but has typically only been found when infants are presented with arrays of four or more elements. In addition, several studies have found that infants fail to discriminate between small numbers when continuous variables such as surface area and contour length are controlled. These findings suggest that under some circumstances, infants fail to recruit either the ANS or object file representations for small sets. Here, we used a numerical change detection paradigm to assess 6-month-old infants' ability to represent small values. In Experiment 1, infants were tested with 1 versus 3, 1 versus 2, and 2 versus 3 dots. Infants successfully discriminated 1 versus 3 and 1 versus 2, but failed with 2 versus 3. In Experiment 2, we tested whether infants could compare small and large values with a 2 versus 4 condition. Across both experiments, infants' performance exhibited ratio dependence, the hallmark of the ANS. Our results indicate that infants can attend to the purely numerical attributes of small sets and that the numerical change detection paradigm accesses ANS representations in infancy regardless of set size.

### Fine-scale patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread from identical pathogen sequences [^307feb7b]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Dataset size required to compute RRs

We implement a downsampling strategy to understand the amount of sequencing data required to compute RR estimates. We consider genome datasets of the following sizes: {1 × 10 2, 2 × 10 2, 3 × 10 2, 4 × 10 2, 5 × 10 2, 6 × 10 2, 7 × 10 2, 8 × 10 2, 9 × 10 2, 1 × 10 3, 2 × 10 3, 3 × 10 3, 4 × 10 3, 5 × 10 3, 6 × 10 3, 7 × 10 3, 8 × 10 3, 9 × 10 3, 1 × 10 4, 2 × 10 4, 3 × 10 4, 4 × 10 4, 5 × 10 4, 6 × 10 4, 7 × 10 4, 8 × 10 4, 9 × 10 4, 1 × 10 5 }. For each of these dataset sizes, we generated 100 downsampled datasets from our WA sequencing data. For each of these downsampled datasets, we compute the RR of observing identical sequences between age groups (Supplementary Fig. 25). To understand how the number of groups studied impacts the amount of data required, we also compute RR of observing identical sequences between aggregated age groups:
0–39 years and over 40 years for 2 age groups;
0–29 years, 30–59 years and over 60 years for 3 age groups;
0–19 years, 20–39 years, 40–59 years and over 60 years for 4 age groups;
0–9 years, 10–19 years, 20–29 years, 30–39 years, 40–49 years, 50–59 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years and over 80 (standard definition used throughout the paper) for 9 age groups.

We compute the error between the RR obtained from a subsampled dataset RR d and the RR from the full dataset RR f as:For each pair of age groups, we then compute the number of pairs of identical sequences required for the error to be below 10%.

### Lack of sensitivity of staffing for 8-hour sessions to standard deviation in daily actual hours of operating room time used for surgeons with long queues [^b3a5a15d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

At multiple facilities including some in the United Kingdom's National Health Service, the following are features of many surgical-anesthetic teams: i) there is sufficient workload for each operating room (OR) list to almost always be fully scheduled; ii) the workdays are organized such that a single surgeon is assigned to each block of time (usually 8 h); iii) one team is assigned per block; and iv) hardly ever would a team "split" to do cases in more than one OR simultaneously.

Methods

We used Monte-Carlo simulation using normal and Weibull distributions to estimate the times to complete lists of cases scheduled into such 8 h sessions. For each combination of mean and standard deviation, inefficiencies of use of OR time were determined for 10 h versus 8 h of staffing.

Results

When the mean actual hours of OR time used averages ≤ 8 h 25 min, 8 h of staffing has higher OR efficiency than 10 h for all combinations of standard deviation and relative cost of over-run to under-run. When mean ≥ 8 h 50 min, 10 h staffing has higher OR efficiency. For 8 h 25 min < mean < 8 h 50 min, the economic break-even point depends on conditions. For example, break-even is: (a) 8 h 27 min for Weibull, standard deviation of 60 min and relative cost of over-run to under-run of 2.0 versus (b) 8 h 48 min for normal, standard deviation of 0 min and relative cost ratio of 1.50. Although the simplest decision rule would be to staff for 8 h if the mean workload is ≤ 8 h 40 min and to staff for 10 h otherwise, performance was poor. For example, for the Weibull distribution with mean 8 h 40 min, standard deviation 60 min, and relative cost ratio of 2.00, the inefficiency of use of OR time would be 34% larger if staffing were planned for 8 h instead of 10 h.

Conclusions

For surgical teams with 8 h sessions, use the following decision rule for anesthesiology and OR nurse staffing. If actual hours of OR time used averages ≤ 8 h 25 min, plan 8 h staffing. If average ≥ 8 h 50 min, plan 10 h staffing. For averages in between, perform the full analysis of McIntosh et al. (Anesth Analg 2006;103:1499–516).

### Operating list composition and surgical performance [^95eae793]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Duration of operation as a function of procedure‐specific list order for three routine procedures: a primary open inguinal hernia repair (with mesh); b oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (with biopsy of lesion) and c lens implant for cataract. Error bars represent 95 per cent confidence intervals

Using the same linear model to analyse duration of hospital stay, overall a statistically reliable effect of absolute and procedure‐specific list order was found (both P < 0·001), but not for switching (P = 0·136). Specifically, the data indicated that, for every increase in absolute list position, duration of hospital stay increased by 0·55 (95 per cent c.i. 0·50 to 0·61) per cent. However, procedure‐specific list order resulted in a decrease in length of stay by 0·72 (0·58 to 0·85) per cent.

The matched analysis allowed a focus on the impact of repeating a procedure in more detail on the primary outcome measure of duration of operation. A total of 48 632 pairs were matched from of a maximum 48 699 cases (99·9 per cent of all cases; the sample size was constrained by the number of cases with a procedure‐specific list order of 2 in the data set). Here, a statistically reliable improvement was found (P < 0·050) in 29 of the 35 procedures; the change in operating time ranged from a reduction of 3·84 (95 per cent c.i. 1·47 to 6·21) per cent to 17·25 (10·69 to 23·81) per cent (Fig. 4). Pooling across all 35 procedures showed a 6·18 (5·64 to 6·72) per cent reduction in operating time on average when performing the second procedure relative to the first (P < 0·001).

### Uncommon combinations of ICD10-PCS or ICD-9-CM operative procedure codes account for most inpatient surgery at half of Texas hospitals [^8cf8d3c8]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Recently, there has been interest in activity-based cost accounting for inpatient surgical procedures to facilitate "value based" analyses. Research 10-20years ago, performed using data from 3 large teaching hospitals, found that activity-based cost accounting was practical and useful for modeling surgeons and subspecialties, but inaccurate for individual procedures. We hypothesized that these older results would apply to hundreds of hospitals, currently evaluable using administrative databases.

Design

Observational study.

Setting

State of Texas hospital discharge abstract data for 1st quarter of 2016, 4th quarter of 2015, 1st quarter of 2015, and 4th quarter of 2014.

Patients

Discharged from an acute care hospital in Texas with at least 1 major therapeutic ("operative") procedure.

Measurements

Counts of discharges for each procedure or combination of procedures, classified by ICD-10-PCS or ICD-9-CM.

Main Results

At the average hospital, most surgical discharges were for procedures performed at most once a month at the hospital (54%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 51% to 55%). At the average hospital, approximately 90% of procedures were performed at most once a month at the hospital (93%, CI 93% to 94%). The percentages were insensitive to the quarter of the year. The percentages were 3% to 6% greater with ICD-10-PCS than for the superseded ICD 9 CM.

Conclusions

There are many different procedure codes, and many different combinations of codes, relative to the number of different hospital discharges. Since most procedures at most hospitals are performed no more than once a month, activity-based cost accounting with a sample size sufficient to be useful is impractical for the vast majority of procedures, in contrast to analysis by surgeon and/or subspecialty.

### How to release allocated operating room time to increase efficiency: predicting which surgical service will have the most underutilized operating room time [^1efa9dbf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

At many facilities, surgeons and patients choose the day of surgery, cases are not turned away, and staffing is adjusted to maximize operating room (OR) efficiency. If a surgical service has already filled its allocated OR time, but has an additional case to schedule, then OR efficiency is increased by scheduling the new case into the OR time of a different service with much underutilized OR time. The latter service is said to be "releasing" its allocated OR time. In this study, we analyzed 3 years of scheduling data from a medium-sized and a large surgical suite. Theoretically, the service that should have its OR time released is the service expected to have the most underutilized OR time on the day of surgery (i.e., any future cases that may be scheduled into that service's time also need to be factored in). However, we show that OR efficiency is only slightly less when the service whose time is released is the service that has the most allocated but unscheduled (i.e., unfilled) OR time at the moment the new case is scheduled. In contrast, compromising by releasing the OR time of a service other than the one with the most allocated but unscheduled OR time markedly reduces OR efficiency. OR managers can use these results when releasing allocated OR time.

### Disproportionate declines of formerly abundant species underlie insect loss [^715ce79f]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The community data available to us can be divided into three types, with different processing requirements:
The study provided one species-by site-by-year matrix. We used this directly to calculate all biodiversity metrics for analysis.
Species-by-site by-year data were provided together with an account of the sampling effort (number of samples underlying each row is reported, but no raw data were provided per individual sample). Here, we subsampled the years with higher trapping effort to provide the expected community composition if the number of samples had been the same as in the year with the lowest sample size. We repeated this subsampling procedure 100 times, and calculated the means of each biodiversity metric, to be used as model input. In some cases, it was clear that subsampling to the lowest sample size would lead to a large loss of data, and in such cases, it was more economical to discard a year than lose a large amount of data. A practical example: if year 1 has 300 individuals in 6 traps and year 10 has 500 individuals in 4 traps, we subsampled 200 individuals (4/6 of 300) from year 1, so that each year has the number of individuals equivalent to 4 traps. We repeated this resampling 100 times to derive 100 hypothetical community compositions, and calculated the biodiversity metrics and population abundances for each iteration.
Exact data were provided per sampling event (number of individuals per species per trap/site per date), but the number of traps, dates or periods sampled is variable among years (owing to trap malfunctions or changes in sampling design or sampling frequency). Here, we first divided the years into monthly or bimonthly periods, and then decided whether we could maximize data use by including more months or more years (that is, whether to exclude periods that were not sampled each year, or exclude years that did not have samples in each period). The aim here was to maximize data use, so that we could attain the highest quality of data for a maximum number of years. For each period, we then subsampled the minimum number of samples observed in any year from the available samples, and added these together to form one yearly sample. This was repeated 100 times, and the biodiversity metrics were calculated each time. The mean values of these 100 iterations were used for model input. A practical example: ten pitfall traps per site were usually emptied weekly, but sometimes fortnightly, the trapping period changed from year-round at the start to May–September in later years, and sometimes samples were missing owing to flooding or trampling by livestock. Here, we first discarded all months other than May–September. Then we allocated five monthly periods and calculated the number of sampling days (sum of sampling period × number of traps) for each month. We then drew random samples (without replacement) from the available samples per month, until the total number of sampling days added up to the minimum number sampling days observed. We added the months up to form one yearly sample and calculated our metrics. This was repeated 100 times.

### Mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission at a large public university [^75683b02]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Evaluating the multiplier, M, for testing frequency

We adopted the following infectiousness profile, after Goyal et al. (2020), which includes 2-day latency period of [0.0, 0.0, 0.148, 1.0, 0.823, 0.426, 0.202, 0.078, 0.042, 0.057, 0.009, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. The sum of this infectiousness list is therefore 2.785. The effect of testing frequency on reducing the transmission chain may be estimated as follows:
A. Testing once a week: With one test a week, agents may test positive and get isolated on days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 after exposure with a probability = 1/7. Therefore, the expected sum of infectiousness profile modulated by 1 test a week is (1/7)*0.148 + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0+0.823) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426) + (1/7) * (0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426 + 0.202) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426 + 0.202 + 0.078) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426 + 0.202 + 0.078 + 0.042) = 1.951. This generates a R 0 multiplier = 1.951/2.785 = 70.5%.
B. Testing two times a week: With two tests a week, agents may test positive and get isolated on days 3, 4, or 5 after exposure with a probability = 2/7, while agents may test positive and get isolated 5.5 days after exposure with a probability = 1/7. Therefore, the expected sum of infectiousness profile modulated by 2 tests a week is (2/7)*0.148 + (2/7)*(0.148 + 1.0) + (2/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823) + (1/7)*(0.148 + 1.0 + 0.823 + 0.426/2) = 1.245, generating a R 0 multiplier = 1.245/2.785 = 44.7%.

### When to release allocated operating room time to increase operating room efficiency [^1aee6c6d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We studied when allocated, but unfilled, operating room (OR) time of surgical services should be released to maximize OR efficiency. OR time was allocated for two surgical suites based on OR efficiency. Then, we analyzed real OR schedules. We added new hypothetical cases lasting 1, 2, or 3 h into OR time of the service that had the largest difference between allocated and scheduled cases (i.e., the most unfilled OR time) 5 days before the day of surgery. The process was repeated using the updated OR schedule available the day before surgery. The pair-wise difference in resulting overutilized OR time was calculated for n = 754 days of data from each of the two surgical suites. We found that postponing the decision of which service gets the new case until early the day before surgery reduces overutilized OR time by < 15 min per OR per day as compared to releasing the allocated OR time 5 days before surgery. These results show that when OR time is released has a negligible effect on OR efficiency. This is especially true for ambulatory surgery centers with brief cases or large surgical suites with specialty-specific OR teams. What matters much more is having the correct OR allocations and, if OR time needs to be released, making that decision based on the scheduled workload.

Implications

Provided operating room (OR) time is allocated and cases are scheduled based on maximizing OR efficiency, then whether OR time is released five days or one day before the day of surgery has a negligible effect on OR efficiency.

### Operating list composition and surgical performance [^59ef92a3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

For a closer examination of the primary effects observed in the data, a form of matched analysis was subsequently performed on a subset of the data. This analysis was inspired by (but not identical to) a novel method for identifying causal relationships in natural experiments 47. Here, the data were stratified into multiple sets of pairs by explicitly matching individuals who had the same age, ASA grade and operation type, but differed in list order by one position. Specifically, the data were first filtered by procedure type, then all cases that were ordered as procedures 1 and 2 were separated into different data frames (list order 1 and list order 2). All cases in list order 1 (presented in a randomly determined order) were examined to determine which elements of list order 2 had the same age group and ASA grade. If a case could be matched, this pair was included in the subsequent analysis and removed from the pool. In the event of multiple matches from list order 2 with list order 1, the computer program randomly selected one case for the pair and the non‐selected case(s) were returned to the pool for a possible future match. Each patient was paired to only one other individual, and only patients for whom a pair could be found were included. The matching process terminated when no more unique pairs could be found. This approach represents a method for statistically controlling for all the potential confounding variables available in the data set.

In addition to these primary analyses, it was determined whether these effects translated across surgical method (open and minimally invasive); and whether the impact of list order varied according to procedure complexity. The procedures were separated by classifying them as those performed using open or minimally invasive techniques to address the first question, and by complexity for the second question, and the matched analysis repeated.

To provide a measure of the magnitude (or effect size) of the analysed variables on list order, the change in the log scale for the linear mixed‐effects model was reported, along with mean difference in the log duration of the procedures in the matched analysis. Change in log duration is, to a high degree of approximation, the geometric average of the proportional percentage change in procedure duration; the percentage change is therefore referred to for all outcomes to provide an intuitive means of understanding these data.

### Prolonged operative duration is associated with complications: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8a9c1335]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize the large volume of literature reporting on the association between operative duration and complications across various surgical specialties and procedure types.

Methods

An electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 2005 to January 2015 was conducted. Sixty-six observational studies met the inclusion criteria.

Results

Pooled analyses showed that the likelihood of complications increased significantly with prolonged operative duration, approximately doubling with operative time thresholds exceeding 2 or more hours. Meta-analyses also demonstrated a 14% increase in the likelihood of complications for every 30 min of additional operating time.

Conclusions

Prolonged operative time is associated with an increase in the risk of complications. Given the adverse consequences of complications, decreased operative times should be a universal goal for surgeons, hospitals, and policy-makers. Future study is recommended on the evaluation of interventions targeted to reducing operating time.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### When do newborns die? A systematic review of timing of overall and cause-specific neonatal deaths in developing countries [^a9d67ee8]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Data abstraction and synthesis

The following list depicts the steps used to summarize the data from the included studies.

We first made a master chart with the day of life in columns and different studies in rows. For the first week of life, we made columns for each day — that is, day 0, day 1 and so on. For the next 3 weeks, we made columns for the week(s) rather than days (week 2 and weeks 3 to 4), as it was unlikely that the studies would have provided daily mortality rates for the second week onwards.
As it was likely that different studies would have used different terminologies to describe the day of birth, we assumed the following to ensure uniformity across the studies: We considered 0 to 23 h as day 0 of life, 24 to 47 h as day 1, 48 to 71 h as day 2 and so on for studies that mentioned the age in hours. For studies that did not mention the age in hours but reported it as < 1 day, day 1, day 2 and so on, < 1day was considered as 'day 0'. For those studies that did not report either of these two, we examined whether they had reported days 1 to 28 or days 0 to 27 as the neonatal period. For studies reporting deaths from days 1 to 28, we considered day 1 of the study to be 'day 0' for our analysis. Similarly, day 2 was considered as 'day 1', day 3 as 'day 2' and so on. For studies that reported deaths from day 0 to day 27, we used the data as such — that is, day 0 of the study is 'day 0'. For those studies that provided data for 0 to 28 days, we included day 7 figures in the data for the second week.
We then attempted to pool the data for different time points. For pooling, we included only those studies that provided data for at least three time points in the first 4 weeks of life (for example, day 1, day 2 and days 3 to 28; days 1 to 3, days 4 to 7, days 8 to 28; and so on). Studies that provided data for only two time points were simply enumerated in the table but not included in the final analysis.
Pooling of the data was done in three steps: Initially, the data from those studies that provided data for all the time points were pooled to obtain the summary estimate (proportion) for each time point. We then used this summary estimate to calculate the proportion for the missing time points in the other studies (extrapolation). For example, if a study provided data for day 1, day 2 and days 3 to 28, we split the data of 3 to 28 days into data for day 3, day 4, day 5, day 6, week 2 and weeks 3 to 4 based on the proportion obtained from step (i) for these time points. The data — original and extrapolated — were pooled again to obtain the final estimate for each time point.
We made the final graph based on the pooled result for each day in the first week and also for week 1, week 2 and weeks 3 to 4.
For cause-specific mortality, the same steps were carried out for each of the major outcomes — asphyxia, prematurity, sepsis/pneumonia/diarrhea, congenital malformations and others. The denominator was the total number of deaths secondary to a particular cause (for example, asphyxia) while the numerator was the number of deaths due to that cause on a given day.

### Rivaroxaban [^f2929305]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Discontinuation for Surgery and other Interventions

If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other procedures, rivaroxaban tablets should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of rivaroxaban tablets, the increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. Rivaroxaban tablets should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established, noting that the time to onset of therapeutic effect is short [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider administering a parenteral anticoagulant.

2.5 Missed Dose

Adults

- For patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily: if a dose is missed, the patient should take a single 2.5 mg rivaroxaban tablets dose as recommended at the next scheduled time.

- **For patients receiving 15 mg twice daily**: The patient should take rivaroxaban tablets immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg rivaroxaban tablets per day. Two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once.

- **For patients receiving 20 mg, 15 mg or 10 mg once daily**: The patient should take the missed rivaroxaban tablets dose immediately. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.

Pediatric Patients

- If rivaroxaban tablets are taken once a day, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible once it is noticed, but only on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose.

- If rivaroxaban tablets are taken two times a day, the patient should take the missed morning dose as soon as possible once it is noticed. A missed morning dose may be taken together with the evening dose. A missed evening dose can only be taken in the same evening.

- If rivaroxaban tablets are taken three times a day, if a dose is missed, the patient should skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule at the usual time without compensating for the missed dose.

On the following day, the patient should continue with their regular regimen.

The 3 main contributions of this article are the following: (i) the validation of Strum's results on the statistical distribution of case durations, including surgeon effects, using OR databases of 2 European hospitals, (ii) the use of expert prior expectations to predict durations of rarely observed cases, and (iii) the application of the proposed methods to predict case durations, with an analysis of the resulting increase in OR efficiency.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all recorded surgical cases of 2 large European teaching hospitals from 2005 to 2008, involving 85,312 cases and 92,099 h in total. Surgical times tended to be skewed and bounded by some minimally required time. We compared the fit of the normal distribution with that of 2- and 3-parameter lognormal distributions for case durations of a range of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)-anesthesia combinations, including possible surgeon effects. For cases with very few observations, we investigated whether supplementing the data information with surgeons' prior guesses helps to obtain better duration estimates. Finally, we used best fitting duration distributions to simulate the potential efficiency gains in OR scheduling.

Results

The 3-parameter lognormal distribution provides the best results for the case durations of CPT-anesthesia (surgeon) combinations, with an acceptable fit for almost 90% of the CPTs when segmented by the factor surgeon. The fit is best for surgical times and somewhat less for total procedure times. Surgeons' prior guesses are helpful for OR management to improve duration estimates of CPTs with very few (< 10) observations. Compared with the standard way of case scheduling using the mean of the 3-parameter lognormal distribution for case scheduling reduces the mean overreserved OR time per case up to 11.9 (11.8–12.0) min (55.6%) and the mean underreserved OR time per case up to 16.7 (16.5–16.8) min (53.1%). When scheduling cases using the 4-parameter lognormal model the mean overutilized OR time is up to 20.0 (19.7–20.3) min per OR per day lower than for the standard method and 11.6 (11.3–12.0) min per OR per day lower as compared with the biased corrected mean.

Conclusions

OR case scheduling can be improved by using the 3-parameter lognormal model with surgeon effects and by using surgeons' prior guesses for rarely observed CPTs. Using the 3-parameter lognormal model for case-duration prediction and scheduling significantly reduces both the prediction error and OR inefficiency.

Values and preferences in AT9 recommendations — each chapter includes a summary, quantitative wherever possible, of the key values and preferences, and when judgments are particularly relevant or controversial, explicit statements accompany individual recommendations. Because studies showed extensive heterogeneity of patient values and preferences, the developers mandated circumspection in making strong recommendations and "restricted strong recommendations to situations in which the desirable consequences of an intervention substantially and convincingly outweighed the undesirable consequences (or the reverse)" and to unusual situations in which values and preferences are relatively uniform.

### The cost of large numbers of hypothesis tests on power, effect size and sample size [^4b1c0c24]. Molecular Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Results

For a fixed targeted effect size and fixed sample size, power decreases as the number of tests and corresponding critical value increase (Table 1, Figure 2a). If the power for a single test is 80%, the power is approximately 50% for 10; 10% for 1000; and 1% for 100 000 Bonferroni-adjusted tests. To avoid a drop in nominal power without increasing sample size, an investigator may target larger effect sizes (Table 1, Figure 2b) using equation (1). For one million tests, the effect size multiplier is 2.25 at 80% power and 2.08 at 90% power. Suppose it has been determined that a sample of 100 yields 80% power to detect a difference in group means when the mean in group 1 is 10 and the mean in group 2 is 12. The original sample size of 100 would also yield 80% power to detect a mean difference of 2.25 × 2 = 4.50, with Bonferroni adjustment for one million tests. The effect size multiplier works on the scale of the underlying Normally distributed test statistic. For example, effect size multiplication for an OR should be carried out after conversion to the natural log scale. Suppose 500 total cases and controls provide 90% power to detect an OR = 1.2, the effect size multiplier for 90% power and 1000 tests is 1.65. Since log e (1.2) = 0.18, the same sample of 500 yields 90% power in 1000 tests to detect a log e (OR) = 1.65 × 0.18 = 0.30 or, equivalently, an OR = exp(0.30) = 1.35.
