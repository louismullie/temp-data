## Question

Goal Uric acid levels for urate lowering agents?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the goal uric acid (serum urate) levels for urate-lowering therapy in gout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal target for all patients with gout on urate-lowering therapy. Then, I should verify the lower target for severe disease, especially with tophi or frequent flares. Next, I will check the rationale for why these targets are chosen and whether they are evidence-based. After that, I need to consider special populations, particularly chronic kidney disease, and whether the same targets apply. Finally, I will review monitoring cadence, safety considerations, and how to operationalize treat-to-target in practice, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the universal target. For all patients with gout who are on urate-lowering therapy, the recommended serum urate target is less than 6 mg/dL, which equals less than 360 μmol/L, and this is a strong recommendation across contemporary guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology and EULAR, with treat-to-target dose titration to achieve and maintain this level over time [^b2544b44] [^ea2706e3] [^d44e3f77] [^c3ed3875].

> Wait, let me verify the lower target for severe disease. In patients with severe gout — typically defined by tophi, chronic arthropathy, or frequent flares — guidelines advise a more stringent target of less than 5 mg/dL, which equals less than 300 μmol/L, to accelerate crystal dissolution and improve outcomes; this is a conditional recommendation and should be individualized once disease burden improves [^839e9040] [^4d541b27] [^2c25d3da].

> I need to ensure the rationale is sound. The < 6 mg/dL threshold is below the physiologic saturation point of uric acid at approximately 6.8 mg/dL, which prevents new monosodium urate crystal formation and promotes dissolution of existing crystals; achieving this target is associated with fewer flares, tophi resolution, and improved quality of life, and treat-to-target strategies outperform fixed-dose approaches in clinical trials and observational analyses [^1b5a3ff1] [^903698b8] [^cc968c42].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about special populations. In chronic kidney disease, I initially thought the target might need to be higher due to safety concerns, but wait, I should double-check that. Recent high-quality cohort evidence using target trial emulation shows that achieving serum urate less than 6 mg/dL with urate-lowering therapy in patients with gout and CKD stage 3 is not associated with increased risk of progression to severe or end-stage kidney disease, supporting the same < 6 mg/dL target in CKD when gout is present, with careful monitoring and dose adjustments as needed [^8b464110] [^b4b5a624] [^4e556e02].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence to make this actionable. During dose titration, serum urate should be checked every 2 to 5 weeks until the target is reached, then monitored about every 6 months once stable; this cadence balances efficacy and safety and is consistently recommended across ACR guidance and treat-to-target frameworks [^a6d144e2] [^6239eda6] [^577bdd47].

> I will now examine safety and the lower bound of urate. There is no established long-term safety signal for serum urate around 3 to 5 mg/dL in gout patients, and inherited hypouricemia syndromes suggest that very low urate is generally safe; however, guidelines caution against routinely targeting less than 3 mg/dL in the long term and note uncertainty about prolonged very low urate, so I should avoid pushing below 3 mg/dL outside of short-term intensive strategies for refractory disease [^d1733b1f] [^8af18ccb] [^14c628ea].

> But wait, what if the patient has asymptomatic hyperuricemia without gout. I should confirm that urate-lowering therapy is not indicated in that scenario. Current guidelines recommend against initiating pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy for asymptomatic hyperuricemia, so there is no serum urate target in that population; management is focused on lifestyle and addressing comorbidities rather than drug therapy to lower urate [^c2dd3093] [^aba0e820].

> Let me consider how to operationalize treat-to-target in practice. Start low and go slow with allopurinol or febuxostat, titrate every 2 to 5 weeks toward the target, use anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3 to 6 months to mitigate mobilization flares, and escalate therapy by switching XOIs or adding a uricosuric if the target is not achieved on a maximally tolerated XOI dose; this approach aligns with ACR and EULAR guidance and improves target attainment in real-world cohorts [^bea6ab4b] [^49c48f96] [^306c2150] [^8a6bc3ed].

> In summary, I should confirm the final answer clearly. For all patients with gout on urate-lowering therapy, the goal serum urate is less than 6 mg/dL, with a lower goal of less than 5 mg/dL for severe disease featuring tophi, chronic arthropathy, or frequent flares; these targets are supported by strong guideline recommendations and causal evidence linking target achievement to fewer flares and improved outcomes, and they apply even in CKD when gout is present, with appropriate monitoring and dose adjustments [^b2544b44] [^ea2706e3] [^839e9040] [^8b464110].

---

The goal uric acid level for urate-lowering therapy is **< 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L)** for all patients with gout [^b2544b44] [^d44e3f77], with a lower target of **< 5 mg/dL (300 μmol/L)** for severe disease (tophi, frequent flares, or chronic arthropathy) [^839e9040] [^4d541b27]. These targets are below the urate saturation threshold and are supported by major guidelines and evidence showing reduced flares, tophi resolution, and improved quality of life [^1b5a3ff1] [^cc968c42]. For patients with CKD, the same targets apply, and achieving **< 6 mg/dL** is safe and not associated with increased kidney disease progression [^8b464110] [^b4b5a624]. Regular monitoring and dose titration are essential to maintain target levels long term [^a6d144e2] [^577bdd47].

---

## Rationale for uric acid targets

Uric acid is a purine metabolite that, when supersaturated, precipitates as monosodium urate crystals and drives gout pathogenesis [^903698b8]. The solubility limit of uric acid in plasma at 37°C is approximately **6.8 mg/dL**; therefore, maintaining serum urate below this threshold prevents new crystal formation and promotes dissolution of existing deposits [^1b5a3ff1] [^84e0df15].

---

## Evidence-based uric acid targets

Multiple international guidelines converge on a **treat-to-target strategy** with specific serum urate goals:

| **Guideline** | **General target** | **Severe disease target** |
|-|-|-|
| American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2020 | < 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L) | Not explicitly specified, but lower targets are reasonable in severe disease |
| European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2016 | < 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L) | < 5 mg/dL (300 μmol/L) for tophi, frequent flares, or chronic arthropathy |
| British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) 2017 | ≤ 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L) | ≤ 5 mg/dL (300 μmol/L) until tophi resolve, then ≤ 6 mg/dL |

---

These targets are supported by evidence that achieving and maintaining **< 6 mg/dL** reduces gout flares, promotes tophi resolution, and improves quality of life [^cc968c42] [^1b5a3ff1]. Lower targets (** < 5 mg/dL**) are recommended for severe disease to accelerate crystal dissolution and improve outcomes [^839e9040] [^4d541b27].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with achieving target uric acid levels

Achieving target uric acid levels is associated with significant clinical benefits:

- **Reduction in gout flares**: Achieving < 6 mg/dL significantly reduces the frequency of gout flares, with a graded relationship between lower serum urate and fewer flares [^cc968c42] [^88c27058].
- **Tophi resolution**: Sustained urate lowering below 6 mg/dL promotes dissolution of monosodium urate crystals and resolution of tophi [^1b5a3ff1] [^84e0df15].
- **Improved quality of life**: Lower serum urate correlates with better physical function, pain control, and overall quality of life [^notfound].
- **Potential renal benefits**: Lowering uric acid may slow CKD progression in patients with gout and CKD, although evidence is mixed and ongoing research is needed [^8b464110] [^17a8528e].

---

## Special considerations in chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Patients with CKD often have higher baseline uric acid levels and may require dose adjustments of urate-lowering agents. Historically, there were concerns about aggressive urate lowering in CKD due to potential renal toxicity. However, recent evidence suggests that achieving **< 6 mg/dL** is safe and not associated with increased risk of severe or end-stage kidney disease progression in patients with gout and CKD stage 3 [^8b464110] [^b4b5a624]. Therefore, the same targets apply, with careful monitoring and dose titration.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Regular monitoring of serum uric acid is essential to ensure target attainment and maintenance. The ACR recommends checking serum urate every 2–5 weeks during dose titration, then every 6 months once the target is achieved [^a6d144e2]. If targets are not met, therapy should be intensified by increasing the dose, switching agents, or using combination therapy [^49c48f96] [^306c2150].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of aggressive uric acid lowering

Aggressive uric acid lowering to very low levels (** < 3 mg/dL**) has been explored, particularly in refractory gout. While very low urate levels may accelerate crystal dissolution, prolonged hypouricemia may pose theoretical risks, such as increased oxidative stress or neurodegenerative effects, although clinical evidence for harm is limited [^c73ca12f]. Current guidelines advise against maintaining **< 3 mg/dL** long term and recommend balancing benefits and risks [^d1733b1f].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General target**: < 6 mg/dL (360 μmol/L) for all patients with gout on urate-lowering therapy [^b2544b44] [^d44e3f77].
- **Severe disease target**: < 5 mg/dL (300 μmol/L) for patients with tophi, frequent flares, or chronic arthropathy [^839e9040] [^4d541b27].
- **CKD patients**: Same targets apply, with careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^8b464110] [^b4b5a624].
- **Monitoring**: Regular serum urate checks during titration and maintenance phases [^a6d144e2] [^577bdd47].

---

The goal uric acid level for urate-lowering therapy is **< 6 mg/dL** for all patients with gout, with a lower target of **< 5 mg/dL** for severe disease. These targets are evidence-based and supported by major guidelines, aiming to reduce flares, promote crystal dissolution, and improve quality of life. Regular monitoring and individualized therapy adjustments are essential to maintain target levels and optimize outcomes.

### The case for uric acid-lowering treatment in patients with hyperuricaemia and CKD [^e83ec7be]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Hyperuricaemia is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and increases in severity with the deterioration of kidney function. Although existing guidelines for CKD management do not recommend testing for or treatment of hyperuricaemia in the absence of a diagnosis of gout or urate nephrolithiasis, an emerging body of evidence supports a direct causal relationship between serum urate levels and the development of CKD. Here, we review randomized clinical trials that have evaluated the effect of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) on the rate of CKD progression. Among trials in which individuals in the control arm experienced progressive deterioration of kidney function (which we define as ≥ 4ml/min/1.73 m² over the course of the study - typically 6 months to 2 years), treatment with ULT conferred consistent clinical benefits. In contrast, among trials where clinical progression was not observed in the control arm, treatment with ULT was ineffective, but this finding should not be used as an argument against the use of uric acid-lowering therapy. Although additional studies are needed to identify threshold values of serum urate for treatment initiation and to confirm optimal target levels, we believe that sufficient evidence exists to recommend routine measurement of serum urate levels in patients with CKD and consider initiation of ULT among those who are hyperuricaemic with evidence of deteriorating renal function, unless specific contraindications exist.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^647133e7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend to follow a treat-to-target strategy of urate-lowering therapy dose management, rather than a fixed, standard-dose urate-lowering therapy strategy, in all patients with gout taking urate-lowering therapy that includes dose titration and subsequent dosing guided by serial serum urate values to achieve a serum urate target.

### Critical appraisal of serum urate targets in the management of gout [^1b5a3ff1]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Gout management involves two broad aspects: treatment of gout flares to provide rapid symptomatic relief and long-term urate-lowering therapy to lower serum urate sufficiently to prevent gout flares from occurring. All of the major rheumatology societies recommend a target serum urate of < 5mg/dl (< 0.30mmol/l) or < 6mg/dl (< 0.36mmol/l), both of which are below the point of saturation for urate and therefore lead to monosodium urate crystal dissolution. In this Review, we describe the rationale for treat-to-target urate approach in the long-term management of gout and the current evidence and controversy around the appropriate serum urate targets.

### Lowering serum urate with urate-lowering therapy to target and incident fracture among people with gout [^774c5215]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gout is associated with a higher risk of fracture; however, findings on the associations of hyperuricemia and urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with the risk of fracture have been inconsistent. We examined whether lowering serum urate (SU) levels with ULT to a target level (i.e., < 360 μmoles/liter) reduces the risk of fracture among individuals with gout.

Methods

We emulated analyses of a hypothetical target trial using a "cloning, censoring, and weighting" approach to examine the association between lowering SU with ULT to the target levels and the risk of fracture using data from The Health Improvement Network, a UK primary care database. Individuals with gout who were age 40years or older and for whom ULT was initiated were included in the study.

Results

Among 28,554 people with gout, the 5-year risk of hip fracture was 0.5% for the "achieving the target SU level" arm and 0.8% for the "not achieving the target SU level" arm. The risk difference and hazard ratio for the "achieving the target SU level" arm was -0.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -0.5%, -0.1%) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.46, 0.93), respectively, compared with the "not achieving the target SU level" arm. Similar results were observed when the associations between lowering SU level with ULT to the target levels and the risk of composite fracture, major osteoporotic fracture, vertebral fracture, and nonvertebral fracture were assessed.

Conclusion

In this population-based study, lowering the SU level with ULT to the guideline-based target level was associated with a lower risk of incident fracture in people with gout.

### Gout, urate-lowering therapy, and uric acid levels among adults in the United States [^05fd5a8d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Evidence strongly suggests that delivery of gout care is suboptimal. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines emphasize a serum uric acid (SUA) target of < 6 mg/dl when utilizing urate-lowering therapy (ULT). However, the proportion and characteristics of Americans with gout receiving ULT, or with a ULT indication, who are achieving this target is unknown.

Methods

We identified US adults with gout receiving ULT, and those with an indication for ULT, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2007–2010. Using the ACR guidelines, a ULT indication comprised chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2–5, a history of nephrolithiasis, or current ULT use. Demographic and clinical factors associated with an SUA ≥ 6 mg/dl were determined using Poisson regression.

Results

In 2007–2010, an estimated 4.5 million US adults with gout had an indication for ULT; two-thirds had an SUA ≥ 6 mg/dl. In adjusted analyses among those with gout and CKD or nephrolithiasis, those age ≥ 70 years were less likely (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.61–0.97) to have an SUA ≥ 6 mg/dl. Regarding those taking ULT, hypertension was related to a reduced prevalence (PR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30–0.87), whereas diabetes mellitus (PR 1.42, 95% CI 1.06–1.90) and obesity (PR 1.74, 95% CI 1.19–2.56) were each associated with a higher prevalence of an SUA value ≥ 6 mg/dl.

Conclusion

Half of all Americans with gout receiving ULT, and two-thirds with an indication for ULT, have an SUA above target. This study furnishes a meaningful baseline for assessing the effectiveness of the ACR guidelines in future years.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^d44e3f77]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to indications for urate-lowering therapy, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to start urate-lowering therapy at a low dose and then titrate upwards until the serum urate target is reached. Maintain serum urate level < 6 mg/dL (360 mcmol/L) lifelong.

---

### Gout [^52c0da91]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

### Target serum urate achievement and chronic kidney disease progression in patients with gout and kidney disease [^4e556e02]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How does urate-lowering therapy (ULT) affect the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with gout and impaired kidney function?

Findings

This cohort study including 14 792 patients with gout and CKD stage 3 found that lowering serum urate level to less than 6 mg/dL using ULT was not associated with a higher risk of severe or end-stage kidney disease progression compared with those who did not achieve this level with ULT.

Meaning

This finding suggests that achieving serum urate levels less than 6 mg/dL with ULT is well tolerated in patients with gout and CKD stage 3; therefore, optimizing ULT use could benefit both clinicians and patients.

### Asymptomatic hyperuricemia: to treat or not a threat? A clinical and evidence-based approach to the management of hyperuricemia in the context of cardiovascular diseases [^febccd07]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is defined by serum uric acid levels above 6.2mg/dl in women and 7mg/dl in men. In the presence of monosodium urate crystal formation and articular inflammation, hyperuricemia may become symptomatic (namely nephrolithiasis and gout). Uric acid results from purine catabolism and is at the centre of a complex metabolic interplay that involves oxidative stress, inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation and insulin resistance. Uric acid levels present a continuous relation with conditions like hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are reported to have an impact on risk of cardiovascular events. However, whether elevated uric acid is a causal agent and thus a possible therapeutic target is still uncertain and matter of further investigation. Treating symptomatic hyperuricemia involves lowering uric acid drugs and controlling inflammation. Urate-lowering agents are well tolerated but show minimal impact on cardiovascular events in patients with gout. Use of direct-acting urate-lowering agents in asymptomatic hyperuricemia associated with cardiovascular diseases does not warrant a clear benefit, whereas addressing cardiovascular issues with guideline-recommended therapies lowers uric acid and reduces the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Regular assessment of uric acid and clinical symptoms is advised before starting and renewing a urate-lowering treatment.

### Safety of urate-lowering therapies: managing the risks to gain the benefits [^fc6a2400]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a metabolic disorder of purine metabolism and uric acid elimination. Over time, acute gout can develop into a chronic, disabling arthropathy, often associated with multiple comorbidities. Gout patients have often been undertreated, partly because of the clinician's perceived risks of a therapy outweighing its potential benefits. The approval of new therapies to treat hyperuricemia in gout has led to a new understanding of gout management and medication safety regarding new and old therapies. This review focuses on potential safety issues of currently available urate-lowering therapies and outlines strategies to minimize risks so their benefits can be reached.

### Serum uric acid and the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease [^5d4318e1]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence suggests that chronic hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the need for greater attention to serum uric acid levels when profiling patients, and suggests that the threshold above which uricemia is considered abnormal is 6 mg/dl, in light of the available evidence. Another important question is whether lowering serum uric acid can improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and what therapeutic mechanism of action could provide more clinical benefits to patients; the available literature shows a trend toward improvement associated with administration of urate-lowering drugs, in particular for the xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The demonstrated efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on outcomes other than gout flares leads to the consideration that treatment may be beneficial even in the absence of overt gout when hyperuricemia accompanies other clinical conditions, such as urate deposition, advanced CKD or cardiovascular risk factors.

### Reassessing serum urate targets in the management of refractory gout: can you go too low? [^14c628ea]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Growing awareness of patients with refractory gout is prompting a reassessment of treatment strategy. This article reviews the current practice of targeting serum urate concentrations (sUA) in the mid-normal range (roughly 4–6 mg/dl) and considers the rationale for more aggressively lowering sUA in patients with poorly controlled chronic gout. Some hypothetical concerns with inducing hypouricemia are considered and relevant clinical evidence is evaluated.

Recent Findings

Recent studies confirm the benefits of modestly reducing sUA in many gout patients. However, tophi and tissue stores of monosodium urate crystals resolve slowly, particularly in patients with longstanding disease. Consistent with physicochemical principles, the rate of decrease in tophus size increases with a reduction in sUA concentration over a broad range. Reducing sUA to near or below 2 mg/dl can be achieved in some patients with current urate-lowering drugs, but new drugs now under investigation may be more effective. As a free radical scavenger, uric acid has been postulated to protect from oxidative stress. However, inherited disorders associated with profound, lifelong hypouricemia indicate that maintaining sUA near or below 2 mg/dl would probably be safe.

Summary

Targeting low sUA could improve the elimination of tissue urate stores and achieve better control of disease in patients with refractory gout.

### Improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes in gout: what should we target? [^211fa663]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that hyperuricaemia and gout are intricately linked with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. A number of studies suggest that hyperuricaemia and gout are independent risk factors for the development of these conditions and that these conditions account, in part, for the increased mortality rate of patients with gout. In this Review, we first discuss the links between hyperuricaemia, gout and these comorbidities, and present the mechanisms by which uric acid production and gout might favour the development of cardiovascular and renal diseases. We then emphasize the potential benefit of urate-lowering therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with hyperuricaemia. The mechanisms that link elevated serum uric acid levels and gout with these comorbidities seem to be multifactorial, implicating low-grade systemic inflammation and xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, as well as the deleterious effects of hyperuricaemia itself. Patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia should be treated by nonpharmacological means to lower their SUA levels. In patients with gout, long-term pharmacological inhibition of XO is a treatment strategy that might also reduce cardiovascular and renal comorbidities, because of its dual effect of lowering SUA levels as well as reducing free-radical production during uric acid formation.

### Failure to reach uric acid target of… [^b7e11e08]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout has emerged as the most common inflammatory arthritis in men, as well as one of the most common causes of arthritis in elderly women in high-income countriesA large body of evidence incriminates gout as a major determinant of mortality, both total and cardiovascular (CV). This risk increases with the severity of the gout. Treatment of gout has not been consistently associated with reductions in mortalitydue to the fact that serum uric acid (sUA)–mortality associations have not been sufficiently explored while on therapy.

International guidelines recommend target sUA levels of below 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) to reduce the frequency of gout flares and morbidity, although many treating physicians accept higher threshold values. High baseline sUA levels plus tophi are associated with elevated mortality, suggesting a plausible pathophysiological link between greater total body urate load and CV disease. It is speculated that patients with sUA levels beyond 0.36 mmol/L experience increased mortality despite urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and, therefore, a target threshold of at least < 0.36 mmol/L should be set as the desired threshold based on this premise.

We recently reported a strong independent association between the severity of gout and increased mortality, but this was during a period when the concept of treat-to-target was not yet established and the optimal target levels were not clearly defined. During this period, most patients were on active ULTs and patients not on target had short periods of follow-up. In this current study, we have expanded the primary cohort of patients with gout and the period of follow-up in order to explore the association of achieved sUA levels with mortality. Our objective was to determine whether elevated sUA levels and their pharmacological control are associated with increased total and CV mortality.

### Association of uric acid-lowering therapy with incident chronic kidney disease [^1f4a7e64]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We examined the association of urate-lowering therapies (vs no therapies) with the outcomes of interest using a target trial emulation with an intention-to-treat–like design. We used the intention-to-treat principle from randomized trials (the treatment exposure at cohort entry is carried forward irrespective of future treatment status) to model a trial in which patients initiating de novo urate-lowering therapy are compared with untreated comparators who are included (as a simulation of trial recruitment) within the same 180-day calendar period. We described actual exposure to uric acid–lowering therapy in the treated group by calculating the proportion of days covered (PDC; the proportion of days during which a treated individual had access to the drug during the follow-up period). Treated patients started follow-up on the date of receiving the first de novo prescription, while untreated patients entered follow-up on an assigned date randomly chosen based on the start of follow-up dates in the treatment exposure group, occurring after the measurement of a first serum uric acid level but before the occurrence of a potential outcome or censoring date, with the exclusion of patients whose randomly assigned entry dates fell outside of these dates.

### Refractory gout: what is it and what to do about it? [^ebebeea4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to discuss the defining characteristics of refractory gout and the pharmacological management of this problem.

Recent Findings

Refractory gout refers to those patients who have ongoing symptoms of active disease and cannot maintain a target serum urate less than 6 mg/dl. Patients with refractory gout have reduced quality of life, functional impairment, and joint destruction. Multiple factors contribute to refractory gout, and they often relate to delayed or insufficient dosing with allopurinol. Chronic kidney disease imparts a dose limitation on allopurinol that further impairs the effectiveness of urate-lowering therapy. Febuxostat, a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor, represents a potential alternative to allopurinol in refractory gout patients. Uricase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of uric acid into allantoin, is showing promise with its ability to rapidly diminish serum urate levels. The recently defined role of the NALP3 inflammasome in the inflammatory phase of gout suggests a potential role for interleukin-1 inhibition in urate crystal-induced inflammation.

Summary

Refractory gout occurs when urate levels are not adequately controlled. Emerging therapies may improve the clinical course of patients with recalcitrant disease.

### Failure to reach uric acid target of… [^bc41ca41]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Severe gout is associated with cardiovascular mortality.
Achieving and maintaining a serum uric acid target below normal levels (< 0.36 mmol/L or 6 mg/dL) in the first year reduces the risk of dying substantially.
Lower uric acid level targets should be recommended for hyperuricaemic patients with gout. This information may help increase adherence to treatment if well explained to patients.

In conclusion, after implementing a strategy designed to optimize care for people hospitalized with gout flares, > 90% of patients were initiated on ULT. In the context of a single, nurse-led follow-up appointment, relative improvements in urate target attainment were observed; however, for the majority of hospitalized gout patients to achieve target urate levels, better in-hospital gout care needs to be accompanied by strategies that embed and support optimization of ULT in primary care.

### Gout [^903698b8]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease of deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which form in the presence of increased urate concentrations. Although environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin 1β have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A "treat to target serum urate" approach is essential for effective gout management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360 μmol/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide, rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout care are needed.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^d109f4d6]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^fa894f3f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### Improving the use of allopurinol in chronic gout: monitoring oxypurinol levels to guide therapy [^0296d1df]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), adjusted to achieve and maintain a serum uric acid (SUA) of < 6 mg/dl, remains the standard of care for the chronic management of gout. New urate-lowering medications are important options; however, these agents should be reserved for patients who do not tolerate or cannot achieve SUA < 6 mg/dl on allopurinol. The result of oxypurinol monitoring to guide allopurinol therapy suggests that allopurinol should still be considered first-line ULT for gout.

### Uric acid as a target of therapy in CKD [^513fec8e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased and will continue to increase in the United States and worldwide. This is alarming considering that CKD is an irreversible condition and patients who progress to chronic kidney failure have reduced quality of life and high mortality rates. As such, it is imperative to identify modifiable risk factors to develop strategies to slow CKD progression. One such factor is hyperuricemia. Recent observational studies have associated hyperuricemia with kidney disease. In addition, hyperuricemia is largely prevalent in patients with CKD. Data from experimental studies have shown several potential mechanisms by which hyperuricemia may contribute to the development and progression of CKD. In this article, we offer a critical review of the experimental evidence linking hyperuricemia to CKD, highlight gaps in our knowledge on the topic as it stands today, and review the observational and interventional studies that have examined the potential nephroprotective effect of decreasing uric acid levels in patients with CKD. Although uric acid also may be linked to cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with CKD, this review focuses only on uric acid as a potential therapeutic target to prevent kidney disease onset and progression.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^c1ebc32e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Serum uric acid and the risk of incident and recurrent gout: a systematic review [^88c27058]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Lowering serum uric acid (SUA) levels can essentially cure gout; however, this is not widely practiced. To summarize epidemiologic evidence related to this causal link, we conducted a systematic review of the published literature reporting the association between SUA level and incident and recurrent gout (i.e., gout flares).

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using separate search strategies for incident gout and recurrent gout. We screened 646 abstracts to identify 8 eligible articles reporting gout incidence and 913 abstracts to identify 18 articles reporting recurrent gout.

Results

For both gout incidence and recurrence, a graded trend was observed where the risk was increased with higher SUA levels. Gout incidence rates per 1000 person-years from population-based studies ranged from 0.8 (SUA ≤ 6 mg/dl) to 70.2 cases (SUA ≥ 10 mg/dl). Recurrent gout risk in clinical cohorts ranged from 12% (SUA ≤ 6 mg/dl) to 61% (SUA ≥ 9 mg/dl) among those receiving urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and 3.7% (SUA 6–7 mg/dl) to 61% (SUA > 9.3 mg/dl) after successful ULT. Retrospective database studies also showed a graded relationship, although the strength of the association was weaker. Studies reporting mean flares or time-to-flare according to SUA showed similar findings.

Conclusion

This systematic review confirms that higher SUA levels are associated with increased risk of incident and recurrent gout in a graded manner. Although few prospective cohorts have evaluated incident and recurrent gout according to SUA, the existing evidence underscores the need to treat to SUA targets, as recommended by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism.

### Target serum urate achievement and chronic kidney disease progression in patients with gout and kidney disease [^8b464110]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Clinicians often approach urate-lowering therapy (ULT) cautiously in patients with gout and impaired kidney function because they are concerned about the risk of progression to severe or end-stage kidney disease. However, evidence from randomized clinical trials of this association remains inconclusive.

Objective

To evaluate the association between achieving target serum urate level with ULT and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to severe or end-stage in patients with gout and impaired kidney function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cohort study using the target trial emulation approach using data from a general practice database (IQVIA Medical Research Database) for 2000 to 2023. Eligible patients were 40 to 89 years old and had gout and CKD stage 3. Data analyses were performed from November 2023 to September 2024.

Exposures

Lowering serum urate level to target level (< 6 mg/dL) using ULT.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Severe or end-stage kidney disease, determined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 on at least 2 occasions more than 90 days apart within 1 year, or at least 1 Read code (per the Refined Etiology, Anatomical Site, and Diagnosis classification) for CKD stages 4 or 5, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplant. The prespecified noninferiority margin of the hazard ratio (HR) was set at 1.2, comparing those who achieved the target serum urate level with those who did not.

Results

Among the 14 792 participants (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [9.5] years; 9215 men [62.3%] and 5577 women [37.7%]) with gout and with CKD stage 3, the 5-year risk of severe or end-stage kidney disease was 10.32% for those who achieved the target serum urate level and 12.73% for those who did not. Compared with those not achieving the target level, the adjusted 5-year risk difference and HR of severe or end-stage kidney disease for patients achieving the target serum urate level was -2.41% (95% CI, -4.61% to -0.21%) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cohort study indicate that in patients with gout and CKD stage 3, lowering serum urate level to less than 6 mg/dL vs 6 mg/dL or greater using ULT was not associated with an increased risk of severe or end-stage kidney disease. These findings support optimizing ULT to achieve target serum urate levels when treating patients with gout and impaired kidney function.

### Serum uric acid: a risk factor and a target for treatment? [^0e0e2bdc]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Serum uric acid was first noted to be associated with increased BP by Frederick Mohamed in the 1870s. Although the link was rediscovered periodically over the years, it generally was dismissed as a surrogate marker for decreased renal function that led to increased uric acid and increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular (CV) disease. Recently, however, several lines of evidence suggest that increased serum uric acid may be a significant modifiable risk factor. Increased serum uric acid is associated with increased risk for future hypertension in several large longitudinal clinical trials as well as an independent risk factor for poor CV prognosis. Animal model experiments demonstrate that increased serum uric acid causes increased BP that initially is reversible but becomes irreversible, salt sensitive, and uric acid independent over time. The mechanisms include the direct action of uric acid on smooth muscle and vascular endothelial cells. Finally, in adolescents with new-onset essential hypertension, the prevalence of elevated serum uric acid is > 90%, and preliminary clinical trial evidence suggests that agents that lower serum uric acid may lower BP in this select population. Although the investigations are still preliminary, serum uric acid represents a possible new and intriguing target for the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension and CV disease.

### Target serum urate achievement and chronic kidney disease progression in patients with gout and kidney disease [^b86d4904]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a common chronic inflammatory arthritis that affects 1% to 5% of adults worldwide, and projections indicate a continued increase in the coming years. Gout flares are associated with severe pain, poor quality of life, and a transient increase in major cardiovascular and venous thrombotic events. Given that hyperuricemia is a known causal risk factor for gout, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is the cornerstone of long-term management. Experts propose optimal ULT administration as a remission-inducing measure for gout, and treating to a serum urate target of less than 6 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0595) has successfully reduced gout flares over the long-term and improved overall outcomes in recent trials. Rheumatology societies, such as the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology, endorse this treat-to-target approach as best practice. Despite these recommendations, approximately half of the patients with gout receive ULT and achieve the target serum urate level (TSUL) in clinical general practice, where most patients with gout are treated, remains below 30%. Several factors, including lack of monitoring and treatment interruptions, may contribute to this discrepancy.

The discrepancy is further compounded by the frequent comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is present in 20% to 30% or more of patients with gout. Hyperuricemia is associated with a higher risk of kidney disease; however, there is a lack of conclusive evidence on whether ULT may worsen kidney function among patients with gout and CKD. Observational studies, and randomized clinical trials (RCTs), conducted in individuals with hyperuricemia and impaired kidney function have shown protective effects against CKD progression. Three RCTs reported no apparent difference in kidney function decline between ULT and placebo among patients with impaired kidney function. However, these trials included participants with CKD but without gout, type 1 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease regardless of gout status, and CKD with hyperuricemia; none specifically focused on patients with gout. Only 1 RCT assessed ULT among patients with gout with moderate to severe kidney function impairment, and the results did not show a significant difference in kidney function between febuxostat and placebo groups. However, it did not assess whether lowering serum urate to a target level (ie, < 6 mg/dL), as recommended by professional rheumatology societies, was associated with the risk of CKD progression.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^189a75ce]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### Mechanisms and rationale for uricase use in patients with gout [^52885f18]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol and febuxostat have been the mainstay urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for treating hyperuricaemia in patients with gout. However, not all patients receiving oral ULT achieve the target serum urate level, in part because some patients cannot tolerate, or have actual or misconceived contraindications to, their use, mainly due to comorbidities. ULT dosage is also limited by formularies and clinical inertia. This failure to sufficiently lower serum urate levels can lead to difficult-to-treat or uncontrolled gout, usually due to poorly managed and/or under-treated gout. In species other than humans, uricase (urate oxidase) converts urate to allantoin, which is more soluble in urine than uric acid. Exogenic uricases are an exciting therapeutic option for patients with gout. They can be viewed as enzyme replacement therapy. Uricases are being used to treat uncontrolled gout, and can achieve rapid reduction of hyperuricaemia, dramatic resolution of tophi, decreased chronic joint pain and improved quality of life. Availability, cost and uricase immunogenicity have limited their use. Uricases could become a leading choice in severe and difficult-to-treat gout as induction and/or debulking therapy (that is, for lowering of the urate pool) to be followed by chronic oral ULT. This Review summarizes the evidence regarding available uricases and those in the pipeline, their debulking effect and their outcomes related to gout and beyond.

### Treating to target: a strategy to cure gout [^84e0df15]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi. Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

### What is allopurinol failure and what should we Do about It? [^126e1560]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Allopurinol is the most widely used urate-lowering medication worldwide. However, allopurinol failure is frequently observed in clinical practice. In this review, we provide a framework for assessing allopurinol failure, which includes failure of allopurinol to control serum urate concentrations, failure of allopurinol to control clinical symptoms, and failure of allopurinol due to an adverse drug reaction. Understanding the causes of allopurinol failure underpins the approach required to turn failure into success in gout management.

### Intensive serum urate lowering with oral urate-lowering therapy for erosive gout: a randomized double-blind controlled trial [^8c6f4d12]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a therapeutic approach of intensive serum urate lowering results in improved bone erosion scores in patients with erosive gout.

Methods

We undertook a 2-year, double-blind randomized controlled trial of 104 participants with erosive gout who were receiving serum urate-lowering therapy orally and who had serum urate levels of ≥ 0.30mmoles/liter at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intensive serum urate target of < 0.20mmoles/liter or a standard target of < 0.30mmoles/liter (considered the standard according to rheumatology guidelines). Oral serum urate-lowering therapy was titrated to target using a standardized protocol (with the maximum approved doses of allopurinol, probenecid, febuxostat, and benzbromarone). The primary end point was the total computed tomography (CT) bone erosion score. Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) gout core outcome domains were secondary end points.

Results

Although the serum urate levels were significantly lower in the intensive target group compared to the standard target group over the study period (P = 0.002), fewer participants in the intensive target group achieved the randomized serum urate target level by year 2 (62% versus 83% of patients in the standard target group; P < 0.05). The intensive target group required higher doses of allopurinol (mean ± SD 746 ± 210 mg/day versus 497 ± 186 mg/day; P < 0.001) and received more combination therapy (P = 0.0004) compared to the standard target group. We observed small increases in CT bone erosion scores in both serum urate target groups over 2years, with no between-group difference (P = 0.20). OMERACT core outcome domains (gout flares, tophi, pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, health-related quality of life, and activity limitation) improved in both groups over 2 years, with no between-group differences. Adverse event and serious adverse event rates were similar between the groups.

Conclusion

Compared to a serum urate target of < 0.30mmoles/liter, more intensive serum urate lowering is difficult to achieve with an oral urate-lowering therapy. Intensive serum urate lowering leads to a high medication burden and does not improve bone erosion scores in patients with erosive gout.

### Uric acid lowering therapies for preventing or delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease [^875a9358]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-randomised data have shown a link between hyperuricaemia and the progression or development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). If this is correct, urate lowering therapy might form an important part of chronic kidney disease care, reducing risks for cardiovascular outcomes and end-stage kidney disease.

Objectives

This review aims to study the benefits and harms of uric acid lowering therapy on the progression of CKD and other cardiovascular endpoints.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 20 July 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials testing primary urate lowering therapy in patients with or without CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales were used.

Main Results

Twelve studies (1187 participants) were included in the review. Risk of bias was unclear for the majority of domains in each study. Uric acid lowering therapy may make little or no difference in death at six months (2 studies, 498 participants: RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.48) or two years (2 studies, 220 participants): RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.06) (low certainty evidence). Uric acid lowering therapy may make little of no difference (low certainty evidence) in the incidence of ESKD at one or two years. Kidney function may be improved by uric acid lowering therapy at one year with a reduction in serum creatinine (2 studies, 83 participants: MD -73.35 µmol/L, 95% CI -107.28 to -39.41) and a rise in eGFR (1 study, 113 participants: MD 5.50 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 95% CI 0.59 to 10.41). However it probably makes little or no difference to eGFR at two years (2 studies, 164 participants: MD 4.00 mL/min, 95% CI -3.28 to 11.28). Uric acid lowering therapy reduced uric acid levels at all time points (3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 months) (high certainty evidence). There is insufficient evidence to support an effect on blood pressure, proteinuria or other cardiovascular markers by uric acid lowering therapy. It should be noted that the apparent benefits of treatment were not apparent at all time points, introducing the potential for bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited data which suggests uric acid lowering therapy may prevent progression of chronic kidney disease but the conclusion is very uncertain. Benefits were not observed at all time points and study quality was generally low. Larger studies are required to study the effect of uric acid lowering therapy on CKD progression. Three ongoing studies will hopefully provide much needed high quality data.

### Potential dangers of serum urate-lowering therapy [^c73ca12f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In observational studies, high serum urate levels are associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality. However, the hypothesis that urate-lowering may improve nongout outcomes has not been confirmed by placebo-controlled clinical trials. On the contrary, 7 recent placebo-controlled trials of urate-lowering drugs with different mechanisms of action (uricosuric: lesinurad; xanthine oxidase inhibition: febuxostat; uricase: pegloticase) have observed higher mortality or trends to higher mortality in gout patients, with the largest decreases in serum urate. Because all urate-lowering mechanisms were implicated, this raises safety concerns about urate-lowering itself. Far from unexpected, the higher mortality associated with more intense urate-lowering is in line with the U-shaped association of urate with mortality in some observational studies. Urate accounts for most of the antioxidant capacity of plasma, and strategies to increase urate are undergoing clinical trials in neurological disease. Post hoc analysis of recent trials should explore whether the magnitude of urate-lowering is associated with adverse outcomes, and safety trials are needed before guidelines recommend lowering serum urate below certain thresholds.

### Association of uric acid-lowering therapy with incident chronic kidney disease [^02c924ed]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Elevated serum uric acid can be lowered using readily available therapies; hence, the impact of uric acid level on various clinical outcomes can be studied in clinical trials using such treatments. Smaller trials have suggested benefits from lowering serum uric acid levels in patients with preexisting kidney disease, but 2 large randomized clinical trials examining reducing uric acid in patients with type 1 diabetes and in patients without diabetes found that treatment of hyperuricemia did not result in improved progression of preexisting kidney disease. The impact of urate-lowering therapies on the incidence of new-onset CKD has been less well studied in clinical trials. While some have suggested that uric acid lowering is beneficial in preventing the development of CKD, the quality of these trials has been low; hence, their results are not conclusive.

Our findings of higher risk of incident CKD and albuminuria in patients with less severe elevations of serum uric concentration treated with urate lowering therapy may appear surprising, as we hypothesized that the lowering of uric acid levels would be beneficial owing to the detrimental effects of uric acid on various metabolic and cardiovascular processes. While it is possible that the higher risk associated with urate-lowering therapy was due to residual confounding, we cannot exclude the possibility that the administration of allopurinol (the uric acid–lowering agent used in most of our cohort) could also be deleterious. Allopurinol has a known potential to cause acute allergic reactions and could cause acute kidney injury by inducing acute interstitial nephritis. We used a robust definition of incident CKD, which is less likely to be affected by transient elevations of serum creatinine, but acute kidney injury events could potentially contribute to the development of CKD, thus explaining our findings.

### An update on the management of gout [^98645b9a]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

### Determinants of achieving serum urate goal with Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy in gout [^c388cf45]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Using trial data comparing treat-to-target allopurinol and febuxostat in gout, we examined participant characteristics associated with serum urate (SU) goal achievement.

Methods

Participants with gout and SU ≥ 6.8 mg/dL were randomized to allopurinol or febuxostat, titrated during weeks 0 to 24, and maintained weeks 25 to 48. Participants were considered to achieve SU goal if the mean SU from weeks 36, 42, and 48 was < 6.0 mg/dL or < 5 mg/dL if tophi were present. Possible determinants of treatment response were preselected and included sociodemographics, comorbidities, diuretic use, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), body mass index, and gout measures. Determinants of SU response were assessed using multivariable logistic regression with additional analyses to account for treatment adherence.

Results

Of 764 study participants completing week 48, 618 (81%) achieved SU goal. After multivariable adjustment, factors associated with a greater likelihood of SU goal achievement included older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.40 per 10years), higher education (aOR 2.02), and better HRQoL (aOR 1.17 per 0.1 unit). Factors associated with a lower odds of SU goal achievement included non-White race (aORs 0.32–0.47), higher baseline SU (aOR 0.83 per 1 mg/dL), presence of tophi (aOR 0.29), and the use of diuretics (aOR 0.52). Comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease were not associated with SU goal achievement. Results were not meaningfully changed in analyses accounting for adherence.

Conclusions

Several patient-level factors were predictive of SU goal achievement among patients with gout who received treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy (ULT). Approaches that accurately predict individual responses to treat-to-target ULT hold promise in facilitating personalized management and improving outcomes in patients with gout.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^f268e741]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Urate-lowering therapies

The appropriate use of ULT in people with gout and CKD is one of the most controversial areas of gout management. For example, the latest guidelines issued by the ACR, EULAR and the British Society for Rheumatology differ in important areas, such as allopurinol dosing in people with CKD. For drugs used as ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, benzbromarone, lesinurad and pegloticase), efficacy outcomes, as endorsed by most rheumatology professional society management guidelines, include achieving a target serum urate concentration (that is, < 6 mg/dl or < 5 mg/dl), resolution of tophi, reduction or elimination of gout flares over time, improvement in quality of life indicators, and radiographic changes. For this G-CAN Consensus Statement, safety outcomes for each drug were individualized. The general issues identified as well as specific issues with individual drugs are discussed below and the G-CAN proposed research priorities are outlined in Box 4.

### Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy and hospitalizations for gout: results from a nationwide cohort study in england [^b145f570]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hospitalizations for gout flares have increased markedly in recent years, on a background of an increasing prevalence of gout and sub-optimal management. In England, hospitalizations for gout doubled between 2006 and 2020. Hospitalizations due to gout also doubled in the United States, Canada and Sweden, contrasting large decreases in admissions for rheumatoid arthritis. Despite this, few studies have investigated strategies to prevent avoidable gout admissions.

Gout is unique among the inflammatory arthritides, in that there are curative medications that prevent flares: urate-lowering therapies (ULT), such as allopurinol and febuxostat. The benefits of ULT are well recognized in primary care settings. A large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that ULT, when titrated to achieve a serum urate (SU) below the saturation threshold for crystal formation (< 360 micromol/l), significantly reduced the frequency of gout flares at 2 years compared with usual care [risk ratio (RR) 0.33; 95% CI 0.19, 0.57]. However, in the short term, initiation and titration of ULT can precipitate flares: the frequency of gout flares with treat-to-target ULT in the first year of this trial exceeded that observed with usual care (RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.05, 1.77).

What is not known is whether treat-to-target ULT prevents hospitalizations for gout. Using a population-level dataset with over 290 000 people with incident gout, we investigated two primary objectives: (i) the impact of ULT, with and without colchicine prophylaxis, on the risk of hospitalizations for gout; and (ii) whether attaining target SU levels influences the risk of hospitalizations following ULT initiation.

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^8071efc0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### Urate-lowering treatment and risk of total joint replacement in patients with gout [^d591df0a]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Currently there are no explicit evidence-based recommendations concerning when in the clinical course of gout patients should be considered for ULT. Current trends increasingly favour early intervention with ULT, even around the time of first diagnosis, to prevent further crystal deposition and long-term complications such as subcutaneous tophi and joint damage, rather than waiting until these have occurred. This is indirectly supported by previous studies showing frequent attacks in untreated patients and a high prevalence of associated co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease and urolithiasis. Our previous study using UK CPRD data found that many co-morbidities, including OA, are more frequently observed in patients at the time of diagnosis of gout compared with matched people without gout, indicating that damage occurred earlier than clinically apparent gout. The current study further demonstrates that such existing joint damage may already be irreversible at diagnosis. An alternative explanation for the lack of effect of ULT in reducing the risk of TJR is that many people prescribed ULT are not 'treated to target' by up-titration of ULT against serial serum urate levels until a target level below the saturation point for MSU crystal formation is reached. More studies are needed to ascertain the possible beneficial effects of ULT prescribed according to individualized 'treat-to-target' recommendations to prevent joint damage in asymptomatic people with hyperuricaemia.

### Recent evidence on the effect of urate-lowering treatment on the progression of kidney disease [^17a8528e]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Several observational studies have shown that hyperuricemia is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and is a potential therapeutic target in people with CKD. This review discusses the results of three recently published placebo-controlled randomized trials evaluating the effect of urate-lowering treatment on the progression of CKD with at least 2years of follow-up.

Recent Findings

The Febuxostat versus Placebo Randomized Controlled Trial Regarding Reduced Renal Function in Patients with Hyperuricemia Complicated by Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3 trial evaluated the effect of febuxostat in 443 patients with stage 3 CKD (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 45mL/min/1.73m2) and asymptomatic hyperuricemia (mean serum urate 7.8mg/dL). The Controlled trial of slowing of Kidney Disease progression From the Inhibition of Xanthine oxidase and Preventing Early Renal Loss in Diabetes trials respectively evaluated the effect of allopurinol in 369 adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD (mean eGFR 31.7mL/min/1.73m2, mean serum urate 8.2mg/dL) with high progression risk and 530 patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (mean eGFR 74.7mL/min/1.73m2, mean serum urate 6.1mg/dL). Despite the large and sustained reductions in serum urate levels in all 3 trials, urate-lowering treatment with febuxostat or allopurinol did not result in clinically meaningful improvement in kidney outcomes.

Summary

The results of large and well-designed placebo-controlled trials do not support the use of urate-lowering therapy to slow the progression of CKD.

### Failure to reach uric acid target of… [^28a5ded0]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

To put things in context, the prevalence of gout in adults in the USA has been estimated in 3.7% and the prevalence of gout with an indication of ULT in 2.2% (4.5 million people). Of the latter, target sUA may only be achieved in half of the patients. Very high sUA levels have been reported in association with atherogenesis, independently from HT and other CV risk factors. Some concerns have also been raised on the impact of excessive lowering of sUA, as studies have shown that hypouricaemia is correlated with endothelial dysfunction. The evidence to support this, however, is limited. Taken together, there is increasing evidence to support lower sUA thresholds of at least 6 mg/dL in patients with gout to improve survival.

We and others have advocated for earlier intervention in gout primarily to avoid exposure to long-standing hyperuricaemia and reduce the risk of chronic tophaceous gout. The treat-to-target strategy represents a global effort to improve gout control by reducing acute gout flares, preventing chronic tophaceaous gout and its attendant morbidity. The findings from this study also support a treat-to target strategy for improving the outcomes of patients with gout by preventing low grade inflammation and reducing the risks of CV and total mortality.

Using the ACR's Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness registry, we examined the use of a treat-to-target approach among gout patients receiving long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and followed longitudinally by rheumatologists.

Methods

Included patients had one or more diagnoses for gout in 2018–2019 and continuous use of ULT for ≥ 12 months. We assessed the proportions of patients with SU monitoring and, among those tested, who achieved SU < 6.0 mg/dl during the measurement year. Multilevel logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographics, comorbidities, region, and health care utilization was used to determine factors associated with SU monitoring and achievement of target SU.

Results

A total of 9,560 were included. The mean ± SD age was 67.2 ± 12.7 years, 73.5% of patients were male, and 32.3% were non-White. Fifty-six percent of patients had at least 1 SU recorded during the measurement year; among patients with at least 1 SU recorded, 74% achieved the SU target. In multivariate analyses, non-White patients were slightly less likely to be tested or achieve a target SU.

Conclusion

Among gout patients receiving long-term ULT followed longitudinally by rheumatologists, more than half had a documented SU, and among those tested, three-quarters achieved the recommended SU target. Routine monitoring of SU is a first step toward improving quality of care for patients with gout.

### Management of gout and hyperuricemia in CKD [^afcef254]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperuricemia and gout, the clinical manifestation of monosodium urate crystal deposition, are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the presence of CKD poses additional challenges in gout management, effective urate lowering is possible for most patients with CKD. Initial doses of urate-lowering therapy are lower than in the non-CKD population, whereas incremental dose escalation is guided by regular monitoring of serum urate levels to reach the target level of < 6mg/dL (or < 5mg/dL for patients with tophi). Management of gout flares with presently available agents can be more challenging due to potential nephrotoxicity and/or contraindications in the setting of other common comorbid conditions. At present, asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not an indication for urate-lowering therapy, though emerging data may support a potential renoprotective effect.

### Implementing Treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^74881d77]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prior to implementation, only 10% of patients achieved a serum urate ≤ 360 μmol/l within 6 months of discharge. After implementation, urate target attainment more than doubled, to 26.8%. Despite this relative improvement, absolute levels of urate target attainment remained far below those seen in the Nottingham primary care trial (95% attainment by 12 months). Similarly, target attainment was below that reported in the BSR National Audit of outpatient gout management by UK rheumatologists (45% attainment by 12 months), and only modestly better than what was reported in a UK-wide analysis of post-discharge gout care (1184/7040 [16.8%] patients attaining urate ≤ 360 μmol/l within 12 months of hospitalization). There are several possible reasons for this. Follow-up in our study was relatively short at only 6 months. Patients in our study were all hospitalized for gout, and therefore are likely to represent a more severe cohort. Perhaps most importantly, in the Nottingham study there were an average of 17 study visits per participant over a 24-month period. In contrast, our gout follow-up clinic was delivered as a single telephone appointment, followed by handover of care to patients' primary care teams. Indeed, target attainment in our study was comparable to that seen in the usual care group of the Nottingham trial (26.8% vs 26.2%, respectively). Thus, our findings strongly suggest that our intervention, while effective at facilitating ULT initiation, is insufficient for the majority of people hospitalized for gout flares to achieve target urate levels.

, as well as the treatment of gout in the primary care setting. Although the presence of monosodium urate crystals in joint aspirate remains the diagnostic standard, the Diagnostic Rule and the Clinical Gout Diagnosis decision tools predicted gout with 88% and 97% sensitivity and 75% and 96% specificity, respectively. |Insufficient: ○ ○ ○ Research is either unavailable or does not permit estimation of a treatment effect. | NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids were all effective in reducing the pain of acute gout. Low-dose colchicine reduces pain compared with placebo, and is as effective as a higher dosage with fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects. Allopurinol and febuxostat effectively lower serum urate levels but do not reduce the frequency of gout attacks in the first six months of therapy. The use of colchicine or NSAIDs in combination with urate-lowering therapy reduces the increased risk of gout attacks associated with initiation of urate-lowering therapy. After 12 months, urate-lowering therapy reduces the frequency of gout attacks. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether dietary and lifestyle changes are effective for managing gout; however, it is reasonable to recommend reducing dietary purines, red meat, shellfish, sugary drinks, and alcohol while encouraging weight loss and physical activity.

1. The American College of Physicians used this AHRQ review to develop diagnostic and treatment guidelines with concordant conclusions: moderate evidence to support the use of clinical decision tools; low-quality evidence for dual-energy computed tomography or ultrasonography to improve diagnostic accuracy; and strong evidence for NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and colchicine for acute gout attacks.

2, 3 The ACP guidelines differ from those of the American College of Rheumatology, which recommend urate-lowering therapy to a serum urate level of less than 6. 0 mg per dL. 4, 5 However, based on the AHRQ findings, the ACP guideline states that the strength of evidence is low for a specific serum urate goal. 1, 2 In the absence of stronger evidence supporting a specific urate goal, urate-lowering therapy may be titrated clinically to minimize gout flares.

Third is the challenge of optimal control of serum urate. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT), including allopurinol and uricosurics are generic, affordable and the most commonly used drugs; febuxostat, a new ULT, is also available but is more expensive. ULT helps to lower serum urate levels, a central biochemical abnormality in gout. Current guidelines recommend achieving target serum urate of < 6 mg/dl, which is achieved by at most 33% of patients. This is a meaningful disease target since it is associated with improved clinical outcomes such as reduction in gout flares, regression of tophi and lower health care costs (Figure 8). Achievement of this serum urate target frequently requires titration of allopurinol dose, sometimes up to 900 mg/day, rather than a monotonic 300 mg/day dose. Physicians aiming to help gout patients avoid flares and improve function to reap the full benefits of treatment need to monitor serum urate after starting ULT and follow a treat-to-target approach. We believe that it is possible to achieve disease remission in many gout patients with this approach. This is a paradigm shift in gout treatment that is likely to improve patient outcomes. A patient-physician collaborative approach is essential for this to succeed.

We have summarized briefly a few opportunities for improving care and outcomes of gout, for which there are several additional opportunities for interventions not mentioned here. We are at the brink of new treatment options for gout, a better understanding of its impact on cardiovascular and renal disease, and better management with existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches. This is an exciting era in which we know ever more about this ancient disease.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^ff90e257]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature search

Three SLRs were identified, synthetising efficacy of allopurinol, febuxostat and uricosurics. As the last search of each review was older than 12 months, updates were conducted using each SLR's original search strategy. Overall, six RCTs were selected comparing effect of ULT to placebo or other ULTs on flares as outcome (the preferred outcome for patients). After tabulating the study characteristics, data turned out to be too heterogeneous (eg, exclusion criteria, definition of flares, sUA level at inclusion) and follow-up time was too short to provide meaningful data on efficacy on flares (as flares provoked by ULT initiation distorts long-term efficacy). Therefore, an available review of five longitudinal studies reporting data on the association of flares according to sUA category was used. The study best fitting our target population, concerned patients with rheumatologists diagnosed gout and clinically confirmed flares. Of note, the majority of patients were (not yet) treated with ULT during follow-up. As the relation between sUA and flare was steep, it was decided to distinguish two sUA categories, differing in future flares risk. In patients with an sUA of > 0.36– < 0.55 mmol/L, future flares risk was 48/100 and in patients with a sUA ≥ 0.55 mmol/L future flare risk was 90/100 within a follow-up period of at least 1 year. Patients who would reach the sUA target (≤ 0.36 mmol/L) would have a future flares risk of 12/100. To understand the relative efficacy of the different ULTs, one head-to-head RCT comparing allopurinol, febuxostat and placebo concluded a stronger impact of febuxostat compared with allopurinol on sUA but not on flares.

### Novel uricosurics [^7fea761c]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

According to recent guidelines, the mainstay of urate-lowering therapies remains xanthine oxidase inhibition. However, some patients with gout show failure to achieve the predefined target of 5–6 mg/dl with xanthine oxidase inhibitors alone, so alternative drugs are needed. The aim of this study was to review studies of novel drugs targeting uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) and/or other urate transporters for the management of gout.

Methods

MeSH terms were used to identify phase 2/3 trials assessing the efficacy of novel uricosurics. A narrative review of novel drugs targeting URAT1 and/or other urate transporters for the management of gout is provided.

Results

Lesinurad is a recently approved uricosuric that inhibits URAT1 and the organic ion transporter organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4). Phase 3 trials showed that lesinurad, combined with allopurinol or febuxostat, is a potent urate-lowering therapeutic with an acceptable safety profile. Arhalofenate, another emerging uricosuric, also interacts with URAT1 and organic anion transporter 4. Phase 2 trials suggested that it can both lower serum UA levels and reduce the risk of flares.

Conclusions

New drugs inhibiting URAT1 should cover the unmet need for patients with failure to respond or with contraindications to xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### Target serum urate achievement and chronic kidney disease progression in patients with gout and kidney disease [^b4b5a624]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that among patients with gout and CKD stage 3, lowering serum urate level with ULT to less than 6 mg/dL vs 6 mg/dL or greater was not associated with an increased risk of severe or end-stage kidney disease. These findings support optimizing ULT to achieve TSUL when treating patients with gout and impaired kidney function.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to anti-inflammatory therapy, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to consider initiating IL-1 inhibitors for the treatment of flares in patients with frequent flares and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids (oral and injectable). Do not initiate IL-1 inhibitors in patients with a current infection. Adjust urate-lowering therapy to achieve the uricemia target following an IL-1 inhibitor treatment for flare.

### Association between serum urate and flares in people with gout and evidence for surrogate status: a secondary analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^cc968c42]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Use of serum urate as a treatment target and outcome measure has become controversial in view of the 2017 American College of Physicians guidelines, which advocated a treat-to-symptom rather than a treat-to-target serum urate approach to gout management. The relevance of serum urate as a treatment target measure implies that achievement of target serum urate is causally associated with improvement in patient-important outcomes such as reduction in the number of gout flares. The aim of this study was to assess the causal relationship between achieving target serum urate and the occurrence of gout flares.

Methods

We analysed individual patient-level data from two randomised trials on urate-lowering therapies in people with gout conducted in Nottingham, UK, and New Zealand. We included participants randomly assigned to immediate dose escalation in the New Zealand study and all participants in the Nottingham study (a nurse-led gout care group and a general practitioner-led usual care group). Individuals who on average achieved a serum urate concentration less than 6 mg/dL (0·36 mmol/L) based on data at 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline were defined as serum urate responders. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants having at least one gout flare, and the secondary outcome was the mean number of flares per participant per month, from 12 to 24 months after baseline, compared between serum urate responders and non-responders. In adjusted logistic regression models, serum urate at baseline, previous flare history (in the year preceding study entry), presence of tophi at baseline, and, for the Nottingham dataset, the original randomisation group, were included as covariates. The Nottingham study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01477346. The New Zealand study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12611000845932.

Findings

From the combined individual data from both trials, we identified 343 serum urate responders and 245 serum urate non-responders. Significantly fewer serum urate responders had a gout flare than did serum urate non-responders between 12 and 24 months (91 [27%] of 343 vs 156 [64%] of 245; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·29 [95% CI 0·17 to 0·51], p < 0·0001). The mean number of flares per participant per month between 12 and 24 months was significantly lower in serum urate responders than in serum urate non-responders (adjusted mean difference -1·41 [95% CI -1·77 to -1·04], p < 0·0001). This association was independent of the original randomised treatment allocation.

Interpretation

Achieving an average serum urate concentration less than 6 mg/dL is associated with an absence of gout flares and a reduction in the number of flares in the subsequent 12 months in people with gout. These results support a treat-to-target serum urate approach in the management of gout.
