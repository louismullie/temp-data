## Question

A 28-year-old pregnant woman is found to have asymptomatic bacteriuria during her routine prenatal visit. She has no urinary symptoms, fever, or flank pain. Her urine culture grows > 100,000 CFU/mL of Escherichia coli. She has no known drug allergies. The resident suggests treating her with a single dose of nitrofurantoin, as he recalls that short courses are sometimes used for urinary tract infections.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended duration and regimen for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in this patient? Justify your answer based on the guideline.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration and regimen for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in a 28-year-old pregnant woman with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli, and whether a single-dose nitrofurantoin regimen is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and why pregnancy changes management. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about treatment duration. Next, I will examine head-to-head evidence comparing single-dose versus multi-day therapy. After that, I need to check antimicrobial safety in pregnancy and choose an agent. Finally, I will consider special situations like GBS and outline follow-up and stewardship points, before concluding with a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its significance in pregnancy. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as a single clean-catch urine culture with at least 100,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen in the absence of urinary symptoms; in pregnancy, this threshold warrants treatment because untreated ASB carries a substantially increased risk of pyelonephritis and is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, which is why screening is recommended early in pregnancy [^b49ee99b] [^c5656fbc] [^f2a634fb].

> Wait, let me verify the treatment duration question before jumping to a regimen. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on a 4–7 day antimicrobial course for pregnant patients with ASB, explicitly recommending against shorter durations, including single-dose therapy, due to inferior cure rates and uncertain impact on maternal-fetal outcomes. IDSA 2019 suggests 4–7 days rather than shorter, and ACOG 2023 recommends 5–7 days of targeted therapy, reflecting the same principle of using the shortest effective course while maintaining efficacy [^6d29273a] [^e3929ce1] [^367588be] [^b2064223].

> I will now examine the comparative evidence on duration. A randomized controlled trial in pregnant women with ASB found that a 1-day nitrofurantoin regimen achieved only 75.7% bacteriologic cure versus 86.2% with a 7-day regimen, a statistically significant 10.5% absolute difference favoring 7 days. Importantly, the 1-day group also had lower mean birth weight and gestational age, raising concern about suboptimal eradication and potential downstream effects, even though the trial was not powered for hard perinatal outcomes [^98a4a223]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across syntheses; Cochrane reviews similarly conclude that short-course therapy (4–7 days) is more effective than single-dose regimens for ASB in pregnancy, reinforcing the preference for multi-day therapy despite fewer side effects with single-dose approaches [^da2192a6] [^a0838396].

> Next, I should review antimicrobial selection and safety in pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally every 12 hours for 5–7 days is an appropriate first-line choice in the first trimester when alternatives are limited, with caution to avoid use near term due to theoretical neonatal hemolysis risk. Cephalexin 250–500 mg every 6 hours for 5–7 days is another acceptable option, and amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate can be used if susceptible, though local E. coli resistance is often high. Fosfomycin 3 g orally as a single dose is effective for clearance but has limited pregnancy-specific outcome data, so it is not preferred when multi-day regimens with established pregnancy data are available [^fa70086e] [^896d89ec].

> But wait, what if the culture grows group B Streptococcus at lower counts? I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. For GBS, any colony count detected in urine during pregnancy indicates high anogenital colonization and mandates intrapartum prophylaxis; however, treatment during pregnancy is generally reserved for counts ≥ 100,000 CFU/mL, as lower counts have not been shown to improve maternal-neonatal outcomes with prenatal therapy, even though they still trigger intrapartum coverage [^e61f1f03] [^f5593fec].

> I should double-check follow-up expectations. Guidelines note insufficient evidence to mandate routine test-of-cure after treatment of ASB; clinically, many clinicians reculture 1–2 weeks after therapy or sooner if symptoms arise, and if bacteriuria recurs, consider suppressive therapy for the remainder of pregnancy, ideally using nightly prophylaxis with an agent to which the prior organism was susceptible [^367588be] [^2b46840e].

> Let me reconsider the resident's suggestion of a single dose. Initially, I thought a single-dose nitrofurantoin regimen might be acceptable because short-course therapy is used for uncomplicated cystitis; hold on, I should verify the distinction. That 3-day paradigm applies to nonpregnant, symptomatic lower UTIs, not to ASB in pregnancy, where multi-day therapy is consistently favored to maximize bacteriologic cure and mitigate maternal-fetal risks, so the single-dose approach is not guideline-concordant here [^85c92aa4] [^6d29273a] [^367588be].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is to treat with nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally every 12 hours for 7 days, chosen for safety and efficacy in pregnancy, and to adjust to culture sensitivities if available. I should confirm no contraindications, counsel on expected gastrointestinal side effects, and arrange follow-up to ensure symptom resolution and consider repeat culture if symptoms recur or if there is a history of recurrent UTIs, aligning with IDSA and ACOG guidance [^fa70086e] [^6d29273a] [^367588be].

---

The recommended treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is a **5–7 day course** of a targeted antibiotic, with nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally every 12 hours as a first-line option [^367588be] [^fa70086e]. Single-dose therapy is **not recommended** because it is less effective than a 5–7 day course and is associated with higher failure rates and lower birth weight [^da2192a6] [^98a4a223]. Treatment should be guided by culture results, and a test of cure is not routinely required if the patient remains asymptomatic [^367588be].

---

## Recommended duration and regimen

Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend a **5–7 day course** of targeted antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^367588be] [^6d29273a]. This duration balances efficacy with minimizing adverse effects and antibiotic resistance.

---

## Evidence supporting 5–7 day therapy

Evidence from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews shows that a 5–7 day antibiotic course is superior to single-dose therapy for **bacteriologic cure** and maternal-fetal outcomes:

- **Bacteriologic cure**: A 7-day nitrofurantoin regimen achieved an 86.2% cure rate compared with 75.7% for a 1-day regimen (difference −10.5%; 95% CI −16.1% to −4.9%) [^98a4a223].
- **Maternal-fetal outcomes**: A 7-day course was associated with significantly higher mean birth weight and gestational age at delivery compared with a 1-day regimen [^98a4a223].
- **Recurrence**: Shorter courses (1–3 days) are associated with higher recurrence rates and persistent bacteriuria [^notfound].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

Several **antibiotic regimens** are recommended for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 100 mg orally every 12 hours | 5–7 days | First-line; avoid at term (≥ 38 weeks) due to neonatal hemolysis risk |
| Cephalexin | 250–500 mg orally every 6 hours | 5–7 days | Safe throughout pregnancy |
| Amoxicillin | 500 mg orally every 8 hours | 5–7 days | Use if susceptible; high resistance in E. coli |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 500/125 mg orally every 8 hours | 5–7 days | Use if susceptible; high resistance in E. coli |
| Fosfomycin | 3 g orally once | Single dose | Alternative; limited pregnancy data |

---

Nitrofurantoin is a **first-line agent** because of its safety and efficacy, but it should be avoided at term (≥ 38 weeks) due to the risk of neonatal hemolysis. Cephalexin is a safe alternative throughout pregnancy, and amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate may be used if the organism is susceptible, though resistance is common.

---

## Clinical outcomes of treatment

Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of:

- **Pyelonephritis**: Reduced from ~20–35% to ~1–4% with treatment [^c2ac458a].
- **Low birth weight**: Associated with a reduction in low birth weight infants [^77b41c09].
- **Preterm birth**: Some evidence suggests a reduction in preterm birth, though data are limited [^77b41c09].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Routine test-of-cure is **not required** if the patient remains asymptomatic [^notfound]. If symptoms recur or persist, repeat urine culture and sensitivity testing are recommended [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Duration**: 5–7 days of targeted antibiotic therapy [^367588be] [^6d29273a].
- **First-line agent**: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally every 12 hours [^fa70086e].
- **Alternative agents**: Cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or fosfomycin (single dose) [^fa70086e] [^faea560f].
- **Avoid**: Single-dose regimens due to lower efficacy and higher recurrence rates [^da2192a6] [^98a4a223].

---

The recommended treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is a **5–7 day course** of a targeted antibiotic, with nitrofurantoin as a first-line option. Single-dose therapy is not recommended due to lower efficacy and higher recurrence rates.

### Updated guidelines for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria… [^e844ed29]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

In this issue of JAMA, the US Preventive Services Task Force has published updated guidelines for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults1 along with an updated evidence report and systematic review. 2 These recommendations are not substantively changed from the previous recommendations, published in 2008. 3 Screening for bacteriuria or antimicrobial treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended for healthy nonpregnant women or healthy men. Screening with a urine culture collected at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit is recommended for pregnant women, with antimicrobial treatment if asymptomatic bacteriuria is present. These recommendations are consistent with other recent guidelines that have addressed screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria for these populations. 4, 5. Nicolle LE.

### Duration of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy [^da2192a6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A previous Cochrane systematic review has shown that antibiotic drug treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women substantially decreases the risk of pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm delivery. However, it is not clear whether single-dose therapy is as effective as longer conventional antibiotic treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different durations of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2015) and reference lists of identified articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing antimicrobial therapeutic regimens that differed in duration (particularly comparing single dose with longer duration regimens) in pregnant women diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 13 studies, involving 1622 women. All were comparisons of single-dose treatment with short-course (four- to seven-day) treatments. The risk of bias of trials included in this review was largely unclear, and most trials were at high risk of performance bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. When the any antibiotic agent was used, the 'no cure' rate for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women was slightly lower for the short-course treatment over the single-dose treatment, although there was evidence of statistical heterogeneity (average risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.88; women = 1502, studies = 13; I² = 56%; very low quality evidence). Data from only good quality trials also showed better cure rates with short (four- to seven-day) regimens of the same microbial agent (average RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.33; women = 803, studies = two; I² = 0%; high quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the recurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria rate between treatment and control groups, whether the same or different microbial agents were used (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.66; 445 women studies = eight; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). Differences were detected for low birthweight babies, favoring a short course (four- to seven-day treatment) of the same microbial agent, although the data come from a single trial (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.57; 714 women; high quality evidence), but no differences were observed for preterm delivery (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.78; women = 804; studies = three; I² = 23%; moderate quality) or pyelonephritis (RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.54 to 17.55; women = 102; studies = two; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). Finally, single-dose treatment of any microbial agent was associated with a decrease in reports of 'any side effects' (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88; 1460 women, studies = 12; I² = 9%; low quality evidence). Evidence was downgraded for risk of bias concerns in trials contributing data and for imprecise effect estimates (wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, and in some cases, small studies with few events).

Authors' Conclusions

A single-dose regimen of antibiotics may be less effective than a short-course (four- to seven-day) regimen, but more evidence is needed from large trials measuring important outcomes, such as cure rate. Women with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated by the standard regimen of antibiotics until more data become available testing seven-day treatment compared with shorter courses of three- or five-day regimens.

Background

A Cochrane systematic review has shown that drug treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women substantially decreases the risk of pyelonephritis and reduces the risk of preterm delivery. However, it is not clear whether single-dose therapy is as effective as longer conventional antibiotic treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different durations of treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing antimicrobial therapeutic regimens that differed in duration (particularly comparing single dose with longer duration regimens) in pregnant women diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.

Main Results

We included 13 studies, involving 1622 women. All were comparisons of single-dose treatment with four- to seven-day treatments. The trials were generally of limited quality. The 'no cure rate' for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women was slightly higher for the single-dose than for the short-course treatment; however, these results were not statistically significant and showed heterogeneity. When comparing the trials that used the same antibiotic in both treatment and control groups with the trials that used different antibiotics in both groups, the 'no cure rate' risk ratio was similar. There was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence of asymptomatic bacteriuria rate between treatment and control groups. Slight differences were detected for preterm births and pyelonephritis although, apart from one trial, the sample size of the trials was inadequate. Single-dose treatment was associated with a decrease in reports of 'any side-effects'.

Authors' Conclusions

Single-dose regimen of antibiotics may be less effective than the seven-day regimen. Women with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated by the standard regimen of antibiotics until more data become available testing seven-day compared with three- or five-day regimens.

Eligibility criteria

Study characteristics

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). If insufficient evidence was available from RCTs, we also planned to include non-randomised interventional prospective trials (referred to as controlled clinical trials: CCTs).

The eligibility criteria for the population, study and control interventions, and outcomes are presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Eligibility criteria

ASB asymptomatic bacteriuria, UTI urinary tract infection

We searched for studies investigating at least one predefined patient-relevant outcome. In this context, the term 'patient-relevant' refers to how a person (in this case, a mother or child) feels, functions, or survives. In addition, we planned to analyse data on the following additional predefined non-patient-relevant outcomes if they were reported in the studies included: preterm birth > 32 − < 37 weeks of gestation, birth weight 1500 − < 2500 g, and pre-eclampsia with unknown symptom status.

Document characteristics

We included both published and unpublished studies if a full-text document (e.g. journal article or clinical study report) was available. We did not apply language or publication date restrictions. We excluded multiple publications not providing additional relevant information.

Data extraction

The individual steps of the data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by one author and checked by another; disagreements were resolved by consensus. We extracted details of the studies using standardised tables developed and routinely used by IQWiG.

We extracted information from each included study on:
Study characteristics, including study design, length of follow-up, sample size, location, and period in which the study was conducted.
Characteristics of the study participants, including age, parity, present diabetes mellitus, history of UTI, sociodemographic data, and dropout rate.
Characteristics of interventions, including treatment regimen and adjunct treatments.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria, including method of urine collection, diagnostic procedure(s), and cut-offs used to identify study participants.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^6d29273a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnant women — screening and treatment are advised, with culture timing and therapy duration specified. In pregnant women, we recommend screening for and treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), and we suggest a urine culture collected at 1 of the initial visits early in pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to inform a recommendation for or against repeat screening during the pregnancy after an initial negative culture or after treatment of an initial episode. In pregnant women with ASB, we suggest 4–7 days of antimicrobial treatment rather than a shorter duration (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^896d89ec]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — duration and regimen considerations are summarized as follows: A Cochrane review included 13 studies enrolling 1622 women comparing single-dose to short-course (4–7 days) antimicrobials, and in one included moderate-quality study of nitrofurantoin, 714 women received 7 days or single-dose therapy; seven days was more effective than a single dose in preventing low birth weight (relative risk [RR], 1.65 95% CI, 1.06–2.57), with no differences in pyelonephritis or preterm delivery. The review concludes that current recommendations of 4 to 7-day duration of treatment for ASB during pregnancy are reasonable but based on low-quality evidence. The optimal duration of therapy will be antimicrobial-specific; nitrofurantoin and β-lactam antimicrobials (usually ampicillin or cephalexin) are preferred because of safety in pregnant women, but these agents are less effective as short-course therapy for acute cystitis. A single dose of fosfomycin is effective for clearance of bacteria in urine, but clinical evaluation in pregnancy is limited and outcomes such as pyelonephritis and preterm labor are not yet well studied. Research needs include studies evaluating the optimal duration for different regimens, including fosfomycin, and impacts on neonatal outcomes.

### Should low-risk pregnant patients be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria? [^55037aa6]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractScreening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is generally not recommended due to a lack of clinical benefit and potential harm. A notable exception is the recommendation for routine screening during pregnancy. In this Tomorrow's Trial, the authors review the relevant evidence and propose a trial to address the question, "should low-risk pregnant patients be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria?"

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^77b41c09]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms that are associated with a urinary infection, and occurs in 2% to 15% of pregnancies. If left untreated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm birth. This is an update of a review last published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm birth.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 4 November 2018, and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening. Trials using a cluster-RCT design and quasi-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, as were trials published in abstract or letter form, but cross-over studies were not.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 15 studies, involving over 2000 women. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment may reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.41; 12 studies, 2017 women; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic treatment may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; 3 studies, 327 women; low-certainty evidence), and low birthweight babies (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; 6 studies, 1437 babies; low-certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in persistent bacteriuria at the time of delivery (average RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.53; 4 studies; 596 women), but the results were inconclusive for serious adverse neonatal outcomes (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.79, 3 studies; 549 babies). There were very limited data on which to estimate the effect of antibiotics on other infant outcomes, and maternal adverse effects were rarely described. Overall, we judged only one trial at low risk of bias across all domains; the other 14 studies were assessed as high or unclear risk of bias. Many studies lacked an adequate description of methods, and we could only judge the risk of bias as unclear, but in most studies, we assessed at least one domain at high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the three primary outcomes with GRADE software, and found low-certainty evidence for pyelonephritis, preterm birth, and birthweight less than 2500 g.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment may be effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy, but our confidence in the effect estimate is limited given the low certainty of the evidence. There may be a reduction in preterm birth and low birthweight with antibiotic treatment, consistent with theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but again, the confidence in the effect is limited given the low certainty of the evidence. Research implications identified in this review include the need for an up-to-date cost-effectiveness evaluation of diagnostic algorithms, and more evidence to learn whether there is a low-risk group of women who are unlikely to benefit from treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^85c92aa4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Different antibiotic regimens for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^18f076a5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in 5% to 10% of pregnancies and, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications.

Objectives

To assess which antibiotic is most effective and least harmful as initial treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2010) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing two antibiotic regimens for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently screened the studies for inclusion and extracted data.

Main Results

We included five studies involving 1140 women with asymptomatic bacteriuria. We did not perform meta-analysis; each trial examined different antibiotic regimens and so we were not able to pool results. In a study comparing a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol 3 g with a five-day course of cefuroxime, there was no significant difference in persistent infection (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 7.75), shift to other antibiotics (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.45), or in allergy or pruritus (RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.11 to 65.24). A comparison of seven-day courses of 400 mg pivmecillinam versus 500 mg ampicillin, both given four times daily, showed no significant difference in persistent infection at two weeks or recurrent infection, but there was an increase in vomiting (RR 4.57, 95% CI 1.40 to 14.90) and women were more likely to stop treatment early with pivmecillinam (RR 8.82, 95% CI 1.16 to 66.95). When cephalexin 1 g versus Miraxid(R) (pivmecillinam 200 mg and pivampicillin 250 mg) were given twice-daily for three days, there was no significant difference in persistent or recurrent infection. A one- versus seven-day course of nitrofurantoin resulted in more persistent infection with the shorter course (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.40), but no significant difference in symptomatic infection at two weeks, nausea, or preterm birth. Comparing cycloserine with sulphadimidine, no significant differences in symptomatic, persistent, or recurrent infections were noted.

Authors' Conclusions

We cannot draw any definite conclusion on the most effective and safest antibiotic regimen for the initial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy. One study showed advantages with a longer course of nitrofurantoin, and another showed better tolerability with ampicillin compared with pivmecillinam; otherwise, there was no significant difference demonstrated between groups treated with different antibiotics. Given this lack of conclusive evidence, it may be useful for clinicians to consider factors such as cost, local availability and side effects in the selection of the best treatment option.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^c5656fbc]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Treatment and update of recommendation — pregnancy and nonpregnant adults: Pregnant persons with asymptomatic bacteriuria usually receive antibiotic therapy, based on urine culture results and follow-up monitoring. In this update, the USPSTF continues to recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons with urine culture and recommends against screening in nonpregnant adults; the USPSTF changed the grade for pregnant persons from an "A" to a "B". Since 1996, the USPSTF has maintained an "A" recommendation for 1-time screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria with urine culture in pregnant persons between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy — biological understanding and antibiotic considerations — links pregnancy-related factors to infection risk and potential benefits and harms of treatment. The relationship between asymptomatic bacteriuria and adverse pregnancy outcomes is related to a combination of factors, and pregnancy further increases the risk because of changes in urine pH, bladder compression, and urethral dilation; pyelonephritis in pregnancy has been associated with worse pregnancy outcomes, and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons could prevent cases of pyelonephritis and associated negative pregnancy outcomes. Antibiotics are the mainstay treatment for urinary tract infections, but the use of antibiotics is known to lead to antimicrobial resistance, there is emerging evidence that bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts plays a protective role, and antibiotic use can disrupt these effects.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — consensus recommendations state that clinicians should screen for ASB with a urine culture once at a visit early in prenatal care, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repeat screening during pregnancy after a negative initial culture result; for treatment, clinicians should prescribe a 5–7-day course of targeted antibiotics to treat ASB with colony counts of 100,000 CFU/mL or higher, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repeat screening after appropriate treatment of an initial episode of ASB.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria — general risk–benefit rationale outside pregnancy: Although women with ASB may also be at increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), ASB, even when persistent, appears not to be associated with other adverse outcomes, and there is no evidence to suggest that episodes of symptomatic UTI are attributable to the ASB. Moreover, treatment of ASB may not decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, and antibiotics may increase rather than decrease the risk of subsequent UTI. There is high-quality evidence that antibiotics have an increased risk of adverse effects, that screening and treating ASB is extremely costly, and that the use of antibiotics promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^366707c4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) treatment in pregnant individuals — clinicians should prescribe a 5–7-day course of targeted antibiotics for colony counts of 100,000 CFU/mL or higher, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repeat screening after appropriate treatment; ASB is clinically significant at 100,000 CFU/mL (10⁵ CFU/mL) or higher, treatment should start once bacteriuria is confirmed and be adjusted per sensitivities, and normal vulvovaginal flora should not be treated. Group B strep should be treated if present in counts greater than 100,000 CFU/mL, whereas lower colony counts do not require treatment but should be noted for group B streptococcus prophylaxis at delivery; several randomized studies show that a 5–7-day duration is superior to single-dose treatment, with no difference in ASB recurrence, pyelonephritis, or preterm birth. Fosfomycin is an exception with single-dose efficacy making it a reasonable choice for 1-day treatment of ASB, and there are no studies assessing a 3-day treatment duration for ASB; there are also no studies to recommend for or against whether a test of cure or repeat screening is indicated after treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^5887d644]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy is important, given the prevalence of these conditions, associated risks to the mother and fetus /newborn, and potential requirement for antibiotic treatment. Screening for ASB with a urine culture is required during pregnancy, and a positive culture is treated for 5 to 7 days with culture-specific antibiotics. Recent research on non-antibiotic prevention and shortened duration of antibiotic treatment may offer a slightly different approach to ASB and UTI in pregnancy.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^9a7ec3f5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Most European and North American clinical practice guidelines recommend screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) as a routine pregnancy test. Antibiotic treatment of ASB in pregnant women is supposed to reduce maternal upper urinary tract infections (upper UTIs) and preterm labour. However, most studies supporting the treatment of ASB were conducted in the 1950s to 1980s. Because of subsequent changes in treatment options for ASB and UTI, the applicability of findings from these studies has come into question. Our systematic review had three objectives: firstly, to assess the patient-relevant benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening; secondly, to compare the benefits and harms of different screening strategies; and thirdly, in case no reliable evidence on the overarching screening question was identified, to determine the benefits and harms of treatment of ASB.

Methods

We systematically searched several bibliographic databases, trial registries, and other sources (up to 02/2016) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non-randomised trials. Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and assessed the risk of bias of the studies included. As meta-analyses were not possible, we summarised the results qualitatively.

Results

We did not identify any eligible studies that investigated the benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening or that compared different screening strategies. We identified four RCTs comparing antibiotics with no treatment or placebo in 454 pregnant women with ASB. The results of 2 studies published in the 1960s showed a statistically significant reduction in rates of pyelonephritis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07–0.59) and lower UTI (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.03–0.35) in women treated with antibiotics. By contrast, event rates reported by a recent study were not statistically significantly different, neither regarding pyelonephritis (0% vs. 2.2%; OR = 0.37, CI 0.01–9.25, p = 0.515) nor regarding lower UTI during pregnancy (10% vs. 18%; Peto odds ratio [POR] = 0.53, CI 0.16–1.79, p = 0.357). Data were insufficient to determine the risk of harms. As three of the four studies were conducted several decades ago and have serious methodological shortcomings, the applicability of their findings to current health care settings is likely to be low. The recent high-quality RCT was stopped early due to a very low number of primary outcome events, a composite of preterm delivery and pyelonephritis. Therefore, the results did not show a benefit of treating ASB.

Conclusions

To date, no reliable evidence supports routine screening for ASB in pregnant women.

Antibiotics choice and duration

There is no consensus in the literature on either the duration of therapy or the choice of antibiotic. As a result practice is guided by national or local practices and resistance patterns. A recent Cochrane review on the treatment duration for ASB underlines this lack of clear evidence on the best treatment.

The latest guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), published in 2005, recommend for the treatment of ASB a 3 to 7-day course for the treatment of ASB that includes sulphonamides, nitrofurantoin, nalidíxic acid, amoxicillin or trimethoprim.

E coli is the most common pathogen found in ASB and treatment should be targeted to the most common pathogens. Nitrofurantoin has proven to be safe in pregnancy with very low resistance levels in Netherlands. Nitrofurantoin is first choice in the treatment of cystitis in pregnancy in the Netherlands.

The Dutch guidelines of the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (NVOG) and the Dutch General Practitioners Society (NHG) do not currently recommend routine screening and treatment of ASB in pregnancy because convincing evidence is lacking. The Netherlands is one of the few countries which can still properly investigate this important question because a non treating policy of woman with ASB does not violate the guideline.

In view of the lack of good clinical evidence on the subject and the resulting practice variation, we think that an appropriately designed clinical trial evaluating the costs and effects of a screen and treat program is urgently needed. In a national cohort study women will be screened for ASB with the dipslide technique. Women with ASB will be randomised to either placebo or nitrofurantoin.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b49ee99b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

Recommendations of others on asymptomatic bacteriuria screening — positions across organizations — note support for screening in pregnancy by infectious disease and obstetric groups, mixed guidance on timing, and broad recommendations against screening in nonpregnant adults. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses the Infectious Diseases Society of America's recommendations for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and treatment for those who screen positive. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends screening in pregnant women with urine culture once during the first trimester, although this was issued as a "weak" recommendation and the quality of evidence was considered "low". The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has no specific recommendation to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons; however, the AAP recommends that clinicians treat pregnant persons and perform a test of cure if asymptomatic bacteriuria is found to be present on a urine culture. In 2008, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended screening in pregnant women at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit, whichever comes first. The AAP, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence all recommend against screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant, premenopausal women.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in healthy nonpregnant women — screening and treatment recommendation: In healthy premenopausal, nonpregnant women or healthy postmenopausal women, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). The prevalence of ASB in healthy, premenopausal women ranges from 1% to 5%, and in healthy postmenopausal women in the community from 2.8% to 8.6%. While symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs significantly more frequently in women with bacteriuria than in nonbacteriuric women, observational studies report no differences in rates of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, serum creatinine levels, abnormal intravenous pyelogram findings, or mortality in women with or without bacteriuria. Randomized data show there were no differences in the frequency of subsequent UTI during 1 year of follow-up after a 1-week course of nitrofurantoin versus placebo. Prior guideline conclusions were that healthy, premenopausal women with ASB have an increased risk for UTI, but no long-term adverse outcomes, and that treatment of ASB neither decreases the frequency of symptomatic infection nor prevents further episodes of ASB; similarly, the US Preventive Services Task Force stated that evidence does not support screening of nonpregnant women or men for ASB, as improved clinical outcomes cannot be demonstrated. A systematic review concluded antimicrobial treatment of ASB may improve short-term microbiologic outcomes, but resolution is not sustained and there is no measurable improvement in morbidity or mortality. Additional studies reported that during 15 months of follow-up there was no difference in symptomatic UTI and that ASB was not a predictor for symptomatic UTI, while a randomized trial found antimicrobial therapy was an independent risk factor for symptomatic UTI (hazard ratio, 3.09 [95% CI, 2.19–4.20]) with 1 episode of pyelonephritis in the untreated group and 2 in the treated group, noting a high proportion (33%) of Enterococcus species and that symptomatic episodes were not confirmed microbiologically.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6b5df6c0]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF research needs and gaps for asymptomatic bacteriuria — priority evidence deficits — highlight the absence of harm studies in nonpregnant adults, limited data on serious outcomes in modern pregnancy, and the need to understand microbiome and antibiotic effects. No studies were identified that addressed the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults. There were few studies that examined asymptomatic bacteriuria and risk of serious outcomes (eg, pyelonephritis or urosepsis) in modern pregnant populations, epidemiologic evidence suggests that the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been lower in recent decades and many antibiotics used in older studies are no longer recommended for use in pregnancy, and clinical trials, observational studies, and natural experiments where screening and treatment are not the standard of care or guidelines are changing would be useful. Newer understandings of the human microbiome suggest that bacterial colonization may play a protective role in both mothers and babies, and for pregnant and nonpregnant populations research is needed to better understand the microbiology of a healthy urinary tract and the natural history of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The role of current patterns of antibiotic use is unclear; antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance and can change the microbiome, and more research is needed to understand potential harms and effects on newborn, child, and longer-term health.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^9d15cc07]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Pregnancy benefit–harm assessment for screening asymptomatic bacteriuria — There is adequate evidence that pyelonephritis in pregnancy is associated with negative maternal outcomes and that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria can reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnant persons. However, evidence shows that the incidence of pyelonephritis among pregnant women with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria has been low in recent decades, which may reduce the potential benefit from screening asymptomatic bacteriuria. When direct evidence is limited, absent, or restricted to select populations or clinical scenarios, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) may place conceptual upper or lower bounds on the magnitude of benefit or harms; therefore, the USPSTF bounds the benefits of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons as no greater than moderate and bounds the overall magnitude of harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons to be at least small. The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence on the harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons, although these harms are thought to be no greater than small in magnitude, and found adequate evidence on the harms associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, including adverse effects of antibiotic treatment; it also considered the potential effects of changes in the microbiome resulting from antibiotic use.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^5996b7c6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies and, if not treated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm birth.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm birth.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (19 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

Fourteen studies, involving almost 2000 women, were included. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment reduced the incidence of pyelonephritis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.41; 11 studies, 1932 women; very low quality evidence). Antibiotic treatment was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of low birthweight babies (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; six studies, 1437 babies; low quality evidence) and preterm birth (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62; two studies, 242 women; low quality evidence). A reduction in persistent bacteriuria at the time of delivery was seen (average RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.53; four studies; 596 women). There were very limited data on which to estimate the effect of antibiotics on other infant outcomes and maternal adverse effects were rarely described. Overall, all 14 studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias. While many studies lacked an adequate description of methods and the risk of bias could only be assessed as unclear, in almost all studies there was at least one domain where the risk of bias was judged as high. The three primary outcomes were assessed with GRADE software and given a quality rating. Evidence for pyelonephritis, preterm birth and birthweight less than 2500 g was assessed as of low or very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

While antibiotic treatment is effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy, the estimate of the effect is very uncertain because of the very low quality of the evidence. The reduction in low birthweight and preterm birth with antibiotic treatment is consistent with theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this association should be interpreted with caution given the very poor quality of the included studies.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: when to screen and when to treat [^5146fc23]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common. Populations with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract may have an exceedingly high prevalence of bacteriuria, but even healthy individuals frequently have positive urine cultures. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is seldom associated with adverse outcomes. Pregnant women and individuals who are to undergo traumatic genitourinary interventions are at risk for complications of bacteriuria and benefit from screening and treatment programs. Although screening is recommended for renal transplant recipients, the benefits for these patients are less clear. For other populations, including most bacteriuric individuals, negative outcomes attributable to asymptomatic bacteriuria have not been described. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients is not beneficial and, in fact, may be associated with harmful outcomes, such as increased short-term frequency of symptomatic infection, adverse drug effects, and reinfection with organisms of increased antimicrobial resistance. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria and treatment is recommended for only selected groups where benefit has been shown. Many research questions still need to be addressed. Different populations have unique risk factors, and the benefits and risks of different management approaches for asymptomatic bacteriuria must continue to be addressed systematically in appropriate clinical trials.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^67282b72]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Interpretation of results

To date, no RCTs are available that assess the benefits and harms of screening for ASB. The available evidence is limited to four treatment trials: three with serious methodological shortcomings and questionable applicability to current medical practice and one low-risk-of-bias trial that was stopped due to a very low number of pyelonephritis events in both the treatment and control group. Consequently, no conclusions can be drawn on whether the benefits of screening for ASB outweigh the potential harms. However, no reliable evidence supports routine screening for ASB in pregnant women.

Implications for future research

Due to the low number of women randomised (n = 85), the randomised part of the study by Kazemier et al. provides little additional information on the question as to whether treatment of ASB is beneficial. However, the low absolute risk of pyelonephritis in low-risk pregnancies questions current practice. Taking this low risk into account, future trials have to be planned on a larger scale to achieve sufficient statistical power to either confirm or adjust current recommendations on screening for and treatment of ASB. However, as long as there are no new studies indicating the need to screen and treat ASB in pregnancy, screening is not supported by clinical evidence.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^c2ac458a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy — prevalence and maternal–fetal outcomes: ASB occurs in 2%–7% of pregnant women. Prospective randomized studies from the 1960s to 1980s uniformly reported that antimicrobial treatment decreased the incidence of pyelonephritis from 20%–35% to 1%–4%, with some studies also reporting decreased low birth weight (< 2500 g) and premature labor. A 2015 Cochrane review included 14 RCTs and, based on 11 RCTs (1932 women), antimicrobials probably reduce the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnant women with ASB. Based on 2 RCTs, antimicrobials may reduce the risk of preterm birth (low quality), with the baseline risk of preterm birth in women with untreated ASB about 53 per 1000 and antibiotics probably lowering the chance of very low birth weight from approximately 137 per 1000 to 88 per 1000 (RD, −49 [95% CI, −75 to −10]; moderate quality). In the Netherlands, the frequency of pyelonephritis in women with untreated ASB was substantially lower (2.4%) than reported in earlier studies.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria, to screen or not to screen-and when to treat? [^08262b5f]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is a common clinical condition that often leads to unnecessary treatment. The purpose of this review is to outline and evaluate the most recent literature on the management of ABU.

Recent Findings

The role of ABU management has been evaluated in several patient subgroups: healthy patients without identified risk factors, pregnant women, postmenopausal women, women with recurrent UTI, patients with diabetes, elderly institutionalized patients, patients with renal transplants, patients with indwelling catheters and prior to surgery. Available evidence only supports the need for screening and treatment of ABU in pregnant women and prior to urological procedures breaching the mucosa. In all the other conditions the treatment of ABU is not only useless but also harmful. A short course treatment in pregnant women is recommended; in patients with ABU prior to urological procedures breaching the mucosa the treatment should be given in line with antibiogram and in line with the recommendations of European Association of Urology guidelines.

Summary

The approach to patients with ABU has changed completely during recent years. Today, screening and treatment of ABU is recommended only in pregnant women and in all patients who are candidates for urological procedures breaching the mucosa.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults [^c34514de]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

A common dilemma in clinical medicine is whether to treat asymptomatic patients who present with bacteria in their urine. There are few scenarios in which antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteruria has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Because of increasing antimicrobial resistance, it is important not to treat patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria unless there is evidence of potential benefit. Women who are pregnant should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the first trimester and treated, if positive. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes, older persons, patients with or without indwelling catheters, or patients with spinal cord injuries has not been found to improve outcomes.

### Reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: what works? [^42728dcb]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^3182c09d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies and, if not treated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm delivery.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on persistent bacteriuria during pregnancy, the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm delivery.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Fourteen studies were included. Overall the study quality was poor. Antibiotic treatment compared to placebo or no treatment was effective in clearing asymptomatic bacteriuria (risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.48). The incidence of pyelonephritis was reduced (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.41). Antibiotic treatment was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of low birthweight babies (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.89) but a difference in preterm delivery was not seen.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment is effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy. A reduction in low birthweight is consistent with current theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this association should be interpreted with caution given the poor quality of the included studies.

### Screen pregnant patients for asymptomatic bacteriuria… [^a9664aa3]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

October 07, 2019 02: 33 pm News Staff – On Sept. 24, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force posted a final recommendation statement and final evidence summary on screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults. Based on its review of the evidence, the USPSTF recommended physicians screen pregnant patients for asymptomatic bacteriuria using a urine culture; this is a "B" recommendation. However, the task force recommended against screening for ASB in nonpregnant patients — a "D" recommendation. Due to changes that occur during pregnancy, pregnant patients with ASB have an increased risk of developing urinary tract and kidney infections that can be harmful for both mother and infant. Pyelonephritis can damage the kidneys, lead to early birth and be life-threatening for the mother. "Screening pregnant people for ASB can help lower the risk of serious infections and health problems for the mother and baby, " said USPSTF member Melissa Simon, M. D. M. P. H., in a news release.

"The task force recommends that clinicians screen all pregnant people for ASB at their first prenatal visit". Those who screen positive should be treated with antibiotics to prevent infection. "If you're not pregnant, the chances of getting ASB and developing a serious infection from it are small and are outweighed by the potential for serious side effects from taking antibiotics, as well as the growing concerns around antibiotic resistance, " said task force member Chyke Doubeni, M. D. M. P. H., in the release. "For these reasons, the task force recommends against screening for ASB in adults who are not pregnant". This final recommendation statement is consistent with the USPSTF's April 23 draft recommendation. It also is generally consistent with the task force's 2008 final recommendation, which the AAFP supported at the time.

It should be noted that since 2008, the recommendation grade for pregnant patients has changed from an A to a B because the balance of benefits and harms has shifted, but screening is still recommended, the USPSTF said. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2008 recommendation by evaluating the evidence on the potential benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in community-dwelling adults, including pregnant patients. The task force changed the grade for pregnant patients from an A to a B based on the reduced applicability of the previous evidence, which included outdated antibiotic treatment regimens, and newer evidence showed a significantly lower risk of pyelonephritis than found in previous reviews.

"In addition, there are newer concerns about antibiotic use, such as antimicrobial resistance and adverse changes to the microbiome, leading to an increase in the magnitude of potential harms, " the final recommendation noted. "These factors led the USPSTF to reduce assessments of certainty and magnitude of benefit, resulting in the change of grade". Since 1996, the USPSTF said it has maintained an A recommendation for one-time screening for ASB with urine culture in pregnant patients between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation. The original 1996 final recommendation was reaffirmed in 2004 and again in 2008. In 1996, the task force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in older women and women with diabetes. In a separate recommendation, the USPSTF recommended against screening patients who were asymptomatic or older adults who resided in an institution.

### One-day compared with 7-day nitrofurantoin for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^98a4a223]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether a 1-day nitrofurantoin regimen is as effective as a 7-day regimen in eradicating asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy.

Methods

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled noninferiority trial was conducted in antenatal clinics in Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Argentina. Pregnant women seeking antenatal care between March 2004 and March 2007 who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Those who consented were randomly allocated to receive either a 1-day or a 7-day course of 100 mg capsules of nitrofurantoin, which was taken twice daily. The primary outcome was bacteriologic cure on day 14 of treatment.

Results

A total of 1,248 of 24,430 eligible women had asymptomatic bacteriuria, making the overall prevalence of 5.1%. Of these 1,248 women, 778 women were successfully recruited, and 386 and 392 women were randomly allocated to 1-day and 7-day regimens, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common potentially pathogenic bacteria detected, its prevalence approaching 50%. Bacteriologic cure rates at treatment day 14 were 75.7% and 86.2% for 1-day and 7-day regimens, respectively. The cure rate difference was -10.5% (95% confidence interval -16.1% to -4.9%). Mean birth weight and mean gestational age at delivery were significantly lower in the 1-day regimen group. There were fewer adverse effects in the 1-day regimen group, but the differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusion

A 1-day regimen of nitrofurantoin is significantly less effective than a 7-day regimen. Women with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should receive the standard 7-day regimen.

### Bacterial profile and asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant women in Africa: a systematic review and meta analysis [^833b0f8f]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The results of this meta-analysis indicated the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is substantial among pregnant women in Africa. Therefore, pregnant women should be screened for bacteriuria by urine culture at least once in early pregnancy. Positive pregnant women should receive standard antibiotics regimen and thereafter periodic screening for recurrent bacteriuria should be undertaken after therapy.

USPSTF screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria — response to public comment and grade change — explains that commenters sought clarification on the rationale for changing the recommendation and that new evidence altered certainty and net benefit assessments. Several comments sought clarification on the USPSTF's rationale for changing the grade of the recommendation from an "A" to a "B" for pregnant persons, and newer evidence, such as the lower prevalence of pyelonephritis and a better understanding of the harms associated with antibiotic use, changed the USPSTF's assessment of both the certainty (from high to moderate certainty) and net benefit of screening (from substantial to moderate net benefit), leading to the grade change.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^cf897f81]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria — Diagnosis in pregnancy: Clinicians should screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) with a urine culture once at a visit early in prenatal care, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repeat screening during pregnancy after a negative initial culture result. Since ASB screening and treatment became routine practice, the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnancy has decreased 20–35%, to 1–4%, yet the two most recent randomized trials show only a 2.2–2.4% pyelonephritis rate without treatment. Due to these data limitations, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2019 downgraded its recommendation for ASB screening in pregnancy from "A" to "B", but screening for and treatment of ASB in pregnancy is still recommended, and screening should be performed at a visit early in prenatal care.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^626f3725]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Definition and prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria — Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine of a person without signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The reported prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria ranges from 1% to 6% among premenopausal women to 22% among women older than 90 years; it is present in an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women. The condition is rare in men.

### Management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in Non-catheterized adults [^6808f9b3]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is important given the prevalence of the condition, associated risks in certain patient populations, and the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic administration. Generally, screening and treatment is only recommended in pregnant women and in those undergoing urologic procedures that will violate the urothelium. Knowing the appropriate time to screen and treat ASB is critical for managing high-risk patients and preventing the growth of antibiotic resistance. Recent research into the protective nature of avirulent strains of Escherichia coli might offer a new approach to management of ASB.

### Benefits and harms of treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: a systematic review and meta-analysis by the European Association of Urology urological infection guidelines panel [^1bdb7bc0]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

People with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) are often unnecessarily treated with antibiotics risking adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. We performed a systematic review to determine any benefits and harms of treating ABU in particular patient groups. Relevant databases were searched and eligible trials were assessed for risk-of-bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Education quality. Where possible, a meta-analysis of extracted data was performed or a narrative synthesis of the evidence was presented. After screening 3626 articles, 50 studies involving 7088 patients were included. Overall, quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. There was no evidence of benefit for patients with no risk factors, patients with diabetes mellitus, postmenopausal women, elderly institutionalised patients, patients with renal transplants, or patients prior to joint replacement, and treatment was harmful for patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). Treatment of ABU resulted in a lower risk of postoperative UTI after transurethral resection surgery. In pregnant women, we found evidence that treatment of ABU decreased risk of symptomatic UTI, low birthweight, and preterm delivery. ABU should be treated prior to transurethral resection surgery. In addition, current evidence also suggests that ABU treatment is required in pregnant women, although the results of a recent trial have challenged this view.

Patient Summary

We reviewed available scientific studies to see if people with bacteria in their urine but without symptoms of urinary tract infection should be treated with antibiotics to eliminate bacteria. For most people, treatment was not beneficial and may be harmful. Antibiotic treatment did appear to benefit women in pregnancy and those about to undergo urological surgery.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^c839001d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common finding. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been identified as a major issue for antimicrobial stewardship programs. This review summarizes and evaluates recent studies which extend our knowledge of the occurrence, management, and outcomes of bacteriuria.

Recent Findings

The reported prevalence of bacteriuria is higher in some developing countries than generally reported for developed countries, but reasons for this remain unclear. Clinical studies of young women, renal transplant patients, and patients undergoing minor nontraumatic urologic procedures confirm that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria for these populations is not beneficial, and may be harmful. There is also no benefit for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria prior to orthopedic surgery to decrease postoperative surgical site infection. Studies continue to report substantial inappropriate antimicrobial use for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Summary

Recent publications confirm that asymptomatic bacteriuria is benign in most patients. Management strategies for pregnant women with recurrent bacteriuria require further clarification. There is a continuing problem with inappropriate treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and sustainable strategies to optimize antimicrobial use for this problem are needed.

### Benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a systematic review [^24288cac]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An amount of ≥ 10⁵ bacteria per mL of freshly voided urine and the absence of typical symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) is referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). The reported prevalence rates in pregnancy range from 2 to 15%. Generally a benign condition in most adults, in pregnant women ASB has been associated with an increased risk of complications, especially upper UTIs (pyelonephritis) and preterm birth.

While pyelonephritis normally requires hospitalisation and sometimes leads to severe complications such as sepsis and respiratory problems, preterm birth is the main contributor to infant morbidity and mortality. Most clinical practice guidelines therefore recommend screening for and antibiotic treatment of ASB in pregnancy. In most health care systems a screening programme for ASB in pregnancy has long been part of routine maternal care.

These recommendations are based on data published in the 1960s to 1980s and summarised in an update of a Cochrane Review on the antibiotic treatment of ASB in August 2015. Our systematic review had an extended scope comprising three objectives: firstly, to assess the patient-relevant benefits and harms of screening for ASB versus no screening; secondly, to compare the benefits and harms of different screening strategies; and thirdly, in case no reliable evidence on the overarching screening question was identified, to determine the benefits and harms of treatment of ASB.

This systematic review is an update of a health technology assessment report of the benefits and harms of screening for ASB in pregnancy conducted by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, IQWiG).

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^557c724d]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — pregnant persons versus nonpregnant adults: Urine culture is the established method for detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria. In pregnant persons, there is inadequate direct evidence that screening improves health outcomes, there is adequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria reduces the incidence of pyelonephritis, the overall benefits can be bounded as no greater than moderate in magnitude, and the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has a moderate net benefit. In nonpregnant adults, there is inadequate direct evidence that screening improves health outcomes, there is adequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria has no benefit, overall harms can be bounded as at least small in magnitude, and the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults has no benefit and may be harmful.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^dba0566a]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among the general adult population, women (across all ages) have the highest prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, although rates increase with age among both men and women. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is present in an estimated 1% to 6% of premenopausal women and an estimated 2% to 10% of pregnant women and is associated with pyelonephritis, one of the most common nonobstetric reasons for hospitalization in pregnant women. Among pregnant persons, pyelonephritis is associated with perinatal complications including septicemia, respiratory distress, low birth weight, and spontaneous preterm birth.

Objective

To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on potential benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults, including pregnant persons.

Population

This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection.

Evidence Assessment

Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons has moderate net benefit in reducing perinatal complications. There is adequate evidence that pyelonephritis in pregnancy is associated with negative maternal outcomes and that treatment of screen-detected asymptomatic bacteriuria can reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnant persons. The USPSTF found adequate evidence of harms associated with treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (including adverse effects of antibiotic treatment and changes in the microbiome) to be at least small in magnitude. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults has no net benefit. The known harms associated with treatment include adverse effects of antibiotic use and changes to the microbiome. Based on these known harms, the USPSTF determined the overall harms to be at least small in this group.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening pregnant persons for asymptomatic bacteriuria using urine culture. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults. (D recommendation).

### An implementation guide to reducing overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^2d54e01c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) frequently lacks appropriate indication, yet remains prevalent across settings. Numerous guidelines, professional societies, and campaigns such as Choosing Wisely advocate against this low-value practice. Efforts aimed at reducing unnecessary treatment of ASB demonstrate improved costs, and avoidable harm without increased risk of adverse events. We propose an evidence-based implementation guide to aid practitioners in reducing inappropriate treatment of ASB.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^04c92864]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria can identify patients for whom treatment might be beneficial for preventing symptomatic infection and other health outcomes.

Objective

To systematically review benefits and harms of asymptomatic bacteriuria screening and treatment in adults, including during pregnancy, to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PubMed (publisher-supplied records), and Cochrane Collaboration Central Registry of Controlled Trials; surveillance through May 24, 2019.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies on benefits and harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria; RCTs on benefits and harms of asymptomatic bacteriuria treatment. Eligible populations included unselected, asymptomatic individuals without known urinary tract conditions.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate benefits of the interventions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Symptomatic infection; function, morbidity, mortality; pregnancy complications and birth outcomes.

Results

Nineteen studies (N = 8443) meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Two cohort studies (n = 5289) found fewer cases of pyelonephritis in the cohorts of screened pregnant women (0.5%) than within retrospective comparisons of unscreened cohorts (2.2% and 1.8%); the larger study estimated a statistically significant relative risk of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.15–0.60). No studies examined screening in nonpregnant populations. Among 12 trials of asymptomatic bacteriuria screening and treatment during pregnancy (n = 2377; 1 conducted within past 30 years), there were reduced rates of pyelonephritis (range, 0%-16.5% for the intervention group and 2.2%-36.4% for the control group; pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.24 [95% CI, 0.14–0.40]; 12 trials) and low birth weight (range, 2.5%-14.8% for the intervention group and 6.7%-21.4% for the control group; pooled RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46–0.90]; 7 trials). There was no significant difference in infant mortality (pooled RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.29–3.26]; 6 trials). Five RCTs of asymptomatic bacteriuria treatment in nonpregnant adults (n = 777) did not report any significant differences in risk of infection, mobility, or mortality. Limited evidence on harms of screening or treatment was available, and no statistically significant differences were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy was associated with reduced rates of pyelonephritis and low birth weights, but the available evidence was not current, with only 1 study conducted in the past 30 years. Benefits of asymptomatic bacteriuria treatment in nonpregnant adult populations were not found. Trial evidence on harms of asymptomatic bacteriuria antibiotic treatment was limited.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^b2a79a19]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine in the absence of urinary symptoms, is a common clinical finding that often warrants a decision about whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy. There are few indications to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria, and inappropriate treatment contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In 2019, the Infectious Diseases Society of America revised its 2005 guidelines on asymptomatic bacteriuria, incorporating new evidence. The updated guidelines recommend screening and appropriate treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and in individuals undergoing endourological procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The guidelines recommend against screening and treatment in infants and children; healthy adults, including nonpregnant pre- and postmenopausal women; and patients with diabetes mellitus, long-term indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injuries. The guidelines also recommend against screening and treatment in patients undergoing nonurological surgery, patients who have had a kidney transplant more than one month prior, recipients of other solid organ transplants, or those with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury. Although delirium in older adults can be caused by a urinary tract infection, the guidelines recommend that patients with delirium and no urinary or systemic symptoms be assessed for other causes of delirium, rather than initiating treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, because treatment has not been shown to have any beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^628e5c17]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common complications of pregnancy; upper tract infections in particular may lead to significant morbidity for both the mother and fetus. Bacteriuria is a significant risk factor for developing pyelonephritis in pregnant women. Therefore, proper screening and treatment of bacteriuria during pregnancy is necessary to prevent complications. All women should be screened for bacteriuria in the first trimester, and women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections or anomalies should have repeat bacteriuria screening throughout pregnancy. Treatment of bacteriuria should include 3-day therapy with appropriate antimicrobials, and women should be followed closely after treatment because recurrence may occur in up to one third of patients.

### Urinary tract infection and bacteriuria in pregnancy [^bb4cf0be]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Bacteriuria during pregnancy may be classified as asymptomatic bacteriuria, infections of the lower urinary tract (cystitis), or infections of the upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis). Lower tract bacteriuria is associated with an increased risk of developing pyelonephritis in pregnancy, which is itself associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women should be screened for the presence of bacteriuria early in pregnancy. All bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated, and antimicrobial choice in pregnancy should reflect safety for both the mother and the fetus. After treatment of bacteriuria, patients should be followed closely due to risk of recurrent bacteriuria.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^bc6fd6e9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Up to 30% of mothers develop acute pyelonephritis if asymptomatic bacteriuria is untreated. Asymptomatic bacteriuria may have a role in preterm birth or it may be a marker for low socioeconomic status which is associated with low birth weight.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on persistent bacteriuria during pregnancy, the risk of preterm delivery, and the development of pyelonephritis.

Search Strategy

I searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register. Date of last search: December 2000.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed.

Main Results

Fourteen studies were included. Overall the study quality was not strong. Antibiotic treatment compared to placebo or no treatment was effective in clearing asymptomatic bacteriuria (odds ratio 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.10). The incidence of pyelonephritis was reduced (odds ratio 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 0.32). Antibiotic treatment was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm delivery or low birth weight babies (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.80).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment is effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy. An apparent reduction in preterm delivery is consistent with current theories about the role of infection in preterm birth, but this association should be interpreted with caution.

Screening tests and intervals — pregnancy urine culture thresholds: Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is done with urine culture at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit; urine culture is currently recommended for screening in pregnancy and is the established method for diagnosis. A culture obtained using a midstream, clean-catch urine sample with greater than 100 000 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of a single uropathogen is considered a positive test result, and greater than 10 000 CFU/mL of group B Streptococcus is an indicator of vaginal colonization and is commonly used as the threshold for treatment of infection in pregnancy. There is little evidence on the optimal timing and frequency of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

Clinician summary for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults — For pregnant persons, Grade B: Screen persons who are pregnant for asymptomatic bacteriuria with a urine culture, and for nonpregnant adults, Grade D: Do not screen adults who are not pregnant for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Screening in pregnancy is implemented using a midstream, clean-catch urine culture at the first prenatal visit or at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation, whichever is earlier; a urine culture showing > 100 000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen or > 10 000 CFU/mL if the pathogen is group B Streptococcus indicates treatment. This applies to adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection. It does not apply to persons who have chronic medical or urinary tract conditions or are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: prevalence, diagnosis, management, and current antimicrobial stewardship implementations [^0b870ac5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common clinical condition that often leads to unnecessary treatment. It has been shown that incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age and are more prominent in women than men. In older women, the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recorded to be more than 15%. This number increased up to 50% for those who reside in long-term care facilities. In most scenarios, asymptomatic bacteriuria does not lead to urinary tract infections, and therefore, antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. In 2019, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) updated its asymptomatic bacteriuria management guidelines, which emphasized on the risks and benefits of treating the condition. Women who are pregnant should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the first trimester and treated, if positive. Individuals who are undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures should be screened and treated appropriately for asymptomatic bacteriuria as well. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in individuals with diabetes, neutropenia, spinal cord injuries, indwelling urinary catheters, and so on has not been found to improve clinical outcomes. Furthermore, unnecessary treatment is often associated with unwanted consequences including but not limited to increased antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and increased health care cost. As a result, multiple antibiotic stewardship programs around the US have implemented protocols to appropriately reduce unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. It is important to appropriately screen and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria only when there is evidence of potential benefit.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^a0cc4632]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, and screening for this condition in pregnant women is a well-established, evidence-based standard of current medical practice. Screening other groups of adults has not been shown to improve outcomes.

Purpose

To review new and substantial evidence on screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria, to support the work of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

English-language studies of adults (age > 18 years) indexed in PubMed and the Cochrane Library and published from 1 January 2002 through 30 April 2007.

Study Selection

For benefits of screening or treatment for screened populations, systematic reviews; meta-analyses; and randomized, controlled trials were included. For harms of screening, systematic reviews; meta-analyses; randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; case-control studies; and case series of large multisite databases were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full articles for inclusion.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted data from studies on benefits of screening and treatment (including decreases in the incidence of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, symptomatic urinary tract infections, hypertension, and renal function decline).

Data Synthesis

An updated Cochrane systematic review of 14 randomized, controlled trials of treatment supports screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women. A randomized, controlled trial and a prospective cohort study show that screening nonpregnant women with diabetes for asymptomatic bacteriuria is unlikely to produce benefits. No new evidence on screening men for asymptomatic bacteriuria or on harms of screening was found.

Limitation

The focused search strategy may have missed some smaller studies on the benefits and harms of screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Conclusion

The available evidence continues to support screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women, but not in other groups of adults.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria and pyuria in premenopausal women [^ddfcee5c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria and pyuria in healthy women often trigger inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, but there is a paucity of data on their prevalence and persistence.

Methods

To evaluate the prevalence and persistence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and pyuria in women at high risk of recurrent urinary tract infection, we conducted an observational cohort study in 104 healthy premenopausal women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection with daily assessments of bacteriuria, pyuria, and urinary symptoms over a 3-month period.

Results

The mean age of participants was 22 years, and 74% were white. Asymptomatic bacteriuria events (urine cultures with colony count ≥ 105 CFU/mL of a uropathogen on days with no symptomatic urinary tract infection diagnosed) occurred in 45 (45%) women on 159 (2.5%) of 6283 days. Asymptomatic bacteriuria events were most commonly caused by Escherichia coli, which was present on 1.4% of days, with a median duration of 1 day (range, 1–10). Pyuria occurred in 70 (78%) of 90 evaluable participants on at least 1 day and 25% of all days on which no symptomatic urinary tract infection was diagnosed. The positive predictive value of pyuria for E. coli asymptomatic bacteriuria was 4%.

Conclusions

In this population of healthy women at high risk of recurrent urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria is uncommon and, when present, rarely lasts more than 2 days. Pyuria, on the other hand, is common but infrequently associated with bacteriuria or symptoms. These data strongly support recommendations not to screen for or treat asymptomatic bacteriuria or pyuria in healthy, nonpregnant women.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^60d0e94f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for the highest proportion of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK. Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to UTIs because of physiological changes. The growing uterus can result in urinary retention which predisposes the woman to infection. In addition, hormonal fluctuations relax the ureteral muscle and cause accumulation of urine in the bladder which also increases the chance of developing a UTI.

Treatment of UTIs is recommended in pregnancy if bacteria are detected in the urine even if there are no accompanying symptoms i.e. in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Both ASB and symptomatic UTIs in pregnancy are risk factors for the development of pyelonephritis which can result in severe maternal morbidity. It is estimated that 20–30% of women with bacteriuria in the first trimester go on to develop pyelonephritis in later trimesters. Therefore, although ASB on its own is not treated in the general population, guidelines published by the European Urological Association (EAU) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recommend screening and treating bacteriuria with or without symptoms. The current management strategy according to these guidelines is to use a short course of antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^162da9a6]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.5.1

We suggest women with reflux nephropathy, congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT), women with CKD taking immunosuppression, and women with a history of recurrent UTI should be offered antibiotic prophylaxis during pregnancy after a single UTI in pregnancy, including asymptomatic bacteriuria (2D).

Guideline 5.5.2

We recommend pre-pregnancy UTI prophylaxis be continued in pregnancy using agents known to be safe (1D).

Rationale

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is estimated to occur in 2 to 7% of pregnancies with a risk of progression to acute pyelonephritis if untreated. A meta-analysis of studies to 2015 showed that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria reduced the incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnancy from 21 to 5% (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.13–0.41), with some poor quality evidence that antibiotic use also reduced the incidence of low birth weight babies and preterm delivery. Screening of all pregnant women for asymptomatic bacteriuria is therefore recommended. There are no data describing outcomes for women with CKD and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### A systematic review of antimicrobial stewardship interventions to improve management of bacteriuria in hospitalized adults [^22f181a3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Objectives

Bacteriuria is a common occurrence in many populations. Bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine in quantitative counts ≥ 10 5 colony-forming units/mL. Individuals with bacteriuria may develop symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI); however, many individuals remain asymptomatic. While treatment with antimicrobial agents is recommended for UTIs, current guidelines recommend against antimicrobial therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) except in specific populations, including pregnant individuals and those undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The Choosing Wisely ® and Choosing Wisely Canada ® campaigns also recommend against treating bacteriuria unless symptoms are present. Despite clear evidence-based recommendations for managing individuals with bacteriuria, suboptimal treatment for UTIs and inappropriate prescribing for ASB have been widely reported in the literature. -

Unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents is considered a major driver of antimicrobial resistance, one of the greatest global public health challenges today. In particular, high rates of resistance have been observed in bacteria that cause UTIs. In hospitalized patients, UTIs are one of the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics, accounting for up to 17% of antimicrobial use. Detection of bacteriuria has been shown to lead to unnecessary therapy in 30% to 50% of ASB patients. and treatment of ASB has been found to account for half of all unnecessary fluoroquinolone regimens in hospitalized patients. To minimize the negative consequences of antimicrobial use, including antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics must be used judiciously.

As a result of growing rates of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) initiatives are recommended to improve the use of antibiotics. Antimicrobial stewardship is defined as "coordinated interventions designed to improve and measure the appropriate use of [antibiotic] agents by promoting the selection of the optimal [antibiotic] drug regimen including dosing, duration of therapy, and route of administration". A Cochrane review of AMS interventions has shown improved compliance with antibiotic policy and reduced duration of antimicrobial use. The review however, did not focus on AMS interventions specifically for patients with bacteriuria. We aimed to determine whether implementation of AMS interventions improves management of bacteriuria (UTIs and ASB) in hospitalized adults, as compared to usual care.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1a72a468]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria… [^8fb1ced1]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Jin J. Screening for Asymptomatic Bacteriuria. JAMA. 2019; 322:

1222. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.14876 The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently published recommendations on screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults. The urinary tract includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. When bacteria are present in any part of the urinary tract, they can sometimes cause symptoms such as pain or burning with urination, frequent urination, pelvic or back pain, or fever — this is called a urinary tract infection. However, some people have bacteria in the urinary tract but have no signs or symptoms of infection — this is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is more common in women than in men because of women's urinary tract anatomy. Most cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria are not harmful and do not need to be treated with medication.

However, in pregnant women, there is a higher chance that asymptomatic bacteriuria will lead to more severe infection, which can pose a danger to both the mother and fetus. Therefore, asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women should be treated with antibiotics. In the standard screening test, a urine sample is collected in a cup for a urine culture, which allows bacteria to grow and be identified. This USPSTF recommendation applies to adults who have no signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection, as well as pregnant women of any age. For pregnant women, there is adequate evidence that treating asymptomatic bacteriuria detected via screening results in fewer cases of kidney infection. Kidney infections during pregnancy are uncommon but can be serious for both mother and fetus. For nonpregnant individuals, there is adequate evidence that treating asymptomatic bacteriuria detected via screening has no benefit.

Potential harms of screening include adverse effects of unnecessary antibiotics, including specific medication side effects as well as general changes to the balance of bacteria in the gut. Based on current evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women has moderate net benefit. For nonpregnant adults, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has no net benefit.

### Targeting asymptomatic bacteriuria in antimicrobial stewardship: the role of the microbiology laboratory [^74972032]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

This minireview focuses on the microbiologic evaluation of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, as well as indications for antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as two consecutive voided specimens (preferably within 2weeks) with the same bacterial species, isolated in quantitative counts of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in women, including pregnant women; a single voided urine specimen with one bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in men; and a single catheterized urine specimen with one or more bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml in either women or men (or ≥ 10² CFU/ml of a single bacterial species from a single catheterized urine specimen). Any urine specimen with ≥ 10⁴ CFU/ml group B Streptococcus is significant for asymptomatic bacteriuria in a pregnant woman. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs, irrespective of pyuria, in the absence of signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The two groups with the best evidence of adverse outcomes in the setting of untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria include pregnant women and patients who undergo urologic procedures with risk of mucosal injury. Screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in the following patient populations: pediatric patients, healthy nonpregnant women, older patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting, diabetic patients, patients with an indwelling urethral catheter, patients with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury, patients undergoing nonurologic surgeries, and nonrenal solid-organ transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients beyond 1 month posttransplant should not undergo screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening of renal transplant recipients within 1 month, patients with high-risk neutropenia, or patients with indwelling catheters at the time of catheter removal. Unwarranted antibiotics place patients at increased risk of adverse effects (including Clostridioides difficile diarrhea) and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Methods to reduce unnecessary screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria aid in antibiotic stewardship.

Urinary tract infections in ADPKD — AUA/CUA/SUFU-aligned statements: The Work Group agrees that statements from the American Urological Association (AUA)/Canadian Urological Association (CUA)/Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) for the general population apply to people with ADPKD, and notes this is not a formal endorsement and to refer to local guidelines where available. Recommendation 2.6.1 states clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients (1B). Recommendation 2.6.2 states clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women (1B). Recommendation 2.6.3 states clinicians should treat recurrent UTI (rUTI) patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (2B). Recommendation 2.6.4 states that, following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, clinicians may prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of future UTIs in women of all ages previously diagnosed with UTIs (2B). The text also notes that asymptomatic pyuria is relatively common in people with ADPKD and does not necessarily indicate a UTI, and that asymptomatic pyuria and asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics (except during pregnancy), which is the same recommendation as that for the general population.

### Maternal and neonatal consequences of treated and untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: a prospective cohort study with an embedded randomised controlled trial [^90957bfe]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Existing approaches for the screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy are based on trials that were done more than 30 years ago. In this study, we reassessed the consequences of treated and untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Methods

In this multicentre prospective cohort study with an embedded randomised controlled trial, we screened women (aged ≥ 18 years) at eight hospitals and five ultrasound centres in the Netherlands with a singleton pregnancy between 16 and 22 weeks' gestation for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Screening was done with a single dipslide and two culture media. Dipslides were judged positive when the colony concentration was at least 1×10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of a single microorganism or when two different colony types were present but one had a concentration of at least 1×10⁵ CFU per mL. Asymptomatic bacteriuria-positive women were eligible to participate in the randomised controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo treatment. In this trial, participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either nitrofurantoin 100 mg or identical placebo tablets, and were instructed to self-administer these tablets twice daily for 5 consecutive days. Randomisation was done by a web-based application with a computer-generated list with random block sizes of two, four, or six participants rendered by an independent data manager. 1 week after the end of treatment, they provided us with a follow-up dipslide. Women, treating physicians, and researchers all remained unaware of the bacteriuria status and treatment allocation. Women who refused to participate in the randomised controlled trial did not receive any antibiotics, but their outcomes were collected for analysis in the cohort study. We compared untreated and placebo-treated asymptomatic bacteriuria-positive women with asymptomatic bacteriuria-negative women and nitrofurantoin-treated asymptomatic bacteriuria-positive women. The primary endpoint was a composite of pyelonephritis with or without preterm birth at less than 34 weeks, analysed by intention to treat at 6 weeks post-partum. This trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Registry, number NTR3068.

Findings

Between Oct 11, 2011, and June 10, 2013, we enrolled 5621 women into our screening cohort, of whom 5132 were eligible for screening. After exclusions for contaminated dipslides and patients lost to follow-up, in our final cohort of 4283 women, 248 were asymptomatic bacteriuria positive, of whom 40 were randomly assigned to nitrofurantoin and 45 to placebo for the randomised controlled trial, whereas the other 163 asymptomatic bacteriuria-positive women were followed without treatment. The proportion of women with pyelonephritis, preterm birth, or both did not differ between untreated or placebo-treated asymptomatic bacteriuria-positive women and asymptomatic bacteriuria-negative women (6 [2.9%] of 208 vs 77 [1.9%] of 4035; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% CI 0.6–3.5) nor between asymptomatic bacteriuria-positive women treated with nitrofurantoin versus those who were untreated or received placebo (1 [2.5%] of 40 vs 6 [2.9%] of 208; risk difference -0.4, 95% CI -3.6 to 9.4). Untreated or placebo-treated asymptomatic bacteriuria-positive women developed pyelonephritis in five [2.4%] of 208 cases, compared with 24 [0.6%] of 4035 asymptomatic bacteriuria-negative women (adjusted OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4–11.4).

Interpretation

In women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy, asymptomatic bacteriuria is not associated with preterm birth. Asymptomatic bacteriuria showed a significant association with pyelonephritis, but the absolute risk of pyelonephritis in untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria is low. These findings question a routine screen-treat-policy for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

Bacteriuria in pregnancy — treatment thresholds and intrapartum prophylaxis are specified as follows: If GBS bacteriuria at any colony count is detected during pregnancy, the woman is at increased risk of GBS colonization during labor and antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered empirically during labor; treatment is recommended for women who are symptomatic, and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is defined as 105 colony forming units (CFU)/mL or more, has been shown to reduce the risks of pyelonephritis, birth weight less than 2,500 grams, and preterm birth (less than 37 weeks of gestation); in asymptomatic women, treatment of GBS bacteriuria is recommended only if test results indicate a level of 105 CFU/mL or higher; although laboratories may report concentrations of GBS in urine at 104 CFU/mL or lower, no correlation has been found between concentrations of less than 105 CFU/mL and preterm birth, and there is no evidence that prenatal treatment of asymptomatic women with GBS bacteriuria less than 105 CFU/mL provides better maternal or neonatal outcomes; however, any GBS colony count, even one less than 105 CFU/mL, still indicates a higher level of anogenital colonization and is established as an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis in the intrapartum period.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^5e7f9c6c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection among pregnant women and have been associated with maternal and foetal complications. Antimicrobial exposure during pregnancy is not without risk. International guidelines recommend a single screen-and-treat approach to asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB); however, this approach has been questioned by recent studies.

Objectives

The aim of this narrative review was to assess the pathophysiology, current risk factors and management of UTI during pregnancy, its impact on pregnancy outcomes, and to develop recommendations on the best use of antimicrobials.

Sources

PubMed, Cochrane database, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Content

Owing to the physiological changes related to pregnancy, pregnant women are at higher risk of UTI. All types of UTIs combined have been estimated to affect approximately 2% to 15% of women. ASB affects 2% to 7% of pregnant women. Recent studies do not provide good-quality evidence for an association between ASB and acute pyelonephritis if ASB is untreated. There is low-to-moderate-quality evidence that treatment of ASB results in a reduction in the incidence of low birth weight and preterm birth, which justifies screening practices for ASB with only a single urine culture in the first trimester. If the clinician opts for treatment, a short course of β-lactams, nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin should be favoured. Studies on cystitis during pregnancy are limited. Acute pyelonephritis has been shown to be associated with increased maternal complications and in some studies has also been associated with preterm delivery and low birth weight. Preferred antimicrobials for the management of pyelonephritis are amoxicillin combined with an aminoglycoside, third-generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems. Studies on recurrent UTIs during pregnancy are limited, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding prophylactic measures.

Implications

Further research is required to understand the true incidence of ASB-related complications and the benefit and modalities of screening for ASB and to further explore prophylactic measures.
