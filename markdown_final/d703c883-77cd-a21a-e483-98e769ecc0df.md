## Question

In ICD-10, what condition is represented by code D58.8 when used for a hereditary red blood cell membrane disorder that causes pseudohyperkalaemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10 code corresponds to a hereditary red blood cell membrane disorder that causes pseudohyperkalemia, and specifically whether D58.8 fits that description. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10 category structure for hereditary hemolytic anemias and where membrane disorders sit. Then, I should verify which specific entities within RBC membrane disorders are linked to pseudohyperkalemia. Next, I will check whether any of those entities have a more specific ICD-10 code or whether they default to D58.8. Finally, I will confirm the coding nuance and provide the most precise answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the ICD-10 framework. D58.x codes cover hereditary hemolytic anemias, with D58.0 for hereditary spherocytosis, D58.1 for hereditary elliptocytosis, and D58.8 for other specified hereditary hemolytic anemias, which functions as a residual category when a more specific code is not available [^113ErZdK].

> Now, I need to identify which hereditary RBC membrane disorders cause pseudohyperkalemia. Wait, let me verify the key entities: familial pseudohyperkalemia is classically due to ABCB6 mutations and manifests as temperature-dependent potassium leak from red cells with spurious serum hyperkalemia, while dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (hereditary xerocytosis) due to PIEZO1 or KCNN4 mutations also features increased cation permeability and can present with pseudohyperkalemia; cryohydrocytosis variants likewise show temperature-dependent cation leaks and pseudohyperkalemia, and some band 3–related phenotypes have been reported with atypical cation transport abnormalities, though the mechanistic link varies [^1148LLMF] [^116A1eF3] [^112tkTie] [^116A1eF3] [^115DNr23].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about coding specificity. I should confirm whether any of these pseudohyperkalemia-associated membrane disorders have their own ICD-10 codes. Hereditary spherocytosis is D58.0 and hereditary elliptocytosis is D58.1, but familial pseudohyperkalemia, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis/xerocytosis, and cryohydrocytosis are not assigned unique ICD-10 codes and are typically captured under D58.8 as "other specified hereditary hemolytic anemias", reflecting their status as rare, specified entities without dedicated codes [^113ErZdK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if there might be a more specific code like D58.2 for these membrane transport defects, but I should double-check that. D58.2 is labeled "other hemoglobinopathies", which pertains to disorders of hemoglobin structure or synthesis, not RBC membrane transport defects, so that would be incorrect for pseudohyperkalemia due to membrane cation leaks; the appropriate residual category for hereditary membrane disorders causing hemolysis and pseudohyperkalemia is D58.8 [^113ErZdK].

> I will now examine the clinical implications to ensure the coding choice aligns with practice. These membrane disorders are hereditary hemolytic anemias with altered RBC hydration and cation permeability; diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion, smear findings, and specialized testing such as ektacytometry and, increasingly, targeted genetic panels, which reinforces that they are "specified" but rare entities falling under D58.8 when no more specific code exists [^111z6yPq] [^116A1eF3].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final answer clearly. For a hereditary RBC membrane disorder that causes pseudohyperkalemia — such as familial pseudohyperkalemia, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis/xerocytosis, or cryohydrocytosis — the correct ICD-10 code is D58.8, "other specified hereditary hemolytic anemias", because these conditions are recognized entities without dedicated subcodes and are appropriately classified in this residual category [^113ErZdK] [^1148LLMF] [^116A1eF3].

The ICD-10 code for a hereditary red blood cell membrane disorder causing pseudohyperkalemia is **D58.8** (Other specified hereditary hemolytic anemias). This code encompasses hereditary stomatocytosis and related cation-leak disorders that cause **pseudohyperkalemia** due to temperature-dependent potassium efflux from red cells, with normal in vivo potassium and no hemolysis [^113ErZdK] [^117Mtafo]. Accurate diagnosis and coding are essential to avoid **unnecessary treatment** for apparent hyperkalemia [^116FWEUc] [^114riunF].

---

## Clinical features and pathophysiology

Hereditary stomatocytosis and related cation-leak disorders are characterized by **increased cation permeability**, leading to altered red cell hydration and temperature-dependent potassium efflux. Key features include:

- **Pseudohyperkalemia**: Spurious elevation of serum potassium due to potassium efflux from red cells at room temperature or lower, with normal plasma potassium and no hemolysis [^116sZRXD] [^1148LLMF].

- **Hemolytic anemia**: Mild to moderate chronic hemolysis with macrocytosis and reticulocytosis [^113ESk2u].

- **Temperature dependence**: Potassium leak is accentuated at lower temperatures, distinguishing it from other causes of pseudohyperkalemia [^116A1eKT].

---

## Genetic mutations and molecular mechanisms

Several **genetic mutations** have been identified in hereditary stomatocytosis and related cation-leak disorders:

| **Gene** | **Protein** | **Clinical phenotype** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|-|
| PIEZO1 | Mechanosensitive ion channel | Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (xerocytosis) | Increased cation permeability and dehydration [^113ESk2u] [^112tkTie] |
| KCNN4 | Gardos channel | Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis | Increased potassium efflux and dehydration [^113ESk2u] |
| ABCB6 | ABC transporter | Familial pseudohyperkalemia | Temperature-dependent potassium leak [^1148LLMF] |
| SLC4A1 | Band 3 protein | Cryohydrocytosis | Altered cation transport and membrane stability [^115DNr23] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

Diagnosis of hereditary stomatocytosis and related cation-leak disorders relies on **clinical suspicion**, family history, and specific laboratory tests:

- **Pseudohyperkalemia**: Elevated serum potassium with normal plasma potassium, no hemolysis, and normal renal function [^114riunF].

- **Osmotic gradient ektacytometry**: Characteristic left-shifted curve with increased osmotic resistance [^113ESk2u].

- **Genetic testing**: Identification of mutations in PIEZO1, KCNN4, ABCB6, or SLC4A1 [^113ESk2u] [^1148LLMF] [^115DNr23].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognition of pseudohyperkalemia in hereditary stomatocytosis is critical to avoid **unnecessary interventions**. Management includes:

- **Confirmatory testing**: Measure plasma potassium or use heparinized samples to confirm true potassium status [^114riunF].

- **Avoidance of splenectomy**: Splenectomy is contraindicated due to increased risk of thromboembolic complications [^113ESk2u].

- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for affected individuals and family members due to autosomal dominant inheritance [^113ESk2u].

---

## ICD-10 coding and documentation

The ICD-10 code **D58.8** specifically covers hereditary stomatocytosis and related cation-leak disorders causing pseudohyperkalemia. Accurate documentation should include:

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Hereditary stomatocytosis or familial pseudohyperkalemia.

- **Laboratory confirmation**: Pseudohyperkalemia with normal plasma potassium and no hemolysis.

- **Genetic findings**: Specific gene mutations if known (e.g. PIEZO1, KCNN4, ABCB6, SLC4A1).

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for a hereditary red blood cell membrane disorder causing pseudohyperkalemia is **D58.8** (Other specified hereditary hemolytic anemias). This code encompasses hereditary stomatocytosis and related cation-leak disorders characterized by pseudohyperkalemia due to temperature-dependent potassium efflux from red cells. Accurate diagnosis and coding are essential to prevent inappropriate treatment and ensure appropriate management and counseling.

### Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of red cell membrane disorders [^116sZRXD]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary erythrocyte membrane disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding various transmembrane or cytoskeletal proteins of red blood cells. The main consequences of these genetic alterations are decreased cell deformability and shortened erythrocyte survival. Red blood cell membrane defects encompass a heterogeneous group of haemolytic anaemias caused by either (i) altered membrane structural organisation (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis) or (ii) altered membrane transport function (overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis or xerocytosis, familial pseudohyperkalaemia and cryohydrocytosis). Herein we provide a comprehensive review of the recent literature on the molecular genetics of erythrocyte membrane defects and their reported clinical consequences. We also describe the effect of low-expression genetic variants on the high inter- and intra-familial phenotype variability of erythrocyte structural defects.

### Familial pseudohyperkalaemia chiswick: a novel congenital thermotropic variant of K and Na transport across the human red cell membrane [^117Mtafo]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Two families with inherited abnormalities in Na and K transport across the red cell membrane are described. Both presented with 'pseudohyperkalaemia' as a result of loss of K from the red cells on storage at room temperature. Routine haematology was essentially normal, except for macrocytosis in one family. Studies of the temperature dependence of the passive leak to K showed a novel shoulder pattern with a minimum at 25 degrees C, a maximum at 10 degrees C, followed by a further fall. As in other cases of red cell-based pseudohyperkalaemia, the abnormal temperature dependence of this 'leak' flux could be held to account for the loss of K from the cells at room temperature. These cases represent a novel variant of the temperature dependence of the passive leak of K and Na across the red cell membrane, and can be classified as a mild, non-haemolytic form of the group known as the hereditary stomatocytosis and allied disorders'.

We have investigated a Welsh pedigree showing the 'familial pseudohyperkalaemia' phenotype of dominantly inherited, red-cell-based, temperature-dependent pseudohyperkalaemia associated with normal haematology. The 'passive leak' to K across the membrane of these abnormal red cells showed a 'U-shaped' temperature dependence, with a minimum at about 23 degrees C, qualitatively similar to that seen in the frankly haemolytic 'cryohydrocytosis' variant of the hereditary stomatocytosis group. Like three previous pedigrees with cryohydrocytosis, these patients show an excess of ether lipids in the membrane. However, these patients differ from other 'familial pseudohyperkalaemia' pedigrees, in which the leak showed different temperature profiles.

### Hereditary stomatocytosis: an underdiagnosed condition [^115tm7ps]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary stomatocytoses are a wide class of hemolytic anemias characterized by alterations of ionic flux with increased cation permeability that results in inappropriate shrinkage or swelling of the erythrocytes, and water lost or gained osmotically. The last few years have been crucial for new acquisitions in this field in terms of identifying new causative genes and of studying their pathogenetic mechanisms. This review summarizes the main features of erythrocyte membrane transport diseases, dividing them into forms with either isolated erythroid phenotype (nonsyndromic) or extra-hematological manifestations (syndromic), and focusing particularly on the most recent advances regarding dehydrated forms of hereditary stomatocytosis and familial pseudohyperkalemia.

### Estimated mortality rates of individuals with sickle cell disease in Brazil: real-world evidence [^114bJH2o]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

For data manipulation, we identified the variables of interest based on the dictionary of variables from the SIM and removed unnecessary columns from our analyses. The columns that were retained for each record are presented in the supplemental Material 1 (supplemental Table 1).

Next, to identify the records of individuals with SCD, we selected records with an International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code referring to SCD in any field related to the cause of death. The subcodes included in our analyses were D57.0 (sickle cell anemia with crisis), D57.1 (sickle cell anemia without crisis), D57.2 (double heterozygous sickling disorders), and D57.8 (other sickle cell disorders). We excluded registries with the subcode D57.3 (sickle cell trait) because this subcode only indicates that the individual carried 1 copy of the sickle β-globin gene, and it is not considered a disease. Although is possible for a patient with SCD to be wrongly registered under the code D57.3 at the time of their death, we understand that this possible misclassification bias has little impact on our findings because only 41 records of 6 553 132 records evaluated, presented this ICD-10 subcode. If the record presented the code D57 (sickle cell disorders) without a subcode, we include it in our analyses. We understand there is only a slight chance this would refer to a patient with sickle cell trait because the D57.3 subcode is frequently not reported in death certificates. Of note, in the ICD-10 classification used in the Brazilian database, the subcode D57.4 (sickle cell thalassemia) is not used. We expected that patients with this condition were classified under 1 of the other subcodes, specifically D57.2 (double heterozygous sickling disorders) or D57.8 (other sickle cell disorders), and, therefore, were included in our analyses.

### Pseudohyperkalemia: three cases and a review of literature [^116FWEUc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal complication requiring prompt diagnosis and management. However, pseudohyperkalemia, defined as an artificial rise in serum potassium (S k), is also an important diagnosis because management differs. Pseudohyperkalemia can result from multiple factors, including excessive potassium leakage from cells of the forearm during blood collection due to release from exercising the muscle during fist clenching, while washout is prevented by tourniquet application, hemolysis, problems with sample transport, preanalysis or contamination, cell damage and metabolic changes, familial conditions that permit excessive potassium ion (K +) leak from erythrocytes after blood sampling, and leukocytosis or thrombocytosis. In this review, we will discuss the major causes of pseudohyperkalemia, how to avoid certain diagnostic pitfalls, and comment on the clinical importance of recognizing these false readings. We will review three clinical cases seen in our nephrology and hypertension clinic that illustrate some of these problems.

### Red cell membrane disorders: structure meets function [^114Qx2xX]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

The mature red blood cell (RBC) lacks a nucleus and organelles characteristic of most cells, but it is elegantly structured to perform the essential function of delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from all other cells while enduring the shear stress imposed by navigating small vessels and sinusoids. Over the past several decades, the efforts of biochemists, cell and molecular biologists, and hematologists have provided an appreciation of the complexity of RBC membrane structure, while studies of the RBC membrane disorders have offered valuable insights into structure-function relationships. Within the last decade, advances in genetic testing and its increased availability have made it possible to substantially build upon this foundational knowledge. Although disorders of the RBC membrane due to altered structural organization or altered transport function are heterogeneous, they often present with common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia. However, they may require substantially different management depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid emergence of complications or inappropriate interventions. We propose an algorithm for laboratory evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia with a focus on RBC membrane disorders. Here, we review the genotypic and phenotypic variability of the RBC membrane disorders in order to raise the index of suspicion and highlight the need for correct and timely diagnosis.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^113odKzb]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a case that does not fit into the above categories. We describe a family previously classified as HS phenotype who presented in a novel form with familial pseudohypokalaemia. The patient and his daughter were recalled to hospital as an emergency for a repeat electrolyte measurement when a routine samples were found to show a low serum potassium. Repeat serum potassium measurements in an emergency department were within reference intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first case presentation of pseudohypokalaemia associated with the HS phenotype.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115AqoFm]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders are predominantly caused by mutations resulting in decreased RBC deformability and permeability. We present a family in which, the proband and his daughter presented with pseudohypokalaemia. Studies on the temperature dependence of pseudohypokalaemia suggested a maximum decrease in serum potassium when whole blood is stored at 37°C. Routine haematology suggested mild haemolysis with a hereditary spherocytosis phenotype. These two cases present a novel variant in temperature-dependent changes in potassium transport. A new variant was identified in the SLC4A1 gene which codes for band 3 protein (anion exchanger 1) in RBC membrane which may contribute to the phenotype. This is the first report of familial pseudohypokalaemia associated with changes in RBC membrane morphology. The clinical implications of pseudohypokalaemia are that it can lead to inappropriate investigation or treatment. However, many questions remain to be solved and other RBC membrane protein genes should be studied.

### A case of undiagnosed pseudohyperkalaemia following a splenectomy [^111oqheC]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Pseudohyperkalaemia is defined as a rise in serum potassium with concomitantly normal plasma potassium. The case of long undiagnosed pseudohyperkalaemia in an 84-year-old lady with thrombocytosis post splenectomy is presented. Presenting a historical perspective and the multifactorial aetiology of pseudohyperkalaemia the author underlines the importance of detecting apparent hyperkalaemia by testing the plasma potassium. Awareness of the possible causes of pseudohyperkalaemia increases the likelihood of it being detected earlier thereby decreasing the risk of harming the patient. Unnecessary treatment and investigation of pseudohyperkalaemia can cause harm to the patient in the form of undesired side effects, unnecessary investigations and concerns, and potentially dangerous iatrogenically induced cardiac arrhythmias.

### New insights on hereditary erythrocyte membrane defects [^116beA3A]. Haematologica (2016). Low credibility.

After the first proposed model of the red blood cell membrane skeleton 36 years ago, several additional proteins have been discovered during the intervening years, and their relationship with the pathogenesis of the related disorders have been somewhat defined. The knowledge of erythrocyte membrane structure is important because it represents the model for spectrin-based membrane skeletons in all cells and because defects in its structure underlie multiple hemolytic anemias. This review summarizes the main features of erythrocyte membrane disorders, dividing them into structural and altered permeability defects, focusing particularly on the most recent advances. New proteins involved in alterations of the red blood cell membrane permeability were recently described. The mechanoreceptor PIEZO1 is the largest ion channel identified to date, the fundamental regulator of erythrocyte volume homeostasis. Missense, gain-of-function mutations in the PIEZO1 gene have been identified in several families as causative of dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis or xerocytosis. Similarly, the KCNN4 gene, codifying the so called Gardos channel, has been recently identified as a second causative gene of hereditary xerocytosis. Finally, ABCB6 missense mutations were identified in different pedigrees of familial pseudohyperkalemia. New genomic technologies have improved the quality and reduced the time of diagnosis of these diseases. Moreover, they are essential for the identification of the new causative genes. However, many questions remain to solve, and are currently objects of intensive studies.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115NYrjK]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a family with a red cell membrane abnormality which results in an HS phenotype and pseudohypokalaemia. Clinically, the patients were asymptomatic and peripheral blood smears demonstrated HS and biochemistry suggested mild hyperbilirubinaemia with hemolytic anaemia. The true underlying molecular cause of this condition remains obscure, but it is suggested that a SLC4A1 variant gene could contribute to the condition. The clinical implications of pseudohypokalaemia are that it can lead to inappropriate investigation or treatment.

Learning points

We report, to our knowledge for the first time, a variation of the hereditary spherocytosis phenotype with increased red blood cell MCV and pseudohypokalaemia.
Severe hypokalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
Pseudohypokalaemia can be misleading and result in incorrect interpretation and patient mismanagement.
Immediate recognition of pseudohypokalaemia and appropriate intervention can prevent misdiagnosis.
The true underlying molecular cause of this condition remains obscure, but a possibility is that the SLC4A1 missense mutation which predicts structural alterations of transmembrane domains could contribute to changes in cation permeability.

### Self-reported pain levels for emergency department visits associated with sickle cell disease in the United States [^1164Xw9G]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited rare blood disorders that affects an estimated 100 000 individuals in the United States. The hallmark symptom of SCD is acute and chronic pain caused by vaso-occlusion owing to deoxygenated and sickled red blood cells. Acute pain episodes in SCD are frequently managed at home but also result in high levels of emergency department (ED) utilization. On average, ∼200 000 ED visits occur annually by individuals with SCD, with pain being the most common reason for ED utilization. Given the importance of the ED in providing acute care to persons living with SCD, we aim to describe self-reported pain levels in the ED. Specifically, we provide nationally representative estimates of the number and percentage of ED visits made across pain levels and compare self-reported pain between visits associated with SCD compared with the general patient population in the United States.

Data come from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), which is an annual nationally representative survey of ED visits made to nonfederal, short-stay hospitals in the United States. Survey reports from the years 1999 to 2000 and 2003 to 2019 were used to align with those from the years in which self-reported pain measures were collected and to exclude visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. ED visits associated with SCD were identified using the presence of International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification version 9 (ICD-9-CM) codes 282.41, 282.42, and 282.6X and any ICD-10-CM D57X code, excluding sickle-cell trait (D57.3). Therefore, SCD-related ED visits included all SCD codes and were not relegated to only vaso-occlusive crises. Any ED visit not flagged with a diagnosis code for SCD was considered to belong to the general patient population. Self-reported pain was assessed by hospital staff at the time of triage using a numerical pain intensity scale.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115G5C3h]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

RBC membrane is composed of a fluid double layer of lipids in which approximately 20 major proteins and 850 minor proteins are embedded. The membrane is attached to the intracellular cytoskeleton by protein–protein and lipid–protein interactions. The structure is required for the RBC to maintain its shape and stability and deformability. Many transmembrane (TM) proteins have a transport function and a structural function when the intracytoplasmic domain interacts with cytoskeletal proteins. For example, band 3 both interacts with cytoskeletal proteins and is the red cell chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger; in the tissues red cells take up CO 2 where it is converted to the bicarbonate ion, which leaves the cell in exchange for the chloride ion via band 3.

Many families with red cell membrane disorders of varying severity have been described. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a disorder that involves altered membrane structural organisation. In most cases of HS mutations are located in the following genes ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, EBP42 and SPTA1 which encode for Ankyrin, spectrin β-chain, band 3 protein (the red cell chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger 1), protein 4.2 and spectrin α-chain. Mutations for other disorders hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) are in the SPTA1 and SPTB gene and in the EPB41 gene. The latter gene encodes protein 4.1.HS, HE and HPP are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous blood cell membrane disorders. The presence of another RBC defect can enhance or reduce the phenotypic effects of HS, HE or HPP.

### Red cell membrane disorders [^111rrb5v]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of the erythrocyte membrane, including hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis, comprise an important group of inherited hemolytic anemias. These syndromes are characterized by marked clinical and laboratory heterogeneity. Recent molecular studies have revealed that there is also significant genetic heterogeneity in these disorders. This is particularly true for the spherocytosis syndromes where each kindred has a private mutation in one of the spherocytosis genes. Treatment with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Splenectomy via a laparoscopic approach has become the surgical method of choice. Growing recognition and understanding of the long-term risks and complications of splenectomy, including cardiovascular disease, thrombotic disorders, and pulmonary hypertension, and the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci, a concern for infection in overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, have led to reevaluation of the role of splenectomy. Recent management guidelines acknowledge these important considerations when entertaining splenectomy and recommend detailed discussion between health care providers, patient, and family.

### Abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane [^111yZ35c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Primary abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane are characterized by clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity. Among this group, hereditary spherocytosis patients are more likely to experience symptomatic anemia. Treatment of hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Growing recognition of the long-term risks of splenectomy has led to re-evaluation of the role of splenectomy. Management guidelines acknowledge these considerations and recommend discussion between health care providers, patient, and family. The hereditary elliptocytosis syndromes are the most common primary disorders of erythrocyte membrane proteins. However, most elliptocytosis patients are asymptomatic and do not require therapy.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of red cell membrane disorders [^111z6yPq]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders and hydration defects often present with the common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia, but they may require substantially different management, based on their pathophysiology. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to avoid inappropriate interventions and prevent complications. Advances in genetic testing availability within the last decade, combined with extensive foundational knowledge on RBC membrane structure and function, now facilitate the correct diagnosis in patients with a variety of hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs). Studies in patient cohorts with well-defined genetic diagnoses have revealed complications such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis, which is amenable to monitoring, prevention, and treatment, and demonstrated that splenectomy is not always an effective or safe treatment for any patient with HHA. However, a multitude of variants of unknown clinical significance have been discovered by genetic evaluation, requiring interpretation by thorough phenotypic assessment in clinical and/or research laboratories. Here we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding clinical management in patients with RBC membranopathies and propose an algorithm for the laboratory workup of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia, with a clinical case that exemplifies such a workup.

### The association of sickle-cell disorders with diabetic retinopathy: a large database study [^112xSS87]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study. We utilized data from the TriNetX Research Network, a large database network of 119 million patients across 80 health care organizations worldwide. TriNetX is an international health research network that facilitates access to electronic health records — including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab results, and genomic data — from numerous large-scale health care organizations. The data in this study were obtained from a subset of these health care organizations collectively known as the "Research" network and was performed in December 2023. This work used deidentified previously collected data. The study was determined to be exempt from the institutional review board approval at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The study complied with the tents of the Declaration of Helsinki.

We screened all patients' data in the TriNetX research network for the presence of DM using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes (ICD codes: E08-E13). We included all patients who had a diagnosis of T1DM or T2DM, dividing them into 3 cohorts. The first cohort included patients with DM with no history of sickle-cell disorders (ICD: D57.xx). The second cohort was those with DM and a diagnosis of SCD (ICD: D57 or D57.1), excluding those with SCT or sickle-cell/Hb-C disease. The third cohort comprised patients with DM and a diagnosis of SCT (ICD: D57.3), excluding those with SCD or sickle-cell/Hb-C disease. We excluded, from all cohorts, patients with any history of retinal disorders in diseases classified elsewhere (H36.xx), which includes proliferative and nonproliferative sickle-cell retinopathy.

Study population

We created a retrospective longitudinal cohort of individuals from the Truven database who fulfilled a previously validated case definition for SCD at any point between 2007 and 2018. Individuals had ≥ 1 inpatient claim or 2 outpatient or emergency department claims for SCD in any position using the International Classification of Disease, 9th and 10th edition codes (ICD-9: 282.41, 282.42, and 282.6x; ICD-10: D57.0x, D57.1x, D57.2x, D57.4x, and D57.8x, excluding 282.5 and D57.3; sickle cell trait). This criterion has > 90% sensitivity and specificity in identifying pediatric SCD and has been widely applied to populations of all ages; however, its performance in older adults has not been specifically evaluated. Individuals were followed from the start of their first claim encounter (irrespective of when SCD was diagnosed) from January 1, 2007, until December 31, 2018, or any period of continuous enrollment exceeding 1 year therein. We excluded all observations of individuals ≥ 65 years to eliminate periods in which all patients were eligible for Medicare. Because only the year of birth was available, we assumed an individual's day and month of birth coincided with their date of enrollment.

We selected control individuals from MEPS who were surveyed between 2007 and 2018. We restricted this sample to those who reported their primary race as Black since the majority of individuals with SCD are Black, and without race/ethnicity information from the Truven database, we were unable to match more granularly. Individuals selected from MEPS also had private insurance covering hospital and physician services and did not have claims for blood disorders (ICD-9: 280 to 289; ICD-10: D50 to D89) during the study period. We refer to this cohort as "matched controls" to reflect the absence of blood disorders, including SCD.

### Pseudohyperkalemia in a patient with leukemia: a diagnostic pitfall in emergency medicine [^111Y6G64]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudohyperkalemia is characterized by a falsely elevated serum potassium concentration, often due to cellular disruption during blood sample collection, processing, or transport. Accurate differentiation between pseudohyperkalemia and true hyperkalemia is vital to prevent inappropriate treatment, which can lead to iatrogenic hypokalemia.

Case Report

We present a case of a 67-year-old woman with hypertension and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia who presented to the emergency department with fever and hypotension. Initial laboratory results indicated hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and extreme leukocytosis. Despite aggressive management for hyperkalemia, persistent elevation of potassium levels without electrocardiographic changes raised suspicion for pseudohyperkalemia. Subsequent investigations, including the use of different blood collection tubes, revealed disparate potassium concentrations, confirming pseudohyperkalemia due to potassium leakage from fragile leukemia cells. The patient's potassium levels normalized upon using clot-activator tubes, and she was discharged without complications. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case underscores the importance of recognizing pseudohyperkalemia, especially in patients with leukocytosis and incompatible clinical manifestations. Proper blood-sample collection and handling, along with awareness of confounding factors, are essential to prevent misinterpretation of laboratory results and avoid unnecessary treatments. In clinical settings, heparin tubes, while convenient, may contribute to pseudohyperkalemia in patients with fragile blood cells, such as those with leukemia, due to mechanical stress during sample processing. Early recognition and appropriate diagnostic approaches are crucial to ensure accurate patient management and avoid potential harm from unwarranted interventions.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115N1uZ3]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies have indicated that exposure of blood to lower temperatures is associated with a rise in serum potassium concentration and high temperatures will result in a fall in serum potassium, even in healthy individuals. In one study, no significant change in serum potassium was observed at 20°C. In FP, the severity of hyperkalaemia at low temperatures is higher than that found in controls. In our family, the severity of hypokalaemia observed during storage of patient blood at RT and 37°C was increased compared with normal controls.

A detailed review on the crystal structure of band 3 protein has been published. Mutation of the Trp492 or Trp496 within the transmembrane region4 (TM4) is predicted to cause band 3 to misfold. The two residues face outward from the same side of TM4 and are in close contact with N-terminal region of TM8. It is possible that replacement of the bulky Trp496 with a Leu residue as found in our patients can disrupt the packing of this region. Prediction of the consequences of these structural changes to the cation leak remains uncertain. Other mechanisms are that the mutant band 3 activates other endogenous transporters causing a cation imbalance. Consistent with this proposal is that the modelled three-dimensional structures of the mutant ABCB6 polypeptide predicted modest structural alterations of TM and cytosolic ATP binding domains. It is likely that in vivo red cell homeostatic mechanisms maintain normokalaemia in the physiological state.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115DNr23]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Normal RBC has very low basal permeability (leak) to cations which is counteracted by Na, K-ATPase. The leak is temperature dependent. Red cell membrane disorders can also be secondary to altered membrane transport function. Hereditary stomatocytosis has several phenotypes associated with distinct genetic changes. The cryohydrosis phenotype which includes South-east Asian Ovalocytes results from mutations in the SLC4A1 and the rare condition; stomatin-deficient cryohydrosis is caused by mutations in SLC2A1. Mutations in RHAG cause the highly leaky condition overhydrated stomatocytosis and mutations in ABCB6 cause familial pseudohyperkalaemia (FP). All of the above are large multispanning membrane proteins. More recently mutations have been found in two RBC cation channels PIEZO1 and KCNN4 which result in dehydrated stomatocytosis. Changes in cation transport are a common factor in these disorders; however, these disorders show a wide heterogeneity in the degree of cation leak, temperature dependence of the leak and presenting symptoms.

Measurement of the temperature dependence of the abnormal cation leak in red cell membrane disorders is a useful means of identifying leaky mutations. The temperature dependence of the abnormal leak differs in the steepness and minimum temperature of the cation leak than normal controls. Bruce et al identified several different phenotypes associated with SLC4A1 mutations, including the cryohydrocytosis form of stomatocytosis, and HS associated with a large cation leak. Red cells from the affected pedigrees showed a deficiency of band 3 anion transport. The mutant RBCs have an increased permeability to cations though no study so far has shown that the cation leak is through the band 3 protein.

Red cells from FP patients exhibit a loss of K+ at low temperatures, < 37°C mostly at 4°C. The temperature dependency of the cation leak is variable.FP has been associated with HS and hereditary stomatocytosis. Other authors describe the haematological abnormalities as negligible or as atypical HS. The gene responsible for FP was identified as ABCB6 which encodes the protein ABCB6, previously identified as a porphyrin transporter, which belongs to the family of ABC transporters with a binding cassette for ATP. The protein plays a role in heme synthesis. It is not clear whether the mutant ABCB6 protein can generate a cation leak pathway or secondarily change conformation of other proteins that dysregulate membrane cation permeability.

### Burden of anemia in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in French secondary care [^111iRBoh]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Patients admitted to a hospital were classified by primary diagnosis and then allocated a randomized code to maintain anonymity. Access to patient information thereafter was available only at the hospital admission or hospital stay level. The two study cohorts were identified from the PMSI database using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Arthritis, defined as RA and/or OA, included seropositive RA (ICD-10 code M05), other RA (M06), polyarthrosis (M15), coxarthrosis/hip arthrosis (M16), gonarthrosis/knee arthrosis (M17), arthrosis of first carpometacarpal joint (M18), and other arthrosis (M19). A diagnosis of anemia included iron deficiency anemia (D50.0, D50.1, D50.8, D50.9), vitamin B 12 deficiency anemia (D51.0-D51.3, D51.8, D51.9), folate deficiency anemia (D52.0, D52.1, D52.8, D52.9), other nutritional anemias (D53.0-D53.2, D53.8, D53.9), and acquired hemolytic anemias (D59.0-D59.6, D59.8, D59.9). Patients with alpha and beta thalassemia were not included.

### Four pedigrees of the cation-leaky hereditary stomatocytosis class presenting with pseudohyperkalaemia. novel profile of temperature dependence of Na +-K + leak in a xerocytic form [^116A1eF3]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

We report four pedigrees of the group of Na(+)-K(+)-leaky red cell disorders of the 'hereditary stomatocytosis' class. Each showed pseudohyperkalaemia because of temperature-dependent loss of K(+) from red cells on storage of whole blood at room temperature. All pedigrees showed an abnormality in the temperature dependence of the 'passive leak' of the membrane to K(+). Two pedigrees, both of which showed a compensated haemolytic state with dehydrated red cells and target cells on the blood film, showed a novel pattern, in which the profile was flat between 37 degrees C and about 32 degrees C then dropped as the temperature was reduced to zero. The third showed the 'shallow slope' profile, with stomatocytes on the blood film and very markedly abnormal intracellular Na(+) and K(+) levels. Minimal haemolysis was present. The fourth pedigree, of Asian origin, showed the shoulder pattern (minimum at 32 degrees C, maximum at 12 degrees C) with essentially normal haematology. Both of these latter two forms have previously been seen in other pedigrees. The first variant represents a novel kind of temperature dependence of the passive leak found in these pedigrees presenting with pseudohyperkalaemia.

### Red cell membrane: past, present, and future [^113ammss]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

As a result of natural selection driven by severe forms of malaria, 1 in 6 humans in the world, more than 1 billion people, are affected by red cell abnormalities, making them the most common of the inherited disorders. The non-nucleated red cell is unique among human cell type in that the plasma membrane, its only structural component, accounts for all of its diverse antigenic, transport, and mechanical characteristics. Our current concept of the red cell membrane envisions it as a composite structure in which a membrane envelope composed of cholesterol and phospholipids is secured to an elastic network of skeletal proteins via transmembrane proteins. Structural and functional characterization of the many constituents of the red cell membrane, in conjunction with biophysical and physiologic studies, has led to detailed description of the way in which the remarkable mechanical properties and other important characteristics of the red cells arise, and of the manner in which they fail in disease states. Current studies in this very active and exciting field are continuing to produce new and unexpected revelations on the function of the red cell membrane and thus of the cell in health and disease, and shed new light on membrane function in other diverse cell types.

To confirm decrease in serum/plasma potassium with time, we used a screening method similar to one described previously. In brief, blood from both patients and a control were drawn into either heparinised or non-heparinised tubes and incubated at 4°C, room temperature (23°C, RT) and 37°C for a maximum of 10 hours. Controls were women aged 68 and 69 years old with full blood count, renal function, bone studies and liver enzymes within reference range. Directly after venepuncture and at the stated time intervals either serum/plasma was separated and potassium concentration was measured using an ion selective electrode (Roche, UK). Haemolysis index was measured and showed no significant increase in haemolysis. Both patient and controls showed normal electrolyte concentrations at venepuncture. However, patient samples stored at RT and 37°C showed a progressive decrease in serum/plasma potassium at 3 hours. There were no significant differences in the decrease in plasma and serum potassium stored at RT and 37°C for patient A. There was a marked decrease in both serum and plasma potassium at 3 hours (figures 2A–D and 3A–C) in both the proband and his daughter on storage at RT and 37°C which was not observed in the controls. The mean decrease in the patient potassium (figure 4) at 3 hours was −19% and −31% compared with −0.03% and +4.3% (ρ < 0.03) in the controls at RT and 37°C, respectively.

### Pseudohyperkalemia without reported haemolysis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^113puSuU]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a medical condition that requires immediate recognition and treatment to prevent the development of life-threatening arrhythmias. Pseudohyperkalemia is most commonly due to specimen haemolysis and is often recognised by laboratory scientists who subsequently report test results with cautionary warnings. The authors present a case of pseudohyperkalemia in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia that was the result of white blood cell lysis during phlebotomy. False elevations of potassium from this condition may not be reported with a warning from the laboratory. This places the patient at risk of unnecessary and potentially dangerous treatments. This phenomenon has not been published in the emergency medicine literature to date.

The nomenclature of genetic disorders

HC nomenclature suffers from a common problem of classifying genetic diseases. In contrast to genes, diseases lack a standardized way to review official names and symbols by formal committees. Disease nomenclature is often derived from the name(s) of the physician(s) who first described the condition, 1 major sign or symptom, or the biochemical/genetic underlying defect. However, the growing comprehension of the pathophysiological or molecular mechanisms that regulate diseases, as well as the identification of new phenotypes, may require revision of the initial name by experts in order to improve its usefulness in clinical practice.

Proper nomenclature, in fact, is an essential prerequisite for clear and effective communication about a particular condition. Ideally, it should unequivocally evoke disorders sharing the same pathogenesis and treatment, eventually helping clinicians to provide an accurate diagnosis and management.

### Pseudohyperkalemia in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed hematological malignancies [^112LdRCx]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with newly diagnosed hematological malignancies often present with a considerable cellular burden, leading to complications including hyperkalemia. However, pseudohyperkalemia, arising from in vitro cell lysis, can pose challenges in clinical practice. Although pseudohyperkalemia is frequently reported in adult hematological malignancies, its occurrence in pediatric patients is underreported, and its incidence in this demographic remains unclear. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of pediatric patients who received a new diagnosis of hematological malignancies from 2011 to 2022 at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Hyperkalemia was defined by a serum or plasma potassium level exceeding 5.5 mEq/L. Pseudohyperkalemia was defined by 1) a potassium decrease of over 1 mEq/L in within 4h without intervention or 2) the absence of electrocardiography changes indicative of hyperkalemia. Cases with apparent red blood cell hemolysis were excluded. A total of 157 pediatric patients with a new diagnosis of hematological malignancies were included, 14 of whom exhibited hyperkalemia. Among these 14 cases, 7 cases (4.5%) were of pseudohyperkalemia. This rate increased to 21.2% in patients with initial hyperleukocytosis. Pseudohyperkalemia was associated with a higher initial white blood cell count and lower serum sodium level. All episodes of pseudohyperkalemia occurred in the pediatric emergency department, where samples were obtained as plasma, whereas all true hyperkalemia cases were observed in the ordinary ward or intensive care unit, where samples were obtained as serum. Timely recognition of pseudohyperkalemia is crucial to avoiding unnecessary potassium-lowering interventions in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed hematological malignancies.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia: detection of new signals and risk assessment in a nationwide cohort study [^116BdeWc]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

More than 130 drugs have been suspected to induce immune hemolytic anemia. Comparative studies measuring the risk of drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) are lacking. We aimed (1) to detect new signals of DIIHA, excluding vaccines, and (2) to assess the association between all suspected drugs and the occurrence of immune hemolytic anemia in a nationwide comparative study. The new signals were identified using a disproportionality study (case/noncase design) in the World Pharmacovigilance Database, Vigibase, among the cases of adverse drug reactions reported up to February 2020 (> 20 million). We then conducted a comparative study in the French National health database that links sociodemographic, out-of-hospital, and hospital data for the entire population (67 million individuals). Associations between exposure to drugs (those already reported as DIIHA, plus new signals identified in Vigibase) and incident cases of immune hemolytic anemia (D59.0 and D59.1 diagnosis codes of the International Classification of Diseases, version 10) from 2012 to 2018 were assessed with case-control and case-crossover designs. In Vigibase, 3371 cases of DIIHA were recorded. Fifty-nine new signals were identified resulting in a final list of 112 drugs marketed in France and measurable in the nationwide cohort (n = 4746 patients with incident immune hemolytic anemia included in the case-control analysis matched with 22 447 controls from the general population). We identified an association between immune hemolytic anemia occurrence and some antibiotics, antifungal drugs, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, furosemide, azathioprine, and iomeprol.

Methods

Study populations and definition of CD and IMRDs

The dataset was prepared and pseudonymized by the Swedish government agency of statistics. All participants were identified using their personal identity number, which is a 10-digit number given to all Swedish residents at birth or immigration and used as personal identifier in medical records. Medical data were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and consisted of an extract from inpatient and outpatient medical registers used for the investigation of chronic diseases with inflammatory components between 1964 and 2017. The dataset included individuals who were themselves affected or who had parents, children or siblings affected by CD or diabetes. The International classifications of disease (ICD) codes used to identify these patients were 579A, 648A, 648W, 286, 269, 250, 260, K90.0 and E10-E14 O24. In total, approximately 3.3 million individuals or 30% of the total Swedish population were included.

Following exclusion of participants with diabetes, six sex- and age-matched reference individuals (RI) were randomly selected for each CD participant. There were 56 240 CD participants with 306 942 matched RI (Table 2). We then excluded those CD patients that died the same year they were diagnosed with CD and for who CD diagnosis occurred after 75 years of age. We further excluded RI that died the same year or before as their matching CD individual acquired CD diagnosis. This resulted in a main CD cohort of 42 355 participants, each with six matched RI (Table 2). Finally, we assessed medical records of CD patients and RI for diagnoses of IMRDs (outcomes) using relevant ICD codes. ICD N00-N06 cover all glomerular diseases except the hereditary forms. The code N08 was also included since it is a code that is used for the glomerular disease when the main disease is classified with another code. N10-12 covers the tubulointerstitial nephritis and the inflammatory forms of this disease. We also added M31, M35 and M32, which are vasculitis, Sjögren's syndrome and SLE with inflammatory kidney involvement respectively. In addition, D69.0 (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) and D59 (Acquired hemolytic anemia) have inflammatory components involving the kidney and were therefore also included (Table 1).

### Investigation of outpatients referred to a chemical pathologist with potential pseudohyperkalaemia [^1116kX2n]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudohyperkalaemia is when the in vitro blood potassium concentration is artefactually raised while the in vivo concentration is normal. With unexplained hyperkalaemia, pseudohyperkalaemia needs to be excluded to avoid unnecessary and potentially detrimental therapy. There are numerous causes, but no systematic approach for the investigation of outpatients with potential pseudohyperkalaemia exists in the literature.

Aims

To evaluate the in-house protocol.

Methods

Patients referred for investigation of potential pseudohyperkalaemia underwent an outpatient based protocol which is designed to determine whether the cause was due to delayed blood separation, clotting, centrifugation or a haematological abnormality.

Results

32 patients with serum potassium of 5.5–7.1 mmol/l were referred. All patients had pseudohyperkalaemia; the most frequent causes were full blood count (FBC) abnormalities (28%), time > 4 hours from sampling to centrifugation (28%) and sample clotting (25%). Anaemia was more likely to be found in male patients.

Conclusion

Before a problem can be treated, it must be confirmed and its aetiology identified. A systematic approach to investigate potential pseudohyperkalaemia has been presented. This confirmed the clinician's suspicion of pseudohyperkalaemia and in the majority of patients the aetiology was also identified. The use of serum and plasma potassium with an FBC in the initial investigation will identify whether clotting or a haematological abnormality is the cause in about half of the cases. Assay of whole-blood potassium is less important as centrifugation is a rare cause. Time to centrifugation is likely to play a major part in the majority of the remaining cases.

### Epidemiology and health outcomes associated with hyperkalemia in a primary care setting in england [^1147hPFE]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Several study design and database limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings. The CPRD captures data among patients seeking healthcare in a primary care setting and may not fully represent the healthcare status of all patients; this study may not be generalizable to populations outside of England because of inherent differences in populations, treatment strategies, and services. Although the CPRD/HES database is well validated, the potential for misclassified or nonspecific ICD-10 codes, diagnosis codes, and/or laboratory data exists and may lead to over- or under-reporting of HK events and other clinical outcomes, especially because clinical diagnoses were not verified by chart review. One study found the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes for diagnosing HK to be low (14.6% at hospital admission), which may contribute to under-reporting of HK events. However, the likely effect of this would be to underestimate the risk associated with HK. As noted earlier, laboratory data are not available in the HES database; therefore, if severe cases were not coded correctly, they would have been excluded from this analysis. Incidence of HK may also be misreported because this analysis primarily relied on laboratory findings of HK in the CPRD which likely included instances of spurious HK due to hemolysis. Further, the data sources could not account for previously unobserved occurrences of HK which might have obfuscated comorbidities at baseline, as it may be unclear if these conditions are a result of untreated HK. In addition, this analysis did not include emergency care data, which may contribute to potential undercapturing of HK diagnoses given that repeat testing may have occurred in an emergency setting. The incidence of repeat testing may have been further affected by mis-diagnoses and inaccurate K + levels due to hemolysis. The analysis may also be limited because of infrequent measurements of K +. Finally, this study cannot assess whether there is a causal relationship between HK and outcomes following HK events.

### Rare hereditary hemolytic anemias: diagnostic approach and considerations in management [^113iNapK]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs) comprise a heterogeneous group of anemias caused by mutations in genes coding the globins, red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteins, and RBC enzymes. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are rare disorders of erythropoiesis characterized by binucleated and multinucleated erythroblasts in bone marrow. CDAs typically present with a hemolytic phenotype, as the produced RBCs have structural defects and decreased survival and should be considered in the differential of HHAs. This article discusses the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and management considerations for rare HHAs arising from unstable hemoglobins, RBC hydration defects, the less common RBC enzymopathies, and CDAs.

### Hemolytic anemia [^115DmKz2]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.

Materials and methods

Study design and data source

This was a retrospective study using data from the US National Inpatient Sample (NIS) spanning the time period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018. The NIS database is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient database in the United States developed by Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. It contains a stratified sample of 20% of all discharges from American community hospitals, excluding rehabilitation and long-term acute care hospitals and including patients who are covered under Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance as well as those who are uninsured. It includes clinical and nonclinical elements, such as diagnoses, procedures, demographics, payment, and hospital characteristics of ∼7 million inpatient stays. Each observation is assigned a discharge weight which is projected to a nationally representative population, and it represents a single hospital stay, including 1 primary discharge diagnosis, up to 24 secondary diagnoses, patient demographics, procedures performed, in-hospital mortality status, insurance status, and length of stay. Diagnoses were identified based on the the International Classification of Disease, 10th edition, Clinical Modification codes.

### Clinical and biological features in-hereditary xerocytosis and gardos channelopathy: a retrospective series of 126 patients [^113ESk2u]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary stomatocytoses are dominant red cell membrane disorders characterized by an increased cation leak through the membrane and a subsequent alteration in cell hydration. Also called hereditary xerocytosis (HX) (MIM #194380), dehydrated stomatocytosis is the most frequent of these disorders, with an estimated incidence of 1:50000 births. It is characterized by chronic hemolysisas well as non-hematologic features including transient perinatal edema, pseudohyperkalemia, iron overloadand post-splenectomy thromboembolic complicationsthat often dominate the phenotype and delay the diagnosis. In addition, diagnosis is complex because of the lack of an easily available biological test. Osmotic gradient ektacytometry is the most efficient diagnostic tool so far, showing a typical left-shifted curve with increased osmotic resistance. However, it is only performed in a few specialized laboratories.

HX is most often caused by gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO1 which encodes a mechanosensitive ion channel that translates a mechanic stimulus into an increased intracellular calcium concentration. – Recent reports have shown that PIEZO1 mutants induce an inappropriate increase in intracellular Ca 2+ which in turn activates the Gardos channel inducing potassium leak, water loss and consequently erythrocyte dehydration. Of note, erythrocyte dehydration related to PIEZO1 gain-of-function mutations has also been associated with protection against malaria. In HX, it can be assumed that PIEZO1 mutations lead to a stronger dehydration and subsequently to hemolysis. Besides PIEZO1 mutations, gain-of-function mutations in KCNN4, encoding the Gardos channel, directly cause another subset of HX.

Up to now, with the exception of a recent report, the clinical and biological features of HX have been mostly described in small series. Large-scale clinical and biological descriptions at diagnosis and comparisons with the underlying genotypes are required. We report here a retrospective study describing the clinical and biological features in the largest series to date including 126 patients from 64 families with HX diagnosed based on ektacytometry and/or genetics between 1993 and 2017.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^1131gom4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115JdZD7]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Potassium measurement factors and mechanisms — causes and implications are detailed for pseudohyperkalemia, shifts, impaired excretion, diurnal/postprandial effects, and sample type. Pseudohyperkalemia occurs when "in vivo serum potassium is normal and commonly GFR preserved, but during the process of drawing blood or clotting, there has been a release of intracellular potassium", with causes including "Tight tourniquet", "Hand/arm exercising or clenching at the time of blood draw", and "Hemolysis due to vigorous shaking of blood vial/inappropriate blood draw equipment/inappropriate storage of samples"; if suspected, "blood should be retaken and analyzed in the appropriate manner and time frame", and "take plasma potassium as serum potassium may be falsely increased". Hyperkalemia may reflect shifting due to "Increase in plasma osmolality… ", "β-adrenergic blockade", "Insulin deficiency", "Aldosterone blockade", or "Nonorganic acidosis", and also "Disruption in the release of insulin… " or "Disruption to the release of aldosterone… " Decreased excretion causes include "Advancing CKD resulting in inability to excrete excessive potassium", "Constipation: in advancing CKD, the gut assumes a much more important role… by increasing the excretion of potassium", and "Medications: blocking the RAAS pathway and other medication resulting in the inability to excrete excessive potassium (Table 26)". There is "Diurnal variation in potassium excretion with most excretion in humans occurring close to noon", and "Note the 0.24–0.73 mmol/l variation in K+ values within individuals over a 24-hour period". "Potassium values differ between serum and plasma values with serum values being typically higher. Healthcare providers need to be aware of the right reference values for the sample". In chronic kidney disease (CKD), "As kidney function declines in CKD, there is a corresponding decline in the ability of the kidneys to increase kaliuresis postprandially, eventually becoming insufficient to maintain external potassium balance".

### Functional characterization of novel ABCB6 mutations and their clinical implications in familial pseudohyperkalemia [^1148LLMF]. Haematologica (2016). Low credibility.

Isolated familial pseudohyperkalemia is a dominant red cell trait characterized by cold-induced 'passive leak' of red cell potassium ions into plasma. The causative gene of this condition is ABCB6, which encodes an erythrocyte membrane ABC transporter protein bearing the Langereis blood group antigen system. In this study analyzing three new families, we report the first functional characterization of ABCB6 mutants, including the homozygous mutation V454A, heterozygous mutation R276W, and compound heterozygous mutations R276W and R723Q (in trans). All these mutations are annotated in public databases, suggesting that familial pseudohyperkalemia could be common in the general population. Indeed, we identified variant R276W in one of 327 random blood donors (0.3%). Four weeks' storage of heterozygous R276W blood cells resulted in massive loss of potassium compared to that from healthy control red blood cells. Moreover, measurement of cation flux demonstrated greater loss of potassium or rubidium ions from HEK-293 cells expressing ABCB6 mutants than from cells expressing wild-type ABCB6. The R276W/R723Q mutations elicited greater cellular potassium ion efflux than did the other mutants tested. In conclusion, ABCB6 missense mutations in red blood cells from subjects with familial pseudohyperkalemia show elevated potassium ion efflux. The prevalence of such individuals in the blood donor population is moderate. The fact that storage of blood from these subjects leads to significantly increased levels of potassium in the plasma could have serious clinical implications for neonates and infants receiving large-volume transfusions of whole blood. Genetic tests for familial pseudohyperkalemia could be added to blood donor pre-screening. Further study of ABCB6 function and trafficking could be informative for the study of other pathologies of red blood cell hydration.

### A classification of hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and related disorders [^114e9sTj]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnostic terms hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are based on historical and overlapping clinical descriptions. Advances in understanding some of the causes of the syndrome now permit many patients to be classified according to etiology. The increased precision of a diagnosis based on causation is important for considering logical approaches to treatment and prognosis. It is also essential for research. We propose a classification that accommodates both a current understanding of causation (level 1) and clinical association in cases for whom cause of disease is unclear (level 2). We tested the classification in a pediatric disease registry of HUS. The revised classification is a stimulus to comprehensive investigation of all cases of HUS and TTP and is expected to increase the proportion of cases in whom a level 1 etiological diagnosis is confirmed.

### Do hemolyzed potassium specimens need to be repeated? [^116PPkHq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In the emergency department (ED), hyperkalemia in the presence of hemolysis is common. Elevated hemolyzed potassium levels are often repeated by emergency physicians to confirm pseudohyperkalemia and to exclude a life-threatening true hyperkalemia.

Objectives

We hypothesize that in patients with a normal renal function, elevated hemolyzed potassium, and normal electrocardiogram (ECG), there may not be a need for further treatment or repeat testing and increased length of stay.

Methods

Data were prospectively enrolled patients presenting to the ED from July 2011 to February 2012. All adult subjects who had a hemolyzed potassium level ≥ 5.5 mEq/dL underwent a repeat potassium level and ECG. The incidence of true hyperkalemia in this population was measured.

Results

A total of 45 patients were enrolled. The overall median age was 52 years (range 25–83 years); 22 were female (49%). In patients with hyperkalemia on initial blood draw and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60 (n = 45), the negative predictive value was 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.2–99.9%). When patients had hyperkalemia on initial blood draw, GFR ≥ 60, and a normal ECG (n = 42), the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI 93.1–100%).

Conclusions

In the setting of hemolysis, GFR ≥ 60 mL/min in conjunction with a normal ECG is a reliable predictor of pseudohyperkalemia and may eliminate the need for repeat testing. In patients with a normal GFR who are otherwise deemed safe for discharge, our results indicate there is no need for repeat testing.

### Characterizing the healthcare utilization and costs of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^116fJq4E]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Sample Selection

The analyses utilized data from patients in the database between January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2023. Patients were required to have an ICD 10 diagnostic code of I78.0: HHT. To eliminate patients with a provisional or "rule out" diagnosis, we required patients to have either a hospital admission with ICD 10 I78.0, or two or more outpatient visits on separate days during the observation period. The ICD 10 PCS, CPT, and HCPCS codes used to define anemia and hematologic support (intravenous iron and red cell transfusion) are shown in Table S1.

To evaluate subpopulations of patients with HHT with anemia and receiving hematologic support, the data dictionary from Komodo's MapLab was reviewed for all codes related to anemia, blood transfusion and iron infusion in the ICD10, CPT, HCPCS, PCS and billing revenue categories for the dataset. These were then applied to the variables of "primary diagnosis code/array", "admission diagnosis code", "diagnosis/secondary diagnosis code", "icd pcs codes", "cpt hcpcs codes", "procedure code", and "revenue codes" within the HHT population to create the subpopulations for analysis.

2.3 Analysis

We analyzed costs separately for calendar years 2022 and 2023. We calculated all costs for prevalent patients diagnosed with HHT during the observation period, regardless of whether those costs were specifically associated with an ICD 10 I78.0 diagnosis. Inpatient costs were derived from Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) Medicare Allowable Costs. Outpatient costs were derived from PCS, CPT, and HCPCS. Pharmacy costs utilized NDCs. Costs were calculated as mean ± standard deviation and median PPPY, as well as total cost for the full sample in each year. Costs were reported for all HHT patients, the subset with anemia, and the subset receiving hematologic support, separately by calendar year. Codes used to define anemia and hematologic support are shown in Table S1. We examined the leading costs within each utilization category: inpatient costs by admission ICD 10 code and by DRG; outpatient costs by procedure code; and pharmacy costs by indication category and generic drug name. Note that outpatient procedure codes were consolidated, as differentiation of iron infusion by specific iron product or bevacizumab by branded or biosimilar were not deemed relevant.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^116J1uTa]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I (CDA‐I) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] entry: 224120; Orphanet: D64.4 and DCS‐10) is one of a heterogeneous group of disorders termed the congenital dyserythropoietic anaemias (CDAs). Unlike other rare anaemias, the CDAs are characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis and morphological abnormalities of erythroblasts. Other haematopoietic lineages are unaffected and there is a haemolytic component. Dyserythropoiesis is defined as the presence of erythroblast abnormalities indicative of aberrant proliferation or differentiation (Crookston et al, 1966). The World Health Organization recognizes nine types of erythroid dysplasia (Brunning et al, 2008). Although there are further categories and subcategories of abnormalities described on dysplastic bone marrow smears, concordance amongst expert haematologists reviewing identical dyserythropoietic slides is poor (Goasguen et al, 2018). Crookston's original description allows for a minority of dyserythropoiesis in normal bone marrow (Crookston et al, 1966).

There are three main types of CDA (CDA‐I, CDA‐II and CDA‐III) and although each has specific morphological and clinical features, blood films show overlapping abnormalities. All subtypes show anisocytosis and poikilocytosis and CDA‐I has macrocytic red cells while types II and III are usually normocytic (Bain et al, 2010). The major CDA subgroups were originally proposed based on specific erythroblast morphological abnormalities on bone marrow light microscopy of aspirates (Heimpel & Wendt, 1968): CDA‐I is indicated by binucleate macrocytic erythroblasts and internuclear bridging, CDA‐II by the presence of 10–35% binucleate late erythroblasts and CDA‐III by the presence of giant multinucleate erythroblasts with up to 12 nuclei per cell. Electron microscopy of erythroblasts reveals a characteristic pattern of chromatin abnormalities in CDA‐I (see below) and a double cellular membrane in CDA‐II. This classification system has facilitated the systematic collection of CDA cases, allowed the best available treatment to be delivered and led to the identification of causative genes. However, the degree to which these disorders share a molecular basis is unclear.

### Disorders of red cell membrane [^112zkfEq]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Studies during the last three decades have enabled the development of detailed molecular insights into the structural basis of altered function in various inherited red cell membrane disorders. This review highlights our current understanding of molecular and mechanistic insights into various inherited red cell membrane disorders involving either altered membrane structural organization (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary ovalocytosis) or altered membrane transport function (hereditary stomatocytosis). The molecular basis for the vast majority of cases of hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis and ovalocytosis have been fully defined while little progress has been made in defining the molecular basis for hereditary stomatocytosis. Mutations in a number of distinct genes account for hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, while a single genetic defect accounts for all cases of hereditary ovalocytosis. Based on these molecular insights, a comprehensive understanding of the structural basis for altered membrane function has been developed. Loss of vertical linkage between membrane skeleton and lipid bilayer leads to membrane loss in hereditary spherocytosis, while weakening of lateral linkages between skeletal proteins leads to membrane fragmentation and surface area loss in hereditary elliptocytosis. Importantly, the severity of anaemia in both these disorders is directly related to extent of membrane surface area loss. Splenectomy results in amelioration of anaemia.

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON society [^1172ZEKP]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, the panelists agreed that the definition of HC should also include the absence of hematological signs of a primary/predominant red blood cell (RBC) disorder, such as anemia or reticulocytosis (see Table 1 for some exceptions to this rule). This is needed to distinguish HC from other IO conditions, often referred to as "iron-loading anemias", which are similarly characterized by increased TSAT and are nearly always genetically determined. In these conditions, the hepcidin suppression is caused by factors released by erythropoietin-stimulated erythroblasts (eg, erythroferrone or ERFE), as a consequence of ineffective erythropoiesis or compensated chronic hemolysis, and not by variants in genes affecting the hepcidin-ferroportin axis. The prototype of this group is nontransfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT). IO also occurs in transfusion-dependent inherited anemias, but in this case, it is mainly due to transfusions per se, and hepcidin levels tend to be increased, especially immediately after the transfusion because of suppression of erythropoiesis. Figure 3 illustrates the main mechanisms underlying the development of IO in hemochromatosis and iron loading anemias. As mentioned above, the majority of iron loading anemias are inherited, including forms caused by variants in the hemoglobin genes, in genes coding for RBC enzymes or membrane structures, as well as congenital sideroblasticor dyserythropoieticanemias. Sometimes, variants in genes directly regulating iron transport and utilization (such as DMT1, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, and others) may be implicated as well. Finally, IO due to hepcidin inhibition can also occur independently of transfusions in some forms of myelodysplastic syndromes, especially those characterized by ringed sideroblasts and increased ineffective erythropoiesis associated with acquired somatic mutations in SF3B1. In any case, all these conditions should never be regarded as hemochromatosis because of the distinct pathogenesis and treatment (eg, phlebotomies are often not feasible).

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^116SAXmM]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Two further British families with the 'cryohydrocytosis' form of hereditary stomatocytosis [^112vZoKm]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

We describe two families with the 'cryohydrocytosis' form of stomatocytosis. Both show a mild stomatocytic anaemia with Hb levels of 12–16 g/dl and reticulocyte counts of 4.3–24%, with very marked autohaemolysis at refrigerator temperatures and pseudohyperkalaemia as a result of loss of K from red cells on storage at room temperature. The ouabain + bumetanide-insensitive 'passive leak' K influx showed a 'U'-shaped temperature dependence, with a minimum at 23 degrees C. In one family, there was consistent variation in haematological severity within the pedigree. In the other, the parents of the proposita were normal, but all three of her children were affected, consistent with a new mutation of a dominant condition. Cold storage of the red cells led to a very marked increase in osmotic fragility and macrospherocytosis, explaining why a diagnosis of 'hereditary spherocytosis' can easily be reached in these pedigrees.

### Sub-lethal hydrops as a manifestation of dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis in two consecutive pregnancies [^117TtWZf]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2003). Low credibility.

Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) is a rare congenital hemolytic anemia mapping to 16q23-q24. We showed recently that it is part of a pleiotropic syndrome likely to display pseudohyperkalemia and/or different forms of fetal and placental fluid collections. Here, we report a woman with DHS. She had two consecutive pregnancies associated with severe fetal hydrops. Hydrops would probably have been lethal in the absence of appropriate removal of ascites and excess amniotic fluid. In utero exchange transfusion, performed once, was useless, because anemia was not pronounced enough to be the cause of the hydrops. In both newborns, ascites resolved within a week following birth and never recurred. The association of hydrops and hemolytic anemia suggests the possibility of DHS. Symptomatic treatment of the hydrops assists survival until spontaneous resorption occurs.

### 10-year risk of gallstones in congenital red blood cell disorder patients: a nationwide cohort study [^111otvD1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic hemolysis potentially elevates the risk of gallstones in several types of congenital red blood cell (RBC) disorders. However, the magnitude of the risk is unknown. We investigate the risk of gallstone disease in congenital RBC disorder patients, compared with general population comparators. Patients were identified from the Danish National Patient Registry covering all Danish hospitals and the National Reference Laboratory for RBC disorders during 1980–2016. Patients were matched by sex, age, and region of origin with up to 50 general population comparators. Gallstone events were identified using hospital-registered diagnoses and surgery codes. Our study included 9354 congenital RBC disorder patients, grouped according to type of congenital RBC disorder, and 416994 general population comparators. The cumulative 10-year incidence of gallstone disease was 4.2% in patients with congenital RBC disorders and 1.7% among comparators. Adjusted csHR's [95% confidence interval] were 8.1 [6.8, 9.7] for hereditary spherocytosis; 3.3 [1.6, 6.8] for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; 21.6 [10.6, 44.1] for pyruvate kinase deficiency; 3.7 [1.9, 7.0] for sickle cell disease; 0.8 [0.4, 1.6] for sickle cell trait; 1.5 [1.1, 2.2] for α-thalassemia trait; 1.8 [1.4, 2.3] for β-thalassemia minor; and 2.1 [1.8, 2.6] for other congenital hemolysis. We found a markedly higher risk of hospital-registered gallstone diseases in nearly all groups of patients with congenital RBC disorders compared with the general population.

### Glut1 deficiency syndrome: novel pathomechanisms, current concepts, and challenges [^115FKe1o]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

2.7 Valine 165

Valine 165 lies near the exofacial substrate‐binding site or directly in the sugar permeation pathway. V165I generates a side chain, which resides in the middle of transmembrane helix 5 and juts into the aqueous permeation pathway of GLUT1, causing impaired glucose transport.

2.8 Cysteine 207

GLUT1 is palmitoylated at Cysteine 207, and S‐palmitoylation is required for maintaining GLUT1 plasma membrane localization. In vitro studies indicate that the single substitution of C207 does not impair glucose transport or GLUT1 tetramerization. However, C207 variants, though yet undescribed, may potentially result in GLUT1 delocalization.

2.9 Serine 226

Serine 226 was identified as a Protein Kinase C phosphorylation site, required for the regulation of glucose uptake and enhanced cell surface localization of GLUT1. Lee et al. demonstrated that disruption of phosphorylation at this site impairs glucose transport and proposed that this modification is important in the physiological regulation of glucose transport.

2.10 Threonine 310

Threonine 310 is located in the wall of the predicted glucose channel. Missense variants have been confirmed by functional studies as a disease‐causing in Glut1DS.

2.11 Asparagine 317

The GLUT1 sugar binding site has been identified at this highly conserved amino acid residue unique to the GLUT family and preserved among species.

2.12 Glycine 286/Isoleucine 435

Glycine 286/Isoleucine 435 give rise to the very rare pathomechanism of stomatin deficiency in Glut1DS. Stomatin is an integral plasma membrane protein closely associated with Glut1 and present at a high abundance in the human RBC plasma membrane. Stomatin‐deficient cryohydrocytosis is characterized by the leakage of sodium and potassium from red blood cells at low temperatures, resulting in pseudohyperkalemia. Two spontaneous de novo mutations in residues G286 and I435 were involved. Glycine 286 is completely conserved across all species and positioned adjacent to the putative glucose transport pathway as part of an exofacial glucose binding site. The G286D variant is thought to reduce the conformational mobility of GLUT1 by the potential formation of a novel salt bridge between D286 and L38 within the N‐terminus. Since seven additional cases have been reported, indicating that this pathomechanism might be underdiagnosed within Glut1DS.

### Amechanotoxin-4 (GsMTx4)-sensitive cation channel mediates increased cation permeability in human hereditary spherocytosis of multiple genetic etiologies [^111v7wtC]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia among people of Northern European descent. HS is caused by mutations in genes encoding the erythroid cytoskeleton proteins ankyrin-1 (ANK1), b-spectrin (SPTB), and α-spectrin (SPTA1), the major intrinsic erythroid membrane protein and chloridebicarbonate exchanger, SLC4A1/band 3, and rarely EPB42/protein 4.2. These mutations lead to destabilization and progressive loss of red cell membrane lipids and surface area, and in some cases to destabilization of cytoskeletal-membrane attachment. The resulting red cells often exhibit normochromic or hyperchromic, mildmoderate microcytosis with increased incubated osmotic fragility and reduced deformability. Anemia and chronic hemolysis can be accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia and painful splenic enlargement. Splenectomy often provides symptomatic relief and attenuates anemia and hemolysis.

Increased erythroid cation permeability in HS was first reported by Harris and Prankerd (1953) and Bertles (1957), as subsequently cited by Zarkowsky et al. Later reports of increased red cell cation permeability appeared in the setting of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis and cyrohydrocytosis in association with SLC4A1 mutations, in the setting of overhydrated stomatocytosis in association with mutations in RHAG, SLC2A1, and SLC4A1, and in the setting of familial pseudohyperkalemia associated with ABCB6 mutations. Spherocytic mouse red cells genetically lacking EBP41 or EBP42, or haploinsufficient for SLC4A1 exhibited enhanced Gardos channel activity and increased hemolysis in the presence of the Gardos inhibitor, clotrimazole, consistent with enhanced nonspecific cation permeability associated with these mouse HS models. Human HS red cells of diverse genotype were uniformly characterized by increased steady-state concentrations of fluorometrically measured intracellular [Ca 2+]. However, Petkova-Kirova et al.recently reported that HS red cells of the same individuals had a spectrum of decreased, increased, or unchanged cation channel activities as measured by an automated whole cell patch clamp technique.

This retrospective matched cohort study used the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD SM), a geographically dispersed managed-care repository with claims data on more than 45 million enrollees residing across all 50 states, to identify infants born from 01/01/2011 through 08/31/2017. The HIRD is one of the largest privately insured population databases in the U.S. This observational study was exempt from informed consent stipulations as researchers accessed a limited data set without individual enrollee identifiers and only summary statistics were reported. The study complied with all relevant provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

Study population

Newborns were linked to their birth mothers via shared health plan subscriber identification (ID) numbers. Mothers' delivery dates were verified within 32 days of newborns' dates of birth using delivery codes (Appendix: Table 7). Infants with 30-day or longer continuous enrollment after birth and mothers with at least 12 months of continuous health plan enrollment before delivery were included. All newborns, regardless of their estimated gestational age (GA), were included for NHB prevalence estimation. The treated hemolytic NHB and matched non-NHB cohorts were selected among newborns ≥ 35 weeks GA. We excluded newborns < 35 weeks GA as there was no clinical practice guidelines available for this group due to lack of evidence-based data, variabilities in clinical manifestations, and uncertainties about treatment benefits.

NHB population was defined as newborns with ≥ 1 International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10-CM diagnostic codes of NHB (ICD-9-CM = 773.0, 773.1, 773.2, 773.4, 774.x and ICD-10-CM = P55.x, P57.x, P58.x, P59.x) during the first 30 days after birth. Newborns with ≥ 1 ICD-9/10-CM diagnosis codes of ICD-9-CM = 773.0, 773.1, 773.2, 773.4, 774.0, 774.1, 774.7 and ICD-10-CM = P55.x, P57.x, P58.0, P58.1, P58.8, P58.9 were selected for the population of NHB with hemolysis indicators or hemolytic NHB (Appendix: Table 8).

### Definitions of the phenotypic manifestations of sickle cell disease [^111nWLVF]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a pleiotropic genetic disorder of hemoglobin that has profound multiorgan effects. The low prevalence of SCD (approximately 100,000/US) has limited progress in clinical, basic, and translational research. Lack of a large, readily accessible population for clinical studies has contributed to the absence of standard definitions and diagnostic criteria for the numerous complications of SCD and inadequate understanding of SCD pathophysiology. In 2005, the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers initiated a project to establish consensus definitions of the most frequently occurring complications. A group of clinicians and scientists with extensive expertise in research and treatment of SCD gathered to identify and categorize the most common complications. From this group, a formal writing team was formed that further reviewed the literature, sought specialist input, and produced definitions in a standard format. This article provides an overview of the process and describes 12 body system categories and the most prevalent or severe complications within these categories. A detailed Appendix provides standardized definitions for all complications identified within each system. This report proposes use of these definitions for studies of SCD complications, so future studies can be comparably robust and treatment efficacy measured. Use of these definitions will support greater accuracy in genotype-phenotype studies, thereby achieving a better understanding of SCD pathophysiology. This should nevertheless be viewed as a dynamic rather than final document; phenotype descriptions should be reevaluated and revised periodically to provide the most current standard definitions as etiologic factors are better understood, and new diagnostic options are developed.

### Developments in neuroacanthocytosis: expanding the spectrum of choreatic syndromes [^116CdpRA]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

As with other neurodegenerative disorders, research into the group of diseases known under the umbrella term of "neuroacanthocytosis" has greatly benefited from the identification of causative genes. The distinct and unifying aspect of these disorders is the presence of thorny deformations of circulating erythrocytes. This may be due to abnormal properties of red cell membranes, which could lead to insights into mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Research approaches in this field, in addition to examining functions and protein interactions of the affected proteins with particular respect to neurons, have also drawn upon the expertise of hematologists and red cell membrane biologists. In this article, recent developments in the field are presented.

### Diagnostic disparities in inborn errors of immunity: from clinical suspicion to diagnosis [^117AJDks]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Study participants

Study participants included both pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with an unspecified disorder of the immune mechanism (ie, unspecified immune deficiency [uID]) who were subsequently diagnosed with IEI (Fig 1). ICD diagnostic codes in the first and second diagnosis positions were used to identify uID (ICD-9 279.9, ICD-10 D89.9) and IEI (ICD-9 279.0x-279.3x, 279.8, ICD-10 D80-D84) diagnoses (see Table E1 in this article's Online Repository available at). We restricted our cohort to patients who presented with at least one IEI symptom in the annual year of the first (index) uID diagnosis during the study period. IEI symptoms were identified using a previously validated algorithm that enumerates relevant diagnostic and pharmacy codes to assess IEI risk. Given these inclusion criteria, patients in our cohort represented individuals who had received medical attention for suspected IEI-related symptoms but had not yet received a more definitive clinical diagnosis of IEI.

Fig 1
Study cohort definition.

To ensure adequate follow-up, we confined the study cohort to patients with continuous enrollment for > 12 months before and after index uID diagnosis. To form an incident cohort (ie, a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed IEI), we further confined our study cohort to those who did not have an IEI diagnosis at least a year before the index uID diagnosis. We included both pediatric and adult patients. Individuals aged ≥ 65 years were only included if they were enrolled onto Medicare Advantage health plans; those enrolled onto Medicare alone were excluded because data from these individuals may not be completely captured in our dataset. To exclude patients with secondary immune deficiency, we applied a previously published algorithmand excluded patients with human immunodeficiency virus, patients with immune deficiency due to drugs or external causes, and patients diagnosed with uID who also had a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma. Table E2, in the Online Repository available at, lists the ICD codes we used for identifying these conditions, and Fig 2 provides the selection criteria.

### Sensitivity of international classification of diseases codes for hyponatremia among commercially insured outpatients in the United States [^1128nb57]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

We excluded members with a professional claim for dialysis in 2004 or 2005. We also excluded members with serum/plasma triglycerides > 400 mg/dL as measured 15 days before or after the reference serum sodium date, due to the possibility that any observed changes in serum sodium were related to pseudohyponatremia. If blood glucose was > 300 mg/dL as measured 15 days before or after the reference serum sodium lab date, we adjusted the serum sodium laboratory result by a factor of 1.6 (adjusted value = original value + ([glucose – 100]/100) × 1.6).

We reviewed inpatient, outpatient, and professional claims for evidence of underlying comorbid conditions within the 60-day period before through 15 days after the reference serum sodium date. Specifically, we searched for evidence of liver cirrhosis (ICD-9-CM code 572.4); congestive heart failure (428.0); nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis (580–589); and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (253.6). In addition, we identified comorbid conditions using the coding algorithms described by Birman-Deych et al and Quan et al. We searched all inpatient, outpatient, and professional claims for 60 days before through 15 days after the reference serum sodium date for evidence of cerebrovascular disease (362.34, 430.x-438.x), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (416.8, 416.9, 490.x-505.x, 506.4, 508.1, 508.8), coronary heart disease (410.x-414.x, 429.2, V45.81), dementia (290.x, 294.1, 331.2), diabetes mellitus (250.x), hypertension (401.x-405.x, 437.2), kidney disease (403.01, 403.11, 403.91, 404.02, 404.036, 404.12, 404.13, 404.92, 404.93, 582.x, 583.0–583.7, 585.x, 586.x, 588.0, V42.0, V45.1, V56.x), metastatic carcinoma (196.x-199.x), peripheral vascular disease (093.0 437.3, 440.x, 441.x, 443.1–443.9, 47.1, 557.1, 557.9, V43.4), and rheumatic disease (446.5, 710.0–710.4, 714.0–714.2, 714.8, 725.x).

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^1156v3af]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Not all hereditary iron overload is hemochromatosis: a case of hereditary xerocytosis unmasked by blood smear morphology [^1166ZBaq]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

With later access to molecular diagnostics, the diagnosis of hereditary xerocytosis, suspected from the blood film, was confirmed. A next‐generation sequencing (NGS) panel for hereditary hemolytic anemias revealed the presence of the missense variant c.5975C > T p.(Thr1992Met) in the PIEZO1 gene, apparently in homozygosity, resulting in the substitution of threonine with methionine at position 1992. The PIEZO1 gene encodes a component of the Piezo‐type mechanosensitive ion channel. Pathogenic variants in PIEZO1 are associated with dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis with or without pseudohyperkalemia and constitutional abnormalities. The variant is listed in the ClinVar database (ID: 3256323) as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), but our patient demonstrates that it is pathogenic.

Hereditary xerocytosis, also known as the dehydrated form of hereditary stomatocytosis, is a rare inherited hemolytic anemia characterized by increased cation permeability, normal or elevated intracellular cation content, and cellular dehydration. The disorder follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with variable penetrance. It is typically milder than the overhydrated variant. Most cases are associated with a gain‐of‐function mutation in the PIEZO1 gene. Notably, hepatic iron overload can be disproportionately severe relative to the degree of anemia. Diagnosis is important, both because of the possibility of iron overload and because splenectomy should be avoided.

The patient has continued on regular phlebotomy, and ultrasonography of the liver is now normal.

### Multiple clinical forms of dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis arise from mutations in PIEZO1 [^112tkTie]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHSt) usually presents as a compensated hemolytic anemia with macrocytosis and abnormally shaped red blood cells (RBCs). DHSt is part of a pleiotropic syndrome that may also exhibit pseudohyperkalemia and perinatal edema. We identified PIEZO1 as the disease gene for pleiotropic DHSt in a large kindred by exome sequencing analysis within the previously mapped 16q23-q24 interval. In 26 affected individuals among 7 multigenerational DHSt families with the pleiotropic syndrome, 11 heterozygous PIEZO1 missense mutations cosegregated with disease. PIEZO1 is expressed in the plasma membranes of RBCs and its messenger RNA, and protein levels increase during in vitro erythroid differentiation of CD34(+) cells. PIEZO1 is also expressed in liver and bone marrow during human and mouse development. We suggest for the first time a correlation between a PIEZO1 mutation and perinatal edema. DHSt patient red cells with the R2456H mutation exhibit increased ion-channel activity. Functional studies of PIEZO1 mutant R2488Q expressed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated changes in ion-channel activity consistent with the altered cation content of DHSt patient red cells. Our findings provide direct evidence that R2456H and R2488Q mutations in PIEZO1 alter mechanosensitive channel regulation, leading to increased cation transport in erythroid cells.

### Changes in hydroxyurea use among youths enrolled in medicaid with sickle cell anemia after 2014 revision of clinical guidelines [^112HFFgT]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Our study population consisted of youths ages 1 through 17 years with SCA who were enrolled in Medicaid for at least 1 continuous year within the study period. Continuous enrollment was required to ensure complete capture of claims; this approach reduced the likelihood of underestimating adherence rates due to missing data. For data through September 2015, youths with SCA were identified as those with at least 3 claims with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code related to SCA (282.61 or 282.62). Compared with the criterion standard of newborn screening records, this case definition identified youths with SCA with a sensitivity of 91.4% and specificity of 80.0%. From October 2015 through December 2018, after the US transitioned to mandatory reporting using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), youths with SCA were identified as those with at least 1 outpatient visit with an ICD-10 diagnosis code of D5700, D5701, D5702, or D571. This case definition identified youths with SCA with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 92% compared with newborn screening records. For each year of eligibility, we restricted our analyses to youths with no other forms of health insurance (eg, private insurance) to maximize the completeness of claims available. Records of youths were eligible to contribute data across multiple, nonsequential years.

Outcome: Hydroxyurea Use

To identify filled prescriptions for hydroxyurea, a list of National Drug Codes was generated and verified using the RxNorm tool, which contains all medications available on the US market and is maintained by the National Library of Medicine. The number of days' worth of supply of hydroxyurea was obtained for each filled prescription. Hydroxyurea use was characterized as the count of the annual days' supply. Annual days' supply was capped at 365 days.

### An expert discussion on the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome nomenclature-identifying a road map to precision: a report of a National Kidney Foundation working group [^111J82hb]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

The term atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome has been in use since the mid-1970s. It was initially used to describe the familial or sporadic form of hemolytic uremic syndrome as opposed to the epidemic, typical form of the disease. Over time, the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome term has evolved into being used to refer to anything that is not Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome. The term describes a heterogeneous group of diseases of disparate causes, a circumstance that makes defining disease-specific natural history and/or targeted treatment approaches challenging. A working group of specialty-specific experts in the thrombotic microangiopathies was convened to review the validity of this broad term in an era of swiftly advancing science and targeted therapeutics. A Delphi approach was used to define and interrogate some of the key issues related to the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome nomenclature.

### Sickle cell disease [^113Tx4eQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sickle cell disease:

- **Definition**: SCD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia and end-organ damage.
- **Pathophysiology**: SCD is caused by a mutation in the sixth amino acid of the β-globin gene. Polymerization of abnormal hemoglobin leads to vascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia, which precipitate a cascade of pathologic events leading to vascular-endothelial dysfunction, functional nitric oxide deficiency, hypercoagulability, increased neutrophil adhesiveness, and platelet activation.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of SCD is estimated at 30 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: CNS injury is the most debilitating frequent complication of SCD and includes stroke, silent cerebral infarct, and cognitive impairment. SCD causes vasculopathy (pulmonary hypertension, priapism, and retinopathy) and progressive ischemic organ failure (renal failure, hyposplenism, liver damage, bone disease).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, the median age at death is 42 years for females and 38 years for males. HSCT is the only curative treatment, but is not feasible for the vast majority of patients suffering from the disease.

Table 2.
Prevalence of hyponatremia — summary of key studies in adults

A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands of nearly 3000 hospitalized patients with available sodium measurements over a 3-month period found that 30% had a recorded sodium level below 136 mmol/L during their admission. A larger Danish prospective study of more than 250 000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium of less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Larger retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, with reported rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L between 14.5% and 28.2%. An outlying US study of nearly 200 000 patients reported only 5.5% had hyponatremia; however, this study employed stricter criteria, requiring 2 sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission, which would not capture those with transient initial hyponatremia, only a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L. There are specific patient subgroups with a higher risk of moderate-profound hyponatremia — for example, following pituitary surgery, where a meta-analysis showed 5.6% cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. Large database studies may fail to account for factors that can influence the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies do seek to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, causes of pseudohyponatremia such as increased serum lipids or proteins, or erroneous results from hemolyzed or contaminated blood samples, are not specifically excluded.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in anemia and severe maternal morbidity [^114b7ZfT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our data support a strong correlation between antepartum anemia and SMM; antepartum anemia drives SMM more than nontransfusion SMM for every racial and ethnic group. Although the adjusted population attributable risk percentages demonstrated that antepartum anemia contributed to one fifth of SMM among Black, Hispanic, and multiracial patients, it also contributed to one sixth of SMM among Pacific Islander and American Indian–Alaska Native patients. Reducing antepartum anemia can potentially reduce SMM. Our data also show that antepartum anemia also contributed to about 8% of nontransfusion SMM. This suggests that blood transfusions are a particular driver of SMM and that nontransfusion SMM may be a sign of increased risk for maternal end-organ injury and morbidity.

Our study has several strengths. These data reflect a diverse cohort of patients receiving obstetric care at more than 200 hospitals throughout California. We excluded patients with hereditary anemias because they warrant separate screening and management. We also identified antepartum anemia, anemia present at birth on admission, by billing codes. Our cohort allowed us to specify outcomes for American Indian–Alaska Native and Pacific Islander patients, groups not typically well represented in studies, and to identify that SMM remains elevated for these groups after adjustments for social determinants of health and obstetric comorbidities. In addition, we were able to disaggregate outcomes between SMM and nontransfusion SMM to identify the effect of antepartum anemia on each.

Our study has several limitations, including risk of misclassification bias with the use of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to capture diagnosis and procedures. The possibility for measurement error remains if misclassification occurs. Although birth certificate data are informed by patient self-report during hospitalization, congruency among birth certificate data for Native Americans had a sensitivity of 54%. We were also unable to comment on the intersection of racial and ethnic disparities in anemia with index of concentrations at the extremes or social vulnerability index. Stratification of outcomes within the multiracial group was underpowered for additional analysis. Causality of antepartum anemia is also unknown because we did not have access to iron indices, hemoglobin values (anemia severity), and treatment. However, similar work analyzing antepartum anemia has demonstrated the reliability of the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.– In addition, data reinforce that mild anemia (9–10.9 g/dL) is a risk factor for blood transfusion.

Identification of the HHT and Control Populations

We identified persons aged 1–64 years in the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2019, and from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2019, in the MarketScan Medicaid Database with an HHT diagnosis using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9/10-CM) diagnosis codes (ICD-9-CM 448.0, ICD-10-CM I78.0). To establish the diagnosis of HHT, coding was required on at least 1 inpatient facility claim and/or 2 or more outpatient/provider claims spaced at least 30 days apart. Diagnostic claims (e.g. laboratory, diagnostic radiology) were not used to identify HHT to avoid identification of rule-out conditions.

Control persons aged 1–64 years without HHT were identified based on no coding for HHT during the period of health insurance enrollment. For the purpose of comparison with the HHT population, controls were frequency matched 10:1 to individuals with HHT by age (in 5-year categories), duration of health insurance enrollment (per completed year), insurance enrollment start year, sex, and Medicaid status.

Comorbidities were defined using the classification of Elixhauser et al.and the pediatric chronic conditions classification of Feudtner et al.including conditions coded at any time during the medical insurance enrollment dates. Comorbidities, which included various malignancies and anemia, were defined as above for HHT, requiring coding on at least 1 inpatient facility claim and/or 2 or more outpatient/provider nondiagnostic claims spaced at least 30 days apart. In addition, the mean number of clinic visits per year was determined per person using Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition codes 99201–99215, 99241–99245, 99381–99386, and 99391–99396 as a measure of overall health care utilization.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^111ZaHGk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron absorption and regulation: Body iron stores are regulated at the level of intestinal iron absorption, and hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide produced mainly in the liver, is considered the key regulator of iron stores by inhibiting iron absorption from the intestinal mucosal cells by degradation of ferroportin-1; primary iron overload disorders are defined as inherited conditions with either abnormally low levels of hepcidin or decreased binding of hepcidin to ferroportin (FPN1), whereas secondary iron overload may be considered as any condition of acquired hepcidin deficiency from disorders of erythropoiesis, increased red blood cell turnover, other chronic liver disease, or excess alcohol intake. Iron absorption occurs primarily in the second portion of the duodenum; heme iron is absorbed via mechanisms not yet fully understood, while non-heme iron absorption begins with the reduction of Fe3+ to +2 by duodenal cytochrome b and proceeds via divalent-metal transporter 1 located on the apical surface.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^1161wz8n]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A reduced erythrocyte mass can be the consequence of haemolytic anaemia, resulting from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Hereditary or acquired diseases can be the cause of intrinsic abnormalities in the structure and membrane of RBSs, such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, enzymatic disorders (glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] and pyruvate synthesis), sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia. Regarding extrinsic factors of anaemia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation represent mechanical processes with the destruction of RBCs. Furthermore, antibody‐mediated destruction of RBCs can also be considered an extrinsic disorder.

The morphology of anaemia is described by RBC size, shape and colour. Using this classification system, anaemias are classified as hypochromic microcytic anaemia (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] < 80 fL), macrocytic anaemia (MCV > 100 fL) and normocytic normochromic anaemia (MCV: 80–100 fL). Main causes of microcytic anaemia include IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, with impaired iron absorption due to tissue inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin < 30 or < 100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively. Inflammation through cytokine‐mediated mechanisms may trigger an increase in hepcidin and a decrease in circulating iron levels, but not ferritin, hence in the presence of biochemical and/or clinical evidence of inflammation, ACD should be diagnosed if serum ferritin levels are increased and transferrin saturation is decreased.

Finally, anaemia can also be classified according to the form of clinical presentation as acute (usually due to bleeding or haemolysis) or chronic.

### Global, regional, and national prevalence and mortality burden of sickle cell disease, 2000–2021: a systematic analysis from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^117QmBaU]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Previous global analyses, with known underdiagnosis and single cause per death attribution systems, provide only a small insight into the suspected high population health effect of sickle cell disease. Completed as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, this study delivers a comprehensive global assessment of prevalence of sickle cell disease and mortality burden by age and sex for 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2021.

Methods

We estimated cause-specific sickle cell disease mortality using standardised GBD approaches, in which each death is assigned to a single underlying cause, to estimate mortality rates from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded vital registration, surveillance, and verbal autopsy data. In parallel, our goal was to estimate a more accurate account of sickle cell disease health burden using four types of epidemiological data on sickle cell disease: birth incidence, age-specific prevalence, with-condition mortality (total deaths), and excess mortality (excess deaths). Systematic reviews, supplemented with ICD-coded hospital discharge and insurance claims data, informed this modelling approach. We employed DisMod-MR 2.1 to triangulate between these measures-borrowing strength from predictive covariates and across age, time, and geography-and generated internally consistent estimates of incidence, prevalence, and mortality for three distinct genotypes of sickle cell disease: homozygous sickle cell disease and severe sickle cell β-thalassaemia, sickle-haemoglobin C disease, and mild sickle cell β-thalassaemia. Summing the three models yielded final estimates of incidence at birth, prevalence by age and sex, and total sickle cell disease mortality, the latter of which was compared directly against cause-specific mortality estimates to evaluate differences in mortality burden assessment and implications for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Findings

Between 2000 and 2021, national incidence rates of sickle cell disease were relatively stable, but total births of babies with sickle cell disease increased globally by 13.7% (95% uncertainty interval 11.1–16.5), to 515000 (425000–614000), primarily due to population growth in the Caribbean and western and central sub-Saharan Africa. The number of people living with sickle cell disease globally increased by 41.4% (38.3–44.9), from 5.46 million (4.62–6.45) in 2000 to 7.74 million (6.51–9.2) in 2021. We estimated 34400 (25000–45200) cause-specific all-age deaths globally in 2021, but total sickle cell disease mortality burden was nearly 11-times higher at 376000 (303000–467000). In children younger than 5 years, there were 81100 (58800–108000) deaths, ranking total sickle cell disease mortality as 12th (compared to 40th for cause-specific sickle cell disease mortality) across all causes estimated by the GBD in 2021.

Interpretation

Our findings show a strikingly high contribution of sickle cell disease to all-cause mortality that is not apparent when each death is assigned to only a single cause. Sickle cell disease mortality burden is highest in children, especially in countries with the greatest under-5 mortality rates. Without comprehensive strategies to address morbidity and mortality associated with sickle cell disease, attainment of SDG 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 is uncertain. Widespread data gaps and correspondingly high uncertainty in the estimates highlight the urgent need for routine and sustained surveillance efforts, further research to assess the contribution of conditions associated with sickle cell disease, and widespread deployment of evidence-based prevention and treatment for those with sickle cell disease.
