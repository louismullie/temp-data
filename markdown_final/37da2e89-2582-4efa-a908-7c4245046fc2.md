## Question

Evidence for dopamine in critically ill patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for dopamine in critically ill patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical rationale and dose-dependent pharmacology of dopamine. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence for renal protection and for vasopressor use. Next, I will review meta-analyses and observational data, followed by guideline positions. After that, I need to examine adverse effects and mechanistic concerns. Finally, I will consider special populations and practical recommendations, and close with a balanced conclusion and caveats about availability and context.

> Let me first confirm the historical rationale and pharmacology. Dopamine has long been used for its dose-dependent receptor effects: low-dose dopaminergic effects were thought to improve renal blood flow, intermediate beta-1 effects augment contractility, and higher alpha-1 effects raise blood pressure; this led to the concept of "renal-dose dopamine" for AKI prevention and to its use as a vasopressor alternative in shock, but I should verify whether these physiologic effects translated into clinical benefit [^112iUQLd] [^117MNTeg].

> Now, I will examine the renal protection question with the highest-quality evidence. The ANZICS multicenter, double-blind RCT in 324 critically ill patients at risk of renal failure found that low-dose dopamine at 2 mcg/kg/min was not superior to placebo for peak creatinine, need for RRT, or mortality, effectively refuting renal protection claims; I should double-check that this was indeed a blinded, placebo-controlled trial with adequate power, which it was [^114WQdDi] [^117R9o76].

> Next, I should review the vasopressor evidence. The SOAP-II randomized trial in 1,679 patients with shock found no mortality difference overall between dopamine and norepinephrine, but dopamine caused significantly more arrhythmias and, critically, increased mortality in the cardiogenic shock subgroup; wait, let me verify the subgroup signal and the arrhythmia rate, which were 24.1% vs 12.4% for arrhythmias and a prespecified cardiogenic shock harm signal, respectively [^111TQtBn] [^116Y4EwT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm consistency across syntheses. Multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews show no mortality benefit for dopamine versus norepinephrine, with a consistent increase in arrhythmias; some analyses suggest higher mortality with dopamine in septic shock, and Cochrane reviews echo the arrhythmia signal while noting imprecision in mortality differences, reinforcing caution about dopamine as a first-line vasopressor [^112Gjt9Y] [^116eY4La] [^112e8Jbk].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure alignment. Contemporary Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines strongly recommend norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor and advise against low-dose dopamine for renal protection; they allow dopamine only as an alternative when norepinephrine is unavailable, with explicit attention to arrhythmia risk, which I should emphasize given its clinical relevance [^117ToTuH] [^112nKF8Z] [^113ETdXN].

> Let me consider adverse effects and mechanistic concerns beyond arrhythmias. Dopamine has been associated with endocrine suppression, including blunting of prolactin and thyroid axes, potential worsening of splanchnic perfusion and gastric motility, and immunomodulatory effects that could be detrimental in sepsis; I should confirm that these effects are described in peer-reviewed sources, which they are, albeit with variable clinical impact across studies [^115MJbq4] [^113AojkX] [^117TfAxD].

> But wait, what about real-world practice and dose-response signals. Large observational cohorts from Japan show that dopamine remained widely used, often at low doses, and higher doses were associated with dose-dependent increases in mortality and longer ICU stays even after adjustment; I should double-check that these associations persisted in matched analyses, which they did, strengthening the concern about routine dopamine use outside of exceptional circumstances [^115LsDS3] [^116JY3DV] [^1129z7NN].

> I will now examine special populations. In pediatrics, contemporary guidance favors epinephrine or norepinephrine over dopamine for septic shock, with dopamine reserved only if first-line agents are unavailable; in neonates, evidence is evolving and physiology-guided strategies are being explored, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize adult data to neonates, but the trend is away from dopamine as default therapy in many contexts [^111PFv97] [^11471o6c] [^111LHnKW].

> Let me reconsider the practical implications. If norepinephrine is unavailable, epinephrine or dopamine may be used as alternatives, but clinicians should anticipate higher arrhythmia risk with dopamine and monitor closely; I should confirm that guidelines explicitly allow this contingency, which they do, while emphasizing rapid access to preferred agents and vigilant ECG monitoring when dopamine is used out of necessity [^112nKF8Z] [^116vggqb].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the totality of evidence. High-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show no renal protection with low-dose dopamine and no mortality advantage as a vasopressor versus norepinephrine, with a consistent and clinically important increase in arrhythmias and a signal for harm in cardiogenic shock; therefore, dopamine should generally be avoided for renal protection and is not preferred for vasopressor support when norepinephrine is available, aligning with modern guidelines and safety considerations [^114WQdDi] [^111TQtBn] [^117ToTuH].

---

Dopamine is **not recommended as first-line vasopressor** in critically ill patients because it increases arrhythmias and mortality compared to norepinephrine [^111TQtBn] [^112Gjt9Y]. Low-dose "renal-dose" dopamine does not prevent or treat AKI and should be avoided [^114WQdDi] [^112rkSYc]. Current guidelines favor norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor; use dopamine only when norepinephrine is unavailable, with close monitoring for arrhythmias [^117ToTuH] [^112nKF8Z].

---

## Clinical indications and dosing

Dopamine is indicated for hemodynamic support in shock, but **norepinephrine is preferred** as first-line vasopressor in septic shock [^117ToTuH]. Dopamine is considered only when norepinephrine is unavailable or contraindicated [^112nKF8Z]. Dosing is **dose-dependent**: low doses (≤ 5 µg/kg/min) primarily produce dopaminergic effects (vasodilation, increased renal blood flow), moderate doses (5–10 µg/kg/min) add beta-1 effects (inotropy, chronotropy), and high doses (≥ 10 µg/kg/min) produce alpha-1 vasoconstriction [^115VofnM].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

### Septic shock

- **SOAP-II trial**: No mortality difference between dopamine and norepinephrine overall, but dopamine caused more arrhythmias and increased mortality in cardiogenic shock [^116Y4EwT].
- **Meta-analyses**: Dopamine is associated with higher mortality and more arrhythmias than norepinephrine in septic shock [^112Gjt9Y].
- **Guidelines**: Strong recommendation for norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor; dopamine only if norepinephrine is unavailable [^112nKF8Z].

---

### Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Low-dose "renal-dose" dopamine does not prevent or treat AKI and is **not recommended** [^117ND2nJ]. Meta-analyses show **no benefit** in renal outcomes or mortality with low-dose dopamine [^112rkSYc].

---

### Cardiogenic shock

In cardiogenic shock, the **SOAP-II subgroup** found higher mortality with dopamine than norepinephrine [^116Y4EwT]. Given this, **norepinephrine is preferred** over dopamine in cardiogenic shock [^116Yqz7e].

---

## Adverse effects and safety profile

Dopamine has a **higher risk of tachyarrhythmias** than norepinephrine [^111TQtBn]. It can cause tissue ischemia and necrosis if extravasation occurs [^notfound]. Dopamine also suppresses pituitary hormones, which may worsen catabolism and immune dysfunction [^115MJbq4].

---

## Comparison with other vasopressors

| **Vasopressor** | **Mortality benefit** | **Arrhythmia risk** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Norepinephrine | Lower mortality vs dopamine | Lower arrhythmia risk | First-line vasopressor [^117ToTuH] |
| Epinephrine | Similar mortality to norepinephrine | Higher arrhythmia risk | Second-line or alternative [^112nKF8Z] |
| Vasopressin | No mortality benefit | Lower arrhythmia risk | Adjunct to norepinephrine [^111AYW9B] [^112nKF8Z] |
| Dopamine | Higher mortality in cardiogenic shock | Higher arrhythmia risk | Use only if norepinephrine unavailable [^112nKF8Z] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **First-line vasopressor**: Norepinephrine is recommended for septic shock [^117ToTuH].
- **Second-line agents**: Epinephrine or vasopressin if norepinephrine is inadequate [^112nKF8Z].
- **Dopamine**: Use only if norepinephrine is unavailable, with close monitoring for arrhythmias [^116vggqb].

---

## Special populations

In pediatrics, **epinephrine or norepinephrine is preferred**; dopamine is an alternative if these are unavailable [^11471o6c]. In neonates, dopamine remains **widely used**, but evidence is limited and alternatives should be considered [^117PSpjb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dopamine is **not recommended as first-line vasopressor** in critically ill patients due to higher arrhythmia risk and worse outcomes in cardiogenic shock compared with norepinephrine [^111TQtBn]. Low-dose dopamine does not confer renal protection and should be avoided [^114WQdDi]. Use dopamine only when norepinephrine is unavailable, with close monitoring for arrhythmias and adverse effects [^112nKF8Z].

### Is there still a place for dopamine in the modern intensive care unit? [^115MJbq4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

For many years, dopamine was considered an essential drug in the intensive care unit (ICU) for its cardiovascular effects and, even more, for its supposedly protective effects on renal function and splanchnic mucosal perfusion. There is now ample scientific evidence that low dose dopamine is ineffective for prevention and treatment of acute renal failure and for protection of the gut. Until recently, low-dose dopamine was considered to be relatively free of side effects. However, it is now clear that low-dose dopamine, besides not achieving the preset goal of organ protection, may also be deleterious because it can induce renal failure in normo- and hypovolemic patients. Furthermore, dopamine may cause harm by impairing mucosal blood flow and by aggravating reduced gastric motility. Dopamine also suppresses the secretion and function of anterior pituitary hormones, thereby aggravating catabolism and cellular immune dysfunction and inducing central hypothyroidism. In addition, dopamine blunts the ventilatory drive, increasing the risk of respiratory failure in patients who are being weaned from mechanical ventilation. We conclude that there is no longer a place for low-dose dopamine in the ICU and that, in view of its side effects, its extended use as a vasopressor may also be questioned.

### Bad medicine: low-dose dopamine in the ICU [^113AojkX]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Low-dose dopamine administration (ie, doses < 5 microg/kg/min) has been advocated for 30 years as therapy in oliguric patients on the basis of its action on dopaminergic renal receptors. Recently, a large, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial has demonstrated that low-dose dopamine administered to critically ill patients who are at risk of renal failure does not confer clinically significant protection from renal dysfunction. In this review, we present the best evidence and summarize the effects of low-dose dopamine infusion in critically ill patients. We review the history and physiology of low-dose dopamine administration and discuss the reasons why dopamine is not clinically effective in the critically ill. In addition to the lack of renal efficacy, we present evidence that low-dose dopamine administration worsens splanchnic oxygenation, impairs GI function, impairs the endocrine and immunologic systems, and blunts ventilatory drive. We conclude that there is no justification for the use of low-dose dopamine administration in the critically ill.

### Low-dose dopamine in the intensive care unit [^11361j2D]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

For much of the last four decades, low-dose dopamine has been considered the drug of choice to treat and prevent renal failure in the intensive care unit (ICU). The multifactorial etiology of renal failure in the ICU and the presence of coexisting multisystem organ dysfunction make the design and execution of clinical trials to study this problem difficult. However, in the last decade, several meta-analyses and one large randomized trial have all shown a lack of benefit of low-dose dopamine in improving renal function. There are multiple reasons for this lack of efficacy. While dopamine does cause a diuretic effect, it does very little to improve mortality, creatinine clearance, or the incidence of dialysis. Evidence is also growing of its adverse effects on the immune, endocrine, and respiratory systems. It may also potentially increase mortality in sepsis. It is the opinion of the authors that the practice of using low-dose dopamine should be abandoned. Other drugs and treatment modalities need to be explored to address the serious issue of renal failure in the ICU.

### Dopexamine, dobutamine, and dopamine increase splanchnic blood flow: what is the evidence? [^115x9wmm]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Inadequate splanchnic perfusion in the critically ill compromises the gut barrier leading to bacterial translocation, which is postulated to cause multiorgan dysfunction and failure. Inotropic agents such as dopexamine, dobutamine, and dopamine may have a role in increasing splanchnic perfusion, thereby protecting this area from further injury. This article examines the evidence for using these agents in patients with sepsis, postoperative trauma, and in those undergoing cardiac surgery and mechanical ventilation to increase gut perfusion and prevent multiple organ failure. Systemic effects of these agents differ from regional effects and must be considered when selecting therapy.

The study Low-dose dopamine in early renal dysfunction was published by R Bellomo and colleagues in 2000 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute kidney injury. In the Low-dose dopamine in early renal dysfunction study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose dopamine in critically ill patients at risk of renal failure? In the Low-dose dopamine in early renal dysfunction study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Low-dose dopamine in early renal dysfunction study, the population was: 324 patients (128 female, 196 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients at risk of renal failure. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; an episode of acute renal failure within the previous 3 months; previous renal transplantation; use of dopamine at any dose during the current hospital stay; and unsuitability for use of RRT. In the Low-dose dopamine in early renal dysfunction study, the interventions were: n = 161 low-dose dopamine (2 mcg/kg/min through central venous catheter while in the ICU) n = 163 placebo (matching placebo through central venous catheter while in the ICU). In the Low-dose dopamine in early renal dysfunction study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in peak serum creatinine concentration (245 vs. 249; difference 4, 95% CI -28 to 36). In the Low-dose dopamine in early renal dysfunction study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in requirement of RRT (35 vs. 40; difference 5, 95% CI -10 to 20). In the Low-dose dopamine in early renal dysfunction study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients at risk of renal failure, low-dose dopamine was not superior to placebo with respect to peak serum creatinine concentration.

KDOQI commentary — vasopressor selection and dopamine safety in shock with risk of acute kidney injury (AKI): The Work Group notes that "fluid resuscitation is typically insufficient to fully restore blood pressure to normal levels, which is critical for the prevention and management of AKI", and that "whether one vasopressor is more effective for patients with or at risk of AKI is unknown". Regarding dopamine, in a large trial "the use of dopamine was associated with more adverse events in those with sepsis and with an increased risk of death in those with cardiogenic shock", and in a meta-analysis "dopamine was associated with an increased risk of death and arrhythmias", leading to the conclusion that "Thus, we believe that dopamine should be used with caution as the first-line agent of choice in patients with shock at present".

The study SOAP II was published by De Backer D and colleagues in 2010 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the SOAP II study, the trial question was: what is the role of dopamine as first-line vasopressor agent in patients with shock? In the SOAP II study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SOAP II study, the population was: 1679 patients (723 female, 956 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with shock. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; already received a vasopressor agent (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, or phenylephrine) for > 4 hours during the current episode of shock; serious arrhythmia, such as rapid AF (> 160 beats/min) or VT; or declared brain-dead. In the SOAP II study, the interventions were: n = 858 dopamine (dose determined according to the patient's body weight, could be increased or decreased by 2 mcg/kg/min) n = 821 norepinephrine (dose determined according to the patient's body weight, could be increased or decreased by 0.02 mcg/kg/min). In the SOAP II study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 28 days (52.5% vs. 48.5%; OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.42). In the SOAP II study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in required open-label norepinephrine therapy (26% vs. 20%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.07) Significant increase in open-label vasopressors not needed (12.6 vs. 14.2; MD 1.6, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.76). In the SOAP II study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in arrhythmic events (24.1% vs. 12.4%, p < 0.001). In the SOAP II study, the conclusion was: in patients with shock, dopamine was not superior to norepinephrine with respect to death at 28 days.

Shock management — vasopressor selection: With regard to vasopressor support in patients with shock, dopamine is associated with an increased rate of complications in patients with septic and cardiogenic shock compared to norepinephrine, and norepinephrine should be used as a first-line agent over dopamine unless there are specific contraindications to the use of norepinephrine.

### Does dopamine administration in shock influence outcome? Results of the sepsis occurrence in acutely ill patients (SOAP) study [^1153BLA6]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The optimal adrenergic support in shock is controversial. We investigated whether dopamine administration influences the outcome from shock.

Design

Cohort, multiple-center, observational study.

Setting

One hundred and ninety-eight European intensive care units.

Patients

All adult patients admitted to a participating intensive care unit between May 1 and May 15, 2002.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients were followed up until death, until hospital discharge, or for 60 days. Shock was defined as hemodynamic compromise necessitating the administration of vasopressor catecholamines. Of 3,147 patients, 1,058 (33.6%) had shock at any time; 462 (14.7%) had septic shock. The intensive care unit mortality rate for shock was 38.3% and 47.4% for septic shock. Of patients in shock, 375 (35.4%) received dopamine (dopamine group) and 683 (64.6%) never received dopamine. Age, gender, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were comparable between the two groups. The dopamine group had higher intensive care unit (42.9% vs. 35.7%, p = .02) and hospital (49.9% vs. 41.7%, p = .01) mortality rates. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed diminished 30 day-survival in the dopamine group (log rank = 4.6, p = .032). In a multivariate analysis with intensive care unit outcome as the dependent factor, age, cancer, medical admissions, higher mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, higher mean fluid balance, and dopamine administration were independent risk factors for intensive care unit mortality in patients with shock.

Conclusions

This observational study suggests that dopamine administration may be associated with increased mortality rates in shock. There is a need for a prospective study comparing dopamine with other catecholamines in the management of circulatory shock.

Question 3: What Is the Optimal Approach to Selection, Dose Titration, and Escalation of Vasopressor Therapy?

What is known.

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is determined, in part, by signaling through pharmacologically distinct families of receptors. Vasopressor agents are currently available that work by altering signaling via catecholamines, vasopressin receptors, and the renin/angiotensin system.

Norepinephrine is recommended as a first-line vasopressor agent for the treatment of septic shock. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials reported that norepinephrine use resulted in lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and decreased risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) compared with dopamine. Survey studies of intensivists reflect preferences for norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor agent, reflecting clinician agreement with guideline recommendations.

In studies of vasopressin as both an adjunctive treatment and as a first-line therapy, results have been mixed. Although vasopressin did not alter mortality when added to norepinephrine, in a finding contrary to an a priori hypothesis, a subset demonstrated a potential and unexpected survival benefit in patients with less severe septic shock (norepinephrine < 15 µg/min). However, a subsequent study failed to confirm any survival benefit with vasopressin therapy although a reduced need for renal replacement therapy compared with norepinephrine was noted. A consistent norepinephrine-sparing effect has been observed with vasopressin in doses of 0.01–0.03 U/min, leading to its recommendation as an adjunctive therapy.

More recently, angiotensin II was compared with placebo in a randomized controlled trial of 321 patients with vasodilatory shock requiring greater than 0.2 µg/kg/min of norepinephrine. Angiotensin II was effective in achieving the primary endpoint for the study by increasing the MAP by greater than 10 mm Hg or pressure greater than 75 mm Hg. However, no difference was observed in the secondary endpoint of survival. A subsequent subgroup analysis of this trial demonstrated improved survival in 105 patients requiring renal replacement therapy at the time of randomization to angiotensin II, although this finding needs to be further investigated in a prospective, randomized trial.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^115FTBqq]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Vasoactive agents — rationale and supporting evidence note that "Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine as a vasoconstrictor", and a "systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 RCTs" found "a lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and lower risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) compared with dopamine". A "randomized blinded study comparing epinephrine with norepinephrine in patients with shock showed no difference in 90-day mortality (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.63–1.25) and vasopressor-free days". Regarding vasopressin, levels "decrease to normal range in most patients between 24 and 48 hours" and it "is usually administered at a fixed dose of 0.03 units/min" with "up to 0.06 units/min" used in clinical trials; in VANISH, "There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in 28-day mortality".

### Clinical review: immunomodulatory effects of dopamine in general inflammation [^117TfAxD]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Large quantitaties of inflammatory mediators are released during the course of endotoxaemia. These mediators in turn can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to release catecholamines, which ultimately regulate inflammation-associated impairment in tissue perfusion, myocardial impairment and vasodilatation. Treatment of sepsis is based on surgical and/or antibiotic therapy, appropriate fluid management and application of vasoactive catecholamines. With respect to the latter, discussions on the vasopressor of choice are still ongoing. Over the past decade dopamine has been considered the 'first line' vasopressor and is frequently used to improve organ perfusion and blood pressure. However, there is a growing body of evidence that dopamine has deleterious side effects; therefore, its clinical relevance seems to be more and more questionable. Nevertheless, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that other catecholamines are superior to dopamine in this respect. Apart from its haemodynamic action, dopamine can modulate immune responses by influencing the cytokine network. This leads to inhibition of expression of adhesion molecules, inhibition of cytokine and chemokine production, inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis and disturbed T-cell proliferation. In the present review we summarize our knowledge of the immunomodulatory effects of dopamine, with an emphasis on the mechanisms by which these effects are mediated.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^112e8Jbk]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In multiple systematic reviews of vasopressors for shock, norepinephrine has been associated with a possible reduction in adverse events but no difference in mortality compared with other vasopressors. – However, where availability of norepinephrine is limited, alternate vasopressors may be chosen with no adverse effects on mortality. In a systematic review of vasopressor use in shock, norepinephrine did not result in a significant mortality improvement compared with vasopressin (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.91–1.26) or epinephrine (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.77–1.21). In addition, there was no difference in mortality between norepinephrine and phenylephrine (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.64–1.32), although a separate meta-analysis indicated imprecise estimates on mortality when phenylephrine was compared with other vasopressors. However, an observational study during the 2011 norepinephrine shortage in the United States found phenylephrine to have been the most commonly used substitute, and alternative vasopressor use other than norepinephrine was associated with a higher risk of death (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01–1.30, P = 0.03). The Surviving Sepsis guidelines have suggested limiting the use of phenylephrine until further research is conducted.

Regarding the use of dopamine, two systematic reviews compared dopamine with norepinephrine in the management of septic shock. In a systematic review of 11 randomized controlled trials (n = 1,710) comparing norepinephrine with dopamine, norepinephrine use was associated with a lower mortality (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81–0.98) and a lower risk of arrhythmia (RR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.40–0.58). However, a Cochrane systemic review of six randomized trials (n = 1,400) found no significant difference in all-cause mortality between norepinephrine and dopamine, but did confirm a higher risk of arrhythmia with dopamine use (RR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.46–3.78).

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^116zhHFH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

What is the best management of patients with abdominal sepsis?

Statement 43

Early identification of sepsis and prompt administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are always mandatory. Restoring a mean systemic arterial pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg is a good initial goal during the hemodynamic support of patients with sepsis (Recommendation 1 A).

The definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) has returned to the traditional views that sepsis is characterized by organ dysfunction attributed to an infection. Patients with at least two of three clinical abnormalities including Glasgow coma score of 14 or less, systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or less, and respiratory rate 22/min or greater may have poor outcome typical of sepsis. Importantly, qSOFA does not define sepsis but provides simple bedside criteria to screen adult patients with suspected infection. Sepsis is now defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It can be clinically represented by an increase in the SOFA score of 2 points or more. Norepinephrine is now the first-line vasopressor agent which is used to correct hypotension in the event of septic shock. It is more efficacious than dopamine and is more effective for reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities who are associated with higher risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requirement for vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater and serum lactate level less than 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. Under this terminology, "severe sepsis" becomes superfluous. Sepsis should generally warrant greater levels of monitoring and interventions.

### The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic review of randomised trials as a guide for future research [^113FXjer]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Amongst patients with sepsis the most severely affected will be in septic shock, defined as a requirement for vasopressor therapy and a raised serum lactate. The mortality rate in this patient population is in the region of 35–40%. Although incompletely understood in terms of mechanism, patients with septic shock are at high risk for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). This syndrome accounts for almost half of all cases of AKI seen in the critically ill, and results in a further increase in mortality of up to 70%. Understanding specific risk factors for AKI, as well as possible preventative measures, is therefore of vital importance in the management of critically ill septic patients.

Vasopressors are the mainstay of vasodilatory shock management. In addition to classically used catecholamines, non-adrenergic vasopressors are commercially available that target either the vasopressin pathway or renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends intravenous crystalloid resuscitation as well as norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets. Where norepinephrine alone is insufficient, it is suggested that vasopressin be added as a second agent. However, the SSC describe the evidence underpinning these recommendations as high quality only when first line norepinephrine is compared to dopamine. When compared to other catecholamines and non-adrenergic vasopressors the evidence is of moderate, low or very low quality. In addition, the evidence underpinning the recommendation of vasopressin, where a second agent is required, is of moderate quality. This paucity of good quality evidence perhaps contributes to the apparent variation in standards of care relating to vasopressors. In addition, these guidelines do not fully consider cost, which can be important.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^112Epz3c]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — vasopressor evidence in adults: Norepinephrine is an alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic receptor agonist with more potent vasoconstrictor effects than dopamine, resulting in increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) without a significant effect on heart rate, and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a 2000 systematic review showed a lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and risk of arrhythmia (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) with use of norepinephrine compared with dopamine.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^113VQxSn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Search strategy and MeSH terms.

Searches were performed in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science using a combination of the following MeSH and free-text terms through August 15, 2020: "COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR Sars-CoV-2 AND shock AND vasopressors", "COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR Sars-CoV-2 AND norepinephrine OR dopamine OR vasopressin OR epinephrine", and "Septic shock AND vasopressors" "Septic shock AND low-income".

This search yielded 3,007 studies; 268 were clinical trials and/or randomized clinical trials; 73 were meta-analyses, reviews, and/or systematic reviews; and 187 were from LMICs.

Evidence.

The proportion of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring vasopressor support remains incompletely characterized. In a case series of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, shock was observed in 9% and 31% of 138 hospitalized and 36 ICU patients, respectively. In a retrospective case series at two New York City hospitals, vasopressors were used in 32% of all patients with COVID-19 and 95% of the 130 patients on mechanical ventilation. In two additional case series of 21 and 24 adult COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs in the United States, vasopressors were initiated in 67% and 71% of patients, respectively.

There is little evidence to guide optimal vasopressor selection in patients with COVID-19. To generate these recommendations, evidence was extracted from studies in HICs and in critically ill patients with non–SARS-CoV-2–related shock in LMICs.

### Physiology-guided vasoactive therapy in neonates: rethinking dopamine as first-line [^111LHnKW]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dopamine has been widely used as a first-line cardiovascular agent in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for the management of hypotension and circulatory support. While its effectiveness in increasing blood pressure is established, its potential effects on pulmonary vascular resistance, myocardial function, and overall hemodynamics require further consideration. This review explores the role of dopamine in neonatal hemodynamic management and considers alternative vasoactive agents tailored to specific pathophysiological conditions. A more individualized, physiology-based approach to cardiovascular support in neonates may help optimize treatment strategies.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Dopamine use and its consequences in the intensive care unit: a cohort study utilizing the Japanese intensive care PAtient database [^115LsDS3]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Since Goldberg et al. reported that administration of dopamine to patients with end-stage congestive heart failure resulted in increased cardiac output and sodium diuresis, dopamine has been used to treat patients with shock. It was thought that treatment with dopamine would benefit patients at risk of developing acute renal failure due to its vasodilatory effects when used at a low dose. Subsequent studies, however, refuted the beneficial effects of dopamine on patient-centered outcomes in the contexts of renal protection by 2000 and as a vasopressor by 2012. It is now generally accepted that dopamine causes more harm than benefits and is not recommended for patients with at least septic shock based on the findings that dopamine is associated with an increased risk of tachyarrhythmias and possibly increased mortality compared to noradrenaline.

Since 2012, following an epoch-making SOAP II study in 2010 and a subsequent meta-analysis, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines continued to recommend noradrenaline as the drug of choice and recommend dopamine "only in highly selected patients (e.g. patients with a low risk of tachyarrhythmias) and most recently in 2021, "in settings where norepinephrine is not available". The guidelines 2012 and 2016 clearly state that they "recommend against using low-dose dopamine for renal protection". In a recently published article describing online survey results from 839 members of The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine in 82 countries in 2019, the authors reported that only 2% of survey responders chose dopamine as the first choice for the treatment of patients with septic shock. Despite the accumulated evidence, dopamine is still used in some countries including Japan in 2000's. In a study conducted to evaluate the role of polymyxin B hemoperfusion in Japanese patients with abdominal septic shock between 2007 and 2011, dopamine was given to more than 80% of patients. In a national survey conducted in China in 2012, dopamine was found to be the most preferred drug for hypovolemic shock (73.4%) and cardiogenic shock (67.1%) by the physicians. While these data suggest the continued use of dopamine, the actual patient data associated with dopamine use, e.g. type of shock, dose, in recent years are lacking.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^1141pPMi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

In surgical patients early intervention and implementation of evidence-based guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock improve outcomes in patients with sepsis.

Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may present with inadequate perfusion. Poor tissue perfusion can lead to global tissue hypoxia and, in turn, to elevated levels of serum lactate. Fluid resuscitation should be initiated as early as possible in patients with severe sepsis.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend that fluid challenge in patients with suspected hypovolemia begin with > 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300–500 mL of colloids administered over a period of 30 minutes. Quicker administration and greater volumes of fluid may be required for patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion. Given that the volume of distribution is smaller for colloids than it is for crystalloids, colloid-mediated resuscitation requires less fluid to achieve the same results. A colloid equivalent is an acceptable alternative to crystalloid, though it should be noted that crystalloids are typically less expensive.

When fluid challenge fails to restore adequate arterial pressure and organ perfusion, clinicians should resort to vasopressor agents. Vasopressor drugs maintain adequate blood pressure and preserve perfusion pressure, thereby optimizing blood flow in various organs.

Both norepinephrine and dopamine are the first-line vasopressor agents to correct hypotension in septic shock. Both norepinephrine and dopamine can increase blood pressure in shock states, although norepinephrine seems to be more powerful. Dopamine may be useful in patients with compromised cardiac function and cardiac reserve, but norepinephrine is more effective than dopamine in reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine has also potentially detrimental effects on the release of pituitary hormones and especially prolactin, although the clinical relevance of these effects is still unclear and can have unintended effects such as tachyarrhythmias. Dopamine has different effects based on the doses.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^112SPgM7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Patients at increased risk for AKI and particularly those with manifest AKI require careful monitoring of their haemodynamic status, in order to balance the risk of renal hypoperfusion on the one hand and fluid overload on the other. Cardiac output and blood pressure should be kept within optimal limits to ensure the best possible kidney perfusion. However, as recently reported, hazardous fluid overload must be avoided, particularly in anuric patients with AKI. Available therapies to manage hypotension should integrate fluid and vasopressor therapy in protocols with appropriate haemodynamic goals. When volume resuscitation is deemed necessary, there is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation that there is no additional advantage of (more expensive) colloid over crystalloid solutions; therefore ERBP upgraded the strength of this recommendation. However, ERBP wants to stress that this rule does not apply in patients in whom a decrease in the circulating volume is present, e.g. in haemorrhagic shock. In these conditions, the use of colloids can be warranted; iso-osmolar solutions, with low molecular branching coefficients should be preferred. ERBP also wants to point out that the use of large quantities of isotonic saline can potentially lead to metabolic acidosis.

As renal perfusion pressure is more important than renal blood flow per se, and as the action of vasopressors is immediate and directly reversible, ERBP recommends using vasopressor therapy rather than extra fluid in volume-resuscitated patients. Here, norepinephrine has advantages over dopamine, because of fewer side-effects and lower costs, but vasopressin may be used as an alternative. Several meta-analyses have pointed out that dopamine failed to improve outcomes in patients with AKI. Finally, protocol-based goal-directed therapy is advocated in the early hours of sepsis. Such goal-directed therapy includes avoiding hypotension, optimizing oxygen delivery and careful fluid and vasopressor management when indicated. Some clinical studies have highlighted the need to keep mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg in critically ill patients, but the speed of intervention seems to be very important as well.

### Dopamine use and its consequences in the intensive care unit: a cohort study utilizing the Japanese intensive care PAtient database [^112iUA4X]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

As stated in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2016, the literature on the treatment of shock after 2010 — when the landmark Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) II trial was published — does not support dopamine use in treating patients with shock in general. Despite this fact, dopamine use is still found in the literature in relatively recent years after 2010. In a nationwide survey among intensive care physicians in China in 2012, as many as 68% of the responders chose dopamine as the agent of choice for the treatment of patients with cardiogenic shock and 73% for hypovolemic shock. It was found that dopamine was the most commonly used (63%) vasopressor to treat patients with traumatic shock and the second most common (28%) drug for the treatment of patients with septic shock in the Thai-shock survey 2013. Considering practice patterns in Japan, there is very limited literature on dopamine use and preliminary data were available only as incidental findings. In a retrospective study that assessed the role of postoperative polymyxin B administration in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery during 2007–2011, dopamine was used in more than 80% of patients — much higher than noradrenaline (53%) or dobutamine (10%). The other group from Japan reported in 2014 that dopamine was the most prevalently (80%) used catecholamine for patients already treated with noradrenaline in their cohort of refractory septic shock. The results of the present study show that dopamine is commonly used in JIPAD participating facilities as of 2018–2019. As many as 14 out of 56 facilities used dopamine for more than 50% of patients and two of them used dopamine for > 90% of patients, suggesting a low threshold for dopamine use in some facilities. While the situation in Japan might not be applicable in other countries, these results suggest that the deleterious effects of dopamine may be underrecognized in certain situations.

### Vasopressor and inotropic support in septic shock: an evidence-based review [^113ETdXN]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for vasopressor and inotropic support in septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and to improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

An arterial catheter should be placed as soon as possible in patients with septic shock. Vasopressors are indicated to maintain mean arterial pressure of < 65 mm Hg, both during and following adequate fluid resuscitation. Norepinephrine or dopamine are the vasopressors of choice in the treatment of septic shock. Norepinephrine may be combined with dobutamine when cardiac output is being measured. Epinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin are not recommended as first-line agents in the treatment of septic shock. Vasopressin may be considered for salvage therapy. Low-dose dopamine is not recommended for the purpose of renal protection. Dobutamine is recommended as the agent of choice to increase cardiac output but should not be used for the purpose of increasing cardiac output above physiologic levels.

### Prevention of acute kidney injury and protection of renal function in the intensive care unit: update 2017: expert opinion of the working group on prevention, AKI section, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^117ND2nJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit is associated with significant mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine and update previous recommendations for the prevention of AKI, specifically the role of fluids, diuretics, inotropes, vasopressors/vasodilators, hormonal and nutritional interventions, sedatives, statins, remote ischaemic preconditioning and care bundles.

Method

A systematic search of the literature was performed for studies published between 1966 and March 2017 using these potential protective strategies in adult patients at risk of AKI. The following clinical conditions were considered: major surgery, critical illness, sepsis, shock, exposure to potentially nephrotoxic drugs and radiocontrast. Clinical endpoints included incidence or grade of AKI, the need for renal replacement therapy and mortality. Studies were graded according to the international GRADE system.

Results

We formulated 12 recommendations, 13 suggestions and seven best practice statements. The few strong recommendations with high-level evidence are mostly against the intervention in question (starches, low-dose dopamine, statins in cardiac surgery). Strong recommendations with lower-level evidence include controlled fluid resuscitation with crystalloids, avoiding fluid overload, titration of norepinephrine to a target MAP of 65–70 mmHg (unless chronic hypertension) and not using diuretics or levosimendan for kidney protection solely.

Conclusion

The results of recent randomised controlled trials have allowed the formulation of new recommendations and/or increase the strength of previous recommendations. On the other hand, in many domains the available evidence remains insufficient, resulting from the limited quality of the clinical trials and the poor reporting of kidney outcomes.

### Low-dose dopamine in patients with early renal dysfunction: a placebo-controlled randomised trial. Australian and New Zealand intensive care society (ANZICS) clinical trials group [^117R9o76]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Low-dose dopamine is commonly administered to critically ill patients in the belief that it reduces the risk of renal failure by increasing renal blood flow. However, these effects have not been established in a large randomised controlled trial, and use of dopamine remains controversial. We have done a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of low-dose dopamine in patients with at least two criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and clinical evidence of early renal dysfunction (oliguria or increase in serum creatinine concentration).

Methods

328 patients admitted to 23 participating intensive-care units (ICUs) were randomly assigned a continuous intravenous infusion of low-dose dopamine (2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or placebo administered through a central venous catheter while in the ICU. The primary endpoint was the peak serum creatinine concentration during the infusion. Analyses excluded four patients with major protocol violations.

Findings

The groups assigned dopamine (n = 161) and placebo (n = 163) were similar in terms of baseline characteristics, renal function, and duration of trial infusion. There was no difference between the dopamine and placebo groups in peak serum creatinine concentration during treatment (245 [SD 144] vs 249 [147] micromol/L; p = 0.93), in the increase from baseline to highest value during treatment (62 [107] vs 66 [108] micromol/L; p = 0.82), or in the numbers of patients whose serum creatinine concentration exceeded 300 micromol/L (56 vs 56; p = 0.92) or who required renal replacement therapy (35 vs 40; p = 0.55). Durations of ICU stay (13 [14] vs 14 [15] days; p = 0.67) and of hospital stay (29 [27] vs 33 [39] days; p = 0.29) were also similar. There were 69 deaths in the dopamine group and 66 in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Administration of low-dose dopamine by continuous intravenous infusion to critically ill patients at risk of renal failure does not confer clinically significant protection from renal dysfunction.

Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock [^116Y4EwT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both dopamine and norepinephrine are recommended as first-line vasopressor agents in the treatment of shock. There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with shock to receive either dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy to restore and maintain blood pressure. When blood pressure could not be maintained with a dose of 20 microg per kilogram of body weight per minute for dopamine or a dose of 0.19 microg per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine, open-label norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin could be added. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary end points included the number of days without need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events.

Results

The trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5% in the dopamine group and 48.5% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P = 0.10). However, there were more arrhythmic events among the patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine (207 events [24.1%] vs. 102 events [12.4%], P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis showed that dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with an increased rate of death at 28 days among the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock but not among the 1044 patients with septic shock or the 263 with hypovolemic shock (P = 0.03 for cardiogenic shock, P = 0.19 for septic shock, and P = 0.84 for hypovolemic shock, in Kaplan-Meier analyses).

Conclusions

Although there was no significant difference in the rate of death between patients with shock who were treated with dopamine as the first-line vasopressor agent and those who were treated with norepinephrine, the use of dopamine was associated with a greater number of adverse events.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^117RvJjk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

When an appropriate fluid challenge fails, to restore an adequate arterial pressure and organ perfusion, therapy with vasopressor agents should be started.

Vasopressor drugs maintain adequate blood pressure and preserve perfusion pressure for optimizing flow in various organs.

Both norepinephrine and dopamine are the first-line vasopressor agents to correct hypotension in septic shock. Both norepinephrine and dopamine can increase blood pressure in shock states, although norepinephrine seems to be more powerful. Dopamine may be useful in patients with compromised cardiac function and cardiac reserve, but norepinephrine is more effective than dopamine in reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine has also potentially detrimental effects on the release of pituitary hormones and especially prolactin, although the clinical relevance of these effects is still unclear and can have unintended effects such as tachyarrhythmias.

Dopamine has different effects based on the doses.

A dose of less than 5 μg/kg/min results in vasodilation of renal, mesenteric, and coronary districts. At a dose of 5–10 μg/kg/min, beta-1-adrenergic effects increase cardiac contractility and heart rate. At doses about 10 μg/kg/min, alpha-adrenergic effects lead to arterial vasoconstriction and increase blood pressure. Its major side effects are tachycardia and arrhythmogenesis.

The use of renal-dose dopamine in sepsis is a controversial issue. In the past, low-dose dopamine was routinely used because of the possible renal protective effects. Dopamine at a dose of 2–3 μg/kg/min was known to stimulate diuresis by increasing renal blood flow.

A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study about low-dose dopamine in patients with at least two criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and clinical evidence of early renal dysfunction (oliguria or increase in serum creatinine concentration), was published on 2000. Patients admitted were randomly assigned a continuous intravenous infusion of low-dose dopamine (2 μg/kg/min) or placebo administered through a central venous catheter. Administration of low-dose dopamine by continuous intravenous infusion to critically ill patients at risk of renal failure did not confer clinically significant protection from renal dysfunction.

Septic shock vasopressor selection — first-line norepinephrine and adjunct vasopressin: Considering cost and availability, the panel "have issued a strong recommendation to use norepinephrine as first line agent instead of vasopressin", and, for combination therapy, they "issue a weak recommendation for adding vasopressin instead of escalating the dose of norepinephrine". Recognizing access variability, the panel notes that "availability of, and experience with, norepinephrine may vary", and if norepinephrine is unavailable, "either dopamine or epinephrine can be used with special attention given to the risk of arrhythmias".

### Use of dopamine in acute renal failure: a meta-analysis [^112rkSYc]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether low-dose dopamine administration reduces the incidence or severity of acute renal failure, need for dialysis, or mortality in patients with critical illness.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We performed a MEDLINE search of literature published from 1966 to 2000 for studies addressing the use of dopamine in the prevention and/or treatment of renal dysfunction.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted regarding design characteristics, population, intervention, and outcomes. Results of individual randomized clinical trials were pooled using a fixed effects model and a Mantel-Haenszel weighted chi-square analysis.

Data Synthesis

We identified a total of 58 studies (n = 2149). Of these, outcome data were reported in 24 studies (n = 1019) and 17 of these were randomized clinical trials (n = 854). Dopamine did not prevent mortality, (relative risk, 0.90 [0.44–1.83]; p = .92), onset of acute renal failure (relative risk, 0.81 [0.55–1.19]; p = .34), or need for dialysis, (relative risk, 0.83 [0.55–1.24]; p = .42). There was sufficient statistical power to exclude any large (> 50%) effect of dopamine on the risk of acute renal failure or need for dialysis.

Conclusions

The use of low-dose dopamine for the treatment or prevention of acute renal failure cannot be justified on the basis of available evidence and should be eliminated from routine clinical use.

### Norepinephrine plus dobutamine versus epinephrine alone for management of septic shock: a randomised trial [^112SPyzE]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

International guidelines for management of septic shock recommend that dopamine or norepinephrine are preferable to epinephrine. However, no large comparative trial has yet been done. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of norepinephrine plus dobutamine (whenever needed) with those of epinephrine alone in septic shock.

Methods

This prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study was done in 330 patients with septic shock admitted to one of 19 participating intensive care units in France. Participants were assigned to receive epinephrine (n = 161) or norepinephrine plus dobutamine (n = 169), which were titrated to maintain mean blood pressure at 70 mm Hg or more. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00148278.

Findings

There were no patients lost to follow-up; one patient withdrew consent after 3 days. At day 28, there were 64 (40%) deaths in the epinephrine group and 58 (34%) deaths in the norepinephrine plus dobutamine group (p = 0.31; relative risk 0.86, 95% CI 0.65–1.14). There was no significant difference between the two groups in mortality rates at discharge from intensive care (75 [47%] deaths vs 75 [44%] deaths, p = 0.69), at hospital discharge (84 [52%] vs 82 [49%], p = 0.51), and by day 90 (84 [52%] vs 85 [50%], p = 0.73), time to haemodynamic success (log-rank p = 0.67), time to vasopressor withdrawal (log-rank p = 0.09), and time course of SOFA score. Rates of serious adverse events were also similar.

Interpretation

There is no evidence for a difference in efficacy and safety between epinephrine alone and norepinephrine plus dobutamine for the management of septic shock.

### Vasopressors for shock [^113t7xFz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Besides reversing the underlying cause, the first line treatment for the symptoms of shock is usually the administration of intravenous fluids. If this method is not successful, vasopressors such as dopamine, dobutamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline and vasopressin are recommended. It is unclear if there is a vasopressor of choice, either for the treatment of particular forms of shock or for the treatment of shock in general.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of vasopressors for circulatory shock in critically ill patients. Our main aim was to assess whether particular vasopressors reduce overall mortality. We also intended to identify whether the choice of vasopressor influences outcomes such as length-of-stay in the intensive care unit and health-related quality of life.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and PsychINFO:all from inception to November 2003; for randomized controlled trials. We also asked experts in the field and searched meta-registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing various vasopressors, vasopressors with placebo or vasopressors with intravenous fluids for the treatment of any kind of circulatory failure (shock). Mortality was the main outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers abstracted data independently. Disagreement between two reviewers was discussed and resolved with a third reviewer. We used random effects models for combining quantitative data.

Main Results

We identified eight randomized controlled trials. Reporting of methodological details was for many items not satisfactory: only two studies reported allocation concealment, and two that the outcome assessor was blind to the intervention. Two studies compared norepinephrine plus dobutamine with epinephrine alone in patients with septic shock (52 patients, relative risk of death 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 1.67). Three studies compared norepinephrine with dopamine in patients with septic shock (62 patients, relative risk 0.88, 0.57 to 1.36). Two studies compared vasopressin with placebo in patients with septic shock (58 patients, relative risk 1.04, 0.06 to 19.33). One study compared terlipressin with norepinephrine in patients with refractory hypotension after general anaesthesia but there were no deaths (20 patients).

Reviewers' Conclusions

The current available evidence is not suited to inform clinical practice. We were unable to determine whether a particular vasopressor is superior to other agents in the treatment of states of shock.

Vasoactive agents — adult septic shock recommendations state: "we recommend using norepinephrine as the first-line agent over other vasopressors. Strong recommendation"; when norepinephrine is unavailable, "epinephrine or dopamine can be used as an alternative" with attention to arrhythmia risk; for inadequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) on norepinephrine, "we suggest adding vasopressin instead of escalating the dose of norepinephrine. Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence" with a remark that vasopressin is "usually started when the dose of norepinephrine is in the range of 0.25–0.5 μg/kg/ min"; if MAP remains inadequate despite norepinephrine and vasopressin, "we suggest adding epinephrine. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence"; and "we suggest against using terlipressin. Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence".

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^114PZCez]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence to support drug treatment for AKI is limited. While it is commonplace to use a trial of loop diuretics in children with fluid overload, the use of diuretics in the patients with hypovolaemia is associated with poor outcomes and the available evidence does not support the routine use of diuretics to prevent AKI. There is also controversy regarding the role of low-dose dopamine and routine use of dopamine in patients with AKI should be avoided since it is thought to worsen renal perfusion. Trials of new treatments for AKI have been disappointing to date and few of these have included children. Of 126 registered AKI clinical trials in 2011, 118 were in adults and only 8 were in children. Of these trials 65% were prevention studies, investigating a timed insult (eg, cardiac surgery). In addition many of these trials were inadequately powered; few were using agreed AKI definitions and 21/22 treatment trials were based in the intensive care unit and were investigating RRT. As such there is an urgent need to explore novel therapeutic agents and to revisit existing therapies in order to review potential roles in the management of AKI.

Preventing episodes of secondary AKI can also reduce the overall incidence of AKI. Secondary injury can be caused by inappropriate doses of medication with nephrotoxic potential. Examples of these agents include aminoglycosides, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcineurin inhibitors and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. These agents should be avoided if children are dehydrated and therefore at risk of AKI. Indeed patients receiving these treatments regularly should be issued with 'sick day rules' which provide guidance about the circumstances in which to omit potentially nephrotoxic medicines. Appropriate fluid management is also critical and the restoration of adequate blood volume is a priority in the early management of AKI. Overzealous administration of fluid causing fluid overload however, increases the mortality. The appropriate choice of fluid for different causes and stages of AKI is yet not known. Hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis can be caused by 0.9% saline and in a sequential period pilot study, 0.9% saline was also found to increase risk of AKI in critically ill adults by comparison to chloride-restricted intravenous fluids. However a more recent and larger trial found no difference between 0.9% saline and chloride-restricted fluids in terms of the incidence of AKI, the rate of RRT and mortality in adult patients.

### Best vasopressor for advanced vasodilatory shock: should vasopressin be part of the mix? [^114gRdYU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, a number of additional and highly relevant studies have been published addressing the issue of vasopressor use during septic shock. While these new results are provocative, none of the studies are definitive. In sum, they suggest that maybe we should not be thinking of one vasopressor versus another in a winner-takes-all sense. Rather, we should be looking for the best balance of vasopressor agents and, further, the choice likely depends on clinical context. Clinical context may drive the choice of adrenergic agonist; for example, norepinephrine may be superior to dopamine when the potential for arrhythmias is of concern. Norepinephrine may be superior to epinephrine if elevated lactate associated with epinephrine use confounds the clinical picture. The Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) identified an effective dose of arginine vasopressin (AVP) when adrenergic agonist doses are low, but higher doses of AVP may be appropriate in the context of very high adrenergic agonist doses. The effect may be a direct beneficial AVP effect or indirect sparing of adrenergic agonist use. The choice to add AVP may also be influenced by the clinical context, including renal function or the concomitant use of corticosteroids. These interim conclusions, in truth, are hypotheses warranting randomized controlled trials adequately powered to test for survival differences in these severely ill patients.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^111FcZhh]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Dopamine dosing and enteral nutrition (EN) considerations — Dopamine has dose-dependent effects, with lower doses of 3–5 mcg/kg/min associated with improved renal and mesenteric blood flow, moderate doses of 5–10 mcg/kg/min having inotropic and chronotropic effects, and high doses of 10–20 mcg/kg/min impacting arterial circulation; low doses of dopamine appear relatively safe and are not thought to contribute to EN complications. An intensive care unit (ICU) study (N = 70) evaluating enteral tolerability in cardiac surgery found an inverse relationship between EN and the dopamine and norepinephrine dosage.

### Dopamine use and its consequences in the intensive care unit: a cohort study utilizing the Japanese intensive care PAtient database [^113yKcna]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the risks associated with dopamine administration discussed elsewhere, there is an urgent need to evaluate the current situation of dopamine use so that appropriate measures can be taken. In addition, it would also be important to explore the consequences of dopamine use in a large Asian population, which is never reported in the past. This retrospective analysis of the largest database of critically ill patients in Japan was conducted to identify current patterns of dopamine use and also to explore the consequences of dopamine use in this population.

### Dopamine use and its consequences in the intensive care unit: a cohort study utilizing the Japanese intensive care PAtient database [^1129z7NN]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to describe dopamine use in patients in the intensive care unit after the SOAP II trial, utilizing a domestic database administered by the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Dopamine was found to be used widely as of 2018–2019, most notably in patients after cardiac surgery and at a low dose. Dopamine use was associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients in this study, similar to the results of previous studies, supporting the need to change clinical practice for the use of dopamine.

### Vasopressors for hypotensive shock [^116eY4La]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Initial goal directed resuscitation for shock usually includes the administration of intravenous fluids, followed by initiating vasopressors. Despite obvious immediate effects of vasopressors on haemodynamics their effect on patient relevant outcomes remains controversial. This review was originally published in 2004 and was updated in 2011.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to assess whether particular vasopressors reduce overall mortality, morbidity, and health-related quality of life.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and PsycINFO (from inception to March 2010). The original search was performed in November 2003. We also asked experts in the field and searched meta-registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing various vasopressor regimens for hypotensive shock.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors abstracted data independently. Disagreement between the authors was discussed and resolved with a third author. We used a random-effects model for combining quantitative data.

Main Results

We identified 23 randomized controlled trials involving 3212 patients, with 1629 mortality outcomes. Six different vasopressors, alone or in combination, were studied in 11 different comparisons. All 23 studies reported mortality outcomes; length of stay was reported in nine studies. Other morbidity outcomes were reported in a variable and heterogeneous way. No data were available on quality of life or anxiety and depression outcomes. We classified 10 studies as being at low risk of bias for the primary outcome mortality; only four studies fulfilled all trial quality items. In summary, there was no difference in mortality in any of the comparisons between different vasopressors or combinations. More arrhythmias were observed in patients treated with dopamine compared to norepinephrine. Norepinephrine versus dopamine, as the largest comparison in 1400 patients from six trials, yielded almost equivalence (RR 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.03). Vasopressors used as add-on therapy in comparison to placebo were not effective either. These findings were consistent among the few large studies as well as in studies with different levels of within-study bias risk.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence of no difference in mortality between norepinephrine and dopamine. Dopamine appeared to increase the risk for arrhythmia. There is not sufficient evidence of any difference between any of the six vasopressors examined. Probably the choice of vasopressors in patients with shock does not influence the outcome, rather than any vasoactive effect per se. There is not sufficient evidence that any one of the investigated vasopressors is clearly superior over others.

### Exploration of different statistical approaches in the comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock: SOAP II [^1142JeYb]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Choice of vasopressor is a crucial issue in patients with shock admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Dopamine was commonly used as first line vasopressor in patients with shock; however, norepinephrine has been favoured over the last couple decades after trials suggesting that norepinephrine could be associated with improved outcomes and fewer adverse effects. The landmark trial comparing norepinephrine and dopamine is the Comparison of Dopamine and Norepinephrine in the Treatment of Shock trial (SOAP II) which enrolled 1679 critically ill patients with shock to either norepinephrine or dopamine. SOAP II reported neutral results for the primary outcome of 28-day mortality (odds ratio [OR] with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97–1.42; p = 0.10). However, the trial found important differences, including more adverse events with dopamine.

Interpreting neutral clinical trials that include a heterogeneous population is challenging. On one hand, the effect size of SOAP II points towards possible harm with the use of dopamine; and a secondary subgroup analysis suggested that harm could be driven mostly by patients with cardiogenic shock, but the p -value for interaction was 0.12, making a strong statement not completely compatible under the frequentist framework. In addition, physicians continue to use dopamine as a vasopressor agent, suggesting that it may still be considered suitable in some conditions. There is growing interest for different statistical methods that can either provide hierarchical assessment of composite endpoints (such as the win ratio [WR]), probabilistic statements on the results (mostly through Bayesian methods) and exploring heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE), which may provide additional information from randomized trials.

We therefore reanalyzed the SOAP II trial using different statistical methods, including a hierarchical assessment of composite endpoints using WR, Bayesian reanalysis accounting for interaction of shock type and intervention, probabilistic methods of HTE based on risk and effect-based approaches. We hypothesized that these methods would provide additional insights that would both serve to showcase novel methods of analysis for randomized trials and augment the findings from the original SOAP II results.

### Dopamine use and its consequences in the intensive care unit: a cohort study utilizing the Japanese intensive care PAtient database [^113b9Ygh]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

In the present study, dopamine was predominantly (82%) used likely as an inotrope at a low dose (less than 5 μg/kg/min), which suggests the prevailing notion of the renal-protective effects of dopamine among physicians as of 2018–2019. While low-dose dopamine was initially expected to induce natriuresis in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure through vasodilation, the benefits of low-dose dopamine on patient outcomes were subsequently refuted in many studies. The landmark randomized controlled trial conducted by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS revealed no reduction in the incidence of acute renal failure, the requirement for hemodialysis, or 28-day mortality with dopamine use in patients with sepsis and oliguria. Accordingly, three large systematic reviews which included this trial failed to show clinical benefits of low-dose dopamine, leading to an elimination of dopamine from clinical practice as a renal-protective agent. The reason for the widespread use of low dose dopamine in the present study is difficult to determine, but it suggests the challenging nature of knowledge transmission or knowledge updates in clinical practice. The odds ratio for the hospital mortality for the low dose dopamine in the current study was lower than those for higher dose groups in the multivariable analysis (Table 2), likely reflecting the less disease severity in the patients treated with low-dose dopamine. The results were not statistically significant, however, and consistent with the study from ANZICS in 2000, which showed no mortality benefits with the low dose dopamine as described above.

### Dopamine use and its consequences in the intensive care unit: a cohort study utilizing the Japanese intensive care PAtient database [^117BEehk]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These results showed that dopamine is widely used in ICUs in Japan, most commonly for patients with cardiovascular diseases. There were no significant differences in hospital characteristics between dopamine frequent-using facilities compared with infrequent-using facilities. Importantly, a dopamine dose > 5 μg/kg/min was associated with a higher probability of in-hospital mortality in a dose-dependent manner in multivariable analysis. The propensity score-matched analysis excluding those who received ≤ 5 μg/kg/min showed a significantly higher risk of death at ICU discharge or hospital discharge with dopamine use as a vasopressor. Furthermore, this analysis also showed a longer ICU stay by almost two days and a longer duration of the first mechanical ventilation by one day in the dopamine group. While a subgroup analysis showed no difference in the primary outcome associated with dopamine use in any disease categories, a significantly longer ICU stay and the duration of the first mechanical ventilation were noted with dopamine use among the patients with cardiovascular diseases.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^112pNbmR]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II work through different pathways, there are multiple agents that can impact the sympathetic system via altering levels of alpha and beta selectivity. Depending on the clinical scenario, additional stimulation or alpha or beta receptors could have potentially beneficial or deleterious effects. In this context, epinephrine is suggested as an additive agent to raise MAP and reduces the dose of norepinephrine in cases of refractory shock. Although it is effective in raising MAP, epinephrine is not recommended as a first-line agent since clinical trials demonstrate a lack of a mortality benefit, supported further by a meta-analysis of vasopressor trials. Of note, epinephrine may increase lactate production via its activity on skeletal beta-2 receptors, complicating the interpretation of lactate clearance and evaluating perfusion. Phenylephrine represents a complementary vasopressor that could be used. Given its selective alpha-1 agonist activity, the pharmacology of phenylephrine may appear attractive in a high output hypotensive state; however, this agent has the potential to cause splanchnic vasoconstriction. Notably, in a recent analysis of the effects of a nationwide shortage of norepinephrine, phenylephrine was the most commonly substituted vasopressor and was associated with increased mortality. Although correlation is not equivalent to causation, this is not supportive of earlier usage of phenylephrine. Further, dopamine works not only through dopamine receptors at lower doses but also signals through alpha receptors at higher doses. In a randomized trial comparing norepinephrine to dopamine, mortality outcomes were similar with both drugs; however, dopamine was associated with a higher occurrence of arrhythmias, which limits its utility if other agents are available. In addition, the rising cost of available vasopressors challenges their application in clinical care. In an environment where there are concerns due to the rising cost of healthcare and an increasing emphasis on value, the cost of vasopressor drugs is under scrutiny in order to justify use.

### Dopamine versus norepinephrine in the treatment of septic shock: a meta-analysis* [^112Gjt9Y]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

There has long-been controversy about the possible superiority of norepinephrine compared to dopamine in the treatment of shock. The objective was to evaluate the effects of norepinephrine and dopamine on outcome and adverse events in patients with septic shock.

Data Sources

A systematic search of the MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases, and of Google Scholar, up to June 30, 2011.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies providing information on the outcome of patients with septic shock treated with dopamine compared to norepinephrine were included. Observational and randomized trials were analyzed separately. Because time of outcome assessment varied among trials, we evaluated 28-day mortality or closest estimate. Heterogeneity among trials was assessed using the Cochrane Q homogeneity test. A Forest plot was constructed and the aggregate relative risk of death was computed. Potential publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots.

Methods and Main Results

We retrieved five observational (1,360 patients) and six randomized (1,408 patients) trials, totaling 2,768 patients (1,474 who received norepinephrine and 1,294 who received dopamine). In observational studies, among which there was significant heterogeneity (p < .001), there was no difference in mortality (relative risk, 1.09; confidence interval, 0.84–1.41; p = .72). A sensitivity analysis identified one trial as being responsible for the heterogeneity; after exclusion of that trial, no heterogeneity was observed and dopamine administration was associated with an increased risk of death (relative risk, 1.23; confidence interval, 1.05–1.43; p < .01). In randomized trials, for which no heterogeneity or publication bias was detected (p = .77), dopamine was associated with an increased risk of death (relative risk, 1.12; confidence interval, 1.01–1.20; p = .035). In the two trials that reported arrhythmias, these were more frequent with dopamine than with norepinephrine (relative risk, 2.34; confidence interval, 1.46–3.77; p = .001).

Conclusions

In patients with septic shock, dopamine administration is associated with greater mortality and a higher incidence of arrhythmic events compared to norepinephrine administration.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^115rZTMg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should vasopressor agent selection be personalized based on patient characteristics (e.g. home medicines and chronic disease conditions)? A decisional process to determine how to individualize vasopressor therapies does not currently exist. Identifying patient-specific factors affecting organ perfusion and vasopressor response in order to adjust perfusion targets is not commonly used in clinical practice. There is recognition that underlying chronic disease states may affect organ perfusion, yet there is a lack of evidence as to how to guide vasopressor selection based on patient-specific factors in the clinical setting.
2) What should the starting dose of norepinephrine be?
3) Is norepinephrine always the appropriate choice as a first-line vasopressor in sepsis? The data surrounding this recommendation are relatively scant. Is there a potential benefit to use vasopressin as a first-line therapy in select patients with septic shock in the broader population or in a select group of patients (e.g. atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease)?
4) Which agent should be considered as second-line therapy, and does this change based upon patient characteristics?
5) What are appropriate thresholds for adding a second vasopressor agent? Trials comparing adjunctive vasopressor strategies have evaluated different endpoints. Whether adding adjunctive therapies to norepinephrine improves safety and survival is largely unknown. Meaningful clinical endpoints aside from survival may potentially include (but are not limited to) need for renal replacement therapy, new arrhythmias, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, digit necrosis, and quality of life. This is vital to understand since adding an adjunctive agent to reduce the dose of norepinephrine without improving survival or reducing adverse events would result in increased costs, possibly without improving patient-centric clinical outcomes.
6) When should patients receive fluid resuscitation versus vasopressor initiation versus both?
7) When should angiotensin II be initiated? Although the ATHOS-3 trial established the efficacy of angiotensin II as a vasopressor agent to raise blood pressure, important questions remain regarding angiotensin II's role in clinical practice, primarily due to the lack of comparative data and potential safety concerns related to the higher rate of thromboembolism observed in clinical trials to date. Although an argument can be made for the benefits of multimodal vasopressor therapy, more outcome and comparative data are necessary both to determine if angiotensin II is clearly beneficial in subpopulations (such as potentially in patients requiring renal replacement therapy) or is potentially harmful when compared with a strategy that does not use this agent.
8) What is the role of phenylephrine, if any, in the management of sepsis?
9) What is the ideal target MAP in septic patients?
10) How do chronic comorbidities (hypertension, CKD), and baseline medications, impact both goal MAP and vasopressor response?
11) What is the cost effectiveness of different vasopressor strategies? Although cost of care has traditionally not been prioritized, it is a significant factor in the clinical environment where utility and efficiency are measured by stakeholders. Understanding that healthcare economics vary widely between countries, in an environment where healthcare costs are rapidly increasing, evaluations of vasopressors need to factor in costs.
12) How should vasopressor therapies be weaned?

### Prevention of acute renal failure [^116ipxxR]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure (ARF) comprises a family of syndromes that is characterized by an abrupt and sustained decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. In the ICU, ARF is most often due to sepsis and other systemic inflammatory states. ARF is common among the critically ill and injured and significantly adds to morbidity and mortality of these patients. Despite many advances in medical technology, the mortality and morbidity of ARF in the ICU continue to remain high and have not improved significantly over the past 2 decades. Primary strategies to prevent ARF still include adequate hydration, maintenance of mean arterial pressure, and minimizing nephrotoxin exposure. Diuretics and dopamine have been shown to be ineffective in the prevention of ARF or improving outcomes once ARF occurs. Increasing insight into mechanisms leading to ARF and the importance of facilitating renal recovery has prompted investigators to evaluate the role of newer therapeutic agents in the prevention of ARF.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^1121c3Zs]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Septic shock — practical targets and dosing with vasopressors: In summary, norepinephrine should be used as a first-line vasopressor, with epinephrine and dopamine as alternatives if not available, and a MAP of 65 mmHg should be targeted for patients with septic shock receiving vasopressors. Healthcare professionals may consider initiating invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure monitoring and, if central access has not been obtained, consider starting vasopressors peripherally. Should MAP targets not be met despite low-to-moderate dose norepinephrine, healthcare professionals may consider adding vasopressin; the usual dose range for norepinephrine is 0.25 to 0.5 micrograms per kilogram per minute, and if the MAP remains inadequate, healthcare professionals may consider adding epinephrine.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^117UonCk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of literature from 1966 to 2000 for studies addressing the use of dopamine in the prevention and/or treatment of renal dysfunction was published on 2001. The Authors concluded that the use of low-dose dopamine for the treatment or prevention of acute renal failure was not justified on the basis of available evidence.

Norepinephrine is a potent alpha-adrenergic agonist with minimal beta-adrenergic agonist effects. Norepinephrine can successfully increase blood pressure in patients who are septic and remain hypotensive following fluid resuscitation. Norepinephrine is effective to treat hypotension in septic shock patients. In many studies norepinephrine administration at doses 0.01 to 0.3 μg/kg/min has been shown may be effective.

On 1993 Martin and coll. published a randomized trial comparing norepinephrine vs dopamine. 32 volume-resuscitated septic patients were given either dopamine or norepinephrine to achieve and maintain normal hemodynamic and oxygen transport parameters for at least 6 h. Dopamine administration was successful in only 31% of patients, whereas norepinephrine administration was successful in 93%. Of the 11 patients who did not respond to dopamine, 10 responded when norepinephrine was added to therapy. Serum lactate levels were decreased as well, suggesting that norepinephrine therapy improved tissue oxygenation.

Recently a prospective trial by Patel and coll. compared dopamine to norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor in fluid resuscitated 252 adult patients with septic shock. If the maximum dose of the initial vasopressor was unable to maintain the hemodynamic goal, then fixed dose vasopressin was added to each regimen. If additional vasopressor support was needed to achieve the hemodynamic goal, then phenylephrine was added. In this study dopamine and norepinephrine were equally effective as initial agents as judged by 28-day mortality rates. However, there were significantly more cardiac arrhythmias with dopamine treatment.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines state that there is no sufficient evidence to suggest which agent is better as initial vasopressor in the management of patients with septic shock.

Phenylephrine is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist primarily used in anesthesia to increase blood pressure. Although studies are limited, its rapid onset, short duration, and primary vascular effects make it an interesting agent in the management of hypotension associated with sepsis, but there are concerns about its potential to reduce cardiac output in these patients.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115VofnM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

A dose of less than 5 μg/kg/min results in vasodilation of renal, mesenteric, and coronary districts. At a dose of 5–10 μg/kg/min, beta-1-adrenergic effects increase cardiac contractility and heart rate. At doses about 10 μg/kg/min, alpha-adrenergic effects lead to arterial vasoconstriction and increase blood pressure. Its major side effects are tachycardia and arrhythmogenesis.

The use of renal-dose dopamine in sepsis is a controversial issue. In the past, low-dose dopamine was routinely used because of the possible renal protective effects. Dopamine at a dose of 2–3 μg/kg/min was known to stimulate diuresis by increasing renal blood flow.

A meta-analysis of literature from 1966 to 2000 for studies addressing the use of dopamine in the prevention and/or treatment of renal dysfunction concluded that the use of low-dose dopamine for the treatment or prevention of acute renal failure was not justified on the basis of available evidence.

Norepinephrine is a potent alpha-adrenergic agonist with minimal beta-adrenergic agonist effects. Norepinephrine can successfully increase blood pressure in patients who are septic and remain hypotensive following fluid resuscitation. Norepinephrine is effective to treat hypotension in septic shock patients. In many studies norepinephrine administration at doses 0.01 to 0.3 μg/kg/min has been shown may be effective.

Martin and coll. published a randomized trial comparing norepinephrine vs dopamine. 32 volume-resuscitated septic patients were given either dopamine or norepinephrine to achieve and maintain normal hemodynamic and oxygen transport parameters for at least 6 h. Dopamine administration was successful in only 31% of patients, whereas norepinephrine administration was successful in 93%. Of the 11 patients who did not respond to dopamine, 10 responded when norepinephrine was added to therapy. Serum lactate levels were decreased as well, suggesting that norepinephrine therapy improved tissue oxygenation.

A critical view of the recommendations

Two recommendations should be addressed. The first recommendation concerns the use of epinephrine as a second-line agent and the second regards the use of dopamine in highly selected patients. The relevance of using epinephrine in association with norepinephrine should be discussed since a) epinephrine markedly increases lactate levels and may therefore preclude the use of lactate clearance to guide resuscitation, b) norepinephrine and epinephrine both act on α 1 adrenergic receptors so there is no therapeutic value in adding the same molecule type when norepinephrine has failed to increase MAP, and c) the combination of norepinephrine and dobutamine, allowing the separate titration of vasopressor and inotropic effects, is more logical than using epinephrine alone. Therefore, we firmly believe that epinephrine has no place in septic shock treatment with the exception of countries with limited resources (it is cheaper than norepinephrine). In these countries, it is acceptable to use epinephrine since no data support a difference in efficacy, mortality, or morbidity. With regard to dopamine, there is currently ample evidence that norepinephrine or epinephrine is more efficient in restoring MAP and that both drugs could be used through a peripheral venous access. Thus, dopamine should no longer be used in septic shock. Moreover, in a randomized study comparing dopamine and epinephrine in the treatment of shock, a subgroup analysis of 280 patients with cardiogenic shock showed dopamine to be associated with an increase in 28-day mortality compared to norepinephrine.

Clinical studies

Low-dose or 'renal' dose dopamine has been advocated in the past to prevent selective renal vasoconstriction in a variety of conditions. This may not be the case in complex clinical conditions, where low-dose dopamine may even worsen renal perfusion. Several meta-analyses have concluded that 'renal-dose' dopamine has no benefit in either preventing or ameliorating AKI in the critically ill, the latest being presented in ESM_2 Table S6.

Fenoldopam is a pure dopamine-A 1 receptor agonist providing systemic and renal vasodilation and natriuresis, and it has been studied in cardiovascular surgery and critically ill patients. Two older meta-analyses, one including 1290 critically ill and surgical patients (mainly cardiovascular) from 16 RCTs and the other including 1059 cardiac surgery patients from 13 (partially overlapping) RCTs and case-matched studies, reported that the use of fenoldopam reduced the incidence of AKI, need for RRT and hospital mortality. Most studies were small with a moderate to high risk of bias and in the second meta-analysis 30% of the included studies were abstracts. The two most recent meta-analyses in cardiac surgery and major surgery used stricter inclusion criteria and only found a lower risk for AKI, but not for RRT or death. In addition, both showed an increased risk of hypotension and most included studies had a high risk of bias due to low sample size and fragility index, and use of different definitions for AKI. The most recent and largest RCT in post cardiac surgery patients with AKIN stage I did not show any renal protection or clinical benefit from the use of fenoldopam, while fenoldopam conferred more hypotension. (Studies are summarized in ESM_2 Table S7).

### Exploration of different statistical approaches in the comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock: SOAP II [^116WJSoZ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Exploring clinical trial data using alternative methods may enhance original study's findings and provide new insights. The SOAP II trial has been published more than 10 years ago; but there is still some speculation that some patients may benefit from dopamine administration for shock management. We aimed to reanalyse the trial under different approaches and evaluate for heterogeneity in treatment effect (HTE).

Methods

All patients enrolled in SOAP II were eligible for reanalysis. We used a variety of methods including the win-ratio (WR), a Bayesian reanalysis stratified according to shock type, and both a risk-based and effect-based explorations for HTE. The methods were applied to different endpoints, including a hierarchy of death, new use of renal-replacement therapy (RRT), and new-onset arrhythmia; 28-day mortality; a composite endpoint (mortality, new use of RRT, and new-onset arrhythmia), and days alive and free of ICU at 28-days (DAFICU28).

Results

A total of 1679 patients were included (average age was 64.9 years, 57% male, 62% with septic and 17% with cardiogenic shock). All analysis favoured norepinephrine over dopamine. Under the WR approach, dopamine had fewer wins compared to norepinephrine (WR 0.79; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.68–0.92; p = 0.003), evident in both cardiogenic and septic shock subgroups. The Bayesian reanalysis for type of shock showed, for dopamine, a probability of harm of 0.95 for mortality, > 0.99 probability of harm for composite endpoint, and 0.91 probability of harm for DAFICU28. The fewer DAFICU28 with dopamine was more apparent in those with cardiogenic shock (0.92). Under the risk-based HTE, there was a high probability that dopamine resulted fewer DAFICU28 in the highest quartile of predicted mortality risk. The effect-based HTE assessment model did not recommended dopamine over norepinephrine for any combination of possible modifiers including age, type of shock, presence of cardiomyopathy, and SOFA score. Receiving dopamine when the effect-based model recommended norepinephrine was associated with an absolute increase in composite endpoint of 6%.

Conclusion

The harm associated with the use of dopamine for the management of shock appears to be present in both septic and cardiogenic shock patients. There was no suggestion of any subgroup in which dopamine was found to be favourable over norepinephrine.

Potential organ donor — vasoactive support recommendations specify that dopamine has traditionally been the first-line vasoactive agent for cardiovascular collapse following brainstem death but there remain insufficient data to preferentially recommend it over other vasopressors; vasopressin infusion is an alternative first-line agent and can also serve as an additional vasopressor in refractory shock; norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and other agents (e.g., dobutamine and epinephrine) may be used in severe shock, with dopamine, dobutamine, or epinephrine may be used in primary cardiac pump dysfunction, and norepinephrine or phenylephrine is recommended in predominantly vasodilatory shock; if hemodynamic goals are not met and/or left ventricular ejection fraction remains less than 45%, HRT may be undertaken.

Inotropes

Dobutamine (predominantly β 2 -adrenergic, Table 4) has both inotropic and mild vasodilatory effects. In an open-label setting addition of dobutamine in septic patients was associated with improved OPS-measured sublingual microcirculatory perfusion over time, irrespective of changes in systemic hemodynamic variables. Interestingly, topical application of acetylcholine further improved microcirculatory perfusion, challenging the widespread concept of an irresponsive endothelium in sepsis-induced hypotension. In a crossover setting, dobutamine attenuated intramucosal acidosis during sepsis, whereas dopamine did not change p CO 2 g-a under equal effects in systemic hemodynamics. Addition of dobutamine to NE in septic patients revealed a lower p CO 2 g-a, but no change in ICG plasma clearance; this could either be due to a direct effect on the microcirculation or a result of an increase in cardiac output. Whether an increase in general splanchnic perfusion indeed is followed by improved organ function is still a matter of debate.

Dopamine (β 2 -adrenergic and dopaminergic, Table 4; in high-dose also α-adrenergic, Table 2) was used in sepsis for many years in low concentrations for its potential beneficial effects on renal function as a result of afferent renal vessel dilatation. However, results of multiple studies have made such an effect of clinical relevance very unlikely. Low-dose dopamine in addition to NE did not alter pH i despite increased overall splanchnic oxygen consumption. High-dose dopamine decreased pH i despite a rise in cardiac output, whereas NE increased pH i at the same MAP.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^1168JfHm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Vasopressor agents should be administered to restore organ perfusion if fluid resuscitation fails optimizing blood flow and if hypotension persists following fluid loading. These agents should be globally available. Vasopressor and inotropic agents have increasingly become a therapeutic cornerstone for the management of sepsis. They have excitatory and inhibitory actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, as well as important metabolic, central nervous system, and presynaptic autonomic nervous system effects. The optimal timing of vasopressors relative to fluid infusion has been debated. Recently, a large multi-center retrospective analysis of 2849 patients with septic shock, investigators found that mortality was lowest when vasopressors were delayed by 1 h and infused from hours 1 to 6 following onset of shock. Norepinephrine is now the first-line vasopressor agent used to correct hypotension in the event of septic shock. Norepinephrine is more efficacious than dopamine and may be more effective for reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine may cause more tachycardia and may be more arrhythmogenic than norepinephrine, and as an alternative vasopressor agent to norepinephrine, it should be used only in patients with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia.

Dobutamine is an inotropic agent used to treat septic shock patients increasing cardiac output, stroke index, and oxygen delivery (DO 2). It has been suggested to be administered to pre-existing vasopressor therapy in the presence of myocardial dysfunction, defined as elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output. However, dobutamine increases DO 2 to supranormal values and in critically ill patients, it has raised serious questions regarding its safety in the treatment of septic shock. Because dobutamine provides direct stimulation of the β-1 adrenergic receptors, it is recognized as more problematic with regard to tachycardia and arrhythmia.

In LMICs, it may be acceptable to use adrenaline infusions as the inotrope of choice, given it is readily available, cheap, and has been shown to be equivalent to noradrenaline in septic shock.

Increased global availability of vasopressors together with a better understanding of their indications, pharmacodynamics, and important adverse effects are mandatory to fight sepsis worldwide.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^116pRiFn]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Septic shock — vasopressor initiation and escalation (SSC): Vasopressin is typically used at a fixed dose of 0.03 units per minute, and a systematic review of 10 RCTs by the SSC found reduced mortality when vasopressin was combined with norepinephrine versus norepinephrine alone (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–0.99) with no difference in risks of digital ischemia or arrhythmias. A new weak recommendation from the SSC suggests that for adults with septic shock, vasopressors should be started by peripheral intravenous access to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured, and there is a strong recommendation to use norepinephrine as the first-line agent. Alternatives to norepinephrine, if not available, include epinephrine or dopamine; if MAP levels remain inadequate despite norepinephrine, it is suggested to add vasopressin rather than escalating the dose of norepinephrine, and if MAP levels remain inadequate despite norepinephrine and vasopressin, it is suggested to add epinephrine. For septic shock with cardiac dysfunction and persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume status and arterial blood pressure, the SSC suggests adding either dobutamine to norepinephrine or using epinephrine alone, while a new weak recommendation suggests against using levosimendan.

### State-of-the-art management of the acutely unwell child [^112jEu6h]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A global epidemiology study estimated the prevalence of paediatric sepsis at 8.2%, with the most common underlying causes being respiratory (40%) and bloodstream (19%). Despite evidence that hospital sepsis deaths occur within the first 24–72 h of admission, and the availability of guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign since 2004, morbidity and mortality remains high. The new 2020 Surviving Sepsis campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis‐associated organ dysfunction in children provide guidance on fluids and vasoactive medications. Fluid recommendations differ based on the availability of paediatric intensive care. For systems with paediatric intensive care, 40–60 ml.kg ‐1 in bolus fluid (10–20 ml.kg ‐1 per bolus) are suggested over the first hour, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output, with continuous re‐assessment. Should signs of fluid overload (hepatomegaly, pulmonary congestion) develop at any stage, this should be discontinued. In settings without paediatric intensive care, it is advised that maintenance fluids be started but no boluses given if the infant/child is not hypotensive. If hypotension is present, up to 40 ml.kg ‐1 (10–20 ml.kg ‐1 per bolus) over the first hour should be titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output (and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop). Maitland et al. conducted a RCT in a low‐resource African setting that showed bolus fluid in the first hour of resuscitation increased mortality compared with maintenance fluids. Further analysis of the study concluded that, in this setting, the incidence of children presenting with severe febrile illness and fulfilling the World Health Organization definition for shock or hypotension was low. However, even in the children who met those criteria, there was a trend towards increased mortality, suggesting fluid management should be less focused on bolus and more on ensuring maintenance in a resource‐limited setting. The guidelines recommend fluid resuscitation be with balanced/buffered crystalloids rather than 0.9% saline solution in the first 72 h of admission for sepsis, based on observational studies which showed a reduction in mortality in children (OR 0.79; 95%CI 0.65–0.95). In children with septic shock, adrenaline or noradrenaline are advocated as first‐line vasoactive medications rather than dopamine, although dopamine may be substituted if these are not available. This guidance change follows the publication of two small studies. Ramaswamy et al. found adrenaline superior to dopamine in reversing fluid‐refractory hypotensive cold shock within the first hour of resuscitation (41% vs. 13%, OR 4.8; 95%CI 1.3–17.2) and Ventura et al. reported peripheral dopamine to be associated with increased mortality compared with peripheral/intraosseous adrenaline in children with fluid‐refractory septic shock. Vasoactive medications can be administered safely via peripheral or intraosseous access whilst central venous access is sought.

### The use of low-dose dopamine in the neonatal intensive care unit [^117PSpjb]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Dopamine has been used for half a century in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of hypotension, as well as for the theoretical prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI). Although activation of renal dopamine receptors leads to increased urine output, there is no evidence that low-dose dopamine reduces the incidence of AKI, need for dialysis, or death. Dopamine administration is also associated with multiple adverse effects, particularly in preterm infants. Despite the lack of evidence for its use, as well as the known adverse effects of dopamine, many neonatologists still use low-dose dopamine to prevent or treat AKI in neonates. In this review, we provide a summary of our current medical knowledge about the use of low-dose dopamine in the neonatal population.

### Fenoldopam to prevent acute kidney injury after major surgery-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154hQmb]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication of high-risk surgery and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Current management strategies are largely preventative and consist of avoidance of nephrotoxins, optimisation of haemodynamics (including arterial pressure) and correction of volume depletion. At present there are no therapeutic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in preventing or treating post-operative AKI.

Fenoldopam is a short-acting dopamine-1 receptor agonist, licensed for the treatment of hypertension. It decreases systemic vascular resistance while simultaneously increasing renal blood flow in patients with normal renal function and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It has been investigated in off-label studies as a potential agent to protect renal function during the peri-operative period. In contrast to dopamine, it has no α- or β-receptor activity. Data from experimental AKI models suggest that it also has anti-inflammatory effects independent of its vasodilatory action.

At least three meta-analyses have suggested that fenoldopam may reduce the incidence of AKI, reduce the requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and reduce mortality during critical illness and in patients undergoing cardiovascular interventions. However, some of the studies included in these reviews were either non-randomised, studies with an active comparator, or trials performed in non-surgical patients.

Guidance on the role of fenoldopam in surgical and critically ill patients is conflicting. In 2010, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Working Group for Nephrology published recommendations for the prevention of AKI and suggested that the prophylactic use of fenoldopam should be considered in patients at high risk of AKI undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Two years later, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) expert committee released a new guideline and advised against the use of fenoldopam to prevent or treat AKI in any context. New data produced in 2010–2012 may have contributed to the change in guidance.

Our aim was to review the existing data for fenoldopam as a renoprotective agent in the peri-operative setting and to perform a meta-analysis and systematic review of all existing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fenoldopam versus placebo in adult patients undergoing any type of major surgery.

### Adrenergic downregulation in critical care: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic evidence [^1141d9mM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Catecholamines remain the mainstay of therapy for acute cardiovascular dysfunction. However, adrenergic receptors quickly undergo desensitization and downregulation after prolonged stimulation. Moreover, prolonged exposure to high circulating catecholamines levels is associated with several adverse effects on different organ systems. Unfortunately, in critically ill patients, adrenergic downregulation translates into progressive reduction of cardiovascular response to exogenous catecholamine administration, leading to refractory shock. Accordingly, there has been a growing interest in recent years toward use of noncatecholaminergic inotropes and vasopressors. Several studies investigating a wide variety of catecholamine-sparing strategies (eg, levosimendan, vasopressin, β-blockers, steroids, and use of mechanical circulatory support) have been published recently. Use of these agents was associated with improvement in hemodynamics and decreased catecholamine use but without a clear beneficial effect on major clinical outcomes. Accordingly, additional research is needed to define the optimal management of catecholamine-resistant shock.

Pediatric septic shock — vasoactive infusion initiation and vascular access: All vasoactive agents, including norepinephrine, may be initiated through peripheral venous or intraosseous access if central venous access is not readily available to avoid delays, and central venous access should be obtained as soon as reasonably practicable. In practice, 82% of panel members reported at least sometimes administering the initial vasoactive infusion peripherally when central venous or intraosseous access was not readily available, particularly in emergency department or other non-PICU settings. Most panelists preferred epinephrine or dopamine if a peripheral infusion was needed, and although epinephrine or norepinephrine is the preferred first-line medication, dopamine may be substituted as the first-line vasoactive infusion, administered either peripherally or centrally, if neither epinephrine nor norepinephrine is readily available.

Associations with outcomes

A univariable logistic regression with a generalized estimating equation with death at hospital discharge as the outcome variable and dopamine as the predictor variable yielded an odds ratio (OR) 0.39 (95%CI: 0.31–0.51) for dopamine ≤ 5 μg/kg/min, OR 1.39 (95%CI: 1.11–1.73) for dopamine > 5 and ≤ 15 μg/kg/min, and OR 4.87 (95%CI: 2.85–8.34) for dopamine > 15 μg/kg/min (no use as reference). The results of multivariable logistic analysis with the generalized estimating equation are shown in Table 2. The higher doses of dopamine were still associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate after the adjustment.

A propensity-matched analysis was conducted on the data after the inclusion process. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the final model to predict the dopamine treatment was 0.73 [95%CI: 0.71–0.75]. In total, 570 pairs were made upon a 1:1 propensity score matching. The baseline characteristics of the pairs are presented in Table 3 and Additional file 1: Table 3, showing well-balanced groups with standardized mean differences < 0.1 for most of the variables. The primary and secondary outcomes in these two groups are presented in Table 4. Both of the rate of death at the time of ICU and hospital discharge were significantly higher in the dopamine group. ICU length of stay and the duration of the first mechanical ventilation were significantly longer in the dopamine group by almost two days and one day, respectively. Sub-group analyses on the three specific disease categories (cardiovascular, infection, and others) did not show significant differences either in the death at the time of ICU or hospital discharge between no dopamine and dopamine groups in any of the subgroups, however, revealed a significantly longer ICU stay and the duration of the first mechanical ventilation with dopamine use in patients with a cardiovascular diagnosis. The hospital length of stay was significantly longer in the dopamine group in patients with infection. No such association was found for patients with other diagnoses.

Table 2
Summary of the effects of commonly used vasoactive drugs on intensive care at the cellular level

Dobutamine is recommended for treatment of moderate hypotension (70–100 mm Hg systolic) following myocardial infarction, without clinical features of shock. In CS of any aetiology, the use of dobutamine or milrinone should be considered early. Vasodilatory effects, necessitating coadministration with a vasopressor, often limit their use. Norepinephrine should be regarded as the first-line vasopressor (table 3); it is non-inferior to dopamine, and dopamine has demonstrated worse outcomes in the CS subgroup with the attendant risks of arrhythmias. Vasopressin is increasingly deployed as a norepinephrine sparing vasopressor and in the context of right heart failure owing to its pulmonary vasodilatory properties. Epinephrine should be restricted to patients with persistent hypotension despite adequate cardiac filling pressures as it has not been shown to be superior to alternatives and its use has been associated with lactic acidosis, tachyarrhythmias and gastric malperfusion.

Assessment of clinical response to all interventions should occur serially through a combination of clinical assessment, biochemical (lactate, central venous oxygen saturations) and haemodynamic variables (echocardiography, CO, cardiac index and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Continuous haemodynamic monitoring is essential to allow early identification of changes in clinical condition and titration of both pharmacological therapies and MCS, which are often used in tandem. Central venous cannulation permits the safe administration of vasoactive drugs and allows monitoring of right atrial pressures and central venous gases, a surrogate assessment of tissue oxygen delivery and utilisation.

Consensus on the optimal method of haemodynamic monitoring in CS is lacking, although invasive monitoring with an arterial line in addition to continuous ECG should be considered at a minimum. A range of CO devices exist using either thermodilution or bolus indicator dilution. None has demonstrated superiority or outcome benefit; nonetheless, pulmonary artery catheterisation is advocated in the management of CS to aid diagnosis and monitor response to interventions. Use of any CO monitoring should be determined by local availability, safety profile and clinical context of the patient. Where a commensurate physiological response is not being achieved despite escalating pharmacotherapy, discussion with a centre with MCS capability should be considered.

### Recently published papers: sepsis – guidelines, treatment and novel approaches [^114yk4W5]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The choice of inotropic agent, particularly in catecholamine-resistant septic shock, remains an area of debate. Here we discuss a recent trial examining the use of vasopressin in a carefully controlled trial setting. Yet more data on the use of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in septic shock are described, as are novel but as yet experimental approaches to the treatment of sepsis. Finally, it is important not to forget to read the latest surviving sepsis guidelines.

### State of shock: contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^116Yqz7e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock With Associated Hypotension

The initial goal of therapy in patients with CS and associated hypotension should be focused on the restoration of perfusion to vital organs, achieved through augmenting MAP and cardiac output. End‐organ blood flow is a direct correlate of MAP, and reduced systolic blood pressure in CS, in particular in the setting of AMI‐CS, is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality.

The safety and efficacy of dopamine in CS has been called into question by the SOAP‐II (Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients) trial. This study compared dopamine and norepinephrine as first‐line therapies through a multicenter, ICU‐based randomized controlled trial of 1679 patients with shock of all causes. Although there was no difference in the primary outcome of all‐cause 28‐day mortality in this cohort, dopamine was associated with increased arrhythmic events (n = 207 [24.1%] versus n = 102 [12.4%], P < 0.001) and in a prespecified subgroup of 280 patients with CS there was an increased risk of 28‐day mortality (P = 0.03). Although these findings are hypothesis generating, in the absence of alternate data supporting the use of dopamine, we advocate that noradrenaline should be used in preference to dopamine in the hemodynamic support in patients with CS and hypotension.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^111Ji572]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Vasoactive agents for adults with septic shock — Patients with septic shock who do not respond to fluid resuscitation will require support with vasopressors. Adults with septic shock should have vasopressors begun through peripheral access to improve mean arterial pressure (MAP) rather than waiting for central access. Norepinephrine should be used as the first-line vasopressor agent in adults with septic shock unresponsive to intravenous fluid resuscitation. Adults with septic shock should be treated initially with norepinephrine over other vasopressors. It is reasonable to use epinephrine or dopamine for adults with septic shock when norepinephrine is not available. For adults with septic shock and persistent MAP less than 65 mmHg on norepinephrine, consider adding vasopressin rather than increasing the dose of norepinephrine. For adults with septic shock and persistent MAP less than 65 mmHg on norepinephrine and vasopressin, consider adding epinephrine. For adults with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction, add dobutamine to norepinephrine or use epinephrine alone.

### The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score: has the time come for an update? [^111aZqGq]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of central nervous system function is particularly challenging given the lack of available objective measures. The GCS score, although subjective, remains an obvious choice given its relative simplicity and extensive validation. Nevertheless, the use of sedative agents makes its interpretation difficult in some patients, in particular those receiving mechanical ventilation. In these circumstances, an assumed GCS, i.e. the score that the patient would have in the absence of sedation, could be used, as is currently recommended, recognizing that this may not be compatible with the fully automated data collection systems that are increasingly employed.

As noted during the development of the original SOFA score, the variables selected for each organ should ideally be independent of therapy, as management practices vary across units and patients depending on availability and hospital and/or physician preference. However, for the cardiovascular and respiratory systems this may not be possible. If the current use of therapeutic agents for the cardiovascular system is retained in a SOFA 2.0, several changes in use of vasopressor and inotropic agents to primarily correct hypotension or cardiac output merit consideration for inclusion. For example, vasopressin and its derivatives are now used in many centers. Although less widely used, metaraminol, phenylephrine and angiotensin II are other vasopressors that could be considered for inclusion. While use of dopamine has declined considerably worldwide, it may still be used sufficiently to warrant retention. Inclusion of other inotropic agents, such as levosimendan and phosphodiesterase (PDE)-3 inhibitors, may also be considered in addition to dobutamine. At which degree of severity these variables should be included and which doses/cutoffs should be used would need prospective validation. Use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), cardiac assist devices, or other support systems may also be considered in the assessment of the cardiovascular system, although such support may impact on the evaluation of the function of other organ systems. For example, a patient with severe cardiogenic shock receiving VA-ECMO will often have a very high PaO 2 (i.e. > 400). When considering these issues, it will be important to not over-complicate the score while, at the same time, being generic for the different approaches in current use.

### Real-life use of vasopressors and inotropes in cardiogenic shock-observation is necessarily' theory-laden' [^113U9Kmn]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

These contradictory findings are likely be a reflection of how different drugs are used — as the degree of statistical adjustment for confounding was improved (from crude to standardised mortality to propensity score matching), the initial mortality association with epinephrine use disappeared. When the use of drugs was protocolised in randomised controlled trial circumstances the association was reversed, with epinephrine showing a mortality benefit over dopamine. It is likely that more important than the choice of drug may be the use of the right amount of the right drug at the right time. We join the authors to call for further randomised controlled trials to determine an evidence-based approach to vaso-active agent use.

### Dopamine hci [^114y9XEF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In more seriously ill patients, begin infusion of diluted solution at doses of 5 mcg/kg/min of Dopamine Hydrochloride and increase gradually using 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min increments up to a rate of 20 to 50 mcg/kg/min as needed. If doses in excess of 50 mcg/kg/min are required, it is advisable to check urine output frequently. Should urinary flow begin to decrease in the absence of hypotension, reduction of dopamine dosage should be considered. Multiclinic trials have shown that more than 50 percent of patients have been satisfactorily maintained on doses less than 20 mcg/kg/min.

In patients who do not respond to these doses with adequate arterial pressures or urine flow, additional increments of dopamine may be given in an effort to produce an appropriate arterial pressure and central perfusion.

3. Treatment of all patients requires constant evaluation of therapy in terms of blood volume, augmentation of cardiac contractility, and distribution of peripheral perfusion.

Dosage of dopamine should be adjusted according to the patient's response, with particular attention to diminution of established urine flow rate, increasing tachycardia or development of new dysrhythmias as indices for decreasing or temporarily suspending the dosage.

4. As with all potent intravenously administered drugs, care should be taken to control the rate of administration to avoid inadvertent administration of a bolus of the drug.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### The choice of catecholamines in septic shock: more and more good arguments to strengthen the known position, but don't lose the faith! [^114muArx]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The choice of catecholamines for hemodynamic stabilisation in septic shock patients has been an ongoing debate for several years. Several studies have investigated the regional effects in septic patients. Because of an often very small sample size, because of inconsistent results and because of methodical problems in the monitoring techniques used in these studies, however, it is not possible to provide clear recommendations concerning the use of catecholamines in sepsis. Prospective and adequate-sized studies are necessary because outcome data are completely lacking.

### Dopamine use and its consequences in the intensive care unit: a cohort study utilizing the Japanese intensive care PAtient database [^111GTLKz]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

While most previous studies of dopamine use focused on patients with septic shock, a recently conducted systematic review and meta-analysis with 17 trials by Hiemstra et al. included only patients with cardiac dysfunction, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction < 45%. As opposed to previous studies of patients with septic shock, the work by Hiemstra et al. did not show a significant association between dopamine use and mortality. In the patient population in the present study which consisted mostly of post-cardiac surgery patients possibly with some cardiac dysfunction, a higher mortality along with a higher dopamine dose was suggested in contrast to results in the work by Hiemstra et al. This difference could partially be explained by a difference in the dosage of dopamine used in the studies. In the cohort in the present study, only a dopamine dose more than 5 μg/kg/min was associated with higher mortality in a dose-dependent manner, while the dose range studied in Hiemstra's work was less than in the present study (low dose: 4 μg/kg/min, moderate dose: 4–10 μg/kg/min).

Catecholamine type and doses recommended for vasoplegia in patients after cardiopulmonary bypass are not well established, though vasoplegic shock or vasoplegic syndrome is not uncommon in patients after cardiac surgery (9–44%). In a systematic review that assessed catecholamine use after cardiac surgery in 2007, dopamine use was neither recommended nor discouraged due to a lack of evidence. A recently published consensus statement for the use of vasopressor therapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery from Europe strongly recommends against dopamine administration for treating vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery with an agreement of 100%. Although there were no randomized controlled trials which included this specific patient population in our extensive literature search, previous studies did not support dopamine use as the treatment of choice in patients after cardiopulmonary bypass. Considering the results in the existing literature and the results of the present study showing deleterious effects of dopamine, dopamine should not be used to treat patients after cardiac surgery or in patients with sepsis. Combined efforts at the individual level and at the facility / society level are needed to optimize dopamine use in clinical practice.

### Meta-analysis on the effect of dopexamine on in-hospital mortality [^112yV9dR]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether dopexamine alters in-hospital mortality. The following databases were searched, Embase (1974-July 2007), Medline (1950-July 2007), CINAHL, PubMed and Cochrane Clinical Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently checked the quality of the studies and extracted data. Six randomised controlled trials totalling 935 patients were included. Mortality was not significantly different with dopexamine treatment (relative risk 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.48–1.18, p = 0.22). In conclusion, dopexamine does not improve in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and in the critically ill.

### Acute kidney injury [^111JW9Dd]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute renal failure is characterised by abrupt and sustained decline in glomerular filtration rate, which leads to accumulation of urea and other chemicals in the blood. The term acute kidney injury has been introduced to encompass a wide spectrum of acute alterations in kidney function from mild to severe. Acute kidney injury is classified according to the RIFLE criteria, in which a change from baseline serum creatinine or urine output determines the level of renal dysfunction.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent acute kidney injury in people at high risk? What are the effects of treatments for critically ill people with acute kidney injury? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 82 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: albumin supplementation plus loop diuretics (intravenous), aminoglycosides, aminophylline, amphotericin B, calcium channel blockers, contrast media, dialysis membranes, dopamine, early versus late dialysis, extended daily dialysis, fenoldopam, loop diuretics, mannitol, N-acetylcysteine, natriuretic peptides, renal replacement therapy, sodium bicarbonate-based fluids, sodium chloride-based fluids, and theophylline.

Pediatric septic shock — comparative evidence for vasoactive agents: Two trials in children with fluid-RSS showed that epinephrine was "associated with a lower risk of mortality (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40–0.99) and more organ failure-free days among survivors by day 28 (MD 4 more days; 95% CI, 2.0–6.0)". Norepinephrine has not been studied in children with septic shock, and in a trial versus saline in sedated, mechanically ventilated children, "mortality was not different between groups (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.10–2.43)" but urine output and blood pressure were higher with norepinephrine (p = 0.016; p = 0.04). Adult trials show "a lower mortality rate (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86–1.00) and lower incidence of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) with norepinephrine than with dopamine", and "no difference in mortality with epinephrine than with norepinephrine (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77–1.21)". The panel concludes "Evidence is insufficient to recommend either epinephrine or norepinephrine as the initial vasoactive agent for children with fluid-RSS", and cautions that "No pediatric data identify when shock becomes 'fluid-refractory'… However, excessive fluid resuscitation can lead to fluid overload, which has been associated with increased mortality in critically ill children (226)".

### Prevention of acute kidney injury and protection of renal function in the intensive care unit: update 2017: expert opinion of the working group on prevention, AKI section, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^111QKcsh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale for choice of vasopressor

Norepinephrine is the most commonly used vasopressor in patients with vasodilatory shock. A large RCT comparing dopamine to norepinephrine as initial vasopressor in patients with shock found no difference in mortality between randomised groups. However, norepinephrine was associated with less tachycardia in the first hours and was superior regarding survival in cardiogenic shock patients. In addition, there was a trend towards more RRT-free days through day 28 in the norepinephrine group.

Vasopressin or the analogue terlipressin may have a role in the treatment of norepinephrine-refractory shock. Exogenous vasopressin has vasoconstrictive and antidiuretic properties and may increase glomerular filtration by preferential post-glomerular vasoconstriction. In the largest RCT in septic shock (VASST trial), vasopressin reduced mortality in the subgroup with less severe shock, but not in the entire population. There were no differences in RRT-free days. However, in a secondary analysis, a reduced progression to higher stages of AKI could be demonstrated in the subgroup of patients with AKI stage 1 at baseline. In a subsequent 2 × 2 RCT in 409 patients with early septic shock (VANISH trial), the use of vasopressin compared to norepinephrine did not affect the proportion of patients who never developed AKI stage 3 (57% vs. 59.2%), the number of AKI stage 3-free days [difference −4 (−11 to 5)] or the incidence of AKI stage 3 [difference −5.1% (−15.2 to 5.0)]. The use of vasopressin reduced the need for RRT (difference −9.9% (−19.3 to −0.6), but only in non-survivors. A recent single-centre RCT in 300 patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery compared noradrenalin to vasopressin as first-choice vasopressor. The use of vasopressin was associated with less acute renal failure (10.3% vs. 35.8%, p < 0.0001) and less RRT (2.7% vs. 13.9%, p = 0.0016). This trial, however, had some design issues (e.g. change in primary outcome during the study) and requires confirmation. The studies are summarized in ESM_2 Table S5.

### Acute renal failure in hospitalized patients: part II [^111Gnp3X]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common condition in hospitalized patients. Research has been unable to identify the optimal target for therapeutic intervention; hence, effective prevention of and/or treatment for ARF remain elusive.

Objective

To examine the usefulness of current and potential pharmacologic treatments in seriously ill, hospitalized patients.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-June 2002) was conducted using the search terms kidney (drug effects) and acute kidney failure (drug therapy). Bibliographies of selected articles were also examined to include all relevant investigations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, meta-analyses, and clinical trials describing prevention of and treatment for hospital-acquired ARF were identified. Results from prospective, controlled trials were given priority when available.

Conclusions

Appropriate management of ARF includes prospective identification of at-risk patients, fluid administration, and optimal hemodynamic support. Drug treatments, including low-dose dopamine and diuretics, have demonstrated extremely limited benefits and have not been shown to improve patient outcome. Experimental agents influence cellular processes of renal dysfunction and recovery; unfortunately, relatively few drugs show promise for the future.

### Dopamine hci [^117X4dnT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Indications and Usage

Dopamine HCl is indicated for the correction of hemodynamic imbalances present in the shock syndrome due to myocardial infarction, trauma, endotoxic septicemia, open-heart surgery, renal failure, and chronic cardiac decompensation as in congestive failure.

Patients most likely to respond adequately to dopamine HCl are those in whom physiological parameters, such as urine flow, myocardial function, and blood pressure, have not undergone profound deterioration. Multiclinic trials indicate that the shorter the time interval between onset of signs and symptoms and initiation of therapy with blood volume correction and dopamine HCl, the better the prognosis. Where appropriate, blood volume restoration with a suitable plasma expander or whole blood should be accomplished prior to administration of dopamine HCl.

Poor Perfusion of Vital Organs – Urine flow appears to be one of the better diagnostic signs by which adequacy of vital organ perfusion can be monitored. Nevertheless, the physician should also observe the patient for signs of reversal of confusion or reversal of comatose condition. Loss of pallor, increase in toe temperature, and/or adequacy of nail bed capillary filling may also be used as indices of adequate dosage. Clinical studies have shown that when dopamine HCl is administered before urine flow has diminished to levels of approximately 0.3 mL/minute, prognosis is more favorable. Nevertheless, in a number of oliguric or anuric patients, administration of dopamine HCl has resulted in an increase in urine flow, which in some cases reached normal levels. Dopamine HCl may also increase urine flow in patients whose output is within normal limits and thus may be of value in reducing the degree of pre-existing fluid accumulation. It should be noted that at doses above those optimal for the individual patient, urine flow may decrease, necessitating reduction of dosage.

### Efficacy of bromocriptine for fever reduction in acute neurologic injury (BFF) [^111CHTWm]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Efficacy of Bromocriptine For Fever Reduction in Acute Neurologic Injury ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview In patients with acute neurologic injury such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, subdural hematoma, and ischemic stroke, fever has been found to be an independent predictor of poor outcome including increased mortality rates, longer hospital stays, depressed level of consciousness, and worse functional outcomes. Fevers of both central and infectious etiologies must be regulated through the hypothalamus and we have evidence that bromocriptine has an antipyretic effect at the hypothalamus; thus, we hypothesize that bromocriptine could be used safely and more broadly to treat all fevers in the acute setting and not just refractory central fevers in this patient population.

Here, we propose to evaluate the acute antipyretic effects of bromocriptine in this critically-ill population through a pilot, open label, blinded endpoint, randomized controlled trial. In both enrolling centers, University of California, San Francisco Medical Center Parnassus and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, every patient who is admitted to the neurointensive care unit for an anticipated stay of greater than 48 hours with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, subdural hematoma, and ischemic stroke will be screened and consented. If they have a temperature reading ≥ 38. 3 ºC, the investigational pharmacy will randomize them to the control arm of acetaminophen or the intervention arm of acetaminophen and bromocriptine for 48 hours. We will continuously measure their temperature and other vitals data.

Retrospectively, we will review imaging and labs ordered to work up infectious etiologies of fever. The ICU nurse will do a 5 minute assessment every shift during the 48 hour study period for side effects. The temperature data will be analyzed between the two study arms.
- anticipated ICU stay < 48 hours'
- creatinine clearance ≤ 30
- severe cardiovascular disease
- patients already taking bromocriptine for other indications.

### Dopamine for cardiogenic shock… [^113rxQZv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Dopamine is a naturally occurring catecholamine that has been employed both experimentally and clinically for the therapy of various forms of shock. Dopamine possesses a variety of useful pharmacologic properties. It functions as an a-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction of peripheral capacitance and resistance vessels; it also is a β-adrenergic agonist, producing an increase in cardiac rate and an augmentation of myocardial contractility. In these respects, dopamine is not different from norepinephrine. However, dopamine possesses another property that is unique: it dilates renal and mesenteric vascular beds directly. Recent evidence indicates that dopamine inhibits renal tubular reabsorption of sodium. Thus, dopamine can be used to increase systemic arterial pressure by stimulating the myocardium, without compromising renal blood flow and urine output.

Although dopamine, like other pressor agents, has been utilized in a variety of forms of shock, its most successful application has been in patients with cardiogenic shock. Karliner JS. Dopamine for Cardiogenic Shock. JAMA. 1973; 226: 1217–1218.

### The role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression… [^114T8zf9]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Multiple sources of evidence support a role for diminished dopaminergic neurotransmission in major depression. The physiological alterations underlying reduced dopamine signaling could result from either diminished DA release from presynaptic neurons or impaired signal transduction, either due to changes in receptor number or function and/or altered intracellular signal processing. There are data supporting each of these mechanisms, although interpretation of previous research is confounded by issues around study population, medication status, and technological limitations. In some patients with depression, DA-related disturbances improve by treatment with antidepressants, presumably by acting on serotonergic or noradrenergic circuits, which then affect DA function. However, most antidepressant treatments do not directly enhance DA neurotransmission, which may contribute to residual symptoms, including impaired motivation, concentration, and pleasure.

Animal models of major depression show considerable responsiveness to manipulations of DA neurotransmission. Several studies, including postmortem investigations, particularly of subjects with severe depression, have demonstrated reduced concentrations of DA metabolites both in the cerebrospinal fluid and in brain regions that mediate mood and motivation. Although the neuroimaging findings are not unequivocal, several studies support the hypothesis that major depression is associated with a state of reduced DA transmission, possibly reflected by a compensatory up-regulation of D2 receptors. These alterations in DA signaling may underlie the findings of increased "liking" or "high" feelings reported by severely depressed subjects treated with d-amphetamine compared with the response of less severely ill and normal control subjects.

The efficacy of medications that directly act on DA neurons or receptors, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and pramipexole, suggests that subtypes of depression stemming from a primary DA dysfunction exist. Further research on the contribution of DA to the pathophysiology of depression is justified to improve outcomes for patients with treatment-resistant and nonremitting depression.
