Trichomonias

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about trichomoniasis management, including diagnosis, treatment by population, partner management, follow-up, special scenarios, and a concise algorithmic summary. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and clinical significance to frame risk and outcomes. Then, I should verify diagnostic strategies and their performance. Next, I will review first-line treatment regimens for women, men, and people with HIV, and I need to check alternatives and resistance considerations. After that, I should confirm partner management and follow-up testing. Finally, I will examine special populations such as pregnancy, pediatrics, and nitroimidazole allergy, and close with a practical algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with an estimated 3.7 million cases, and it is associated with increased HIV acquisition risk, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, so I need to ensure my approach addresses both individual cure and public health impact [^115ySUBf].

> I need to check the diagnostic strategy next. Wet mount microscopy is insensitive, so I should prefer nucleic acid amplification testing for women and consider NAATs for men when available; NAATs have high sensitivity and specificity and can be performed on vaginal swabs or urine, which improves detection and facilitates screening in high-prevalence settings [^113o3hG8] [^111VNU6f]. Wait, let me verify the role of culture; culture remains useful, particularly for test-of-cure in persistent cases, but NAAT is generally more sensitive for initial diagnosis, so I should align the test choice with the clinical question and timing [^111VNU6f].

> Now, treatment for women. Hold on, I should verify the current first-line regimen. The 2021 CDC guidelines recommend metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as preferred therapy for women, based on randomized data showing lower failure rates compared with single-dose therapy, and this is echoed by ACOG guidance and supported by a multicenter RCT showing a relative risk of persistent infection of 0.55 with the 7-day regimen versus 2 g once [^11488KRC] [^116dDgG9] [^113hTRS5]. Let me consider alternatives; tinidazole 2 g orally once is an acceptable alternative with favorable pharmacokinetics and tolerability, and secnidazole 2 g orally once has FDA approval for trichomoniasis with high cure rates in trials, though long-term comparative data are still maturing [^115CqZg1] [^117HEbba].

> For men, I should confirm the regimen. The CDC recommends metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose as first-line therapy for men, with tinidazole 2 g orally once as an alternative; I initially thought the 7-day regimen might be preferred across sexes, but wait, that applies to women, not men, so I should correct that and keep the single-dose approach for men [^113o9tb4] [^115CqZg1].

> For women with HIV, I need to ensure I am using the multidose regimen. The CDC recommends metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days for women with HIV because single-dose therapy is less effective in this population, and this is supported by randomized data and expert reviews highlighting immunologic and vaginal ecology factors that impair single-dose efficacy [^115zacrg] [^111pzv5p] [^115rNFKj].

> Next, I should review partner management because reinfection risk is high. Current partners should be presumptively treated and counseled to abstain from sex until both parties complete therapy and symptoms resolve; expedited partner therapy is permissible in jurisdictions where legal, though evidence is mixed on superiority for trichomoniasis, so I should prioritize partner referral and treatment when feasible [^113hJ877] [^116fByuJ].

> I will now examine follow-up and retesting. Because reinfection is common, all sexually active women should be retested at 3 months; if 3-month retesting is not possible, retest at the next healthcare encounter within 12 months, and use NAAT or culture for retesting, keeping in mind that NAAT within 3 weeks of treatment may detect nonviable nucleic acid and yield false positives [^1131F4wt] [^113K6nSx]. Hold on, I should verify whether men need routine retesting; data are insufficient to support routine retesting in men, so I will individualize follow-up for men based on symptoms and exposure [^1131F4wt].

> Let me consider pregnancy carefully. I should confirm that symptomatic pregnant women should be treated regardless of gestational age, as metronidazole is considered safe in pregnancy and treatment alleviates symptoms and may reduce transmission; however, routine screening of asymptomatic pregnant women is not recommended because evidence does not show improved preterm birth outcomes with treatment of asymptomatic infection, and one RCT of an atypical multidose regimen suggested harm, which I should not overgeneralize but must acknowledge [^111p45Wk] [^114W7nMU]. I need to ensure I avoid tinidazole in pregnancy due to limited safety data and counsel on breastfeeding considerations after metronidazole, where temporary deferral may be considered but overall risk appears low [^111p45Wk].

> For persistent or recurrent infection, I should double-check the approach. First, distinguish reinfection from treatment failure by ensuring partner treatment and adherence, then consider culture-based confirmation and management with high-dose tinidazole regimens, including combination intravaginal therapy for suspected resistance; in vitro resistance to 5-nitroimidazoles is uncommon but present, and tinidazole often retains activity when metronidazole fails [^115rNFKj] [^111yviKD].

> But wait, what if the patient has a nitroimidazole allergy. I should confirm that desensitization is the guideline-supported pathway because alternatives lack robust evidence; if desensitization is not feasible, some experts consider intravaginal paromomycin, recognizing this is off-label and lower quality evidence, so shared decision-making is essential [^115rNFKj].

> I need to ensure I address adolescents and extragenital sites appropriately. Adolescents have high burdens and benefit from sensitive diagnostics and partner services; extragenital T. vaginalis is rare and testing is not routinely recommended, so I should avoid overtesting outside the genital tract unless there is a compelling clinical scenario [^115DBZBV].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. Diagnose with NAAT when available, treat women with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or tinidazole 2 g once, treat men with metronidazole 2 g once or tinidazole 2 g once, ensure partner treatment and sexual abstinence until completion and symptom resolution, retest all women at 3 months, and manage recurrences with culture-based confirmation and high-dose tinidazole strategies while evaluating for resistance and adherence [^11488KRC] [^113o9tb4] [^113hJ877] [^1131F4wt].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check this conclusion against the highest-quality sources: the 7-day metronidazole regimen is preferred for women because it halves the risk of persistent infection compared with single-dose therapy, whereas men should receive single-dose therapy; partner treatment and 3-month retesting for women are critical to reduce reinfection and close the loop on care [^113hTRS5] [^11488KRC] [^113hJ877].

Trichomoniasis is a common, curable STI caused by **Trichomonas vaginalis** [^111VNU6f], with women often asymptomatic or presenting with discharge, irritation, and dysuria, and men typically asymptomatic or with urethritis/prostatitis [^114yCFTN]. Diagnosis relies on **NAATs** [^113o3hG8] for highest sensitivity; wet mount and rapid antigen tests are less sensitive but useful when NAAT is unavailable [^114zbpmT]. First-line treatment is **metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** for women [^11488KRC], including women with HIV [^111pzv5p]; men should receive **metronidazole 2 g orally once** [^113o9tb4]. Tinidazole 2 g orally once is an alternative [^115CqZg1]; secnidazole 2 g orally once is FDA-approved for women [^117HEbba] and effective in trials [^1161tjAD]. All sexual partners must be treated concurrently [^113hJ877], and abstinence is advised until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve [^1131F4wt]. Retesting is recommended at 3 months [^113K6nSx] due to high reinfection rates [^1131F4wt]. Trichomoniasis increases HIV risk [^1127tHr6] and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes; symptomatic pregnant women should be treated [^111p45Wk], and tinidazole should be avoided in pregnancy [^111p45Wk].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Trichomoniasis is the **most common nonviral STI globally** [^113o3hG8], with ~3.7 million cases in the US [^111VNU6f] and ~156 million worldwide [^notfound]. Prevalence is highest among women, African Americans, older adults, and people with multiple partners or low socioeconomic status [^111VNU6f] [^111yviKD] [^1178xa4D] [^115DBZBV]. It is often asymptomatic [^113o3hG8], facilitating transmission and persistence [^114yCFTN].

---

## Clinical manifestations

### Women

In women, **asymptomatic infection is common** (up to 50%) [^notfound]. When symptomatic, features include yellow-green, frothy discharge with odor, vulvovaginal irritation, pruritus, dysuria, and dyspareunia. Complications include increased HIV risk [^1127tHr6], pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight) [^11746SG2].

---

### Men

In men, **most infections are asymptomatic** [^114yCFTN]. When symptomatic, features include urethritis, prostatitis, epididymitis, and discharge. Complications include increased HIV risk [^114yCFTN], reduced fertility, and chronic infection [^114yCFTN].

---

## Diagnosis

| **Diagnostic method** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Wet mount microscopy | 52–78% | High | Rapid, inexpensive, operator-dependent [^115UvqQJ] |
| Culture (InPouch) | 78–94% | High | Gold standard for test-of-cure [^116rdH4q] |
| NAAT | 86–100% | 97–100% | Highly sensitive, FDA-cleared [^113o3hG8] |
| Rapid antigen tests | 83–88% | 99% | Point-of-care, moderate sensitivity [^notfound] |

---

NAATs are the **preferred diagnostic method** [^112C9UWw] due to high sensitivity and specificity; wet mount and rapid antigen tests are useful when NAAT is unavailable [^1141vjkb].

---

## Treatment

### First-line regimens

- **Women**: Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^11488KRC] (preferred) [^113hTRS5]; metronidazole 2 g orally once is an alternative [^113GQ4Qd].
- **Men**: Metronidazole 2 g orally once [^113o9tb4].
- **Alternative**: Tinidazole 2 g orally once [^115CqZg1].

---

### Special populations

In people with HIV, **women should receive metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** [^111pzv5p]; men should receive metronidazole 2 g orally once [^113o9tb4]. In pregnancy, symptomatic women should be treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^115PQwis]; tinidazole should be avoided [^111p45Wk].

---

### Emerging therapies

Secnidazole 2 g orally once is **FDA-approved for women** [^117HEbba] and achieved 92–100% cure rates in trials [^117HEbba].

---

## Partner management

Partners should be treated presumptively (**expedited partner therapy** where legal) [^113hJ877] to prevent reinfection [^113hJ877]. Patients and partners should abstain from sex until treatment is complete and symptoms resolve [^1131F4wt].

---

## Follow-up and recurrence

Retesting is recommended at **3 months** [^113K6nSx] for all women due to high reinfection rates [^1131F4wt]. Recurrence is common and often due to reinfection or nonadherence; persistent infection may indicate resistance or immunosuppression [^113hJ877].

---

## Public health implications

Trichomoniasis increases **HIV acquisition risk** [^1127tHr6] and is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes [^111VNU6f]. Screening and treatment reduce transmission and complications, especially in high-prevalence settings [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Condom use**: Consistent condom use reduces transmission [^111p45Wk].
- **Partner treatment**: Treat all partners to prevent reinfection [^113hJ877].
- **Screening**: Consider screening high-risk populations (e.g. women with HIV, STD clinic attendees) [^111pzv5p] [^115DBZBV].

---

Trichomoniasis is a prevalent, often asymptomatic STI with significant health consequences. Accurate diagnosis with **NAATs** [^113o3hG8] and appropriate treatment — including partner management and retesting — are essential to reduce transmission and complications [^1131F4wt].

### Single-dose versus 7-day-dose metronidazole for the treatment of trichomoniasis in women: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113hTRS5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Among women, trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide, and is associated with serious reproductive morbidity, poor birth outcomes, and amplified HIV transmission. Single-dose metronidazole is the first-line treatment for trichomoniasis. However, bacterial vaginosis can alter treatment efficacy in HIV-infected women, and single-dose metronidazole treatment might not always clear infection. We compared single-dose metronidazole with a 7-day dose for the treatment of trichomoniasis among HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant women and tested whether efficacy was modified by bacterial vaginosis.

Methods

In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, participants were recruited at three sexual health clinics in the United States. We included women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis infection according to clinical screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single dose of 2 g of metronidazole (single-dose group) or 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 7 days (7-day-dose group). The randomisation was done by blocks of four or six for each site. Patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome was T vaginalis infection by intention to treat, at test-of-cure 4 weeks after completion of treatment. The analysis of the primary outcome per nucleic acid amplification test or culture was also stratified by bacterial vaginosis status. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01018095, and with the US Food and Drug Administration, number IND118276, and is closed to accrual.

Findings

Participants were recruited from Oct 6, 2014, to April 26, 2017. Of the 1028 patients assessed for eligibility, 623 women were randomly assigned to treatment groups (311 women in the single-dose group and 312 women in the 7-day-dose group; intention-to-treat population). Although planned enrolment had been 1664 women, the study was stopped early because of funding limitations. Patients in the 7-day-dose group were less likely to be T vaginalis positive at test-of-cure than those in the single-dose group (34 [11%] of 312 vs 58 [19%] of 311, relative risk 0.55, 95% CI 0.34–0.70; p < 0.0001). Bacterial vaginosis status had no significant effect on relative risk (p = 0.17). Self-reported adherence was 96% in the 7-day-dose group and 99% in the single-dose group. Side-effects were similar by group; the most common side-effect was nausea (124 [23%]), followed by headache (38 [7%]) and vomiting (19 [4%]).

Interpretation

The 7-day-dose metronidazole should be the preferred treatment for trichomoniasis among women.

### Interventions for treating trichomoniasis in women [^112Rt95t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Around 120 million women worldwide suffer from Trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis every year. The infection is sexually transmitted and is believed to facilitate HIV transmission.

Objectives

To assess the effects of various treatment strategies for trichomoniasis in women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Trials were also identified from reference lists of reviews, through pharmaceutical companies, and by informal discovery. Only published data were used in this review. Date of the most recent search: November, 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of different treatment strategies in women with trichomoniasis. Different antitrichomonal drugs or doses were eligible, as were comparisons of treatment with no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data extracted by two reviewers independently using standard criteria.

Main Results

Fifty-four trials were included. Nitroimidazole drugs seem to be effective in achieving parasitological cure in short term follow up. Partner treatment can be effective in decreasing longer term reinfection rates.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Parasitological cure can be achieved by single oral dose of nitroimidazole. Further research should focus on developing effective partner treatment strategies to prevent reinfections and reduce trichomoniasis prevalence.

### Interventions for trichomoniasis in pregnancy [^113qTjAk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginitis due to Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common of sexually transmitted diseases. Trichomoniasis affects women during pregnancy as well but it is not clearly established whether it causes preterm birth and other pregnancy complications.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of various treatments for trichomoniasis during pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 January 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing anti-trichomonas agents during pregnancy. Trials including symptomatic or asymptomatic women with trichomoniasis were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

We included two trials with 842 pregnant women. In both trials around 90% of women were cleared of trichomonas in the vagina after treatment. In the US trial, women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis between 16 and 23 weeks were treated with metronidazole on two occasions at least two weeks apart. The trial was stopped before reaching its target recruitment because metronidazole was not effective in reducing preterm birth and there was a likelihood of harm (risk ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.66). The South African trial recruited women later in pregnancy and did not have the design and power to address adverse clinical outcomes. We excluded two recent studies, identified for the current update, because they did not address the primary question.

Authors' Conclusions

Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of trichomonas vaginalis: summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^111VNU6f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is likely the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of trichomoniasis, as African Americans are > 4 times more likely to be infected than persons of other races. Since publication of the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, additional data have bolstered the importance of T. vaginalis infection sequelae in women, including increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, cervical cancer, preterm birth, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Less is known about the clinical significance of infection in men. Newly available diagnostic methods, including point-of-care assays and multiple nucleic acid amplification tests, can be performed on a variety of genital specimens in women and men, including urine, allowing more accurate and convenient testing and screening of those at risk for infection. Repeat and persistent infections are common in women; thus, rescreening at 3 months after treatment is recommended. In vitro antibiotic resistance to 5-nitroimidazole in T. vaginalis remains low (4.3%) but should be monitored. High rates of T. vaginalis among sexual partners of infected persons suggest a role for expedited partner treatment. A randomized controlled trial in HIV-uninfected women demonstrated that multidose metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days reduced the proportion of women with Trichomonas infection at 1 month test of cure compared with women receiving single-dose therapy (2 g). The 2-g single-dose oral metronidazole regimen remains the preferred treatment in men.

### Neglected parasitic infections in the United States: trichomoniasis [^115UA28j]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common human parasitic infections in the United States, as well as the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infection. However, it has long received much less consideration than other parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases. Much of this inattention can be attributed to a poor understanding of the public health impact of trichomoniasis. Increasing recognition of the sequelae of infection, including increased risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus and adverse outcomes of pregnancy, has led to increased interest in T. vaginalis. Recent innovations include development of diagnostic tests that could improve detection of the parasite. A number of important questions, such as the epidemiology among men and women, the true public health burden of symptomatic and asymptomatic T. vaginalis infections, and whether current treatments will be adequate to reduce the substantial health disparities and costs associated with trichomoniasis, need consideration to remedy neglect of this important disease.

### Trichomoniasis [^115EDyn7]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Trichomoniasis is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection worldwide. It has been associated with a variety of adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes for both men and women. In this review, the authors discuss updates in its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical significance, diagnosis, and treatment.

### A review of evidence-based care of symptomatic trichomoniasis and asymptomatic trichomonas vaginalis infections [^1178xa4D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of this infection, which affects 11% of women aged ≥ 40 years and a disproportionately high percentage of black women. Particularly high prevalences have been identified among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic patients and incarcerated individuals. This article reviews and updates scientific evidence in key topic areas used for the development of the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Current evidence is presented regarding conditions associated with Trichomonas vaginalis infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Nucleic acid amplification tests and point-of-care tests are newly available diagnostic methods that can be conducted on a variety of specimens, potentially allowing highly sensitive testing and screening of both women and men at risk for infection. Usually, trichomoniasis can be cured with single-dose therapy of an appropriate nitroimidazole antibiotic, but women who are also infected with HIV should receive therapy for 7 days. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern.

### Trichomoniasis: challenges to appropriate management [^111FME8R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is a common cause of vaginal irritation in women and is the most common nonviral sexually transmitted disease in the world. It has been associated with serious sequelae, the most notable of which are prematurity, low birth weight, and increases in human immunodeficiency virus transmission. We review advances in diagnosis and treatment and the current controversies regarding management.

### Trichomoniasis: clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management [^115ySUBf]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis was originally considered a commensal organism until the 1950s when the understanding of its role as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) began to evolve. Trichomoniasis has been associated with vaginitis, cervicitis, urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and adverse birth outcomes. Infection with T vaginalis could have an important role in transmission and acquisition of HIV. T vaginalis is site specific for the genitourinary tract and has been isolated from virtually all genitourinary structures. Asymptomatic disease is common in both men and women, thus screening for disease is important. Various sociodemographic factors have been correlated with presence of T vaginalis, and may be used to predict infection. Diagnosis is usually made from wet mount microscopy and direct visualisation, which are insensitive. DNA amplification techniques perform with good sensitivity, but are not yet approved for diagnostic purposes. In areas where diagnostic methods are limited, management of trichomoniasis is usually as part of a clinical syndrome; vaginal discharge for women and urethral discharge for men. A single dose of metronidazole is effective in the majority of cases. Outside of the United States, other nitroimidazoles may be used and are as effective as metronidazole. Metronidazole resistance is an emerging problem, but its clinical importance is not yet clear. Concomitant treatment of sexual partners is recommended.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^116fByuJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for trichomonas vaginalis infection, more specifically with respect to management of sexual partners, ACOG 2020 guidelines recommend to refer current sex partners of patients with trichomoniasis for presumptive therapy and counsel to refrain from sexual activity until completion of therapy and becoming asymptomatic.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1131F4wt]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection and might reduce transmission. Treatment recommendations for women are based on a meta-analysis and a multicenter, randomized trial of mostly symptomatic women without HIV infection. The study demonstrated that multidose metronidazole (500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days) reduced the proportion of women retesting positive at a 1-month test of cure visit by half, compared with women who received the 2-g single dose. No published randomized trials are available that compare these doses among men.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Women
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
Recommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Men
Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose
Alternative Regimen for Women and Men
Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with clinically demonstrated efficacy against T. vaginalis infections. Tinidazole is usually more expensive, reaches higher levels in serum and the genitourinary tract, has a longer half-life than metronidazole (12.5 hours versus 7.3 hours), and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects. In randomized clinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98%, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 92%–100%. Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom resolution.

Metronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the urethra and perivaginal glands. Because it is less efficacious than oral metronidazole, it is not recommended.

Other Management Considerations

Providers should advise persons with T. vaginalis infections to abstain from sex until they and their sex partners are treated (i.e. when therapy has been completed and any symptoms have resolved). Testing for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, should be performed for persons with T. vaginalis.

Follow-Up

Because of the high rate of reinfection among women treated for trichomoniasis, retesting for T. vaginalis is recommended for all sexually active women < 3 months after initial treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment. Data are insufficient to support retesting men after treatment.

### Epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of trichomonas vaginalis in men [^114yCFTN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infections in men are traditionally considered to be benign and consequently have been overlooked. However, men with this common sexually transmitted infection can experience urethritis, prostatitis, reduced fertility, and amplified human immunodeficiency virus risk. In addition, men are often asymptomatic and can unknowingly spread the infection to their female sexual partners. With advances in T. vaginalis diagnostics, more men are being diagnosed, yet the optimal method of treatment in men remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to discuss the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of T. vaginalis among men.

### And HIV infection acquisition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127tHr6]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

T. vaginalis may be used as a biological marker for enhanced risk for HIV acquisition for both high-risk and moderate-risk women. T. vaginalis may be an important factor in HIV acquisition especially in sSA where the prevalence of both T. vaginalis and HIV is high, and this systematic review and meta-analysis provides consolidated evidence that infection with T. vaginalis augments HIV acquisition. Diagnosis and treatment of T. vaginalis in both individuals at high risk and low risk for HIV may perhaps be a potential tool to reduce new HIV infections.

Additional references can be found in the online supplementary file 2.

Key messages

Trichomoniasis augments the likelihood of HIV acquisition by 50%.
Trichomoniasis may be an important factor in HIV acquisition especially in sub-Saharan Africa where the prevalence of both are high.
Screening and treatment of trichomoniasis may be a potential means of curbing new HIV infections among women with high-risk or moderate-risk behaviour.

### Trichomoniasis: the "neglected" sexually transmitted disease [^112rvjLv]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million people in the United States. Although trichomoniasis is common, it has been considered a "neglected" sexually transmitted disease, due to limited knowledge of its sequelae and associated costs. This article reviews current epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic methods, clinical management recommendations and special considerations, research on associated conditions and costs, prevention strategies, and controversies regarding trichomoniasis.

### Modern diagnosis of trichomonas vaginalis infection [^114zbpmT]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

Recent advances in tests for the sexually transmitted protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis have increased opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of this important sexually transmitted infection. This review summarises currently available tests, highlighting their performance characteristics, advantages and limitations. The recent development of molecular tests for the detection of T vaginalis, including rapid antigen detection and nucleic acid amplification tests, has significantly improved the quality of diagnostics for trichomoniasis, particularly in women. In light of the expanded menu of testing options now available, improved recognition and better control of trichomoniasis are in sight, which should enable the eventual reduction of adverse reproductive consequences associated with T vaginalis infection.

HIV Infection

Up to 53% of women with HIV have T. vaginalis infection. T. vaginalis infection among these women is substantially associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Among women who are not virally suppressed, treatment of trichomoniasis is associated with decreases in genital tract HIV viral load and viral shedding; however, no difference might occur among women who are virally suppressed. Because of the high prevalence of T. vaginalis among women with HIV and the potential for adverse reproductive health, poor birth outcomes, and possibly amplified HIV transmission, routine screening and prompt treatment are recommended for all women with HIV infection; screening should occur at entry to care and then at least annually thereafter.

A randomized clinical trial involving women with HIV and T. vaginalis infection demonstrated that a single dose of metronidazole 2 g orally was less effective than 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. Factors that might interfere with standard single-dose treatment for trichomoniasis among women with HIV include high rates of asymptomatic BV infection, ART use, changes in vaginal ecology, and impaired immunity. Thus, to improve cure rates, women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection should be treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. For pregnant women with HIV, screening at the first prenatal visit and prompt treatment, as needed, are recommended because T. vaginalis infection is a risk factor for vertical transmission of HIV.

Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection, cures infection, and might reduce transmission. Likelihood of adverse outcomes among women with HIV infection is also reduced with T. vaginalis therapy.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomonas and HIV Infection Among Women
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days

If a woman with HIV infection experiences treatment failure, the protocol outlined is recommended (see Recurrent Trichomonas). Other management considerations, follow-up, and management of sex partners should be performed as for women without HIV infection. Treatment of men with HIV infection should follow the same guidelines as for men without HIV.

For women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection, retesting is recommended 3 months after treatment; NAAT is encouraged because of higher sensitivity of these tests. Data are insufficient to support retesting of men with trichomonas and HIV infection.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole250 mg) [^111MG5xF]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis:

In the Female:

One-day treatment − two grams of metronidazole tablets, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses of one gram each, given in the same day.

Seven-day course of treatment − 250 mg three times daily for seven consecutive days. There is some indication from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment can assure compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen. A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In pregnant patients for whom alternative treatment has been inadequate, the one-day course of therapy should not be used, as it results in higher serum levels which can reach the fetal circulation (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 500 mg or 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours (approx. 500 mg for a 70-kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

### Update of trichomoniasis [^111GuYNL]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis remains an extremely common infection despite the fact that rates of other treatable sexually transmitted diseases are declining. Newer diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are documenting higher rates of infection in heterosexual men than have been previously found with culture. Although data on the association of vaginal trichomoniasis with preterm birth are controversial, the association of trichomoniasis with HIV acquisition seems clear. Despite being a readily diagnosed and treated STD, trichomoniasis is not a reportable infection and control of the infection has received relatively little emphasis from public health STD control programmes. More recently, however, appreciation of high rates of disease and of associations of trichomoniasis in women with adverse outcomes of pregnancy and increased risk for HIV infection suggest a need for increased control efforts.

Abstract

Background

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of secnidazole vs placebo in women with trichomoniasis.

Methods

Women with trichomoniasis, confirmed by a positive T. vaginalis culture, were randomized to single-dose oral secnidazole 2 g or placebo. The primary endpoint was microbiological test of cure (TOC) by culture 6–12 days after dosing. At the TOC visit, participants were given the opposite treatment. They were followed for resolution of infection afterward and offered treatment at subsequent visits, if needed. Fifty patients per group (N = 100) provided approximately 95% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups.

Results

Between April 2019 and March 2020, 147 women enrolled at 10 sites in the United States. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included 131 randomized patients (secnidazole, n = 64; placebo, n = 67). Cure rates were significantly higher in the secnidazole vs placebo group for the mITT population (92.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 82.7%–97.4%] vs 1.5% [95% CI:.0%–8.0%]) and for the per-protocol population (94.9% [95% CI: 85.9%–98.9%] vs 1.7% [95% CI:.0%–8.9%]). Cure rates were 100% (4/4) in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 95.2% (20/21) in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Secnidazole was generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were vulvovaginal candidiasis and nausea (each 2.7%). No serious TEAEs were observed.

Conclusions

A single oral 2 g dose of secnidazole was associated with significantly higher microbiological cure rates vs placebo, supporting a role for secnidazole in treating women with trichomoniasis, including those with HIV and/or BV.

METHODS

Study Design

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study received institutional review board approval (IntegReview, Austin, Texas; Western Institutional Review Board, Puyallup, Washington; Office of Human Research Ethics, Chapel Hill, North Carolina) for 10 clinical sites in the US (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03935217). It was designed and monitored in accordance with FDA recommendations and the sponsor's standard operating procedures, which comply with the International Conference on Harmonisation's Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent or parental/legal guardian consent (when appropriate) before engaging in study-related procedures.

In contrast to the FDA approval of tinidazole for trichomoniasis, which was based on a literature-focused New Drug Application submission, in this circumstance, the FDA required a single, placebo-controlled trial for the approval of SEC to treat trichomoniasis. To ensure patient safety, the investigators, in collaboration with the FDA, adopted a delayed-treatment study design, similar to FDA guidance on uncomplicated urinary tract infection studies. Because there is no evidence that a 1- to 2-week delay in treatment for trichomoniasis is associated with significant health risks, the study design was approved by both local (academic) and central institutional review boards. Out of an abundance of caution, the investigators agreed on a trial protocol that was more stringent than the current standard of care, which recommends retesting for T. vaginalis at 3 months. In the current trial, test of cure (TOC) was performed 6–12 days after treatment, with additional follow-up if needed to ensure successful treatment. In addition, the investigators counseled patients on the need for partner therapy and the importance of abstinence during the study to prevent reinfection.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole250 mg) [^111nrQW2]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole tablets in cases of reinfection.

### What have we learned about vaginal infections and preterm birth? [^1123uzGo]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic maternal genital tract infection during pregnancy, particularly bacterial vaginosis, has been consistently associated with preterm birth. In response to this evidence, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network (MFMU) designed and conducted 2 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis in a general obstetrical population. These studies showed that treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis failed to prevent preterm birth, regardless of their history of prior preterm birth. Metronidazole treatment of women with trichomoniasis significantly increased the risk of preterm birth compared to placebo. These results formed the basis of the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that screening for bacterial vaginosis not be undertaken in low-risk pregnant women, and show that MFMU network studies can have a direct and immediate impact on obstetrical practice.

### Trichomonas vaginalis genital infections: progress and challenges [^114hriDj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is the most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection in the United States and worldwide. Most TV infections are asymptomatic, and the accurate diagnosis of this infection has been limited by lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly for men. To provide updates for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted of all TV literature published from 9 January 2004 through 24 September 2008. Approximately 175 pertinent abstracts and articles were reviewed and discussed with national experts. This article describes advances in TV diagnostics which have led to an improved understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen, as well as potential biologic and epidemiological interactions between TV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). New data on treatment outcomes, metronidazole-resistant TV, management of nitroimidazole-allergic patients, frequency of recurrent TV infection following treatment, and screening considerations for TV in certain populations are also presented.

### Sexually transmitted infections: challenges ahead [^112Aq4t9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

WHO estimated that nearly 1 million people become infected every day with any of four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs): chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Despite their high global incidence, STIs remain a neglected area of research. In this Commission, we have prioritised five areas that represent particular challenges in STI treatment and control. Chlamydia remains the most commonly diagnosed bacterial STI in high-income countries despite widespread testing recommendations, sensitive and specific non-invasive testing techniques, and cheap effective therapy. We discuss the challenges for chlamydia control and evidence to support a shift from the current focus on infection-based screening to improved management of diagnosed cases and of chlamydial morbidity, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is globally recognised. We review current and potential future control and treatment strategies, with a focus on novel antimicrobials. Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder in women, but current treatments are associated with frequent recurrence. Recurrence after treatment might relate to evidence that suggests sexual transmission is integral to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis, which has substantial implications for the development of effective management approaches. STIs disproportionately affect low-income and middle-income countries. We review strategies for case management, focusing on point-of-care tests that hold considerable potential for improving STI control. Lastly, STIs in men who have sex with men have increased since the late 1990s. We discuss the contribution of new biomedical HIV prevention strategies and risk compensation. Overall, this Commission aims to enhance the understanding of some of the key challenges facing the field of STIs, and outlines new approaches to improve the clinical management of STIs and public health.

### Spontaneous remission of sexually transmitted diseases must be considered in randomised controlled trials [^116D4KnL]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Randomised controlled trials that test biomedical interventions to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have had very mixed results, as have behavioural trials. It is only in the past 10 years that the field has recognised that chlamydia resolves itself without treatment in 50% of the cases, although the estimates range from 13% to 60%. The length of time to clear chlamydia infection varies from 60 days in women to up to 15 months in men. The speed of resolution is also subject to individual-level factors (eg, infection clears sooner in older people), making it difficult to determine sample sizes for randomised controlled trials with STI outcomes.

In a recent five-country trial, the determination of sample size to identify the necessary number of participants to demonstrate a reduction in bacterial STI was based primarily on chlamydia (65.8% of the bacterial infections observed at recruitment; 10.3% prevalence) and trichomoniasis among women (17.2% of infections; 4.89% prevalence). When we examined all the bacterial STIs 1 year later, the rates of chlamydia were more than 60% lower and the rates of trichomoniasis were 40% lower. Potentially, half of the new chlamydia and trichomoniasis infections may have spontaneously resolved, as suggested by the above studies, but the actual incidence rates may have been 25% more than those observed at 12 months (assuming a consistent rate of infection over time).

The emerging data on spontaneous remission rates raises serious questions on how to design effective evaluations to demonstrate reductions in STIs. Randomised controlled trials must be designed to have shorter periods between assessments. It is also likely that there is a variance in the rates of clearance, although it is unclear in what direction and for whom the variations will apply. Thus, the design of future multisite trials must cautiously estimate STI infections, given the emerging data on spontaneous remissions or clearing of infections, and consider much shorter follow-up periods, even for long-term longitudinal trials.

### Prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases: an update [^1175cE4i]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently published revised guidelines for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. One new treatment strategy is the use of azithromycin as a primary, rather than alternative, medication for pregnant women with Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection continues to increase in the United States; therefore, quinolones are no longer recommended for treatment of this infection. Expedited partner therapy gives physicians another option when addressing the need to treat partners of persons diagnosed with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection. Tinidazole is now available in the United States and can be used to manage trichomoniasis, including trichomoniasis resistant to metronidazole. Shorter courses of antiviral medication can be used for episodic therapy of recurrent genital herpes. Because of increasing resistance, close follow-up is required if azithromycin is used as an alternative treatment in the management of primary or secondary syphilis. Unexpected increases in the rates of lymphogranuloma venereum have occurred in The Netherlands, and physicians should remain vigilant for symptoms of this disease in the United States.

### Rapid antigen testing for trichomoniasis in an emergency department [^1141vjkb]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Trichomoniasis is a prevalent cause of vaginitis among adolescents that increases the risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted diseases and of negative pregnancy outcomes. Treatment of trichomoniasis is therefore essential for improving sexual and reproductive health outcomes. A timely, sensitive diagnostic test for T vaginalis may increase the accuracy of clinician's treatment decisions, resulting in more infected women receiving treatment and fewer uninfected women receiving treatment.

Methods

This study was a retrospective observational assessment of electronic medical records before and after point-of-care (POC) implementation of the rapid antigen test. Records were collected from women aged 14 to 20 years who received a T vaginalis test in the emergency department during either study period. The main outcome measures were rates of accurate treatment, inaccurate treatment, and missed treatment of trichomoniasis in each study period.

Results

Overall rates of accurate treatment increased from 78.7% pre-POC to 87.7% post-POC (P = 0.02). Specifically, rates of not treating uninfected women increased from 61.4% pre-POC to 70.4% post-POC (P = 0.06), and rates of treating infected women were the same pre-POC (17.3%) and post-POC (17.3%; p = 0.99). Rates of inaccurate treatment decreased from 23.1% pre-POC to 13.1% post-POC (P = 0.02). Changes in missed treatment rates (14.0% pre-POC; 8.8% post-POC; p = 0.73) were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

POC testing can improve clinical care by decreasing the use of antibiotics in uninfected women. The results of this study support the use of a T vaginalis rapid antigen POC test for adolescents presenting to the emergency department.

Vaginal complaints are one of the most common reasons women seek the advice of a health care provider. Uncomplicated infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis are easy to diagnose and treat. However, about 8% of patients will have a more complicated course with failure to respond to treatment or rapid recurrence of symptoms. Understanding the need for a methodical, diagnostic approach to help these women with recurrent or refractory cases of vaginal symptoms will aid the clinician achieve successful patient outcomes.

One-day Treatment – Administer 2 g (20 mL) of LIKMEZ, either as a single oral dose or in 2 divided oral doses of 1 g (10 mL) each, given on the same day.
Seven-day Course of Treatment − Administer 250 mg (2.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally 3 times daily for 7 consecutive days.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment may help improve compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen.

A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. There are some data from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

When repeat courses of LIKMEZ are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Amebiasis

Adult Patients:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): Administer 750 mg (7.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally three times daily for 5 days to 10 days.
For amebic liver abscess: Administer 500 mg (5 mL) or 750 mg (7.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally three times daily for 5 days to 10 days.

Pediatric Patients:

Administer 35 mg/kg/24 hours to 50 mg/kg/24 hours of LIKMEZ, divided into three doses, to a maximum dose of 2,250 mg/24 hours (maximum dose 750 mg/dose or 7.5 mL/dose), orally for 10 days.

### Trichomonas vaginalis virulence factors: an integrative overview [^1119PJqK]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

The elusive nature of Trichomonas vaginalis, the most common, non-viral, sexually transmitted pathogen has hampered our knowledge of its significance for human health for over 150 years. The combination of epidemiology, molecular cell biology, immunology and more recently genomics and other allied omics data, are all contributing at shedding new light onto what is increasingly recognised as a significant human pathogen leading to important health sequelae due to multifaceted interactions with its human host, the human microbiota, bacterial pathogens and viruses. The integrations of these various data are contributing in important ways to refining our understanding of the parasite pathobiology and virulent factors. Indeed, it is increasingly recognised that to rationalise the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for human pathogens it is important to integrate the broadest possible spectrum of human-microbial-parasite-virus interactions in relation to qualitative and quantitative variations in the human innate and adaptive defence responses. This short review aims at providing an integrative overview of T vaginalis virulent factors by taking into account the importance of the human-microbiota-parasite-virus interplay in human health. It also highlights selected cellular characteristics of the parasite often overlooked in the biological and medical literature.

### Updates in trichomonas treatment including persistent infection and 5-nitroimidazole hypersensitivity [^115rNFKj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to update information on treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis. T. vaginalis is estimated to be the most common treatable sexually transmitted infection. In the world and is associated with poor birth outcomes, cervical cancer, sperm motility and morphology issues, and HIV acquisition and transmission.

Recent Findings

The efficacy of the recommended 2-g oral single-dose metronidazole (MTZ) for the treatment of T. vaginalis in women has recently been challenged. Two recent multicentered randomized trials and a meta-analysis have demonstrated that the 7-day dose of MTZ 500mg twice daily was nearly two times more efficacious at clearing infection compared with the 2-g dose. Partner treatment is also essential, since up to 70% of male sexual partners can be infected and rescreening of treated women at 3 months is also recommended given the high repeat infection rates. Future studies should examine the importance of treating asymptomatic T. vaginalis, best treatment for men, the influence of the microbiome on treatment efficacy and different formulations of intravaginal treatments for hypersensitivity.

Summary

7-day 500mg twice daily MTZ should be used as the first line treatment for T. vaginalis-infected women.

### Failure of metronidazole to prevent preterm delivery among pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomonas vaginalis infection [^115h1yLm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Infection with Trichomonas vaginalis during pregnancy has been associated with preterm delivery. It is uncertain whether treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis in pregnant women reduces the occurrence of preterm delivery.

Methods

We screened pregnant women for trichomoniasis by culture of vaginal secretions. We randomly assigned 617 women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis who were 16 to 23 weeks pregnant to receive two 2-g doses of metronidazole (320 women) or placebo (297 women) 48 hours apart. We treated women again with the same two-dose regimen at 24 to 29 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was delivery before 37 weeks of gestation.

Results

Between randomization and follow-up, trichomoniasis resolved in 249 of 269 women for whom follow-up cultures were available in the metronidazole group (92.6 percent) and 92 of 260 women with follow-up cultures in the placebo group (35.4 percent). Data on the time and characteristics of delivery were available for 315 women in the metronidazole group and 289 women in the placebo group. Delivery occurred before 37 weeks of gestation in 60 women in the metronidazole group (19.0 percent) and 31 women in the placebo group (10.7 percent) (relative risk, 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.7; P = 0.004). The difference was attributable primarily to an increase in preterm delivery resulting from spontaneous preterm labor (10.2 percent vs. 3.5 percent; relative risk, 3.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 5.9).

Conclusions

Treatment of pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis does not prevent preterm delivery. Routine screening and treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women for this condition cannot be recommended.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116cJ4gr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide, affecting 3.7 million people in the United States (US). Women with Trichomonas vaginalis have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other STIs. Trichomoniasis is also associated with infertility and adverse birth outcomes. National guidelines recommend annual screening of women with HIV for trichomoniasis.

The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines recommend a single 2 g dose of oral metronidazole (MTZ) or tinidazole (TDZ) for T. vaginalis –infected women without HIV; for infected women with HIV, MTZ 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days is preferred. The 2020 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) practice bulletin on vaginitis has recently recommended multidose MTZ for all nonpregnant women, based on new clinical trial data. Updated 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines are pending.

Secnidazole (SEC) is a potent 5-nitroimidazole antibiotic with a longer half-life than MTZ and TDZ. In 2017, SEC was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first, single-dose oral treatment for bacterial vaginosis (BV) in women. The 2020 ACOG guidance includes SEC 2 g as an alternative treatment for BV, based on a randomized controlled trial, finding it comparable to 7-day MTZ for BV.

As a treatment for trichomoniasis, single-dose SEC had microbiological cure rates of 93%–96% after 2–3 days of treatment and up to 100% for ≤ 20 days of treatment in studies conducted outside the US. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-dose SEC in US-based women with trichomoniasis. We hypothesized that microbiological cure rates would be high after treatment of T. vaginalis –infected women with SEC, similar to studies outside the US.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116dDgG9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate the superiority of SEC vs placebo for the treatment of trichomoniasis. Importantly, SEC was superior to placebo in patients with trichomoniasis and vaginal symptoms and in those with HIV and/or BV. Although prior studies have shown trichomoniasis is asymptomatic in 70%–85% of cases, patients can present with symptoms including yellow-to-green frothy vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal odor, pruritus, irritation, and/or dysuria. Thus, single-dose SEC may be an effective option for symptomatic and asymptomatic trichomoniasis in women.

National guidelines have traditionally recommended a single, 2 g dose of oral MTZ or TDZ as the preferred treatment of trichomoniasis in women, with oral MTZ 500 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days as an alternative regimen. In 2010, results of a randomized, open-label trial of a single oral dose of MTZ 2 g vs the 7-day MTZ 500 mg BID regimen in women with HIV and trichomoniasis demonstrated microbiological cure rates of 83.2% vs 91.5%, 6–12 days after treatment. These results led to the CDC recommendation to use the multidose MTZ regimen for trichomoniasis in women with HIV. In 2018, similar results were reported from a randomized, open-label trial of single- vs multidose MTZ for trichomoniasis in women without HIV. Microbiological cure rates at TOC were 81.4% and 89.1% in the single- and multidose MTZ groups. Hence, the 2020 ACOG practice bulletin on vaginitis now recommends the multidose MTZ regimen as the preferred regimen for trichomoniasis in nonpregnant women. Updated 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines are anticipated later this year.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^1117g5Bv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Assuming microbiological cure rates of 75% and 40% with SEC and placebo, respectively, a sample size of 100 patients (50 patients/group) provided approximately 95% power to demonstrate a statistically significant between-treatment-group difference using a 2-sided, 2-sample comparison of proportions at the α = .05 level of significance. Assuming an attrition rate of 30%, 144 patients needed to be randomly assigned to SEC or placebo.

The primary efficacy endpoint was compared between the active and placebo treatment groups using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (stratified by the presence/absence of clinical symptoms of trichomoniasis at baseline, HIV status, and BV status) at the α = .05 level of significance. As required by the FDA and determined a priori, the primary efficacy analysis was based on the mITT population, defined as all randomized patients who had a positive T. vaginalis culture at baseline and a negative chlamydia and gonorrhea NAAT at baseline. Secondary efficacy endpoint analysis was based on the per protocol (PP) population, defined as patients in the mITT population who received their assigned study medication and had a TOC visit. Post hoc efficacy analyses of the microbiological cure rate at TOC compared SEC- vs placebo-treated patients (1) with trichomoniasis who were symptomatic and those who were asymptomatic, (2) infected with HIV, and (3) with BV at baseline. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

Safety endpoints included the incidence, severity, and relationship to study medication of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests also were assessed. Safety endpoints were evaluated using the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who received any study-related medication.

### Metronidazole (Flagyl) [^111xkqgN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. FLAGYL 375 capsules are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole in cases of reinfection.

### Global epidemiology and control of trichomonas vaginalis [^114CsSwq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection. Despite a number of serious health consequences including facilitation of HIV transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease and adverse outcomes of pregnancy it remains an under-recognized condition. This review aims to update the reader on the global epidemiology and control of T. vaginalis.

Recent Findings

The burden of T. vaginalis infection is found in resource-limited settings and high-risk groups in industrialized settings. Utilization of polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostics has enhanced our understanding of the epidemiology of T. vaginalis both at the population level and in sexual partners. High rates of asymptomatic infection in male partners of infected females and subsequent re-infection have significant implications for control programmes. Further studies investigating the role of T. vaginalis in facilitating HIV transmission has highlighted its significance and the need to develop and implement control interventions.

Summary

Future research to develop cheap, point-of-care diagnostic tests will allow a greater understanding of T. vaginalis epidemiology. In addition, the effect of treatment on outcome of pregnancy and HIV acquisition requires further study. This will in turn facilitate operational studies evaluating optimal control strategies and their impact on the complications of T. vaginalis.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115DBZBV]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic testing for T. vaginalis should be performed for women seeking care for vaginal discharge. Annual screening might be considered for persons receiving care in high-prevalence settings (e.g. STD clinics and correctional facilities) and for asymptomatic women at high risk for infection (e.g. multiple sex partners, transactional sex, drug misuse, or a history of STIs or incarceration). However, data are lacking regarding whether screening and treatment for asymptomatic trichomoniasis in high-prevalence settings for women at high risk can reduce any adverse health events and health disparities or reduce community infection burden. Decisions about screening can be guided by local epidemiology of T. vaginalis infection. Routine annual screening for T. vaginalis among asymptomatic women with HIV infection is recommended because of these adverse events associated with trichomoniasis and HIV infection.

Extragenital T. vaginalis is possible but highly uncommon compared with genital infections. A study of 500 men in San Francisco, California, reported a 0.6% rate of rectal T. vaginalis; however, this might reflect deposition of T. vaginalis DNA and not necessarily active infection. Few studies of extragenital T. vaginalis among women have been published. The efficacy, benefit, and cost-effectiveness of extragenital screening are unknown, and no tests are FDA cleared for extragenital testing; therefore, rectal and oral testing for T. vaginalis is not recommended.

Management of Sex Partners

Concurrent treatment of all sex partners is vital for preventing reinfections. Current partners should be referred for presumptive therapy. Partners also should be advised to abstain from intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated and any symptoms have resolved. EPT might have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis and can be used in states where permissible by law; however, no partner management intervention has been demonstrated to be superior in reducing reinfection rates. Although no definitive data exist to guide treatment for partners of persons with persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis among whom nonadherence and reinfection are unlikely, partners might benefit from being evaluated and receiving treatment (see Recurrent Trichomoniasis).

Recurrent Trichomoniasis

A recurrent infection can result from treatment failure (antimicrobial-resistant T. vaginalis or host-related problems), lack of adherence, or reinfection from an untreated sex partner. In the case of a recurrent infection, the origin of the repeat infection should be assessed because most recurrent infections likely result from reinfection. Retesting can be considered in cases of persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis with culture, the preferred test. If NAAT is used, it should not be conducted before 3 weeks after treatment completion because of possible detection of residual nucleic acid that is not clinically relevant.

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobials known to be effective against trichomonas infection. Metronidazole resistance occurs in 4%–10% of cases of vaginal trichomoniasis. Tinidazole resistance is less well studied but was present in 1% of infections in one study. Overall, more T. vaginalis isolates have reported susceptibility to tinidazole than metronidazole. Multidose oral metronidazole is more effective than single-dose treatment, particularly for women who are symptomatic or have a history of T. vaginalis.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116Xsz4f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, cure rates were 92%–100% in the overall population and in subgroups of women with genital symptoms, HIV, and/or BV. Previous research showed that trichomoniasis treatment significantly decreases HIV viral load and viral shedding and may reduce HIV transmission. Although only 4 patients had HIV, our finding that all were cured is reassuring, and larger clinical trials in this patient population are warranted to confirm these results. Moreover, coinfection of BV and T. vaginalis is common, with rates of 60%–80%. Thus, a single treatment for BV and trichomoniasis may have multiple benefits.

A potential limitation of this study was the use of T. vaginalis culture to achieve a shorter timeframe to TOC. Although InPouch may be less sensitive than NAAT, the accuracy in this study was high as supported by the low placebo responder rate (~1%). Other limitations include the lack of long-term follow-up and the exclusion of men and pregnant women. However, 2 non-US-based studies of SEC for trichomoniasis in patients, including a small subgroup of men, showed cure rates of 91.7%–100% at 2–20 days after treatment. Although our study did not include pregnant women, and data on the use of SEC during pregnancy are limited, reproductive preclinical toxicology studies have shown no evidence of toxicity, and SEC is not contraindicated during pregnancy. The CDC recommends that trichomoniasis treatment be considered for symptomatic pregnant women, regardless of pregnancy stage. Finally, 5-nitroimidazole susceptibility testing was not performed on trichomonas isolates in the study; thus, we cannot comment on any resistance that potentially may have been present.

Study strengths include high cure rates for SEC (92%–95%), low placebo responder rates, minimal dropouts, a favorable TEAE profile, and treatment success in women with and without clinical symptoms, HIV, and/or BV.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a single dose of SEC 2 g was efficacious and well tolerated in women with trichomoniasis and in those with trichomoniasis and comorbid HIV and/or BV. If approved by the FDA for the treatment of trichomoniasis, SEC will be the only single oral-dose medication available for the treatment of BV and T. vaginalis. Future studies should be considered in pregnant women and those with persistent T. vaginalis infection, including the use of SEC multidose regimens.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services for persons with HIV — assessment, condom counseling and provision, presumptive treatment, and scope — are detailed as follows: Assessment of behavioral and biologic risk factors is recommended at initial and subsequent visits in clinical settings providing continuing care, and in clinical or nonclinical settings that provide one-time or episodic STD services, assessment is recommended at initial encounter and when clients seek follow-up services; recalling clients specifically for risk assessment may not be feasible. In this section, the term "assess" means eliciting information about behavioral and biologic risk factors for HIV transmission, including history of STD and STD symptoms, and the term "screen" means testing for STD pathogens in persons without symptoms. This section does not address screening persons with HIV for other conditions that have not been shown to facilitate HIV transmission to others, such as viral hepatitis and human papillomavirus infection. All source guidance advises providing information or counseling about condom use; guidance from the Health Resources and Services Administration advises providing condoms to patients in publicly funded clinics. According to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines, immediate presumptive treatment (or immediate linkage to such treatment) is recommended for persons who report sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis or have STD syndromes in order to reduce the risk of onward STD transmission; STD syndromes are conditions that can be caused by sexually transmitted pathogens and cause symptoms or abnormal findings (signs) on physical examination, such as genital ulcer disease, urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, epididymitis, and proctitis. The cited source guidance describes the rationale for retesting for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection; the Evidence topic describes the rationale for retesting for trichomoniasis.

Bacterial Vaginosis, Trichomoniasis, and Genital Herpes

Evidence does not support routine screening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. Symptomatic women should be evaluated and treated (see Bacterial Vaginosis). Evidence does not support routine screening for Trichomonas vaginalis among asymptomatic pregnant women. Women who report symptoms should be evaluated and treated (see Trichomoniasis). In addition, evidence does not support routine HSV-2 serologic screening among asymptomatic pregnant women. However, type-specific serologic tests might be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk for HSV-2 infection and for guiding counseling regarding the risk for acquiring genital herpes during pregnancy. Routine serial cultures for HSV are not indicated for women in the third trimester who have a history of recurrent genital herpes.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^115eWUnQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
U.S. CDC, European International Union/WHO, and U.K. guidelines for treatment of BV and trichomoniasis.

In light of these practical realities, empirical single‐dose oral tinidazole treatment of both BV and TV (with single‐dose fluconazole) would offer a patient‐centered solution to optimize the chance for first‐time cure, particularly for women challenged by medication adherence and follow‐up capability. Currently, the 2021 U.S. CDC STI guidelines recommend 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole (as four 500‐mg tablets) for TV treatment and 2 g on Days 1 and 2 as an alternative BV treatment option. Due to ED dispensing limitations, the next day's dose would require the patient to fill a prescription. However, 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole is already recommended as an alternative treatment of both BV and TV by the European International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) and World Health Organization (WHO) and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) U.K. guidelines (Table 1). Tinidazole's plasma half‐life is 12–14 h, which is longer than metronidazole's (~8 h), allowing for a shorter treatment course, and its safety profile is less adverse, with metallic taste, nausea, anorexia, and constipation associated with longer duration as opposed to single‐dose treatment.TV also exhibits less resistance to tinidazole than metronidazole, demonstrating both lower in vitro minimum lethal concentrations and a high clinical efficacy rate for patients with metronidazole‐refractory TV infection.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^111C1QBY]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Section 9. Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Preventive Services focuses on preventive services for 5 STDs that may increase the risk of transmitting HIV: syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in men and women and trichomoniasis in women. This section does not provide comprehensive recommendations about STD preventive services for persons with HIV; other guidance addresses screening, treatment, vaccination, and other interventions for infections that have not been shown to increase the risk of onward HIV transmission (e.g., human papillomavirus, hepatitis A, B, and C) and services for STDs that may increase the risk of HIV acquisition by HIV-uninfected persons, including trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis in women. Settings must be tested in laboratories that have validated procedures specified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) for testing specimens obtained in nonclinical settings. Health departments are responsible for population-level STD prevention and control programs. Quality improvement and program monitoring and evaluation can determine if the interventions described in this section are implemented as intended, yield the expected outcomes, or warrant changes in delivery methods. Although it remains uncertain if bacterial vaginosis results from acquisition of a sexually transmitted pathogen, this condition may increase risk of HIV acquisition.

### Trichomonas vaginalis polymerase chain reaction compared with standard diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for detection and treatment of vaginal trichomoniasis [^115UvqQJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Wet preparation has limited sensitivity for diagnosis of Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection. An observational study of 337 women was conducted to evaluate a new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for TV. The sensitivities of wet preparation and TV culture were 52% (95% confidence interval, 41–62) and 78% (95% CI, 69–86), respectively. TV PCR had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI, 75–90) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI, 90–97). Metronidazole was provided to 67 (69%) of 97 women with TV because of TV on wet preparation, exposure to TV, or a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis or pelvic inflammatory disease; however, if TV PCR had been used for diagnosis, 81 (84%) of 97 women with TV would have been treated (P = 0.02). TV is significantly undertreated using standard algorithms for metronidazole therapy. Given the association of trichomoniasis with perinatal morbidity and HIV transmission, women in high-risk groups may benefit from TV PCR.

How these recommendations differ from previous recommendations — updated recommendations advise screening for gonorrhea and chlamydial infection in genital and extra-genital sites using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), screening for trichomoniasis with more sensitive tests: NAAT or culture, informing persons with HIV that reporting of specified infections by laboratories and health care providers as required by state laws may prompt health departments to offer voluntary, confidential HIV partner services in some jurisdictions, retesting persons diagnosed with gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis 3 months after treatment, and using the STD treatment regimens most recently recommended by CDC that include administration of two different antimicrobial drugs for gonorrhea, one of which requires injection.

### Trichomoniasis: under control or undercontrolled? [^11746SG2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Aside from human papillomavirus, trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States today, yet it has long been regarded as a sexually transmitted infection of minor importance. Medical opinion has traditionally held that it plays little role in health complications in women, and it is rarely seen in men. However, evidence has recently accumulated implicating Trichomonas vaginalis as a contributor to a variety of adverse outcomes among both sexes. Among both women and men, the association of T vaginalis with human immunodeficiency acquisition and transmission has been shown in multiple studies. Among women, trichomoniasis may play a role in development of cervical neoplasia, postoperative infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes and as a factor in atypical pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Among men, trichomoniasis has emerged as a cause of nongonoccocal urethritis and as contributing to male factor infertility. As evidence continues to accumulate, the time has come to increase diagnostic efforts beyond traditional sexually transmitted disease clinic settings.

14.2 Trichomoniasis

The efficacy of a single 2-gram oral dose of SOLOSEC for the treatment of trichomoniasis was evaluated in a multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, delayed treatment, double-blind, trial (Trial 5, NCT03935217). A total of 147 female patients from the United States aged 15 to 65 years were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either SOLOSEC or placebo. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included all randomized patients who were culture positive for T. vaginalis and negative for other sexually transmitted infections. Of the 131 female patients in the mITT population, the median age was 36 years, and 90.8% were African American. Baseline clinical symptoms of vaginal itching, discharge, or odor were reported in 111 (84.7%) patients. Following initial dosing, the test of cure (TOC) visit occurred 6 to 12 days later. At the TOC visit, patients received the opposite treatment (placebo patients received SOLOSEC and vice versa) with a return visit 7 to 12 days later.

Results for microbiological cure, defined as testing negative for T. vaginalis, for the mITT population are presented in Table 5. The microbiological cure rate at the TOC visit was significantly higher in the SOLOSEC treatment group compared to the placebo group.

The single oral 2 g secnidazole dose was also assessed in four open-label trials in males (one comparative study with metronidazole and ornidazole in males only1and three single-arm studies in males and females2,3,4). Parasitological evaluation was performed both pre- and post-treatment and reported cure rates ranged from 91.7% (165/180) to 100% (30/30) at time points ranging from 2 to 20 days (n = 437, 211 males and 226 females). In addition, the natural history of trichomoniasis in men was evaluated in one study.5The spontaneous resolution during a mean follow-up of 16 ± 12 days was noted in 36% (5/14) (95% CI: 12.8%, 64.9%) of untreated men.

### Tinidazole (tindazole) [^1165DSg4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Trichomoniasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. The organism should be identified by appropriate diagnostic procedures. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, partners of infected patients should be treated simultaneously in order to prevent re-infection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.2 Giardiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of giardiasis caused by Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia) in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Amebiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age. It is not indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)].

1.4 Bacterial Vaginosis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis) in adult women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans and Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out.

1.5 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tinidazole Tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Tinidazole Tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections, that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111p45Wk]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

T. vaginalis infection among pregnant women is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and delivery of infants who are small for gestational age. One randomized trial of pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis reported no substantial difference in preterm birth after treatment with 2 g of metronidazole 48 hours apart during 16–23 and 24–29 weeks' gestation, compared with placebo. However, that trial had multiple limitations, including use of an atypical metronidazole regimen. Another multicenter observational study of asymptomatic pregnant women in sub-Sahara African, the majority with HIV infection, reported neither trichomoniasis nor its treatment appeared to influence the risk for preterm birth or a low-birthweight infant.

Although metronidazole crosses the placenta, data indicate that it poses a low risk to the developing fetus. No evidence of teratogenicity or mutagenic effects among infants has been found in multiple cross-sectional and cohort studies among pregnant women examining single-dose (2 g) and multidose metronidazole regimens (,–).

Symptomatic pregnant women, regardless of pregnancy stage, should be tested and treated. Treatment of T. vaginalis infection can relieve symptoms of vaginal discharge for pregnant women and reduce sexual transmission to partners. Although perinatal transmission of trichomoniasis is uncommon, treatment might also prevent respiratory or genital infection in the newborn. Clinicians should counsel symptomatic pregnant women with trichomoniasis about the potential risks and benefits of treatment and about the importance of partner treatment and condom use in the prevention of sexual transmission. The benefit of routine screening for T. vaginalis in asymptomatic pregnant women has not been established.

Metronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal oral therapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses that are lower than those used to treat infections among infants, although the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. Plasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but remain less than maternal plasma levels. Although multiple reported case series studies demonstrated no evidence of adverse effects among infants exposed to metronidazole in breast milk, clinicians sometimes advise deferring breastfeeding for 12–24 hours after maternal treatment with metronidazole. In one study, maternal treatment with metronidazole (400 mg 3 times/day for 7 days) produced a lower concentration in breast milk and was considered compatible with breastfeeding over longer periods.

Data from studies involving human subjects are limited regarding tinidazole use during pregnancy; however, animal data indicate this drug poses moderate risk. Thus, tinidazole should be avoided for pregnant women, and breastfeeding should be deferred for 72 hours after a single 2-g oral dose of tinidazole.

### Treatment of trichomoniasis in pregnancy and preterm birth: an observational study [^115ZS72K]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between treatment of maternal trichomoniasis with oral metronidazole and preterm birth.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Medicaid billing data and birth certificate records for 144,737 live births in South Carolina from 1996 through 2002. Cases of trichomoniasis were identified using billing codes. The risk of preterm birth among women with treated vs. untreated trichomoniasis was modeled as a time-varying covariate in Cox proportional hazards regression. Women who were initially diagnosed with trichomoniasis at ≥ 35 weeks or delivered < 2 days after the diagnosis were excluded from the modeling. We also examined the effect of excluding women who gave birth within 14 days following the diagnosis.

Results

There were 4274 (3.0%) women diagnosed with trichomoniasis; 3579 women were diagnosed with trichomoniasis prior to 35 weeks gestation and remained pregnant until at least the second day after the diagnosis, and 1436 (40.1%) of these women filled a prescription for oral metronidazole within 14 days. Of treated women, 12.7% delivered prior to 37 weeks compared with 15.3% of women who were not treated within 14 days. In the multivariable proportional hazards regression, treatment appeared to be protective both for women with and without another genitourinary infection at some point during pregnancy (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.50, 0.95 in women with another infection; HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52, 0.92 in women without another infection). After excluding women who delivered within 14 days of the diagnosis, the hazard ratios remained < 1.0 but were no longer statistically significant (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.64, 1.11 in women with another infection; HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.69, 1.32 in women without another infection).

Conclusions

Treatment with oral metronidazole was not associated with increased risk of preterm birth in women diagnosed with trichomoniasis.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^111yviKD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis, caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, is one of the most common nonviral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs): annually, ≈248 million incident cases occur worldwide, and ≈7.4 million cases occur in the United States. The estimated US prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is 3.1%, with a higher prevalence among black women and women of low socioeconomic status than among other women. Trichomoniasis is a frequent cause of vaginitis and can contribute to premature rupture of membranes during pregnancy, preterm birth, low birth weight, and may facilitate HIV acquisition.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) STD Treatment Guidelines recommends the use of a 5-nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, either metronidazole or tinidazole, for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection. Metronidazole has been the mainstay of treatment for several decades; however, tinidazole has better in vitro activity and is well tolerated.

The reliance on a single drug class for treating T. vaginalis infections may be problematic if resistance to nitroimidazole becomes widespread in T. vaginalis strains. Three small studies that examined the prevalence of in vitro resistance in the United States have been conducted during the past 15 years, but they were limited in geographic scope. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of in vitro aerobic metronidazole and tinidazole resistance among a broad sample of T. vaginalis isolates from multiple geographic sites in the United States.

### The incidence of trichomonas vaginalis infection in women attending nine sexually transmitted diseases clinics in the United States [^1113rcDU]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Trichomoniasis (TV) is associated with an increased risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate factors associated with incidence TV among female STD clinic attendees in the United States.

Methods

Data were collected from women participating in a randomised controlled trial evaluating brief risk reduction counselling at the time of HIV testing to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) incidence in STD clinics. Participants recruited from STD clinics underwent STI testing at baseline and 6-month follow-up. TV testing was performed using Nucleic Acid Amplification Test.

Results

1704 participants completed study assessments. Prevalence of TV was 14.6%, chlamydia 8.6%, gonorrhoea 3.0%, herpes simplex virus 2 44.7% and HIV 0.4%. Cumulative 6-month incidence of TV was 7.5%. Almost 50% of the incident TV cases had TV at baseline and had received treatment. Factors associated with incidence of TV were having chlamydia, TV and HIV at baseline: TV relative risk (RR) = 3.37 (95% CI 2.35 to 4.83, p < 0.001); chlamydia RR = 1.92 (95% CI 1.23 to 2.99, p = 0.04); and HIV = 1.59 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.50, p = 0.047).

Conclusions

Prevalent and incident TV is common among STD clinic attendees; and baseline TV is the main risk factor for incident TV, suggesting high rates of reinfection or treatment failures. This supports the importance of rescreening women after treatment for TV, evaluating current treatment regimens and programmes to ensure treatment of sexual partners.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1173pBYj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences including increased risk of acquisition of the others, transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus‐2 as well as adverse reproductive and mental health outcomes, and cervical cancer risk. Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower formal educational attainment and/or experiencing poverty, the very groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs). Current U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatment. We propose an empirical, single‐dose, point‐of‐care treatment strategy, novel to the U.S. but evidence‐based and consistent with international guidelines, to address existing deficiencies in availability of inexpensive and accurate point‐of‐care diagnosis, and substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow‐up commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111VqaEC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Multiple factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should be provided for women at increased risk (e.g. those aged < 25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if follow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not possible. Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected (see Bacterial Vaginosis; Trichomoniasis). For women at lower risk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a follow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved can be considered.

Recommended Regimen for Cervicitis*
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
* Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high (see Gonococcal Infections).
Alternative Regimen
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose

Other Management Considerations

To minimize transmission and reinfection, women treated for cervicitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e. until completion of a 7-day regimen or for 7 days after single-dose therapy) and symptoms have resolved. Women who receive a cervicitis diagnosis should be tested for syphilis and HIV in addition to other recommended diagnostic tests.

Follow-Up

Women receiving treatment should return to their provider for a follow-up visit to determine whether cervicitis has resolved. For women who are untreated, a follow-up visit gives providers an opportunity to communicate test results obtained as part of the cervicitis evaluation. Providers should treat on the basis of any positive test results and determine whether cervicitis has resolved. Women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return in 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated. If symptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to return for reevaluation.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116rdH4q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

At visit 2 (TOC), patients were queried about treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and assessed for clinical symptoms of trichomoniasis. A provider obtained an additional vaginal specimen for T. vaginalis culture. At this visit, patients received the opposite treatment from baseline (ie, SEC if they had received placebo at baseline or placebo if they had received SEC at baseline) under direct observation by study staff. Patients with a microbiological cure, defined as negative T. vaginalis by InPouch culture at visit 2, were subsequently discharged from the study. Patients with a positive T. vaginalis culture from visit 2 were asked to return for a third visit, 7–12 days later, for an additional assessment, including determination of the need for additional therapy. A fourth visit (7–12 days after visit 3) was scheduled at the investigator's discretion if a repeat T. vaginalis culture at visit 3 was positive. Patients who had a positive culture at visit 3 and visit 4 were offered treatment, based upon the investigator's discretion and per standard of care. InPouch cultures were examined daily for 5 days over a 7-day period to reduce the possibility of false-negative results.

The primary efficacy endpoint was microbiological cure at visit 2 (TOC). The trial was designed to limit the possibility of unprotected sex resulting in reinfection, which would become more likely the longer the interval between treatment and TOC. The InPouch culture was selected as the diagnostic TOC based on its relatively high sensitivity (81%–94%), allowing for a TOC visit within 1 week. We did not perform a T. vaginalis NAAT for TOC as the optimal timing of this highly sensitive test is 3–4 weeks after treatment. Use of this test within 3 weeks after treatment may have detected remnant trichomonal nucleic acid, leading to false-positive test results. In addition, the use of T. vaginalis NAAT for TOC would have required patients to remain sexually inactive for as much as 4 weeks, which was considered impractical.

### Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections: a review [^113o3hG8]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in 2018. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes.

Observations

From 2015 to 2019, the rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis increased in the US; from 1999 to 2016, while the rates of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 declined. Populations with higher rates of STIs include people younger than 25 years, sexual and gender minorities such as men and transgender women who have sex with men, and racial and ethnic minorities such as Black and Latinx people. Approximately 70% of infections with HSV and trichomoniasis and 53% to 100% of extragenital gonorrhea and chlamydia infections are asymptomatic or associated with few symptoms. STIs are associated with HIV acquisition and transmission and are the leading cause of tubal factor infertility in women. Nucleic acid amplification tests have high sensitivities (86.1%-100%) and specificities (97.1%-100%) for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydia, M genitalium, trichomoniasis, and symptomatic HSV-1 and HSV-2. Serology remains the recommended method to diagnose syphilis, typically using sequential testing to detect treponemal and nontreponemal (antiphospholipid) antibodies. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles, such as metronidazole, are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, M genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral treatment options for gonorrhea and M genitalium. No cure is available for genital herpes. Effective STI prevention interventions include screening, contact tracing of sexual partners, and promoting effective barrier contraception.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US had an STI in 2018. Rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis in the US have increased, while rates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 have declined. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral therapies for gonorrhea and Mycoplasma genitalium, and no cure is available for genital herpes.

In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 2‐g single‐dose oral secnidazole (two 1‐g packets) for treatment of BV and TV, and this is currently listed as an alternative BV treatment option in U.S. CDC guidelines. Table 2 shows the results of clinical trials among women with symptomatic vaginitis comparing metronidazole, tinidazole, and secnidazole, including single‐dose regimens, to treat BV and TV. For BV, when compared with metronidazole 500 mg BID for 7 days, both 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole and 2‐g single‐dose secnidazole demonstrated similar cure rates to metronidazole. Another trial comparing single doses of secnidazole, tinidazole, and metronidazole to treat BV found that tinidazole had a significantly greater clinical cure rate than metronidazole but secnidazole did not, further supporting the efficacy of single‐dose tinidazole. Across all trials, for BV, 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole demonstrated clinical cure rates of 83%–100%.,

TABLE 2
Comparative clinical trials of tinidazole, secnidazole, and metronidazole treatment for symptomatic women diagnosed with BV and trichomoniasis.

Unlike FDA guidance for comparative noninferiority trials to evaluate new antibiotics to treat other common infections, guidance for BV antimicrobial approval specifies a placebo‐controlled superiority trial. Tinidazole was FDA‐approved in 2004 based on a placebo‐controlled trial that demonstrated efficacy of both 2 g daily for 2 days and for 5 days. Earlier placebo‐controlled trials and many comparative studies of a single 2‐g dose of tinidazole were conducted outside the United States and had a different design than specified in U.S. FDA guidance to evaluate BV treatments, which may explain the divergence of U.S. and international treatment recommendations (i.e. 2 g daily for 2 days vs. single dose). Tinidazole has gone off‐patent, so no commercial interest now exists for FDA approval of single‐dose treatment. However, as shown in Table 2, single‐dose tinidazole has compared favorably to both 7‐day twice‐daily metronidazole and single‐dose secnidazole, regimens that have met FDA guidance criteria, and tinidazole has the endorsement of agencies outside the United States, supporting its off‐label use.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^1179pkzm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patient Disposition and Characteristics

Between 23 April 2019 and 18 March 2020, 147 women with trichomoniasis (SEC = 74, placebo = 73), identified by a positive wet mount (n = 119), OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test (n = 112), or T. vaginalis NAAT (n = 60) were enrolled at 10 clinical sites in the United States. One hundred thirty-one women (SEC = 64, placebo = 67) were included in the mITT population (Figure 1). In the mITT population, 57 patients had positive T. vaginalis InPouch test results at visit 2, and 54 of these 57 patients had negative T. vaginalis InPouch test results at visit 3. This corresponds to a 94.7% success rate for SEC.

### Trichomonas vaginalis in pregnancy: patterns and predictors of testing, infection, and treatment [^112mgbST]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify factors associated with testing for and diagnosis of trichomoniasis in pregnancy and to describe patterns of treatment and tests of reinfection or persistence.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered from July 2016 to June 2018 at one institution. Testing for Trichomonas vaginalis infection was done by wet mount microscopy or by nucleic acid amplification testing for routine prenatal testing or symptomatic visits. Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated with testing for trichomoniasis and testing positive in pregnancy. Treatment and re-testing patterns also were assessed.

Results

Among 3,265 pregnant women, 2,489 (76%) were tested for T vaginalis infection. Of the total sample, 1,808 (55%) were tested by wet mount microscopy, 1,661 (51%) by nucleic acid amplification testing, and 980 (30%) by both modalities. The sensitivity for microscopy compared with nucleic acid amplification testing was 26%, with a specificity of 99%. Factors associated with increased likelihood of being tested included younger age (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.99–1.00) and bacterial vaginosis (aRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01–1.37). Prevalence of trichomoniasis was 15% among those tested by any modality (wet mount or nucleic acid amplification testing). Risk factors for trichomoniasis included younger age (aRR 0.97, P < .01), being of black race (aRR 2.62, P < .01), abnormal vaginal discharge (aRR 1.45, P < .01), and chlamydia during the current pregnancy (aRR 1.70, P < .01). Women diagnosed by microscopy had a shorter time to treatment compared with those diagnosed by nucleic acid amplification testing. Most (75%) women with positive infections had a test of reinfection; 29% of these were positive. Bacterial vaginosis was associated with decreased risk of a positive test of reinfection.

Conclusion

Although testing for and treatment of trichomoniasis during pregnancy is not routinely recommended, the high burden of infection among some pregnant women demonstrates a need to further understand patterns of T vaginalis testing and infection. Opportunities exist for improving timely treatment of trichomoniasis and test of reinfection.

### Vaginitis: diagnosis and treatment [^112C9UWw]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases. Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing. Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin. The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy; DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida. Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplification testing for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis in symptomatic or high-risk women. Trichomoniasis is treated with oral metronidazole or tinidazole, and patients' sex partners should be treated as well. Treatment of noninfectious vaginitis should be directed at the underlying cause. Atrophic vaginitis is treated with hormonal and nonhormonal therapies. Inflammatory vaginitis may improve with topical clindamycin as well as steroid application.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^113EzQKq]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Section 9. Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Preventive Services — recommendations for persons with HIV include providing persons with HIV who have STD symptoms or report recent sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis with access to presumptive STD treatment (while awaiting STD test results) through onsite treatment at a health care facility or immediate linkage to a health care facility that offers clinical evaluation and onsite presumptive STD treatment. Engaging nonclinical providers to inform sexually active persons with HIV that some STDs may increase the risk of HIV transmission and that screening for these STDs at least annually is beneficial, to offer recommended STD screening tests using venous blood specimens or provider-initiated self-collected specimens or refer clients to clinical settings that offer STD screening, and to promptly link persons with HIV who report symptoms of STD or sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis to health care providers for clinical evaluation (including physical examination and diagnostic testing) and presumptive treatment with recommended injectable or oral antimicrobial drugs. Engaging health departments to integrate or routinely match STD and HIV surveillance data to identify populations or individuals with HIV with STD coinfection who may warrant being offered HIV and STD preventive services, including voluntary HIV partner services; presumptive treatment involves providing treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection or trichomoniasis before results of STD testing or clinical evaluation are available and is recommended for persons who report symptoms suggestive of these STDs or recent sex partners who were treated for these STDs, or have clinical signs of these STDs.

### Trichomoniasis-STI treatment guidelines… [^115d3M4a]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

T. vaginalis causes reproductive morbidity and has been reported to be associated with a 1. 4-times greater likelihood of preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and infants who are small for gestational age. T. vaginalis was also determined to be associated with a 2. 1-fold increased risk for cervical cancer in a meta-analysis. Another meta-analysis of six studies reported a slightly elevated but not statistically significant association between T. vaginalis and prostate cancer. T. vaginalis infection is associated with a 1. 5-fold increased risk for HIV acquisition and is associated with an increase in HIV vaginal shedding, which is reduced with T. vaginalis treatment among women without viral suppression. Among women with HIV infection, T. vaginalis infection is associated with increased risk for PID.

Metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose The nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with clinically demonstrated efficacy against. In randomized clinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98%, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 92%–100%. Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom resolution. Recurrent Trichomoniasis A recurrent infection can result from treatment failure.

If this regimen fails, high-dose oral tinidazole plus intravaginal paromomycin for 14 days should be considered.
