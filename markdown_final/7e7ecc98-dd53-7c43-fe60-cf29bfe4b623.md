## Question

52 year old on amiodarone with refractory Afib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 52-year-old with refractory atrial fibrillation who is already on amiodarone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis of true refractory AF and verifying current therapy. Then, I should assess structural heart disease and hemodynamics to guide next steps. Next, I will review guideline-directed options for rhythm control, including catheter ablation and alternative antiarrhythmics, and weigh them against rate control strategies. After that, I need to check for amiodarone toxicity and drug interactions. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise plan with monitoring, anticoagulation, and shared decision-making, while double-checking dosing and safety nuances throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and ensure we are truly dealing with refractory AF on amiodarone. Refractory AF generally means persistent symptoms or recurrent AF despite therapeutic dosing of at least one antiarrhythmic, and in this case the patient is already on amiodarone, which is often reserved for difficult cases; I should verify the dose, duration, adherence, and whether a proper loading regimen was used, because underdosing or inadequate loading can masquerade as refractory disease.

> Next, I should review the underlying substrate and hemodynamics, since management hinges on LV function, atrial size, and symptom burden. I need to check echocardiography for LVEF, left atrial size, and valvular disease; in patients with HFrEF, amiodarone or dofetilide are reasonable for rhythm maintenance, whereas in HFpEF or normal LV function, other AADs may be considered if amiodarone fails or is not tolerated; I should also confirm whether there is any evidence of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, which would push me toward rhythm control rather than rate control [^1116xxXV] [^1111eHN8] [^1145nHv8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply escalating amiodarone. I need to check for amiodarone toxicity and interactions that could undermine efficacy or safety. I should review thyroid function tests, liver enzymes, pulmonary symptoms and chest imaging, ophthalmologic symptoms, and dermatologic changes; I also need to check for interacting drugs that raise amiodarone levels or prolong QT, and I should remember that amiodarone has a very long half-life, so cumulative toxicity can emerge even on stable dosing [^115p3MvJ] [^115ZRH51].

> Now, I will examine rhythm-control alternatives, with catheter ablation as the leading strategy after failure of amiodarone. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: in patients with persistent AF and HFrEF, catheter ablation has been shown to improve freedom from AF, reduce hospitalizations, and in some studies improve survival compared with amiodarone; even outside HF, ablation is guideline-supported as a reasonable next step when AADs fail or are not tolerated, and contemporary pathways position ablation early for selected patients [^11166T6M] [^113P8Y5o] [^112EqJi8].

> But wait, what if ablation is not feasible or the patient prefers pharmacologic options? I should consider switching to dofetilide, which is guideline-endorsed for rhythm maintenance in HFrEF and does not require dose adjustment in CKD; I need to ensure inpatient initiation with QT monitoring and renal dosing, and I should avoid it in patients with prolonged baseline QT or significant electrolyte disturbances. Alternatively, sotalol can be considered in selected patients with preserved LV function, but I must adjust for renal function and monitor QT closely [^1116xxXV] [^114YpKwG] [^114YpKwG].

> I should double-check the role of rate control if rhythm strategies are declined or contraindicated. Lenient rate control is reasonable initially, but if symptoms persist or LV function deteriorates, stricter targets are appropriate; in HFrEF, beta-blockers and digoxin are preferred, and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided; if pharmacologic rate control fails, AV node ablation with pacing can be considered, with CRT or conduction-system pacing when appropriate [^116spYze] [^112wWpUS] [^1145nHv8].

> Let me consider the possibility that the current amiodarone regimen is suboptimal before declaring failure. If the patient never received a proper loading phase, I should confirm whether to add a short loading burst or, if already at 200 mg daily, whether a cautious increase to 300–400 mg daily could be tried transiently with close monitoring, recognizing diminishing returns and higher toxicity risk at higher chronic doses; I should confirm that any dose escalation is paired with vigilant toxicity surveillance [^115hy5wo] [^115p3MvJ].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation and cardioversion logistics if rhythm restoration is planned. I need to ensure appropriate anticoagulation per CHA₂DS₂-VASc and address bleeding risk; if AF duration is uncertain or longer than 48 hours, I should confirm TEE-guided or 3–4 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation before cardioversion, and continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after rhythm restoration, adjusting long term to stroke risk [^112wWpUS].

> I will now examine a practical, stepwise plan with shared decision-making. First, confirm the diagnosis and current amiodarone exposure, and screen comprehensively for toxicity. Second, if LVEF is reduced or symptoms are severe, prioritize catheter ablation; if ablation is not preferred, switch to dofetilide with inpatient initiation. Third, if ablation and dofetilide are unsuitable, consider sotalol in preserved LV function or accept a rate-control strategy with beta-blocker and digoxin, escalating to AV node ablation if needed. Fourth, if amiodarone is continued, use the lowest effective dose with structured toxicity monitoring and explicit stop criteria [^1116xxXV] [^1145nHv8] [^115ZRH51].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing details to avoid errors. For IV amiodarone used acutely for rate control or pharmacologic cardioversion, typical loading is 150 mg over 10 minutes followed by 360 mg over 6 hours and then 540 mg over 18 hours, with transition to oral 100–200 mg daily; for oral loading, 600–800 mg daily in divided doses to a total of about 10 g is common, then 100–200 mg daily maintenance; I need to ensure I communicate the long half-life and the need for ongoing monitoring even after dose changes [^1132C5oR] [^115hy5wo] [^112EFACu].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal follow-up and safety netting. I should arrange periodic thyroid, liver, pulmonary, ophthalmologic, and dermatologic assessments; monitor for bradycardia, QT prolongation, and drug interactions; and reassess symptoms, LV function, and AF burden at regular intervals. If ablation is pursued, I should counsel on procedural risks, success rates, and the possibility of repeat procedures, aligning choices with patient values and comorbidities [^115ZRH51] [^113P8Y5o].

For a 52-year-old with refractory atrial fibrillation on amiodarone, **catheter ablation is the preferred next step** [^112EqJi8] because it offers superior rhythm control and reduces AF burden compared to continued antiarrhythmic therapy [^113P8Y5o]. If ablation is not feasible, **switch to dofetilide** [^1116xxXV] or consider **sotalol** [^notfound] if LV function is preserved, with close monitoring for QT prolongation and proarrhythmia. Amiodarone should be tapered to the lowest effective dose (100–200 mg/day) [^1111eHN8] to limit toxicity, and ongoing surveillance for pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, and ocular adverse effects is essential [^115p3MvJ]. Rate control with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be optimized, and anticoagulation managed per CHA₂DS₂-VASc [^notfound].

---

## Clinical assessment and evaluation

### Confirm refractory atrial fibrillation

Confirm refractory atrial fibrillation by documenting **persistent or recurrent AF despite therapeutic amiodarone dosing** (typically 200 mg/day) for an adequate duration (≥ 3–6 months) [^116ahXBy]. Also assess adherence, drug interactions, and serum amiodarone/desethylamiodarone levels when available.

---

### Evaluate underlying cardiac conditions

Evaluate underlying cardiac conditions with **echocardiography** to assess LV function, atrial size, and valvular disease; obtain ECG to assess rhythm, conduction, and QT interval; and perform laboratory tests including thyroid, liver, renal function, and electrolytes (K⁺, Mg²⁺) [^115ZRH51].

---

## Alternative pharmacological strategies

### Switch to alternative antiarrhythmic drugs

- **Dofetilide**: Preferred alternative for rhythm control, especially in patients with structural heart disease or HFrEF. Requires inpatient initiation with continuous ECG monitoring and dose adjustment based on renal function and QT interval [^1116xxXV] [^115hy5wo].

- **Sotalol**: Consider if LV function is preserved. Requires inpatient initiation with QT monitoring and dose adjustment based on renal function and QT response [^113we7UH].

- **Dronedarone**: Not recommended for patients with HFrEF or persistent AF due to limited efficacy and safety concerns [^1117bXxc].

---

### Adjust amiodarone dosing

Adjust amiodarone dosing by tapering to the **lowest effective dose** (100–200 mg/day) [^1111eHN8] to minimize toxicity while maintaining rhythm control. Continue regular monitoring for adverse effects, including pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, and ocular toxicity [^115p3MvJ].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation is the **preferred next step** for refractory AF, offering superior rhythm control and symptom improvement compared to continued antiarrhythmic therapy [^113P8Y5o]. In patients with HFrEF, ablation improves LV function, quality of life, and reduces hospitalizations [^11166T6M]. Success rates vary with AF duration, atrial size, and patient comorbidities, and repeat procedures may be necessary [^112ibJR9].

---

### Atrioventricular node ablation with pacemaker implantation

Consider AV node ablation with pacemaker implantation for **refractory rate control** or when rhythm control is not achievable. This strategy effectively controls ventricular rate but results in pacemaker dependence [^1145nHv8].

---

## Monitoring and management of amiodarone toxicity

### Regular surveillance

Regular surveillance should include **pulmonary function tests** (PFTs) and high-resolution CT if respiratory symptoms develop, given the risk of pulmonary fibrosis [^115p3MvJ]. Also monitor liver function tests (LFTs) for hepatotoxicity, thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) for hypo- or hyperthyroidism, and ophthalmologic exams for corneal deposits and optic neuropathy [^115p3MvJ].

---

### Management of adverse effects

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Discontinue amiodarone immediately; consider corticosteroids in severe cases.

- **Hepatic toxicity**: Discontinue amiodarone if significant liver enzyme elevation or hepatitis occurs.

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Treat hypo- or hyperthyroidism as indicated; discontinue amiodarone if severe or refractory.

- **Ocular toxicity**: Regular ophthalmologic monitoring; discontinue if significant visual impairment occurs.

---

## Rate control strategies

Optimize rate control with **beta-blockers** as first-line agents, especially in patients with HFrEF [^11488C8o]. Use nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) if LV function is preserved, and consider digoxin as adjunctive therapy, particularly in patients with HFrEF or when beta-blockers are contraindicated [^116spYze].

---

## Anticoagulation management

Anticoagulation management should follow **CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk stratification** [^notfound], with anticoagulation recommended for men with a score ≥ 2 and women with a score ≥ 3. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin unless contraindicated, with regular monitoring for bleeding complications and drug interactions [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and patient education

Follow-up should include **regular visits** to monitor rhythm status, symptom control, and adverse effects, with patient education on symptom recognition, medication adherence, and when to seek medical attention. Encourage lifestyle modifications — weight loss, blood pressure control, alcohol moderation, and sleep apnea management — to reduce AF burden and improve outcomes [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Catheter ablation | Preferred next step for refractory AF |
| Dofetilide | Alternative antiarrhythmic drug |
| Sotalol | Consider if LV function preserved |
| Amiodarone dose adjustment | Taper to lowest effective dose (100–200 mg/day) |
| Rate control | Optimize with beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin |
| Anticoagulation | Per CHA₂DS₂-VASc risk stratification |
| Monitoring | Regular surveillance for amiodarone toxicity |

---

For a 52-year-old with refractory AF on amiodarone, **catheter ablation is the preferred next step** [^112EqJi8]; if not feasible, switch to dofetilide or sotalol with close monitoring, and taper amiodarone to the lowest effective dose to limit toxicity [^1111eHN8]. Optimize rate control, manage anticoagulation per CHA₂DS₂-VASc [^notfound], and monitor closely for adverse effects.

Amiodarone — uncontrolled studies in refractory or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) report longer-term outcomes and dosing context: in 89 patients with persistent AF after failed prior treatments, 53% were in sinus rhythm after 3 y of therapy; in another study of 110 patients with refractory AF or atrial flutter after a median of 2 failed class I agents, amiodarone (268 plus or minus 100 mg daily) was associated with recurrence in 9% of persistent AF and 40% of paroxysmal AF over 5 y. As an agent of last resort after failed cardioversion, 200 mg daily appeared effective, with 52% undergoing repeated cardioversion with success for 12 mo.

### Amiodarone in the management of refractory atrial fibrillation… [^116ahXBy]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Thirty-eight patients were studied to evaluate amiodarone hydrochloride in the treatment of refractory atrial fibrillation. Among them were 25 with sustained atrial fibrillation and 13 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. All patients were symptomatic and refractory to therapeutic doses of at least two conventional drug trials, and patients with atrial fibrillation had relapsed from electroversion. Amiodarone hydrochloride was administered in doses of 5 mg/kg intravenously, then 600 to 800 mg/d for seven to ten days, followed by 200 to 400 mg/d. Holter recordings were obtained every one to three months. The effect of amiodarone on the ventricular rate during sustained atrial fibrillation was evaluated in 18 patients and decreased from 99/min at baseline to 75/min at follow-up before conversion. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm occurred in 19 patients, including 11 with and eight without directcurrent cardioversion.

During long-term treatment, sinus rhythm was sustained on an average of 16 months in 20 patients. This included 11 of 25 patients with sustained atrial fibrillation and nine of 13 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with only four of these patients relapsing. Four patients developed intolerable side effects, but no serious toxic effects were encountered, perhaps because of the relatively low doses of amiodarone hydrochloride that were used. Amiodarone is a safe and effective alternative to standard therapy in patients with refractory sustained or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Blevins RD, Kerin NZ, Benaderet D, et al.

### A practical guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone: 2007 [^113L8aRS]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. Over- and under-use of amiodarone is common, and data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Because of adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to deriving optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000, reviews indications for use of amiodarone and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects. The recommendations included herein are based on the best available data and the collective experience of the member of the writing committee.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Agents with proven efficacy to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) — evidence summary and amiodarone: Thirty-six controlled trials evaluating 7 antiarrhythmic drugs for maintenance were identified, including 14 trials in paroxysmal AF and 22 trials in persistent AF. Available evidence suggests that amiodarone is more effective than either class I drugs, sotalol, or placebo for long-term maintenance in patients refractory to other drugs, but it is associated with a relatively high incidence of potentially severe extracardiac toxic effects, making it a second-line or last-resort agent in many cases. The use of low-dose amiodarone (200 mg daily or less) may be effective and associated with fewer side effects. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and/or previous myocardial infarction (MI), amiodarone is associated with a low risk of proarrhythmia, making it an appropriate initial choice to prevent recurrent AF in these situations, and it provides the added benefit of effective rate control, frequently eliminating the need for other drugs to control the ventricular rate. In the CTAF trial context, a majority of the 403 patients had first-time paroxysmal (46%) or persistent (54%) AF of less than 6-month duration.

### Medical management of atrial fibrillation: future directions [^114LANvJ]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia that requires treatment, and although ablation is appropriate in many cases, anti-arrhythmic drug therapy remains the first and most appropriate therapy in most patients. Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs are limited by modest efficacy and significant toxicity. Cardiac toxicity relates to effects on the ventricle, especially in prolonging the QT interval and causing torsades de pointes. Amiodarone, an agent with multiple antiarrhythmic effects, is unique in its relative lack of pro-arrhythmia, although its non-cardiac toxicities limit its use. Some investigational agents are directed at multiple ion channels, or are designed to be analogs of amiodarone. The other line of investigation focuses on the antiarrhythmic action of agents that affect novel ion channel targets. Basic and early clinical studies show promise for drugs that provide atrial antiarrhythmic effects without ventricular pro-arrhythmia by affecting the atrium preferentially or selectively (inhibiting the I(TO) and I(Kur) currents, respectively). Future drugs may possess preferential effects on the remodeled atrium (and as such would be selective for patients with atrial fibrillation). It is hoped that efforts to develop new drugs, including those with preferential effects on the atrium, will provide therapy with greater efficacy and safety.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^115ZRH51]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery — supportive text on rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation states that "The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented" and that "Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective". Rate control or rhythm control "are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients" because "neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients", and "patients in the rhythm-control group received amiodarone". "Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed", "routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone". A review of "8 observational studies that included 15 335 patients found a protective impact on the mortality rate at 5 years but no differences in thromboembolic events" with anticoagulants. "In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days"; in a randomized trial, if AF "remained" or "recurrent" "48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days, unless complications occurred", and "Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to determine underlying rhythm". Postdischarge, "The need for a rhythm-control strategy should be evaluated", as patients on rate control "often convert spontaneously after 6 to 8 weeks", with "earlier discharge" for hemodynamically stable patients; those not converting "can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy". For poorly controlled AF, "cardioversion is reasonable", and for those with " > 48 hours" of AF, "imaging of the LA (even if surgically closed) should be considered".

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — amiodarone for prevention of recurrent AF around electrical cardioversion: In patients with persistent AF, treatment with amiodarone for 6 wk before and after cardioversion increased the conversion rate and the likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm and reduced supraventricular ectopic activity that may trigger recurrent AF, and prophylactic treatment with amiodarone was also effective when an initial attempt at direct-current cardioversion had failed. In patients with persistent AF randomly assigned to carvedilol, amiodarone, or placebo 6 d before direct-current cardioversion, the 2 drugs yielded similar cardioversion rates, but amiodarone proved superior at maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion.

### Prescribing amiodarone: an evidence-based review of clinical indications [^115p3MvJ]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although amiodarone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration only for refractory ventricular arrhythmias, it is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic medications in the United States.

Objective

To evaluate and synthesize evidence regarding optimal use of amiodarone for various arrhythmias.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other studies with clinical pertinence. The search was limited to human-participant, English-language reports published between 1970 and 2007. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, electrical storm, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, surgery, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and Wolff-Parkinson-White. Bibliographies of identified articles and guidelines from official societies were reviewed for additional references. Ninety-two identified studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review.

Evidence Synthesis

Amiodarone may have clinical value in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation, though other agents are available. Amiodarone is useful in acute management of sustained ventricular tachyarrythmias, regardless of hemodynamic stability. The only role for prophylactic amiodarone is in the perioperative period of cardiac surgery. Amiodarone may be effective as an adjunct to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy to reduce number of shocks. However, amiodarone has a number of serious adverse effects, including corneal microdeposits (> 90%), optic neuropathy/neuritis (≤ 1%-2%), blue-gray skin discoloration (4%-9%), photosensitivity (25%-75%), hypothyroidism (6%), hyperthyroidism (0.9%-2%), pulmonary toxicity (1%-17%), peripheral neuropathy (0.3% annually), and hepatotoxicity (elevated enzyme levels, 15%-30%; hepatitis and cirrhosis, < 3% [0.6% annually]).

Conclusion

Amiodarone should be used with close follow-up in patients who are likely to derive the most benefit, namely those with atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction, those with acute sustained ventricular arrhythmias, those about to undergo cardiac surgery, and those with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and symptomatic shocks.

### Amiodarone therapy for atrial rhythm control: insights gained from a single center experience [^111JhZKr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone has been advocated as an effective "long-term" therapy for atrial rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to assess the sustainability of this therapeutic strategy.

Methods and Results

Retrospective analysis of a consecutive, single-center cohort (n = 168) with symptomatic AF who were treated with amiodarone and followed for 3 years. The incidence of amiodarone cessation was evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 years and attributed principally to drug inefficacy, intolerance, or toxicity. A gradual diminution in the number of patients on therapy was observed, such that by 3 years, only 45% remained. This was attributable to inefficacy (25%), intolerance (12%), or toxicity (18%). Pulmonary toxicity was surprisingly common, occurring in at least 7% of patients.

Conclusions

These data challenge the notion of amiodarone as a reasonable "destination" therapy for AF.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^112ibJR9]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drugs

Antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF and HFrEF are limited to dofetilide or amiodarone; however, dofetilide is not approved in Europe. Both drugs have associated safety concerns (see Table 2). Other AAD are not recommended for general use in HFrEF. When antiarrhythmic medications are used to treat AF in patients with HF, every effort should be made to avoid toxicity.

Table 2
Antiarrhythmic drug therapy for atrial fibrillation in heart failure

Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation has been shown to significantly improve freedom from AF in patients who have failed AAD, and avoids their toxicity. Accordingly, the use of catheter ablation has increased in clinical practice. Observational data suggest that in patients with AF and HF, LVEF improves by 11.1% after ablation (95% CI 7.1–15.2). Higher recurrence rates of AF are seen after ablation in patients with HF, leading to a need for additional ablation procedures. The PABA-CHF pilot study compared a rate-control approach with atrioventricular (AV) node ablation and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), vs. catheter ablation in 81 patients with drug-refractory AF and mild-to-moderate HF. In the ablation group, 71% maintained sinus rhythm without AAD. The patients randomized to ablation had better HF-related quality of life, better 6-min walk times, and greater improvement in LVEF. Similar findings were reported in the ARC-HF trial of 52 HFrEF patients randomized to ablation or rate control with β-blockers/digoxin. More recently, pre-publication results from the Ablation vs. Amiodarone for Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure and an Implanted ICD/CRTD trial suggest promising results for catheter ablation in this patient group, including greater maintenance of sinus rhythm. While there is debate as to which ablative approach is most effective for restoring sinus rhythm in patients with persistent forms of AF, the Substrate and Trigger Ablation for Reduction of Atrial Fibrillation Trial Part II demonstrated that neither additional linear ablation nor ablation of complex fractionated electrograms improves efficacy. Larger, more definitive trials are underway to help clarify whether ablation leads to improved CV outcomes in patients with AF and HF.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of pre-treatment and short-or long-term maintenance therapy with amiodarone supporting DC cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation [^114SdYis]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

The efficacy of cardioversion (DCCV) for restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) in persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is limited by a high relapse rate. Relapse may be reduced by amiodarone but no placebo-controlled trials of efficacy have been performed and the appropriate duration of therapy is unknown.

Methods and Results

In this double-blind study, 161 subjects with persistent AF were randomized to one of three groups-placebo (n = 38); amiodarone 400mg BD for 2 weeks prior to DCCV and 200mg daily for 8 weeks followed by placebo for 44 weeks (n = 62, short-term amiodarone); amiodarone 400mg BD for 2 weeks then 200mg daily for 52 weeks (n = 61, long-term amiodarone). Spontaneous reversion to SR occurred before DCCV in 21% (26/123) patients on amiodarone and none of the 38 patients on placebo (absolute difference 21%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 10 to 29%, P = 0.002). At 8 weeks following DCCV, 51% (63/123) patients on amiodarone remained in SR compared to 16% (6/38) taking placebo (difference-35% 95% CI: -48 to -18%, P < 0.001). At 1 year, 49% (30/61) patients on long-term amiodarone were in SR compared to 33% (21/62) taking short-term amiodarone (difference-15%, 95% CI: -31 to 2%, P = 0.085). There was no difference in adverse event rate or quality of life scores between groups.

Conclusions

Amiodarone pre-treatment before electrical DCCV for persistent AF allows chemical conversion in one-fifth of patients without altering the efficacy of subsequent DC conversion. Amiodarone is more effective than placebo in the maintenance of SR when continued for 8 weeks following successful DCCV. More patients taking long-term amiodarone remained in SR at 52 weeks, but more had serious adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy. Eight weeks of adjuvant therapy with amiodarone following successful DCCV may be the preferred option.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC atrial fibrillation — recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: In patients who experience brief or minimally symptomatic recurrences, it is reasonable to avoid antiarrhythmic drugs, but troublesome symptoms generally call for suppressive antiarrhythmic therapy, and rate control and prevention of thromboembolism are appropriate in both situations. For individuals with no or minimal heart disease, flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol is recommended as initial antiarrhythmic therapy, and for patients who tolerate these agents an as-needed, pill-in-the-pocket approach may reduce toxicity. If these drugs prove ineffective or cause side effects, second- or third-line choices include amiodarone, dofetilide, disopyramide, procainamide, or quinidine, and as an alternative when first-line drugs fail or are not tolerated, PV isolation or LA substrate modification may be considered. When a consistent initiating scenario suggests vagally mediated AF, disopyramide or flecainide are appropriate initial agents, and a beta blocker or sotalol is suggested for adrenergically induced AF; in particularly symptomatic patients, LA ablation may be considered when antiarrhythmic drug treatment alone fails. For patients with heart failure, safety data support selecting amiodarone or dofetilide to maintain sinus rhythm. In coronary artery disease, sotalol is considered first unless heart failure is present, with amiodarone and dofetilide considered secondary and disopyramide, procainamide, or quinidine on an individual basis. In hypertension without left ventricular hypertrophy, flecainide and propafenone are recommended first, with amiodarone, dofetilide, or sotalol as secondary choices and disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine considered third-line; in left ventricular hypertrophy, amiodarone is suggested as first-line therapy.

### Ablation versus amiodarone for treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation in patients with congestive heart failure and an implanted device: results from the AATAC multicenter randomized trial [^11166T6M]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The study AATAC was published by Di Biase L and colleagues in 2016 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation and Heart failure. In the AATAC study, the trial question was: is catheter ablation superior to amiodarone for the treatment of persistent AF in patients with HF? In the AATAC study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the AATAC study, the population was: 203 patients (52 female, 151 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with persistent AF, dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator or CRT defibrillator, NYHA II to III and LVEF < 40% within the past 6 months. The key exclusion criteria were AF caused by a reversible etiology, and presence of valvular or coronary artery disease requiring surgical intervention, early postoperative AF (within 3 months of surgery), or a life expectancy ≤ 2 years, prolonged QT interval, hypothyroidism, history of severe pulmonary disease, and liver failure, or patients receiving a regular dose of AMIO (≥ 200 mg/d). In the AATAC study, the interventions were: n = 102 catheter ablation (pulmonary vein antrum isolation with an open-irrigation tip catheter ablation) n = 101 amiodarone (loading dose given in divided doses of 400 mg PO BID for 2 weeks followed by 400 mg daily for the next 2 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg daily). In the AATAC study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in freedom from AF recurrence (70% vs. 34%; RR 2.05, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.27). In the AATAC study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the rate of unplanned hospitalization over the 2-year follow-up (31% vs. 57%; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.76) Significant decrease in death from all causes (8% vs. 18%; RR 0.44, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.96). In the AATAC study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in groin hematoma, pericardial effusion. significant differences in change in LVEF (8.3% vs. 5.0%), 6-minute walk distance (19 m vs. 6 m), and Minnesota Living with HF Questionnaire (10 vs. 5.0). In the AATAC study, the conclusion was: in patients with persistent AF, dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator or CRT defibrillator, NYHA II to III and LVEF < 40% within the past 6 months, catheter ablation was superior to amiodarone with respect to freedom from AF recurrence.

### Amiodarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation… [^111RPp6K]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Five percent of persons older than 65 years experience atrial fibrillation — the most common cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment. Complications associated with atrial fibrillation include congestive heart failure and reduced exercise tolerance. This condition also increases the risk of stroke fourfold in patients not receiving anticoagulation. It is often possible to restore patients with atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm through cardioversion or with medical therapy; however, the arrhythmia recurs within six months in one half of patients. Patients with atrial fibrillation lasting more than 48 hours were anticoagulated to obtain an International Normalized Ratio of 2 or higher for at least three weeks. They were then randomized to receive amiodarone, sotalol or propafenone in an open-label fashion. Cardioversion was performed in patients who had not converted to sinus rhythm after two weeks of amiodarone therapy or after four days of the other two medications.

Patients were seen at three months after randomization, and every six months thereafter. The primary end point was the length of time to a first electrocardiographically confirmed recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Secondary end points were thromboembolic events, death and adverse events caused by the study drugs. A total of 403 patients were enrolled in the study. There were slightly more men than women, and the mean age for both groups of patients was 65 ± 11 years. During a mean follow-up period of 468 ± 150 days, 71 patients in the amiodarone group had a recurrence of atrial fibrillation compared with 127 patients who were given sotalol or propafenone. With regard to major clinical events, nine deaths occurred in the amiodarone group and eight deaths in the patients receiving sotalol or propafenone. Eighteen percent of patients in the amiodarone group required treatment for a major clinical event compared with 17 percent in the second group.

However, strokes and intracranial hemorrhages were less common in the amiodarone group. Sixty-eight patients in the amiodarone group and 93 patients in the second group stopped taking their medication because of lack of efficacy or adverse events. Four patients who were taking amiodarone had suspected pulmonary toxicity, although it was only proved in one patient. Adverse cardiac events were rare and occurred equally in both study groups.

### Control of refractory cardiac arrhythmias with amiodarone… [^114QPt6X]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Amiodarone hydrochloride was used to treat 19 patients with symptomatic arrhythmias refractory to quinidine sulfate, procainamide hydrochloride, disopyramide phosphate, antazoline hydrochloride, lidocaine hydrochloride, bretylium tosylate, propranolol hydrochloride, phenytoin sodium, and practolol acetanilide given to the limit of tolerance. In 17 patients, attacks were completely controlled. Arrhythmias treated successfully included recurrent supraventricular tachycardias, recurrent supraventricular tachycardias with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and refractory ventricular arrhythmias including recurrent ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation complicating acute coronary heart disease. Control was confirmed by continuous ECG monitoring both in the hospital and when ambulatory and was maintained for up to four years. Attacks of supraventricular tachycardia were reduced from 7. 9/mo to one attack every
53. 5 months on amiodarone.

Hospital admissions for arrhythmias were reduced from 34 the year before treatment to none the year after. Therefore, amiodarone is an excellent drug for control of many refractory arrhythmias, but two patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation were refractory to this treatment. Leak D, Eydt JN.

Sotalol — role in atrial fibrillation — Sotalol is not effective for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm, but it may be used to prevent AF. Placebo-controlled studies found it safe and effective at doses ranging from 80 to 160 mg twice daily. In the CTAF study, sotalol and propafenone were less effective than amiodarone. In an uncontrolled stepped-care study beginning with propafenone and then sotalol after failure, paroxysmal AF occurred in nearly 50% of patients and only 27% with persistent AF converted to sinus rhythm at 6 mo. In recurrent AF after cardioversion, propafenone was as effective as sotalol in maintaining sinus rhythm 1 y after cardioversion. Sotalol should be avoided in patients with asthma, HF, renal insufficiency, or QT interval prolongation.

Out-of-hospital initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in atrial fibrillation — A frequent issue is whether to initiate therapy in hospital or on an outpatient basis, with concern for serious adverse effects including torsades de pointes; virtually all pharmacological cardioversion studies (except those with low-dose oral amiodarone) have involved hospitalized patients, but one study provided a clinically useful approach with out-of-hospital patient-controlled conversion using class IC drugs. The pill-in-the-pocket strategy consists of self-administration of a single oral dose shortly after the onset of symptomatic AF to improve quality of life, decrease hospital admission, and reduce cost. Recommendations differ for paroxysmal versus persistent AF: for paroxysmal AF the aims are to terminate an episode or prevent recurrence, whereas for persistent AF the aims are to achieve pharmacological cardioversion, obviate direct-current cardioversion, or enhance its success by lowering the defibrillation threshold and prevent early recurrence. In patients with lone AF without structural heart disease, class IC drugs may be initiated on an outpatient basis, and for other selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, pill-in-the-pocket administration of propafenone and flecainide outside the hospital becomes an option once treatment has proved safe in hospital.

Atrial fibrillation in cardiac amyloidosis — management: The reported prevalence of atrial fibrillation may be as high as 56% in AL amyloidosis and 70% in ATTR-CM, and the risk for intracardiac thrombus may be as high as 33% with events even on chronic anticoagulation. Consensus statements and guidelines recommend anticoagulation when atrial fibrillation is present, and transesophageal echocardiography to evaluate for left atrial appendage thrombus is necessary before cardioversion regardless of the duration of anticoagulation. There is insufficient randomized clinical trial evidence to inform the use of direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in cardiac amyloidosis. Left atrial appendage closure devices can be considered when anticoagulation is contraindicated, though data is lacking. Ventricular response rates tend not to be elevated; low-dose beta-blockade may be effective if tolerated without hypotension, and atrioventricular junctional ablation with permanent pacemaker placement may be a reasonable last option for refractory cases. Although digoxin has historically been believed to be contraindicated due to in vitro binding to amyloid fibrils, more recent data suggests it may be used for rate control with close monitoring. Rhythm control can be considered if symptoms persist despite rate control, with amiodarone generally well tolerated as a first-line agent, and published data suggest higher catheter ablation success in earlier-stage disease.

### Amiodarone after surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation: is it really necessary? A prospective randomized controlled trial [^11142CQA]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) treatment is a well-established practice after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), but it is controversial after surgical ablation. This prospective randomized controlled trial examined whether amiodarone after surgical ablation reduced atrial arrhythmia recurrence within the first 3 months after surgery.

Methods

Ninety patients were randomized to receive (n = 45) or not receive (n = 45) amiodarone after surgical ablation. Rhythm status was ascertained via clinical follow-up and 72-hour continuous monitoring at 6 and 12 weeks, using Heart Rhythm Society guidelines. Primary outcome was defined as atrial arrhythmia recurrence, cardioversion, ablation, or crossover from no-amiodarone to amiodarone as a result of atrial arrhythmia during follow-up. An intention-to-treat approach was used.

Results

The 2 study groups were similar in traditional predictors for failure, including left atrium size (5.0 vs 5.1 cm, P = 0.734), median AF duration (23 vs 20 months, P = 0.513), and long-standing persistent AF (44% vs 33%, P = 0.280). The primary outcome occurred in 52% of the no-amiodarone group (23 of 44) and 19% of the amiodarone group (8 of 43; P = 0.001). Cumulative freedom from primary outcome was greater in the amiodarone group (81.4% vs 47.7%, P < .001). Amiodarone was discontinued in 18 patients randomized to amiodarone for side effects, bradycardia, or noncompliance.

Conclusions

Prophylactic amiodarone reduced early atrial arrhythmia recurrence. These results are consistent with catheter AF ablation findings and should inform recommendations for prophylactic class I/III AAD after surgical AF ablation, regardless of discharge rhythm status. As previously recommended, monitoring for side effects and amiodarone discontinuation by 3 months, for patients in sinus rhythm, is warranted.

### Medical management of atrial fibrillation: state of the art [^11736o7w]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Predominantly a disease of advancing age, atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Its prevalence is rising as the proportion of elderly people in the population continues its inexorable rise. Without more effective therapeutic interventions, AF-related cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality will also continue to rise. Antiarrhythmic drugs are an essential tool in the management of AF and may be used as premedication before cardioversion; together with cardioversion to help or assist cardioversion; or given afterward to prevent recurrence. If AF recurs after one or two cardioversions, then it is usual to adopt a rate control strategy; highly symptomatic patients who fail cardioversion may benefit from ablation therapy. We are already on the threshold of a large expansion in the use of ablation therapy, a strategy that has potential to deliver dramatic improvements in outcome. Not only can AF be cured by ablative therapy, but there is also evidence that it confers functional improvement as well. It will not, however, be appropriate for all AF patients and pharmacological therapies will continue to have an important place in the management of AF. The plethora of antiarrhythmic drugs currently available for the treatment of AF is a reflection that none is wholly satisfactory, each having limited efficacy combined with poor safety and tolerability. Improved class III antiarrhythmic agents, such as dronedarone; new classes of antiarrhythmic agents, such as atrial repolarization delaying agents; and upstream therapies dealing with substrate represent potential sources of new pharmacological therapies for AF.

It is reasonable to use ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) node or accessory pathway to control heart rate when pharmacological therapy is insufficient or causes side effects (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous amiodarone can be useful to control heart rate when other measures are unsuccessful or contraindicated (Level of Evidence: C). When electrical cardioversion is not necessary in AF with an accessory pathway, intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is a reasonable alternative (Level of Evidence: C).

Atrial fibrillation — treatment algorithm for pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm lists options by left ventricular (LV) function and setting. In patients with normal LV function, IV amiodarone or ibutilide (2a) are listed, and procainamide may be considered when amiodarone and ibutilide are not optimal; recommend avoidance of IV procainamide after amiodarone or ibutilide. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 40%), IV amiodarone (2a) is listed. For AF occurring outside the hospital in patients with normal LV function ("pill‑in‑the‑pocket"), flecainide or propafenone (2a) are listed. Use is "in the absence of preexcitation", the first dose is administered in a monitored facility, and IV amiodarone requires several hours for efficacy whereas ibutilide is generally effective in 30 to 90 min but carries higher risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.

Implantable cardioverter–defibrillator recipients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and frequent appropriate ICD firing — management: This extreme has been called defibrillator (tachycardia) storm and requires the addition of antiarrhythmic drugs and/or catheter ablation to control recurrent VT and associated ICD shocks; sotalol is effective in suppressing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and combining beta blockers with amiodarone is an alternative. Because many such patients have low EF and poor renal function, amiodarone and beta blockers rather than sotalol can be the first-line therapy; sotalol should be avoided in patients with severely depressed left ventricular function or significant heart failure, and intravenous amiodarone has been useful.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation — recommendations for pharmacological cardioversion state that administration of flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, or ibutilide is recommended for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). Administration of amiodarone is a reasonable option for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). A single oral bolus dose of propafenone or flecainide (pill-in-the-pocket) can be administered to terminate persistent AF outside the hospital once treatment has proved safe in hospital for selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, and before antiarrhythmic medication is initiated, a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist should be given to prevent rapid AV conduction in the event atrial flutter occurs (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of amiodarone can be beneficial on an outpatient basis in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF when rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is not deemed necessary (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of quinidine or procainamide might be considered for pharmacological cardioversion of AF, but the usefulness of these agents is not well established (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin and sotalol may be harmful when used for pharmacological cardioversion of AF and are not recommended (Level of Evidence: A). Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and dofetilide should not be started out of hospital for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm (Level of Evidence: B).

Atrial flutter ongoing management — Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is useful in patients with atrial flutter that is either symptomatic or refractory to pharmacological rate control, and beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful to control the ventricular rate in patients with hemodynamically tolerated atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is useful in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter after failure of at least 1 antiarrhythmic agent, and ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). For rhythm maintenance in symptomatic, recurrent atrial flutter, the following drugs can be useful with the drug choice depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities: amiodarone, dofetilide, or sotalol. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF, and catheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options; flecainide or propafenone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic recurrent atrial flutter; and catheter ablation may be reasonable for asymptomatic patients with recurrent atrial flutter.

We present two patients who had life-threatening arrhythmias, which are highly likely to be secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, occasionally its use can transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions and contra-indications of amiodarone as well as the need for vigilance following initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^114cfQvB]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with new-onset AF who are treated with amiodarone should receive a loading dose, immediately followed by an infusion. Clinicians should consider continuing amiodarone infusions in patients who are receiving inotropes until the inotrope is ceased. Patients who have pre-existing congestive cardiac failure or SIRS diagnosed on admission into ICU are at a greater risk of recurrence of AF. Vigilance of magnesium replacement, avoiding excessive volume depletion and the resolution of SIRS would appear a reasonable approach to limit AF recurrence, particularly as many known parameters are managed routinely within a tight range for patients in the ICU. A clear dosing guide is not available and further research is required to elicit the best dosing strategy.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

The management of atrial fibrillation (AF) is plagued by, among other things, limitations in the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of currently available agents for the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm. This review describes some of the most promising approaches to new therapies that may overcome some of the limitations of our current therapies. The agents we have chosen to review are representative of these new approaches and have completed their phase III trials and have submitted an application for approval for release by regulatory agencies or have almost completed their phase III trials and appear likely to submit for approval in the not to distant future.

### How to manage atrial fibrillation secondary to ibrutinib [^111qxtMT]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Continued

Six months later, the patient was tolerating his anticoagulation and beta-blocker, and was asymptomatic.

It is important to follow patients with new AF. This is particularly important if the proarrhythmogenic treatment is continuing because their symptom load may increase. If this patient started complaining of increasing palpitations and shortness of breath, it would be prudent to increase his rate control medication. If his symptoms were refractory to maximal medical therapy, he would then be considered for a rhythm control strategy, which can include medications, or more invasive management such as atrioventricular node ablation and pacemaker insertion or radiofrequency ablation. If a rhythm control strategy is pursued, it is advisable to avoid CYP3A4 inhibitors such as amiodarone, diltiazem, and verapamil. Generally, it is accepted that Class 1B and 1C antiarrhythmic drugs are the least likely to cause drug–drug interactions with ibrutinib. An electrical cardioversion strategy can also be considered. An alternative rhythm control strategy could potentially involve acalabrutinib. This is a second-generation BTK inhibitor that is more selective and has thus far demonstrated lower rates of AF and bleeding.

Our treatment decisions throughout the case were guided by the AF Better Care (ABC) pathway, which our group has pioneered (Figure 1). The ABC pathway proposes a streamlined approach to holistic AF management that is applicable to primary and secondary care: A, Avoid stroke/Anticoagulation; B, Better symptom management, with patient-centered symptom-directed decisions on rate or rhythm control; and C, Cardiovascular risk factor and Comorbidity management, including addressing lifestyle factors.

Figure 1
The ABC Pathway Applied to Oncology Patients

The ABC (AF Better Care) pathway can be used to provide holistic management of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Step A focuses on avoiding stroke via utilization of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score and treatment of modifiable bleeding risk factors via the HAS-BLED score. Step B focuses on symptom control in AF and the decision between rate versus rhythm control. Step C focuses on management of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.

### Pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation: current therapeutic strategies [^117ATJch]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common form of sustained arrhythmia, is associated with a frightening risk of embolic complications, tachycardia-related ventricular dysfunction, and often disabling symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy is the treatment used most commonly to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, to prevent recurrences, or to control ventricular response rate.

Methods

This article reviews published data on pharmacologic treatment and discusses alternative systems to classify AF and to choose appropriate pharmacologic therapy.

Results

AF is either paroxysmal or chronic. Attacks of paroxysmal AF can differ in duration, frequency, and functional tolerance. In the new classification system described, 3 clinical aspects of paroxysmal AF are distinguished on the basis of their implications for therapy. Chronic AF usually occurs in association with clinical conditions that cause atrial distention. The risk of chronic AF is significantly increased by the presence of congestive heart failure or rheumatic heart disease. Mortality rate is greater among patients with chronic AF regardless of the presence of coexisting cardiac disease. The various options available for the treatment of chronic AF include restoration of sinus rhythm or control of ventricular rate. Cardioversion may be accomplished with pharmacologic or electrical treatment. For patients in whom cardioversion is not indicated or who have not responded to this therapy, antiarrhythmic agents used to control ventricular response rate include nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists, digoxin, or beta-blockers. For patients who are successfully cardioverted, sodium channel blockers or potassium channel blockers such as sotalol, amiodarone, or a pure class III agent such as dofetilide, a selective potassium channel blocker, may be used to prevent recurrent AF to maintain normal sinus rhythm.

Conclusions

The ultimate choice of the antiarrhythmic drug will depend on the presence or absence of structural heart disease. An additional concern with chronic AF is the risk of arterial embolization resulting from atrial stasis and the formation of thrombi. In patients with chronic AF the risk of embolic stroke is increased 6-fold. Therefore anticoagulant therapy should be considered in patients at high risk for embolization. Selection of the appropriate treatment should be based on the concepts recently developed by the Sicilian Gambit Group (based on the specific channels blocked by the antiarrhythmic agent) and on clinical experience gained over the years with antiarrhythmic agents. For example, termination of AF is best accomplished with either a sodium channel blocker (class I agent) or a potassium channel blocker (class III agent). In contrast, ventricular response rate is readily controlled by a beta-blocker (propranolol) or a calcium channel blocker (verapamil). Alternatively, antiarrhythmic drug therapy may be chosen based on the Vaughan-Williams classification, which identifies the cellular electrophysiologic effects of the drug.

### Update on atrial fibrillation: part II [^114hp7vC]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drugs are an essential tool in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). Although we are already on the threshold of a large expansion in the use of ablation therapies, these will not, however, be appropriate for all patients, and pharmacological therapies will continue to have an important place in the management of atrial fibrillation. The plethora of antiarrhythmic drugs currently available for the treatment of atrial fibrillation is a reflection that none is wholly satisfactory, each having limited efficacy combined with poor safety and tolerability. Improved class III antiarrhythmic drugs, such as dronedarone, new classes of antiarrhythmic agents, such as atrial repolarization delaying agents, and upstream therapies dealing with substrate, represent potential sources of new pharmacological therapies.

Acute heart failure arrhythmia management — supraventricular rhythm control — notes that given its relatively rapid onset of action and superior safety profile in HF, intravenous amiodarone for life-threatening arrhythmias during acute HF has gained widespread acceptance, and in acutely ill HF, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter may impose hemodynamic decompensation requiring aggressive therapy; poorly tolerated SVT may be better treated acutely by synchronous cardioversion at relatively low energies (e.g., 50 to 100 J biphasic), verapamil may be effective for recurrent AV node–dependent SVTs but care should be taken due to negative inotropic effects, and intravenous amiodarone may be more effective at rate control of AF or atrial flutter and may restore sinus rhythm; in HF, amiodarone alone or with electrical cardioversion is effective at slowing the heart rate and achieving cardioversion, and for unstable arrhythmia cardioversion is appropriate with amiodarone preferred for longer-term administration and generally well tolerated hemodynamically.

Part 3: arrhythmias

A 56-year-old female with history of hypertension, CAD, chronic kidney disease, and immunoglobulin Gκ multiple myeloma was admitted for treatment with B-cell maturation antigen–directed CAR T cells (idecabtagene vicleucel). On day 3, she developed fever and tachycardia consistent with grade 1 CRS and was placed on telemetry. She was noted to have new-onset atrial fibrillation. She was hemodynamically stable but off her antihypertensive medications. The patient was treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab and corticosteroids but her atrial fibrillation persisted, so she was started on amiodarone and placed on telemetry.

We recommend placing all patients who develop CRS on telemetry for monitoring of arrhythmias, if feasible, especially if patients develop grade 2 CRS. Arrhythmias are common after CAR T-cell therapy and consist of approximately two-thirds of the cardiovascular complications after CAR T-cell therapy. On the basis of data from the FDA adverse event reporting system of CD19 CAR T cells, 74% of reported arrhythmias were atrial fibrillation or flutter and 18% were ventricular tachycardias. In the setting of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation with low blood pressure, we may use amiodarone because CRS-related hypotension may often preclude patients from beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for rate control. For patients with a preserved blood pressure, beta-blockers are commonly used as first-line therapy. These patients usually cannot receive anticoagulants to prevent atrial fibrillation–related embolism, and, thus, the aggressive use of amiodarone may lead to conversion to sinus rhythm. However, if atrial fibrillation persists beyond 48 hours, we typically stop the amiodarone because the risk of embolism with chemical cardioversion increases. We rarely use digoxin in this case, and digoxin should be reserved for patients in whom amiodarone is contraindicated. Patients with hemodynamic instability should be admitted to the ICU, and cardioversion should be considered. Atrial fibrillation can be paroxysmal and resolve in < 24 hours, and we do not use anticoagulation or cardiac medications frequently in that setting. These decisions should be made in consultation with a cardiologist before discharge. For those in whom the atrial fibrillation lasts longer, and stroke risk is high, we first start patients on unfractionated heparin drip when platelet counts are > 50 × 10³/μL and then discharge patients using direct-oral anticoagulants. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter during CRS will not likely need long-term anticoagulant. However, the long-term risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence is unknown, and patients will need monitoring. After discharge, we place an ambulatory cardiac monitor to evaluate for arrhythmias. If we do not detect atrial fibrillation at that time, we stop the antiarrhythmic monitoring. For those with persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter, we place an ambulatory cardiac monitor ∼4 or 6 months after treatment, and, again, if no further arrhythmias, we stop the direct-oral anticoagulant and do not pursue further treatment.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1145nHv8]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure (HF) — key guideline recommendations state that in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected, and an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control is recommended; in appropriate patients with AF and HFrEF on guideline-directed medical therapy and with reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation is beneficial to improve symptoms, quality of life (QOL), ventricular function, and cardiovascular outcomes; in symptomatic AF with HFpEF and reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms and QOL; for AF with HF, digoxin is reasonable for rate control, either with other rate-controlling agents or as monotherapy if others are not tolerated; when AF with HF presents with rapid ventricular rates and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control; in AF, HF, HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 50%) with refractory rapid ventricular response and not candidates for or failing rhythm control, atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with biventricular pacing can be useful to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; in AF and HF with implanted biventricular pacing where effective pacing percentage cannot be achieved pharmacologically, AVNA can be beneficial to improve functional class, reduce ICD shock risk, and improve survival; after recovery of LV function from AF‑induced cardiomyopathy, long-term surveillance can be beneficial to detect recurrent AF; for suspected AF‑induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms on pharmacological rate control, a stricter rate-control strategy (target heart rate ≤ 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during moderate exercise) may be reasonable; in AF and HFrEF undergoing AVNA, His bundle or left bundle branch area pacing may be reasonable as an alternative to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; and in AF with known LVEF < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered because of the potential to exacerbate HF.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — antiarrhythmic pretreatment around cardioversion and safety: Antiarrhythmic medications may be initiated out of hospital or in hospital immediately prior to direct-current cardioversion, but risks include paradoxically increasing the defibrillation threshold with flecainide, accelerating the ventricular rate when class IA or IC drugs are given without an atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agent, and inducing ventricular arrhythmias. Prophylactic drug therapy to prevent early recurrence of AF should be considered individually for each patient; pretreatment with pharmacological agents is most appropriate in patients who fail to respond to direct-current cardioversion and in those who develop immediate or subacute recurrence of AF. In patients with late recurrence and those undergoing initial cardioversion of persistent AF, pretreatment is optional. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended in conjunction with a second cardioversion attempt, particularly when early relapse has occurred, whereas additional cardioversion, beyond a second attempt, is of limited value and should be reserved for carefully selected patients; infrequently repeated cardioversions may be acceptable in patients who are highly symptomatic upon relapse to AF.

### Physician stated atrial fibrillation management in light of treatment guidelines: data from an international, observational prospective survey [^1165M99b]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The Registry on Cardiac Rhythm Disorders Assessing the Control of Atrial Fibrillation (RecordAF) study is the first worldwide, prospective, survey of real-life management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in recently diagnosed patients (n = 5604) with a 1-year follow-up.

Hypothesis

Surveys of AF management have identified a divergence between guidelines and clinical practice, and an overinterpretation of guidelines in low-risk patients.

Methods

Physicians' theoretical approaches to rhythm and rate control were investigated using a pre-study questionnaire.

Results

One cardiologist, from each of the 583 sites in 6 regions, completed a questionnaire on their practice and management of AF patients. In AF patients with structural heart disease (SHD), amiodarone was the most frequent choice of first-line rhythm control agents in all regions. Amiodarone or sotalol tended to be the preferred second-line rhythm control agents, 1 exception being Central/South America. beta-Blockers were the first-line rate control agents for patients with AF and SHD in all regions, and calcium channel blockers and cardiac glycosides were the most common second-line rate control treatments in all regions, except Asia. In lone AF patients, propafenone (30.6%), flecainide (24.1%), and amiodarone (21.7%) were the most common global choices of first-line rhythm control, and amiodarone or sotalol were the preferred second-line rhythm control agents, 1 exception being Central/South America.

Conclusions

These results highlight points of divergence from the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of AF in terms of first-line drug selection in patients with associated SHD or coronary artery disease.

### Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation… [^114wFord]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The study included 208 consecutive patients 27 to 78 years of age who presented to an emergency department or outpatient clinic because of acute or chronic atrial fibrillation. An anticoagulant was given for 21 days if the duration of atrial fibrillation could not be determined or if it had lasted for more than 48 hours. It was then given orally, 600 mg daily in three divided doses, for one week, followed by 400 mg daily for three weeks. If the patient had not previously received digoxin, digoxin was also administered during the first 24 hours. Anticoagulation was continued for 21 days after cardioversion. Patients were hospitalized for at least the first three days of treatment and were reevaluated after 30 days of therapy. One-dimensional and two-dimensional echocardiography was performed either 24 hours after conversion or at the end of the study. Thus, by the end of the first day, conversion to normal sinus rhythm had occurred in 61.

1 percent of the amiodarone group and
40. 0 percent of the placebo group. Between the second day and the 30th day, 21 additional patients who received amiodarone converted to sinus rhythm, compared with no patients in the placebo group. In all, 87 of the patients who received amiodarone converted to sinus rhythm by the 30th day, compared with 40 of the persons in the placebo group. Compared with patients who did not have successful conversion, those who converted to sinus rhythm had atrial fibrillation of a shorter duration and smaller atria. The authors conclude that amiodarone is a safe and effective method for termination of atrial fibrillation. While the conversion rate was generally high following administration of amiodarone, it fell to a relatively low level in patients with a very large left atrium or with chronic fibrillation. The conversion rate in patients with a large left atrium was 61 percent, and it was 34.

6 percent in those with chronic atrial fibrillation. The authors believe amiodarone could be a drug of first choice for atrial fibrillation, unless rapid conversion is needed.

Examples of low concordance between practice and guidelines are also numerous in other areas of cardiology 23, 26, 27, 28; as such, a variety of methods, from financial incentives 29 to tools and system redesign strategies for increasing adherence to guidelines, have been introduced in the United States. One example is the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines initiative, a quality improvement registry designed to improve adherence to AF guidelines. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 Outcomes of the initiative related to AAD use are still to be made available.

Currently, in the United States up to 6.1 million individuals have a diagnosis of AF, and the number of patients with AF is expected to double during the next 25 years, 1, 2, 3, 4 proportionately adding to the clinical burden of managing this condition among specialty HCPs as well as noncardiology HCPs. With the rates of discordance in AAD guideline prescribing appearing to continue, we underscore the implications from previous studies such as risk for serious adverse events including ventricular arrhythmias and death. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Further research revealing possible explanations of the low levels of guideline adherence and educational strategies (eg, safety considerations in the choice of AADs), 1, 2 prescribing tools, or structural changes to address the discordance are needed. Prescribing behaviors may change based on the recently released European Society of Cardiology 2020 guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of AF, which downgraded sotalol in certain patients, included ablation as a first‐line rhythm control treatment consideration, and recommended amiodarone be considered after other AADs. 5 The revised European Society of Cardiology guidelines also presented the ABC treatment pathway that promotes integrated care of patients with AF on the basis of patient attributes: (A) avoiding stroke, (B) better symptom control, and (C) managing comorbidities.

Atrial fibrillation — ibutilide and amiodarone efficacy, timing, and safety are summarized as follows. Randomized, double‑blind placebo‑controlled studies report ibutilide achieves AF conversion rates of about 30% versus 2% with placebo, with greater efficacy in atrial flutter (38%-63%), and most patients convert within 30 to 90 minutes. Ibutilide is associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes; risk is higher with reduced LVEF, HFrEF is an independent risk factor, and ibutilide is best avoided when LVEF ≤ 40%; a magnesium infusion immediately before ibutilide may mitigate torsades and excessive QT prolongation. Intravenous amiodarone is effective for conversion; a meta‑analysis reported relative risks for sinus rhythm at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours of 1.23 (P = 0.022) and 1.44 (P < 0.001), respectively, and cardioversion with IV amiodarone requires 8 to 12 hours compared with a much shorter response time with ibutilide.

Atrial fibrillation in adult congenital heart disease — antiarrhythmic drug strategy — emphasizes individualized selection and explicit drug cautions. Adults with simple forms of congenital heart disease (CHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are generally managed according to standard published guidelines, whereas in moderate or complex forms of CHD, choice of antiarrhythmic therapy should be individualized. Most antiarrhythmic drugs are associated with proarrhythmic effects and increased mortality in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), and rhythm control is generally preferred over rate control in patients with ACHD with moderate or complex disease who may tolerate AF poorly. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs must be avoided in patients with ACHD with coronary artery disease or significant subpulmonary or systemic ventricular dysfunction. Amiodarone is effective for maintaining sinus rhythm but long-term therapy is limited by adverse effects, particularly amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis; amiodarone should also be avoided in patients with ACHD who have a BMI < 21 kg/m2 due to the increased incidence of thyrotoxicosis. Dofetilide may be a viable alternative to amiodarone, whereas dronedarone is best avoided in patients with ACHD who have moderate or complex disease or significant ventricular dysfunction due to the increased risk of heart failure, stroke, and death.

ICD therapy — adverse effects, quality of life, and counseling emphasize that ICDs are highly effective in preventing death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but frequent shocks can reduce quality of life and may occur inappropriately; antiarrhythmic therapy (most often amiodarone) may be added for recurrent discharges due to ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation, and catheter ablation may be effective for recurrent discharges from ventricular tachycardia. ICDs have the potential to aggravate heart failure and have been associated with an increase in heart failure hospitalizations, possibly related to right ventricular pacing producing dyssynchrony. Before implantation, patients should be fully informed of prognosis and device risks, and patients and families should clearly understand that the ICD does not improve clinical function or delay HF progression.

Pregnancy with congenital heart disease — risk context and background management emphasize anticipatory counseling, arrhythmia burden, and thrombotic risk. Patients with CHD are at higher risk of maternal and fetal complications, morbidity, and mortality than individuals without heart disease, and clinicians should have clear discussions and take steps to mitigate risks before pregnancy. In Fontan pregnancies, supraventricular arrhythmia was the most common adverse event (8.4% of pregnancies with a range of 3–37%), generally managed conventionally; refractory, persistent arrhythmias are associated with poor fetal outcomes, so it is optimal to address arrhythmias prior to pregnancy. Thrombosis risk is increased, and in the immediate postpartum period it is as much as 4-fold higher than in the antepartum period. Atrial arrhythmias are common, with IART by far the most common (61% of patients). Cardioversion can be administered safely in unstable or drug-refractory situations, and amiodarone is generally reserved for refractory cases.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Based on multiple large randomized trials, rate control therapy has been shown to be safe and effective and is gaining greater acceptance as a frontline alternative to drugs to maintain sinus rhythm. Adequate rate control can be achieved by atrioventricular nodal blocking agents both in the acute and chronic settings.

Atrial fibrillation — propafenone for cardioversion: reported cardioversion of recent-onset AF ranged from 56% to 83%, and oral propafenone was as efficacious as flecainide but superior to oral amiodarone and quinidine plus digoxin. Limited data suggest reduced efficacy in patients with persistent AF, in conversion of atrial flutter, and in patients with structural heart disease. Adverse effects are uncommon but include rapid atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, intraventricular conduction disturbances, hypotension, and bradycardia on conversion. Available data on propafenone loading in organic heart disease are scant; this agent should be used cautiously or not at all for conversion of AF in such cases and should be avoided in patients with HF or severe obstructive lung disease.

### Continuous vs episodic prophylactic treatment with amiodarone for the prevention of atrial fibrillation: a randomized trial [^116fjBXm]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Amiodarone effectively suppresses atrial fibrillation but causes many adverse events.

Objective

To compare major events in patients randomized to receive episodic amiodarone treatment with those who received continuous amiodarone treatment while still aiming to prevent atrial fibrillation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized trial of 209 ambulatory patients with recurrent symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation, conducted from December 2002 through March 2007 at 7 Dutch medical centers.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either episodic or continuous amiodarone treatment after electrical cardioversion following amiodarone loading. Episodic amiodarone treatment was discontinued after a month of sinus rhythm and reinitiated if atrial fibrillation relapsed (1 month peri-electrical cardioversion). In the continuous treatment group amiodarone was maintained throughout.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was a composite of amiodarone and underlying heart disease-related major events. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations.

Results

After a median follow-up of 2.1 years (range, 0.4–2.5 years), 51 (48%) of those receiving episodic treatment vs 64 (62%) receiving continuous treatment had sinus rhythm (P = 0.05). There were 85 atrial fibrillation recurrences (80%) among the episodic treatment group vs 56 (54%) in the continuous treatment group (P < .001). No significant difference existed in the incidence of the primary composite end point between each group (37 [35%] episodic vs 34 [33%] continuous; incidence rate difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.2 to 10.6). However, there were nonstatistically significant differences in the incidence of amiodarone-related major events (20 [19%] episodic vs 25 [24%] continuous; incidence rate difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -8.7 to 4.6) and underlying heart disease-related major events (17 [16%] episodic vs 9 [9%] continuous; incidence rate difference, 3.6; 95% CI, -1.6 to 8.7). All-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations were higher among those receiving episodic treatment (56 [53%] vs 35 [34%], P = 0.02).

Conclusions

In this study population, there was no difference in the composite of amiodarone and cardiac major adverse events between groups. However, patients receiving episodic treatment had a significantly increased rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence and a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations.
