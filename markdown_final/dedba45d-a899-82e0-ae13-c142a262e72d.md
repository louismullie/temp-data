## Question

A 58-year-old man with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis is admitted for worsening jaundice and confusion. He is diagnosed with acute-on-chronic liver failure. During his hospital stay, he develops ascites requiring a large-volume paracentesis. His laboratory results show an elevated INR of 2.1, platelet count of 110,000/μL, and hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL. The resident asks you whether to order blood products before the procedure and which coagulation test should guide transfusion decisions.

According to current guidelines, which coagulation test should be used to assess transfusion needs in this patient with cirrhosis prior to paracentesis, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which coagulation test should be used to assess transfusion needs in a 58-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure who requires a large-volume paracentesis, and whether any blood products are indicated before the procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the procedure-specific bleeding risk of paracentesis in cirrhosis. Then, I should verify the limitations of INR and platelet count in predicting bleeding in liver disease. Next, I will review guideline positions on preprocedural testing and transfusion thresholds. After that, I should consider the role of viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) versus standard labs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation for this specific case and note any exceptions or caveats that could change management.

> Let me first confirm the procedure risk. Large-volume paracentesis is a low-risk procedure in cirrhosis, with reported bleeding rates around 0%–3.3% and often much lower when ultrasound guidance is used, and routine preprocedural correction of INR or thrombocytopenia is not recommended by major societies, including AASLD and AGA, given the minimal benefit and potential harms of transfusion [^52092364] [^6525ef7a] [^a9ac2352].

> Wait, let me verify the role of INR here. INR reflects reduced synthesis of procoagulant factors but fails to capture parallel reductions in anticoagulant factors (e.g., protein C, antithrombin), so it does not reflect the rebalanced hemostasis of cirrhosis and correlates poorly with procedural bleeding risk; multiple high-credibility guidelines advise against using INR to guide transfusion decisions in this setting [^d885e2df] [^b6940b3c] [^da9df041].

> I should confirm the platelet threshold next. With a platelet count of 110,000/μL, this patient exceeds the commonly cited 50,000/μL threshold below which some clinicians consider platelet support for higher-risk procedures; moreover, even for low-risk procedures, routine platelet transfusion is not recommended unless there is severe thrombocytopenia or additional high-risk features, and this patient's count is not in that range [^d29c2158] [^6525ef7a] [^b6edf734].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing. I initially thought "no testing is needed at all", but I should double-check guideline nuance. AGA suggests against extensive preprocedural testing for common GI procedures in stable cirrhosis, yet some guidance allows selective use of viscoelastic testing when available to refine hemostatic assessment; importantly, EASL notes insufficient evidence to recommend routine viscoelastic testing to predict procedural bleeding, so I need to align the test choice with availability and clinical context rather than reflexively ordering it [^94f15442] [^e6fe65ef] [^60bba347].

> Let me consider viscoelastic testing more carefully. TEG/ROTEM provide a global assessment of clot formation, strength, and lysis and have been shown in randomized and observational studies to reduce unnecessary transfusions without increasing bleeding, though optimal cutoffs in cirrhosis are not fully validated; thus, if available and the team prefers a more granular assessment, TEG/ROTEM can be used, but they are not mandatory for low-risk procedures like paracentesis in this scenario [^f24185d2] [^90cf0e26] [^ee205ee6].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking exceptions. In ACLF or decompensated states, there is a subset with consumptive coagulopathy and low fibrinogen where bleeding risk may rise, and renal dysfunction has been identified as a predictor of post-paracentesis bleeding; in those exceptional cases, fibrinogen level and clinical judgment matter, but even then, routine FFP to "correct INR" is discouraged due to limited benefit and volume-related risks [^7da04a8b] [^074b9c45] [^b6940b3c].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For this patient with platelets 110,000/μL and INR 2.1 undergoing ultrasound-guided large-volume paracentesis, no preprocedural blood products are indicated, and no specific coagulation test is required; if a test is chosen, viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) is preferred over INR to assess global hemostasis, but standard practice supports proceeding without routine correction or testing given the low procedural risk and lack of predictive value from INR/platelets in cirrhosis [^6525ef7a] [^52092364] [^e6fe65ef].

> Final recommendation: Do not order prophylactic FFP or platelets, and do not use INR to guide transfusion decisions. If available and the team desires additional assessment, TEG/ROTEM can be considered, but it is optional for low-risk paracentesis. Ensure ultrasound guidance and standard post-paracentesis albumin for large-volume taps to mitigate circulatory dysfunction, which is the evidence-based intervention here [^6525ef7a] [^70808664] [^9c2aa9f8].

For a patient with cirrhosis and ACLF undergoing paracentesis, **do not use INR to guide transfusion** [^b6940b3c] because INR does not reflect bleeding risk in cirrhosis [^d885e2df]. Instead, **use platelet count and fibrinogen** to guide decisions: transfuse platelets if< 50,000/μL [^d29c2158] and give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is< 120 mg/dL [^f35fcc2e]. Viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) can further refine risk assessment [^f24185d2] but is not required for low-risk procedures like paracentesis [^6525ef7a]. Routine FFP is not recommended [^da9df041] because it does not improve thrombin generation and increases portal pressure [^b6940b3c].

---

## Limitations of INR in cirrhosis

- **INR limitations**: INR reflects procoagulant deficits but not anticoagulant losses in cirrhosis, so it does not predict bleeding risk [^f1361cd1] [^b6940b3c].
- **FFP futility**: FFP rarely corrects INR meaningfully and can worsen portal hypertension, so routine FFP is not advised [^da9df041] [^1757c4f2].
- **Guideline stance**: Major guidelines advise against using INR to guide transfusion in cirrhosis [^b6940b3c] [^04139b3a].

---

## Recommended coagulation tests and transfusion thresholds

| **Coagulation test** | **Recommended threshold** | **Transfusion recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Platelet count | < 50,000/μL | Platelet transfusion [^d29c2158] [^f35fcc2e] |
| Fibrinogen | < 120 mg/dL | Cryoprecipitate [^d29c2158] [^f35fcc2e] |
| INR | Any value | Do not transfuse FFP routinely [^da9df041] [^b6940b3c] |

---

## Role of viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM)

- **Global assessment**: TEG/ROTEM assesses clot formation, strength, and lysis, providing a more complete picture than INR [^d5915390].
- **Reduced transfusions**: TEG/ROTEM-guided strategies reduce transfusions without increasing bleeding in cirrhosis [^f24185d2] [^90cf0e26].
- **Guideline position**: TEG/ROTEM is reasonable when available, but not required for low-risk procedures like paracentesis [^6525ef7a] [^e6fe65ef].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current recommendations

Large series show **paracentesis is safe without correcting INR or platelets**, with bleeding rates near zero even when INR is> 2 or platelets are< 50,000/μL [^e04a56c0] [^75d59015]. Randomized data demonstrate that TEG-guided strategies reduce transfusions without increasing bleeding [^f24185d2] [^90cf0e26]. Guidelines consistently recommend against routine INR-based transfusion for paracentesis [^6525ef7a] [^a9ac2352].

---

## Clinical implications for the patient

Given platelets 110,000/μL and INR 2.1, **no transfusion is indicated** for paracentesis [^6525ef7a]. Use platelet count and fibrinogen to guide decisions, and consider TEG/ROTEM only if available and clinically indicated [^e6fe65ef]. Avoid routine FFP, as it does not improve hemostasis and may cause harm [^da9df041].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Do not use INR**: INR does not predict bleeding risk in cirrhosis [^b6940b3c].
- **Use platelets and fibrinogen**: Transfuse platelets if< 50,000/μL and give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is< 120 mg/dL [^d29c2158] [^f35fcc2e].
- **TEG/ROTEM optional**: Consider viscoelastic testing when available, but not required for paracentesis [^6525ef7a] [^e6fe65ef].
- **Avoid routine FFP**: FFP is not recommended for paracentesis [^da9df041] [^b6940b3c].

---

For cirrhosis with ACLF undergoing paracentesis, **platelet count and fibrinogen** are the key tests; **do not use INR** to guide transfusion, and reserve viscoelastic testing for select cases.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^3e45ba34]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. The intent is to evaluate the current data on mechanism of altered coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, provide guidance on the use of currently available testing of the coagulation cascade, and help practitioners use anticoagulation and pro-coagulants appropriately in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This review is framed around the best practice points, which were derived from the most impactful publications in the area of coagulation in cirrhosis and agreed to by all authors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Global tests of clot formation, such as rotational thromboelastometry, thromboelastography, sonorheometry, and thrombin generation, may eventually have a role in the evaluation of clotting in patients with cirrhosis, but currently lack validated target levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In general, clinicians should not routinely correct thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy before low-risk therapeutic paracentesis, thoracentesis, and routine upper endoscopy for variceal ligation in patients with hepatic synthetic dysfunction-induced coagulation abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunization, and/or transfusion reactions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimize clot formation in advanced liver disease: hematocrit ≥25%, platelet count >50,000, and fibrinogen >120 mg/dL. Commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion, but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary international normalized ratio target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the utility of this agent significantly. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate contains both pro- and anticoagulant factors that offer an attractive low-volume therapeutic to rebalance a disturbed hemostatic system. However, dosage is, in part, based on international normalized ratio, which is problematic in cirrhosis, and published experience in liver disease is limited. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Anti-fibrinolytic therapy may be considered in patients with persistent bleeding from mucosal oozing or puncture wound bleeding consistent with impaired clot integrity. Both ε-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid inhibit clot dissolution. Neither is believed to generate a hypercoagulable state, although both may exacerbate pre-existing thrombi. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Desmopressin releases von Willebrand factor as its primary hemostatic mechanism. As this factor is usually elevated in cirrhosis, the agent lacks a sound evidence-based foundation, but may be useful in patients with concomitant renal failure. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Systemic heparin infusion is recommended for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis, but there are unresolved issues regarding monitoring with both the anti-Xa assay and the partial thromboplastin time due to cirrhosis-related antithrombin deficiency (heparin cofactor). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Treatment of incidental portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis depends on estimated impact on transplantation surgical complexity vs risks of bleeding and falls. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, and direct-acting anticoagulants improve portal vein repermeation vs observation alone. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Direct-acting anticoagulants, such as the factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors, are relatively safe and effective in stable cirrhotic patients, but are in need of further study in patients with more advanced liver disease.

Coagulation assessment for procedures in cirrhosis—several common procedures do not routinely require coagulation assessment before performance, including ascites and therapeutic paracentesis, common forms of thoracentesis, upper endoscopy to screen for and band esophageal varices, and diagnostic (but not therapeutic) colonoscopy; paracentesis and thoracentesis are supported as low risk even with combined elevation in INR and thrombocytopenia so the risks of transfusion greatly outweigh the potential benefit; exceptions include pharmacologically anticoagulated and renal failure patients; when testing is indicated, platelet count and fibrinogen level are the standard of care assessment.

AASLD Practice Guidance—procedural bleeding risk and transfusion strategies in cirrhosis/ACLF: Bleeding rates for paracentesis (0%–3.3%) and thoracentesis (2%) in patients with cirrhosis are low and do not require routine preprocedural coagulation assessment in decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF. Reported bleeding rates for liver biopsy are higher in patients with < 50 platelets/L, and transjugular liver biopsy is relatively safe even with decreased platelet counts or prolonged INR. When correction is needed, transfusion of low volume cryoprecipitate or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate are preferred to high-volume fresh frozen plasma. TEG-guided strategies resulted in fewer blood transfusions compared with standard of care without differences in failure to control bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality; in a randomized trial of 60 patients undergoing invasive procedures, TEG-guided transfusion (fresh frozen plasma trigger: reaction time > 40 min; platelet trigger: maximum amplitude < 30 mm) decreased transfusions (16.7% vs. 100%; p < 0.0001) with no difference in bleeding or 90-day mortality.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^d885e2df]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Cirrhosis—pre-procedure bleeding risk and testing—The coagulation cascade is rebalanced in patients with cirrhosis and results in a relative hypercoagulable state, and standard measures of coagulation such as INR serve the practitioner poorly when an accurate assessment of bleeding risk is needed. Pervasive reliance on and misinterpretation of INR results in underutilization of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation in admitted patients with cirrhosis. When assessing a patient’s pre-procedure bleeding risk, one should ensure that treatment is necessary to prevent bleeding because several procedures (paracentesis, thoracentesis, and diagnostic endoscopy) do not require routine evaluation unless the patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation, and one should ensure that platelet number and fibrinogen level are adequate. Transfusions carry significant risk for immunologic consequences, exacerbate portal hypertension, and are likely overutilized in patients with cirrhosis. Further study of global measures of coagulation, such as TEG and ROTEM, to determine appropriate cutoffs for therapeutic intervention are urgently needed.

Preprocedural blood product transfusion in stable cirrhosis—For patients with stable cirrhosis undergoing common gastrointestinal procedures (eg, paracentesis, thoracentesis, variceal banding, colonic polypectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP], and liver biopsy), the AGA suggests against the routine use of blood products (eg, fresh frozen plasma [FFP] or platelets [PLTs]) for bleeding prophylaxis. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). This recommendation applies to the majority of patients with stable cirrhosis who usually do not have severe thrombocytopenia or severe coagulopathy, and in those with severe derangements in coagulation or thrombocytopenia undergoing a high-risk procedure, decisions about prophylactic blood transfusions should include discussion about potential benefits and risks (including transfusion reactions and delay of procedures) in consultation with a hematologist.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^d29c2158]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update—Procedural bleeding risk mitigation in cirrhosis prioritizes hemostatic targets including platelets ≥50,000 by infusion or with TPO agonist if elective, with rechecking platelets recommended when bleeding risk is assessed as greater than minimal, and fibrinogen ≥120 mg/dL best achieved with cryoprecipitate; weight-based dosing usually raises fibrinogen level by 50 mg/dL. Superimposed renal failure is associated with uremic platelet dysfunction, volume issues, and changes in hemostatic cascade, and a hematocrit of ≥25% is suggested because it improves platelet margination. The need for prophylactic measures depends on procedure risk assessment, and minor procedures like paracentesis/thoracentesis and upper endoscopy with banding do not require prophylaxis.

### Thrombelastography-guided blood product use before invasive procedures in cirrhosis with severe coagulopathy: a randomized, controlled trial [^f24185d2]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bleeding is a feared complication of invasive procedures in patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy (as defined by routine coagulation tests) and is used to justify preprocedure use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or platelets (PLT). Thromboelastography (TEG) provides a more comprehensive global coagulation assessment than routine tests (international normalized ratio [INR] and platelet count), and its use may avoid unnecessary blood product transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy (defined in this study as INR >1.8 and/or platelet count <50 × 10(9) /L) who will be undergoing an invasive procedure. Sixty patients were randomly allocated to TEG-guided transfusion strategy or standard of care (SOC; 1:1 TEG:SOC). The TEG group would receive FFP if the reaction time (r) was >40 min and/or PLT if maximum amplitude (MA) was <30 mm. All SOC patients received FFP and/or PLT per hospital guidelines. Endpoints were blood product use and bleeding complications. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Per protocol, all subjects in the SOC group received blood product transfusions versus 5 in the TEG group (100% vs. 16.7%; P < 0.0001). Sixteen SOC (53.3%) received FFP, 10 (33.3%) PLT, and 4 (13.3%) both FFP and PLT. In the TEG group, none received FFP alone (P < 0.0001 vs. SOC), 2 received PLT (6.7%; P = 0.009 vs. SOC), and 3 both FFP and PLT (not significant). Postprocedure bleeding occurred in only 1 patient (SOC group) after large-volume paracentesis.

Conclusions

In patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy before invasive procedures, TEG-guided transfusion strategy leads to a significantly lower use of blood products compared to SOC (transfusion guided by INR and platelet count), without an increase in bleeding complications. Remarkably, even in patients with significant coagulopathy, postprocedure bleeding was rare, indicating that TEG thresholds should be reevaluated.

Bleeding risk testing before common gastrointestinal procedures in stable cirrhosis—PICO Question 1 recommendations state that “the AGA makes no recommendation regarding VET before procedures to predict bleeding risk” in patients with stable cirrhosis undergoing such procedures (No recommendation, knowledge gap). For patients with stable cirrhosis (with known baseline abnormal coagulation parameters) undergoing common gastrointestinal procedures (eg, paracentesis, thoracentesis, variceal banding, colonic polypectomy, ERCP, and liver biopsy), “the AGA suggests against the use of extensive preprocedural testing, including repeated measurements of PT/INR or PLT count” (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British society of gastroenterology, the royal college of radiologists and the royal college of pathology [^00587e91]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The recent guidelines from the American Gastroenterology Associationinclude the recommendations that blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunisation and/or transfusion reactions.

The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimise clot formation in advanced liver disease: haematocrit ≥25%, platelet count >50 x 10 9 /L, and fibrinogen >120 mg/dL. Commonly used thresholds for correction of the INR are not supported by evidence.

The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary INR target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the usefulness of this agent considerably.

In contrast, decompensated liver disease with acute or chronic liver failure is associated with a progressive consumptive coagulopathy and hypofibrinogenaemia, often with hyperfibrinolysis. Spontaneous mucocutaneous and other bleeding manifestations may become evident at this stage. In one study, a platelet count <30×10 9 /L, fibrinogen level <0.6 g/L and activated partial thromboplastin time values >100 s were the strongest independent predictors for new onset of major bleeding.All but the most essential invasive procedures should be avoided under these circumstances. Acute kidney injury has also been associated with an increased risk of bleeding after paracentesis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Treatment with vitamin K should be considered in patients with an increased INR, which may in part reflect vitamin K deficiency; particularly in patients in intensive care, in patients with malnutrition, in patients using antibiotics and in patients with cholestatic liver disease.

### Study details | High dose albumin in refractory ascites (...) [^b87e570f]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

High Dose Albumin in Refractory AscitesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Advanced cirrhosis with complications is a serious problem imposing a heavy financial burden on health care system. Moreover, ascites is associated with increase in mortality rates among cirrhotic patients. Ascites pathogenesis is multifactorial including: portal hypertension; splanchnic and peripheral arterial vasodilation; and neurohumoral activation. Current management strategies include dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy, however, this strategy put patients at the risk of intravascular volume depletion, renal impairment, hepatic encephalopathy and hyponatremia. Moreover, around 10% of patients do not respond to this strategy with 50% of them die within 6 months. This sub-group is managed by frequent large volume paracentesis along with intravenous albumin administration and are usually considered for liver transplantation and TIPS.

Nonetheless, Frequent paracentesis increases the risk of infection, bleeding, bowel perforation, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction and renal dysfunction in this sub-group of patients. Moreover, a randomized multicenter open label trial published in lancet last year, demonstrated that long term albumin administration improved 18-month survival, decreased the use of paracentesis and decrease in the incidence of cirrhosis related complications among cirrhotic patients with ascites. As of today, there's a limited use of regular high dose albumin in cirrhotic patients with ascites in US, despite being used elsewhere in the world as previously stated. Patients with advanced liver disease often has low serum albumin level. The Infusion of human albumin is a standard of care after removal of ascitic fluid in patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites.

The objective of the study is to prove that regular infusion of albumin prevents formation of fluid in abdomen or pleural fluid and thus reduces the requirement of paracentesis or thoracentesis, and prevent complications. The Primary endpoints are: Number of paracentesis/thoracentesis needed and volume of fluid removed per month and if there is any reduction in frequency or volume after high-dose albumin administration; Twelve-month mortality or transplant.

Secondary endpoints are: Improvement of MELD score; Cumulative diuretic dosage; Development of hyponatremia or hyperkalemia as potential diuretic-induced side-effects; Incidence of cirrhosis related complications; Quality of life; Number and duration of hospital admissions; and Treatment cost-effectiveness. The research design is a prospective, parallel, randomized, open label clinical trial. The target trial population comprises of patients with advanced cirrhosis.

Common procedure risk assessment in cirrhosis—paracentesis and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) highlights that “the use of prophylactic transfusions of FFP and/or platelets based on preprocedural laboratory tests is not routinely indicated.” Supporting data include “a study of 1,100 therapeutic paracenteses in 628 patients (513 with cirrhosis) and no prophylactic transfusion before the procedure” that “showed no bleeding or complications requiring hospitalization in any patient (292 patients with INR > 2; 598 patients with platelets <50,000/μL).” For EVL, “traditional hemostasis testing (elevated INR and thrombocytopenia) was not predictive of EVL bleeding, but advanced cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] C) was the most important factor associated with risk of post-EVL ulcer bleeding,” and because bleeding is delayed, “the use of prophylaxis, based on traditional measures of hemostasis before EVL, is not recommended.”

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^da9df041]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Cirrhosis—bleeding risk assessment and prophylactic plasma: International normalized ratio (INR) correlates poorly with thrombin generation and bleeding risk in cirrhosis, and conventional fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) dosing does not effectively correct coagulopathy while posing risks. There is poor correlation between INR and thrombin production, and INR correlates poorly with thrombin generation and risk of bleeding. FFP commonly given as 2–4 units is rarely able to achieve a target INR of 1.5 or less, and in vitro mixing at 10 mL/kg lowers PT without enhancing thrombin generation. High-volume plasma infusions can raise portal pressure in the range of 15–20 mm Hg, whereas paracentesis without prophylactic FFP is reported safe even with INR as high as 8.7. Accordingly, we do not recommend FFP to improve thrombin generation at conventional doses (10–15 mL/kg), and in most situations prophylactic plasma to decrease bleeding risk is futile and potentially risky (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence).

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^8f3aa1a9]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis,and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines,,,the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis.The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient’s baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

### Management of coagulopathy among patients with cirrhosis undergoing upper endoscopy and paracentesis: persistent gaps and areas of consensus in a multispecialty Delphi [^83affa5d]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis have abnormal coagulation indices such as a high international normalized ratio and low platelet count, but these do not correlate well with periprocedural bleeding risk. We sought to develop a consensus among the multiple stakeholders in cirrhosis care to inform process measures that can help improve the quality of the periprocedural management of coagulopathy in cirrhosis. We identified candidate process measures for periprocedural coagulopathy management in multiple contexts relating to the performance of paracentesis and upper endoscopy. An 11-member panel with content expertise was convened. It included nominees from professional societies for interventional radiology, transfusion medicine, and anesthesia as well as representatives from hematology, emergency medicine, transplant surgery, and community practice. Each measure was evaluated for agreement using a modified Delphi approach (3 rounds of rating) to define the final set of measures. Out of 286 possible measures, 33 measures made the final set. International normalized ratio testing was not required for diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis as well as diagnostic endoscopy. Plasma transfusion should be avoided for all paracenteses and diagnostic endoscopy. No consensus was achieved for these items in therapeutic intent or emergent endoscopy. The risks of prophylactic platelet transfusions exceed their benefits for outpatient diagnostic paracentesis and diagnostic endosopies. For the other procedures examined, the risks outweigh benefits when platelet count is >20,000/mm 3 . It is uncertain whether risks outweigh benefits below 20,000/mm 3 in other contexts. No consensus was achieved on whether it was permissible to continue or stop systemic anticoagulation. Continuous aspirin was permissible for each procedure. Clopidogrel was permissible for diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis and diagnostic endoscopy. We found many areas of consensus that may serve as a foundation for a common set of practice metrics for the periprocedural management of coagulopathy in cirrhosis.

Ultrasound guidance

Use of ultrasound guidance may reduce the adverse events related to LVP.In a study involving 1297 procedures, 723 (56%) with ultrasound guidance and 574 (44%) without where the indications for paracentesis were similar between the two groups, the incidence of adverse events was lower in the ultrasound-guided procedures.In another retrospective cohort study, 0.8% of 565 patients undergoing paracentesis experienced bleeding complications. After adjustment, ultrasound guidance was associated with lower risk of bleeding complications by 68%.

Recommendations

Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate and Recommendation: strong)

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^8eda854d]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Summary of the evidence—In cirrhosis across common procedures (paracentesis, thoracentesis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding, ERCP, colonoscopy with polypectomy, and liver biopsy), no randomized controlled trials used prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or platelet (PLT) counts to predict or manage procedural bleeding, and systematic review found no direct evidence of a predictive PT/INR or PLT threshold. Low-risk interventions reported either no bleeding or very low bleeding rates, and studies of variceal banding, colonoscopic polypectomy, and endoscopic sphincterotomy did not identify a specific PLT or PT/INR value that increased bleeding risk; rather, progressive decompensation (Child-Turcotte-Pugh) was a more likely marker. In liver biopsy, there was no clear difference in bleeding risk versus patients without cirrhosis and no specific PT/INR threshold, with a trend that lower PLT counts correlated with higher bleeding risk.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^b6edf734]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Recommendations—procedure-related platelet management in cirrhosis state that we do not recommend prophylactic platelet transfusions before common procedures such as routine variceal banding or paracentesis outside of significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl) or sepsis. Existing data suggest there is a somewhat tenuous relationship between bleeding risk and platelet count. In vitro studies demonstrate adequate thrombin production with platelet levels ≥50,000/mL. Infusion of a single adult platelet dose does not improve thrombin generation. Higher platelet levels may be more appropriate for higher risk procedures such as removal of large polyps and major surgery, but will probably require higher doses of platelet infusions; if the procedure is elective, the use of TPO agonists may be more appropriate (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

ACG Clinical Guideline—Key concepts: hemostatic interventions and perioperative care pathways—If viscoelastic testing is not available, it is reasonable to correct severe thrombocytopenia (<50 K/mm3) in patients with cirrhosis prior to major surgery, whereas use of vitamin K or blood products to correct elevated international normalized ratio (INR) prior to major surgery has not been demonstrated to reduce bleeding risk. In patients with cirrhosis in need of a nonhepatic elective major surgery, referral to a high-volume liver surgery and/or transplant center, when feasible, may improve postoperative outcomes, and remaining current with routine cirrhosis-related management prior to elective surgery may mitigate operative risk.

Certainty of the evidence and clinical implications—The certainty of evidence was very low across all outcomes due to indirectness and few events. Data suggest baseline bleeding risk for common nonsurgical procedures is low in cirrhosis, and there are insufficient data to justify cutoffs of standard coagulation parameters. The technical review stratified procedure-related bleeding risk into low or high using a threshold of 1.5%. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy undergoing high-risk procedures, decisions about prophylactic blood transfusions should include potential benefits and risks, the threshold for severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy could not be clearly defined and remains a matter of clinical judgment, and in many cases care should be managed in collaboration with an expert hematologist.

Best practice advice on perioperative hemostasis in cirrhosis—There are no established preoperative safety thresholds for common laboratory values related to bleeding and clotting, and the INR is not predictive of procedural bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis. In vitro studies suggest that a platelet count >50,000/μL is adequate to generate thrombin and provide stable clot formation, and clinical studies show an increased bleeding tendency in patients with a platelet count lower than this threshold; critically ill patients with plasma fibrinogen levels <100 mg/dL may have more bleeding events. Handle coagulation management on a case-by-case basis preferably using viscoelastic testing directed therapy and avoid needless transfusions or volume overload.

### Decompensated cirrhosis and fluid resuscitation [^468825f9]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The critically ill patient with decompensated cirrhosis has a unique physiology and alterations in albumin that need to be understood to properly resuscitate them and minimize morbidity and mortality. Little data exist on specific resuscitation of the patient with cirrhosis compared with those patients without liver disease. The effectiveness of albumin administration compared with saline administration in common settings, such as large-volume paracentesis, can be extrapolated to the care of the general surgical patient but further studies in this area are warranted. This article enhances the understanding of unique physiology of the patient with decompensated cirrhosis to guide their needs in fluid resuscitation in critical illness.

### Prophylactic fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion have a prothrombotic effect in patients with liver disease [^3816648b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there is increasingly broad consensus on the futility of INR correction with FFP for preventing bleeding complications in this setting, there is none on the requirement to correct cirrhotic thrombocytopenia. High‐quality research in this specific field is scarce, and clinical studies have shown contradicting results. 12, 13 Guidelines defining the indication for platelet transfusion in patients with liver disease‐associated thrombocytopenia are not uniform, although most guidelines maintain a platelet count threshold of 50 × 10 9 /L for patients with liver disease before invasive procedures. 14

In addition to doubts on whether prolonged INR and thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis are associated with bleeding risk, the efficacy of FFP and platelet transfusions in patients with liver disease has been questioned. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that although FFP improves the INR in patients with liver disease, there is no appreciable increase in hemostatic potential as estimated by thrombin generation tests. 15, 16, 17 In addition, several clinical studies have shown that FFP or platelet transfusions only minimally improve the hemostatic status of patients with liver disease and did not reduce bleeding risk. 17, 18, 19

Importantly, bleeding risk is, next to a patient's hemostatic status, determined by the procedure and operator. Extensive research has shown that many of the common procedures that patients with liver disease undergo (eg, endoscopy, paracentesis), have a low to very low bleeding risk, which further questions the need for prophylactic prohemostatic interventions. 6 Further, every transfusion is associated with the risk of transfusion‐related complications, such as circulatory overload, transfusion‐related acute lung injury, and infection, and those risks may be higher in patients with liver disease. 20, 21, 22

Here, we examined the hemostatic efficacy of prophylactic FFP and platelet transfusions to patients with chronic liver disease‐associated hemostatic changes. We specifically studied patients that were deemed to require FFP or platelet transfusion before an invasive procedure by their treating physician in a real‐life clinical setting.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^5c7e3628]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

There is variability in the management of coagulopathy and antithrombotic agents for paracentesis.Cirrhotic patients have mixed coagulopathies where INR does not necessarily correlate to bleeding risk.If certain labs fall significantly out of generally agreed parameters (platelets <30 × 10^9 or INR > 2.5), thromboelastogram and fibrinogen measurements were used to quantify bleeding risk before the procedure.We also suspend chemical thromboprophylaxis and anticoagulation unless there is a strong indication otherwise.

Despite our individualized conservative approach, we reported a higher percentage of significant HGB drop following paracentesis, although only 0.49% of these had a hemorrhagic complication related to the procedure, which is in‐line with prior rates. The majority of the significant HGB declines that were not due to the paracentesis were multifactorial, including dilutional effects from IV fluid/albumin, bleeding from other sources (e.g. GIB), spurious values, etc. We did not investigate patients with nonsignificant HGB drops nor potential outcomes in patients after 48 h, therefore we may be underestimating patients who had minimal self‐resolved bleeding or delayed bleeding, although this is thought to be rare.

Our findings show a higher incidence of significant HGB drop in chronic viral hepatitis patients. There is no correlation between coagulopathic parameter, thrombocytopenia, use of antiplatelets or anticoagulation, multiple attempts, operator, renal dysfunction, or MELD. The best predictors of significant HGB drop appear to be AST, deeper ascites pocket, and LVP. It is unclear if elevated AST is truly related to an increased hemorrhagic risk. AST is present as cytosolic and mitochondrial isoenzymes and is found in organs outside the liver which perhaps suggests these patients are in a more acutely decompensated state, which places this group at higher risk of hemorrhage.Future studies could investigate this association further. Depth of pocket likely correlates with larger volume ascites and may lead to a larger decrease in intraabdominal pressure, leading to increased intraabdominal varix bleeding risk. However, this could also reflect a dilutional effect as the majority of patients receiving LVP receive albumin, and only one patient out of 45 with a significant HGB drop post LVP required a blood transfusion.

### Coagulation testing and management in liver disease patients [^d5915390]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present article aims to provide clinicians with an overview of coagulation testing in individuals with liver disease, to discuss available procoagulants and the rationale for their use, and to provide management strategies in a variety of common clinical scenarios.

Recent Findings

Clinicians and researchers are gaining an increased understanding of the shortfalls of assessing bleeding risk using traditional tests of coagulation. The use of global tests of clot formation, including viscoelastic testing and thrombin generation analysis, continues to evolve and guide the management of these patients.

Summary

Abnormal coagulation testing in individuals with cirrhosis leads to a variety of difficult clinical scenarios that can be challenging for practitioners. With advanced liver disease, changes in the traditional tests of hemostasis such as the international normalized ratio reflect decreased synthesis of procoagulant factors but do not capture concomitant decreases in anticoagulant factors. In this setting, transfusion thresholds targeting platelet and fibrinogen goals may provide an effective strategy to optimize clot formation. Global tests of clot formation provide practical information to clinicians and can help guide decision making, although optimal target levels have not been validated.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^7da04a8b]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Bleeding risk in decompensated cirrhosis and ACLF—patients with cirrhosis are at risk of becoming critically ill with exposure to multiple procedures and potentially increasing the risk of bleeding complications. Acute decompensation of cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) directly alter the hemostatic system. A retrospective case-control study demonstrated that patients with ACLF had a higher risk of hemorrhage after paracentesis, with low fibrinogen levels associated with this risk. Of note, there were no significant differences between platelet and INR levels between matched controls and patients with bleeding, and neither factor was predictive of bleeding on multivariable analysis. The systemic inflammatory response and association with concurrent infection alter hemostatic function, as measured by global hemostasis testing, and may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures.

In patients with ACLF and altered coagulation parameters, we suggest against transfusion in the absence of bleeding or a planned procedure (low quality, conditional recommendation). In patients with cirrhosis who require invasive procedures, we recommend use of thromboelastography (TEG) or rotational TEG (ROTEM), compared with INR, to more accurately assess transfusion needs (moderate quality, conditional recommendation).

Adverse events

A systematic review of adverse events that can result from a paracentesis reported an overall rate of significant bleeding ranging from 0% to 2.7%, ascitic fluid leak in 0% to 2.35%, perforation in 0.83%, residual catheter tip fragment in 0.41% and death in 0% to 17% among studies that were heterogeneous.In a retrospective study published in abstract form, of consecutive 3116 ultrasound guided LVPs, the mean international normalised ratio (INR) was 2.1 (range 1.0–7.0) and MELD score 24 (range 6–40) for inpatients, and 1.5 (range 1‐5–5) and 16 (range 5–40) for outpatients, respectively. With no patients receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) before the procedure, a total of six patients (0.19%) had post‐LVP bleeding requiring blood transfusion (one inpatient, five outpatients) and one required angiography with embolisation of a bleeding abdominal wall vessel. No patient died.In another study where GI endoscopy assistants performed 1100 large volume paracenteses, with a preprocedure mean INR of 1.7 (range 0.9–8.7) and the mean platelet count was 50.4×10 9 /L (range, 19–341×10 9 /L), there were no significant procedure-related complications.

Risk factors for haemorrhagic complications after paracentesis in three studies (which included patients with acute on chronic liver failure) were high MELD and Child-Pugh scores and renal impairment.In a study by Hung et al, acute kidney injury at he time of paracentesis was the only independent predictor of post-paracentesis haemoperitoneum, independent of MELD score, large volume paracentesis, sepsis, platelets, INR and haemoglobin levels.While some patients with bleeding complications after paracentesis have low platelet counts, elevated INR and low fibrinogen levels, this is invariably accompanied with high MELD scores (>25) and/or renal impairment.

Evidence Summary

We identified a 2019 Cochrane systematic review including 27 RCTs (N = 1,592) examining the use of any plasma volume expanders in patients with cirrhosis undergoing paracentesis.In general, enrolled patients were undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and the most commonly used albumin doses were either 6 to 8 g of albumin per 1 L of fluid removed or a standard dose of 20 to 40 g. Compared with no plasma expander, no statistically significant effect of using hyperoncotic (20%-25%) albumin on mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.06-4.83), kidney impairment (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02-5.88), or recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.49-3.42) was found. Compared with hyperoncotic albumin, use of other fluids showed uncertain effects on mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82-1.30), kidney impairment (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71-1.91), and recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96-1.36). Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was more frequent with nonalbumin plasma expanders (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.31-2.99) compared with albumin. A 2020 systematic review focused on the impact of different therapies (albumin, other fluids, vasoactive drugs) on the rate of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction and identified nine RCTs (N = 620).Albumin at a dose of 8 g/L was found to be superior to other volume expanders for the prevention of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (rise in plasma renin activity by ≥ 50% of baseline). Similar to the Cochrane review, uncertainty regarding the role of albumin as compared with alternative treatments was noted for the prevention of complications after paracentesis. RCTs comparing high-dose albumin (6-8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) with low-dose albumin (2-4 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) found no difference in the rate of paracentesis associated circulatory dysfunction, although uncertainty exists regarding the risk to benefit profile of the two doses, given the small sample size (two studies [N = 120]; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.22-4.49).

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications (...) [^cadf657e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis leads to intrahepatic resistance, which causes portal hypertension and, at later stages, hepatic insufficiency, which disrupts the liver’s normal metabolic functions. Together these features cause gut-barrier disruption and portosystemic shunting, resulting in the multisystem complications of cirrhosis, eg, hepatic encephalopathy, sarcopenia, ascites, and kidney injury. The presence of cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of complications such as liver cancer and decompensation including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. It is important to evaluate for the presence of cirrhosis in people with risk factors or any diagnosed chronic liver disease. The most common causes of cirrhosis in the US, which can overlap, include alcohol use disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C.

Patients with cirrhosis experience symptoms including muscle cramps, pruritus, poor-quality sleep, and sexual dysfunction. The median survival time following onset of hepatic encephalopathy and ascites is 0. 92 and
1. 1 years, respectively. Among people with ascites, the annual incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is 11% and of hepatorenal syndrome is 8%; the latter is associated with a median survival of less than 2 weeks. Most prevalent cases of cirrhosis are caused by alcohol use disorder, hepatitis C, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with many patients having overlapping causes. 4 However, hepatitis C is now curable with direct-acting antivirals and most newly diagnosed cirrhosis is due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol use disorder.
5. What is the most common cause of cirrhosis.

Most prevalent cases of cirrhosis in the US are caused by alcohol use disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C infection. Most incident cases of cirrhosis are caused by NAFLD; however, there is also an increase in alcohol-related cirrhosis, particularly among young people. The causes of cirrhosis vary by context and many overlap. In a study of 68 673 patients from a national sample of patients in the Veterans Administration, the causes of cirrhosis were hepatitis C, alcohol related, hepatitis C and alcohol related, NAFLD related and decreased production of vasodilators, further restricting sinusoidal flow. Inflammatory injury from alcohol or steatosis also increases vascular resistance. In both NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease, heritable factors in lipid metabolism have been associated with progression of liver disease. 57 In addition, chronic liver injury causes hepatocyte loss and reduces the liver’s capacity for metabolic activity including protein synthesis, detoxification, nutrient storage, and bilirubin clearance. Over time, patients may progress from compensated cirrhosis without clinical manifestations to decompensated cirrhosis with variceal hemorrhage, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy.

### How to manage hemostasis in patients with liver disease during interventions [^4064336c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD) often need procedures to both treat and prevent complications of portal hypertension such as ascites or gastrointestinal bleeding. Abnormal results for hemostatic tests, such as prolonged prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and/or thrombocytopenia, are commonly encountered, raising concerns about increased bleeding risk and leading to transfusion to attempt to correct prior to interventions. However hemostatic markers are poor predictors of bleeding risk in CLD, and routine correction, particularly with fresh frozen plasma and routine platelet transfusions, should be avoided. This narrative review discusses the hemostatic management of patients with CLD using 2 case descriptions.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^e75a2a93]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for select patient populations have been published in some jurisdictions, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. The British Society for Gastroenterology published guidelines on the management of patients with cirrhosis and ascites.They recommend albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The French Society of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and the French Association for the Study of the Liver jointly released guidelines for the management of liver failure in critical care.They recommend the use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome (with terlipressin), large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines from 2021recommend the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis, severe muscle cramps, severe hyponatremia (sodium < 120 mEq/L), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome. The Italian Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the Italian Society for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology guidelines update from 2020 include the use of albumin for ascites requiring moderate doses of diuretics as an outpatient treatment.This was an update from their 2016 guidelines that also recommended the use of albumin in patients requiring large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or with hepatorenal syndrome.Similarly, the European Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 guidelines detailing the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis recommended albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with acute kidney injury without known cause, or with hepatorenal syndrome.The ICTMG guidelines are concordant with these guidelines for recommending albumin for large-volume paracentesis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but report insufficient evidence to support its use in other settings. The use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome, in conjunction with terlipressin, was recommended commonly in prior guidelines, likely based on both expert opinion and the fact that randomized trials used albumin in both treatment arms (albumin vs albumin plus terlipressin). We elected to refrain from making a recommendation without clinical trial evidence to support its use and highlight that this indication needs further study.

### Performance standards for therapeutic abdominal paracentesis [^4788a54f]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Large-volume paracentesis, the preferred treatment for patients with symptomatic tense ascites due to cirrhosis, has traditionally been performed by physicians as an inpatient procedure. Our objectives were to determine (1) whether large-volume paracentesis could be performed safely and effectively by gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants and as an outpatient procedure, (2) whether the risk of bleeding was associated with either thrombocytopenia or prolongation of the prothrombin time, and (3) the resources used for large-volume paracentesis. Gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants performed 1,100 large-volume paracenteses in 628 patients, 513 of whom had cirrhosis of the liver. The preprocedure mean international normalized ratio for prothrombin time was 1.7 +/- 0.46 (range, 0.9-8.7; interquartile range, 1.4-2.2), and the mean platelet count was 50.4 x 10(3)/microL, (range, 19 x 10(3)/microL - 341 x 10(3)/microL; interquartile range, 42-56 x 10(3)/microL). Performance of 3 to 7 supervised paracenteses was required before competence was achieved. There were no significant procedure-related complications, even in patients with marked thrombocytopenia or prolongation in the prothrombin time. The mean duration of large-volume paracentesis was 97 +/- 24 minutes, and the mean volume of ascitic fluid removed was 8.7 +/- 2.8 L. In conclusion, large-volume paracentesis can be performed safely as an outpatient procedure by trained gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants. Ten supervised paracenteses would be optimal for training the operators carrying out the procedure. The practice guideline of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases which states that routine correction of prolonged prothrombin time or thrombocytopenia is not required is appropriate when experienced personnel carry out paracentesis.

### Real-time ultrasound-guided paracentesis by radiologists: near zero risk of hemorrhage without correction of coagulopathy [^75d59015]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the rate and risk factors for hemorrhage in patients undergoing real-time, ultrasound-guided paracentesis by radiologists without correction of coagulopathy.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective study of all patients who underwent real-time, ultrasound-guided paracentesis at a single institution over a 2-year period. In total, 3116 paracentesis procedures were performed: 757 (24%) inpatients and 2,359 (76%) outpatients. Ninety-five percent of patients had a diagnosis of cirrhosis. Mean patient age was 56.6 years. Mean international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.6; INR was > 2 in 437 (14%) of cases. Mean platelet count was 122 x 10 3 /μL; platelet count was < 50 x 10 3 /μL in 368 (12%) of patients. Seven hundred seven (23%) patients were dialysis dependent. Patients were followed for 2 weeks after paracentesis to assess for hemorrhage requiring transfusion or rescue angiogram/embolization. Univariate analysis was performed to determine risk factors for hemorrhage. Blood product and cost saving analysis were performed.

Results

Significant post-paracentesis hemorrhage occurred in 6 (0.19%) patients, and only 1 patient required an angiogram with embolization. No predictors of post-procedure bleeding were found, including INR and platelet count. Transfusion of 1125 units of fresh frozen plasma and 366 units of platelets were avoided, for a transfusion-associated cost savings of $816,000.

Conclusions

Without correction of coagulation abnormalities with prophylactic blood product transfusion, post-procedural hemorrhage is very rare when paracentesis is performed with real-time ultrasound guidance by radiologists.

Hemostasis and coagulation in perioperative cirrhosis—The international normalized ratio (INR) is not predictive of bleeding in cirrhosis and “prophylactic” fresh frozen plasma is “not recommended”; studies indicate platelet counts “above 50,000/μL are adequate to allow clot formation,” so prophylactic platelet transfusions to higher levels are “unlikely to be beneficial.” For thrombocytopenia, “Only avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are approved” and were “effective in raising platelet counts above 50,000/μL,” but “rates of bleeding events… were equivalent” to placebo and “thrombotic events have occurred,” so they should be used “with caution,” and it “would seem reasonable to consider their use” before elective high-risk procedures when baseline platelets are “less than 50,000/μL.” Regarding fibrinogen, low levels are linked to bleeding and “levels <100 mg/dL are associated with a risk of inhibiting clot formation”; “Fibrinogen can be replaced with low-volume cryoprecipitate,” and “it seems physiologically reasonable to replete fibrinogen… before high-risk surgical procedures.” If available, “viscoelastic testing… should be considered before and during surgical procedures” to guide transfusion strategy.

### Plasma expanders for people with cirrhosis and large ascites treated with abdominal paracentesis [^ab86969f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Plasma volume expanders are used in connection to paracentesis in people with cirrhosis to prevent reduction of effective plasma volume, which may trigger deleterious effect on haemodynamic balance, and increase morbidity and mortality. Albumin is considered the standard product against which no plasma expansion or other plasma expanders, e.g. other colloids (polygeline , dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol have been compared. However, the benefits and harms of these plasma expanders are not fully clear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of any plasma volume expanders such as albumin, other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus no plasma volume expander or versus another plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until January 2019. Furthermore, we searched FDA, EMA, WHO (last search January 2019), www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and www.controlled-trials.com/ for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials, no matter their design or year of publication, publication status, and language, assessing the use of any type of plasma expander versus placebo, no intervention, or a different plasma expander in connection with paracentesis for ascites in people with cirrhosis. We considered quasi-randomised, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials only, for reports on harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) using the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model meta-analyses, based on the intention-to-treat principle, whenever possible. If the fixed-effect and random-effects models showed different results, then we made our conclusions based on the analysis with the highest P value (the more conservative result). We assessed risks of bias of the individual trials using predefined bias risk domains. We assessed the certainty of the evidence at an outcome level, using GRADE, and constructed 'Summary of Findings' tables for seven of our review outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 27 randomised clinical trials for inclusion in this review (24 published as full-text articles and 3 as abstracts). Five of the trials, with 271 participants, assessed plasma expanders (albumin in four trials and ascitic fluid in one trial) versus no plasma expander. The remaining 22 trials, with 1321 participants, assessed one type of plasma expander, i.e. dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, polygeline, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus another type of plasma expander, i.e. albumin in 20 of these trials and polygeline in one trial. Twenty-five trials provided data for quantitative meta-analysis. According to the Child-Pugh classification, most participants were at an intermediate to advanced stage of liver disease in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were assessed as at overall high risk of bias. Ten trials seemed not to have been funded by industry; twelve trials were considered unclear about funding; and five trials were considered funded by industry or a for-profit institution.We found no evidence of a difference in effect between plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion on mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.83; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 5.88; 181 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.27; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.40; 158 participants; 3 trials; very low certainty). Two of the trials stated that no serious adverse events occurred while the remaining trials did not report on this outcome. No trial reported data on health-related quality of life.We found no evidence of a difference in effect between experimental plasma expanders versus albumin on mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; 1014 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty); serious adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.10 to 8.30; 118 participants; 2 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91; 1107 participants; 17 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.48; 1083 participants; 16 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.85; 977 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty). We found no data on heath-related quality of life and refractory ascites.

Authors' Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not find any benefits or harms of plasma expanders versus no plasma expander or of one plasma expander such as polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus albumin on primary or secondary outcomes. The data originated from few, small, mostly short-term trials at high risks of systematic errors (bias) and high risks of random errors (play of chance). GRADE assessments concluded that the evidence was of very low certainty. Therefore, we can neither demonstrate or discard any benefit of plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion, and differences between one plasma expander versus another plasma expander.Larger trials at low risks of bias are needed to assess the role of plasma expanders in connection with paracentesis. Such trials should be conducted according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.

Correction of prolonged international normalised ratio (INR) with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not recommended, even for high-risk procedures—in some cases plasma expansion can exacerbate PHTN and increase bleeding risk. Platelet infusion/thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists are not recommended if platelets are >50×10 9 or if bleeding can be treated by local haemostasis.For people with a platelet count <50×10 9 undergoing high-risk procedures platelet transfusion/TPO-R agonists should not be required routinely but should be considered on a case-by-case basis, particularly if platelet count <20×10 9.TPO-R agonist should be used with caution in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and dose adjustments may be required.Consider discussing with haematology and refer to local protocols. If possible, haemoglobin, iron, folic acid and B 12 should be optimised prior to high-risk procedures.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^c5317b3d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

As a personal history of previous bleeding may be associated with a higher bleeding risk, further details should be sought to establish context. For example, prior procedural bleeding will be more relevant than a prior history of variceal bleed (as this is secondary to portal hypertension rather than hemostatic impairment as discussed above). Renal impairment is associated with higher post paracentesis bleeding but not specifically reported in relation to dental extractions.The use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are associated with increased risk of bleeding but are not relevant to this case.

Whilst INR and thrombocytopenia may indicate an increased bleeding risk in the absence of cirrhosis, as discussed above, neither have been consistently demonstrated to predict procedural bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. One series desribed a small observational cohort (n = 23 patients, 84 dental extractions over 35 procedures), including patients with platelet count >30 000/µl (range 31–160) and INR < 3 (range 0.98–2.5). One postoperative bleed (2.9%) was observed despite a platelet count of <50 000/µl in 34% of procedures and INR > 2 in 9%. All patients were managed with post procedural gauze compression.

Dental procedures should be performed in settings with access to local hemostatic measures including socket packing and suturing.Topical TXA (soaked gauze/mouthwash) are advocated by some but there is no specific evidence of reduced bleeding.All patients should be given general advice to minimize delayed bleeding and when to seek further dental /medical attention.

There are few studies investigating systemic therapy to reduce bleeding in dental extractions. A small study randomized patients with cirrhosis and platelet count 30–50 000/µl and/or INR 2–3, to either intranasal desmopressin vs FFP and/or platelet transfusion prior to dental extraction.Of 36 patients randomized and receiving the planned intervention, there was no significant difference in bleeding between groups (with a single bleed in the transfusion arm) but the study was underpowered to show a difference between treatments and should thus be interpreted cautiously. A further study investigating laboratory parameters in patients with cirrhosis who received DDAVP infusion found no effect on platelet adhesion, further questioning this approach.

4 CASE 3: DIFFUSE BLEEDING IN A CRITICALLY ILL CIRRHOSIS PATIENT

A 68‐year‐old woman with primary biliary cholangitis and decompensated cirrhosis is admitted to the intensive care unit with gram‐negative septic shock related to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation and delirious. She has rapidly progressive acute kidney injury and was recently placed on continuous renal replacement therapy. The right internal jugular dialysis line has been steadily oozing and soaking through the dressings with blood. She also has a large subcutaneous hematoma in the left lower quadrant at the site of a paracentesis performed 48 h ago. Her hemoglobin levels have been steadily dropping each day and she has needed several blood transfusions over the past week. Her platelet count is 36 000/µl, fibrinogen 77 mg/dl, PT 28 s, and INR 3.2. The bleeding has not responded to platelet or cryoprecipitate transfusion administered by the critical care team prior to our consultation. The critical care team is requesting advice on the potential source of her continuous low level bleeding and any therapies that might offer benefit.

The transition from an acutely decompensated state to ACLF requiring organ support, is accompanied by a further decline in platelet count and fibrinogen levels, and a further increase in the PT/INR.Whilst global hemostasis assays demonstrate rebalanced hemostasis with hypercoagulable features in patients with acute decompensation, in ACLF there is broad individual variation with evidence of both hypo‐ and hypercoagulable characteristics and variable fibrinolytic activity.Sepsis, acute kidney injury and procedural intervention predispose to bleeding and are common in patients with cirrhosis.Importantly, over a third of admissions to critical care units are precipitated by sepsis.AKI is present in up to 20% of those hospitalized with decompensation and 75% in those requiring critical care support.The incidence of major bleeding in ACLF was reported as 17% in a single center cohort (n = 211).Comprehensive laboratory evaluation of 80 patients with decompensated liver disease with/without AKI (predominantly ward based care) demonstrated both hypo and hypercoagulable features, with greater platelet dysfunction, lower factor XIII and increased fibrinolysis, along with further hypercoagulable features and hypofibrinolytic features.These factors likely contribute to instability of an already delicately rebalanced coagulation status in this patient. Renal replacement therapy may contribute to rebalancing hemostasis by optimization of fluid balance and improving platelet function, although there are no studies investigating this.

Coagulation interventions and factor assessment in cirrhosis highlight that the international normalized ratio (INR) does not predict bleeding risk and that certain corrective measures have limited utility or risks: “it is not a reliable indicator of hemostatic balance in patients with cirrhosis and is unable to predict procedural bleeding risk.” Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions “carry important risks: (1) a potential for developing transfusion-related lung injury syndromes and (2) increases in portal pressures directly proportional to the volume transfused” and “show minimal efficacy in improving thrombin generation capacity in vitro.” Outside of advanced malnutrition or cholestasis, “vitamin K replacement has no measurable effect on the INR in patients with cirrhosis,” and “Determination of factor V levels can aid the practitioner in differentiating vitamin K deficiency from impaired liver function.”

### Albumin in advanced liver diseases: the good and bad of a drug! [^ada28ab7]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human serum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, and it regulates diverse body functions. In patients with advanced and decompensated cirrhosis, serum albumin levels are low because of a reduction in the hepatocyte mass due to disease per se and multiple therapeutic interventions. Because of their oncotic and nononcotic properties, administration of human albumin solutions (HAS) have been found to be beneficial in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or who have hepatorenal syndrome or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Albumin also improves the functionality of the immune cells and mitigates the severity and risk of infections in advanced cirrhosis. Its long-term administration can modify the course of decompensated cirrhosis patients by reducing the onset of new complications, improving the quality of life, and probably providing survival benefits. There is, however, a need to rationalize the dose, duration, and frequency of albumin therapy in different liver diseases and stages of cirrhosis. In patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, potentially toxic oxidized isoforms of albumin increase substantially, especially human nonmercaptalbumin and 2, and nitrosoalbumin. The role of administration of HAS in such patients is unclear. Determining whether removal of the pathological and dysfunctional albumin forms in these patients by "albumin dialysis" is helpful, requires additional studies. Use of albumin is not without adverse events. These mainly include allergic and transfusion reactions, volume overload, antibody formation and coagulation derangements. Considering their cost, limited availability, need for a health care setting for their administration, and potential adverse effects, judicious use of HAS in liver diseases is advocated. There is a need for new albumin molecules and economic alternatives in hepatologic practice.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^3032fa5e]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance—Albumin in critically ill cirrhosis notes that albumin administration is recommended in the management of patients with cirrhosis for select indications (large-volume paracentesis, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [SBP], and hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]). In single-institution open-label RCTs, 20% albumin versus Plasma-Lyte in 100 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher rates of shock reversal but no survival benefit and increased pulmonary complications, and 5% albumin versus normal saline in 308 patients with sepsis-induced hypotension had higher reversal of hypotension with higher 1-week survival (43.5% vs. 38.3%, p = 0.03). There are no large RCT specific to the use of albumin in patients with ACLF; in the Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure trial, 777 hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis were randomized to daily albumin infusions versus standard care with no difference in the composite primary endpoint and possible higher rates of pulmonary edema and fluid overload, and overall its broader use as a resuscitation agent in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and/or ACLF is not well defined.

Platelet management in cirrhosis—thresholds, transfusion performance, and thrombopoietin (TPO) agonists: The convergence of retrospective and in vitro studies regarding platelet levels in the 50,000–60,000 range as promoting thrombin generation has led to this range becoming the target for prophylaxis, and when increased platelet levels are deemed urgently necessary, single-donor platelet transfusion will minimize immunologic risk. Thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis is multifactorial; the lifespan of a normal platelet is approximately 10 days and one-third are sequestered in the spleen, and the half-life of transfused platelets has been reported to be as low as 2.5–4.5 days and their function is diminished. When procedures are planned in advance, recently approved TPO agonists are a nice alternative to platelet transfusion; TPO agonists have the advantage of not increasing portal pressure and elevating platelets for longer than transfusions can, but eltrombopag has been associated with PVT when platelets inadvertently increased dramatically in a minority of patients, whereas both avatrombopag and lusutrombopag have more modest effects on platelet levels and, when used for a short duration, have not had this issue in currently available clinical trials.

P363 Thromboelastometry versus standard coagulation tests versus restrictive protocol to guide blood transfusion prior to central venous catheterization in cirrhosis: a randomized controlled trial

LL Rocha, A Serpa Neto, CM Pessoa, RF Chaves, T Crochemore, E Silva, LR Ferraz, TD Correa

Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil

Introduction: There is a perceived increased risk of bleeding in cirrhosis patients undergoing invasive procedures. This lead to a high rate of empirical prophylactic transfusion, which has been associated to increased complications and cost. The best strategy to guide transfusion in these patients remains unclear. Our aim was to compare three strategies to guide blood component transfusion prior to central venous catheterization (CVC) in critically ill cirrhosis patients.

Methods: Single center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial conducted in Brazil [1]. All cirrhosis patients admitted to the ICU with indication for a CVC were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to three transfusion strategies based on: (1) standard coagulation tests (SCT), (2) rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and (3) restrictive. The primary outcome was proportion of transfusion of any blood component prior to CVC. Secondary outcomes were incidence of major and minor bleeding, ICU length of stay (LOS), and 28-day mortality. Analysis was intention-to-treat.

Results: 57 participants (19 in each group) were enrolled between September 2014 and December 2016. Most were male (64.9%) and listed for liver transplantation. The study ended after reaching efficacy in first interim analysis. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics among groups. Regarding primary endpoint, there was 14 (73.7%), 13 (68.4%), and 3 (15.8%) events in SCT, ROTEM and restrictive groups, respectively (p <0.001). There was no difference between SCT and ROTEM groups (p >0.99). Overall 28-day mortality was 33.3% and was similar between groups. ICU LOS did not differ between groups. There was no major bleeding. Overall minor bleeding occurred in 10.53% with no difference between groups.

Conclusions: A restrictive strategy is safe and effective in reducing the need of blood component transfusion prior to CVC in critically ill cirrhosis patients. A ROTEM-based strategy was no different from transfusion guided by SCT.

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British society of gastroenterology, the royal college of radiologists and the royal college of pathology [^676acbcc]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Increasing evidence shows that viscoelastic assays can be used to assess haemostatic status in patients with liver disease, with evidence that this can result in a reduction in blood products transfused.This has become increasingly established in liver surgery but more recently for other procedures. In a small randomised trial, De Pietrishowed that in patients with cirrhosis and an INR >1.8 and/or platelet count <50×10 9 /L requiring invasive procedures, a thromboelastogram-guided transfusion strategy led to a significantly lower use of blood products (17% compared with 100% transfusion in the standard of care group) without an increase in bleeding complications; only one major bleed occurred, which was in the standard of care group. This has been shown in other open-label randomised studies.Viscoelastic testing has therefore been used successfully to reduce unnecessary prophylactic transfusions in patients with liver disease (in comparison with using the INR and platelet count). In contrast, in a single-centre randomised study of central venous catheter insertion in patients with cirrhosis, a thromboelastography-based strategy did not reduce blood transfusion compared with usual care; however, a restrictive protocol (no transfusion unless INR >5.0 or platelet count <25×10 9 /L) reduced transfusion without an increase in bleeding.It should also be noted that these assays have not yet been shown to reliably predict bleeding in patients with liver disease.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^ec8f1ba7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Cirrhosis and ACLF—coagulation assessment and venous thromboembolism (VTE) management: INR, although strongly linked with liver function in the absence of vitamin K deficiency, does not measure coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, whereas thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are viscoelastic tests that are more physiologic than standard testing. Normal TEG or ROTEM measurements in compensated or decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF can avoid blood product transfusion for procedures even with elevated INR, and TEG-guided assessment decreases transfusions without changing rebleeding risk. When TEG/ROTEM are unavailable, fibrinogen and platelet levels should be evaluated, and no data support prophylactic transfusions in the absence of bleeding or need for invasive procedures. In patients with cirrhosis without ACLF, a rebalancing in coagulation occurs but hypercoagulability can be found; one cannot justify therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) chronically without a thrombus, whereas full-dose anticoagulation should be used for acute thromboembolic events, especially symptomatic acute portal vein thrombosis in the absence of contraindications. Hospitalized cirrhotic patients are at higher VTE risk than noncirrhhotics; pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis has not been shown to increase bleeding overall, but patients with recent bleeding and significant thrombocytopenia (platelets ≤ 50 × 10^9/L) are not optimal candidates for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of coagulopathy, EASL 2022 guidelines recommend to do not correct abnormal laboratory tests (INR, aPTT, platelet count, fibrinogen) by administering blood products or factor concentrates with the aim of preventing spontaneous bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.

Patients with cirrhosis who develop tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome have a very high mortality and present a management challenge. Current debate stems from a lack of studies evaluating changes in effective arterial blood volume following paracentesis or targeting fluid replacement with appropriate vascular physiological measures to ensure no paracentesis-related circulatory dysfunction. The study by Umgelter and colleagues addresses a goal-directed approach to fluid management in hepatorenal syndrome and raises several mechanistic questions, the answers to which are likely to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology in hepatorenal syndrome and to guide future management.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^f1361cd1]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Tests of hemostasis in cirrhosis—INR and conventional labs: All currently available laboratory measures of hemostasis have significant limitations in liver disease patients and lack adequate prospective data, especially as pre-procedure risk measures. The international normalized ratio (INR) is the most problematic because of its entrenched but unfounded position in traditional medical teaching, and the test is a mathematical manipulation of the prothrombin time that measures procoagulant factors I, II, V, VII, and X but does not measure the deficit of liver-derived anticoagulant factors, such as protein C. This causes significant variation in the INR in cirrhosis between different hospitals, depending on which thromboplastin is used in the test, and use of fresh frozen plasma to “correct” a prolonged INR in cirrhosis does not actually change thrombin production (factor II), but does exacerbate portal hypertension.

TRADITIONAL HEMOSTATIC ASSESSMENT TESTS

There is a poor correlation between traditional coagulation tests and thrombin‐generating capacity in cirrhosis. Prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) traditionally assess hemostasis; however, these tests measure only a discrete number of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors that can lead to an incomplete picture of hemostasis and have limitations in advanced liver disease and cirrhosis. PT/INR are usually prolonged in patients with decompensated cirrhosis as a result of reduced liver synthetic function; however, this does not account for all anticoagulant factors (including low levels of proteins C and S) and therefore does not correlate with bleeding risk and thus should not be corrected routinely with plasma transfusion. This is clearly demonstrated with studies using a modified thrombin generation assay, which adds thrombomodulin to activate protein C, thereby demonstrating a more accurate depiction of hemostasis in this population. 

Thrombocytopenia has historically been considered a risk factor for bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. However, data are mixed, and the putative relationship between thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk is not well supported. Changes in the hemostatic system may partially compensate for thrombocytopenia, including elevated vWF, which promotes platelet adhesion and forms a complex with Factor VIII (also elevated) to accelerate coagulation. Large randomized controlled trials examining TPO use prior to procedures for patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia were not designed to assess the effect on bleeding outcomes. Viscoelastic testing (VET) has been used as a guide for platelet transfusions and demonstrates a reduction of platelet transfusion use. It remains unclear what level of thrombocytopenia represents an increased risk of bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. 

Transfusion of blood products in patients with cirrhosis has risks, including exacerbation of portal hypertension from volume expansion, hemolysis, and infectious and immunologic complications. The risk of human leukocyte antigen or red cell antibody development from transfusion can impair the ability to receive further transfusions and impact subsequent transplantation, especially for simultaneous liver–kidney transplantation. Transfusion‐associated circulatory overload rates increase with the number of transfusions administered, and transfusion‐related acute lung injury rates are higher when plasma‐containing blood products, including platelets, are used. Blood products and transfusion thresholds are summarized in Table 1.

### Thromboelastography versus standard coagulation testing in the assessment and reversal of coagulopathy among cirrhotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^90cf0e26]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The utility of thromboelastography/thromboelastometry currently has unvalidated clinical benefit in the assessment and reversal of coagulopathy among cirrhotic patients as compared to standard coagulation testing. A novel systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in order to assess pooled outcome data among patients receiving thromboelastography/thromboelastometry as compared to standard coagulation testing. As compared to standard coagulation testing, there was a significant reduction in the number of patients requiring pRBC, platelet, and fresh frozen plasma transfusions among thromboelastography/thromboelastometry group with pooled OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.32-0.85; P = 0.009), 0.29 (95% CI 0.12-0.74; P = 0.009), and 0.19 (95% CI 0.12-0.31; P < 0.00001), respectively. Similarly, there was a significant reduction in number of pRBC, platelet, and fresh frozen plasma units transfused in the thromboelastography/thromboelastometry group with pooled MD -1.53 (95% CI -2.86 to -0.21; P = 0.02), -0.57 (95% CI -1.06 to -0.09; P = 0.02), and -2.71 (95% CI -4.34 to -1.07; P = 0.001), respectively. There were significantly decreased total bleeding events with pooled OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.31-0.94; P = 0.03) and amount of intraoperative bleeding during liver transplantation with pooled MD -1.46 (95% CI -2.49 to -0.44; P = 0.005) in the thromboelastography/thromboelastometry group. Overall, there was no significant difference in mortality between groups with pooled OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.63-1.30; P = 0.60). As compared to standard coagulation testing, a thromboelastography/thromboelastometry-guided approach to the assessment and reversal of cirrhotic coagulopathy improves overall number of patients exposed to blood product transfusions, quantity of transfusions, and bleeding events.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^8013b51d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Management of hemostatic derangements—perioperative care in cirrhosis: If available, viscoelastic testing such as TEG may be considered to guide management of coagulopathy in the perioperative setting for patients with cirrhosis rather than reliance on traditional hemostatic markers alone to minimize periprocedural bleeding risk; if viscoelastic testing is not available, it is reasonable to correct severe thrombocytopenia (<50 K/mm^3) prior to major surgery. Use of vitamin K or blood products to correct elevated INR prior to major surgery has not been demonstrated to reduce bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis, and vitamin K administration has not been studied in the preoperative setting, with routine use not reducing the risk of bleeding in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. In one study of invasive procedures, a PLT count of <75 K/mm^3 was independently associated with periprocedural bleeding in the setting of significant coagulopathy (INR >1.5). Several randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis showed reduced utilization of blood product transfusions without increased incidence of bleeding when TEG was evaluated in cirrhosis, including an RCT of 58 patients where only 31% received preprocedural blood products with TEG vs 100% with standard care, with no patients in either group developing periprocedural bleeding; although TEG has not been studied in patients with cirrhosis undergoing major surgery.

Methods

Study design

This was a prospective study of adult cirrhotic patients who admitted with AKI-prone conditions. All patients had normal baseline serum creatinine within 3 months prior to admission and were enrolled during May 1, 2011 to Dec 31, 2013 at tertiary-care, King Chulalongkorn Memorial hospital. One hundred and thirty-seven patients with cirrhosis, aged more than 18 years, were admitted during the study period. Exclusion criteria were chronic kidney disease, or previous liver or kidney transplantation. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on a combination of clinical, biochemical and imaging assessments (ultrasound/computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) or liver biopsy.

Clinical data included demographics, cause of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score, MELD score, use of vasoactive drug, blood transfusion, and length of hospital stay, together with laboratory data included liver function test, complete blood count, coagulogram, and blood culture were collected within 72 h after admission. Patients had urine collection upon enrollment (within 24 h after admission) and at the subsequent 24 h for uNGAL measurements. Blood samples were drawn for serum creatinine upon enrollment and at 24, 48 and 72 h. Patients were prospectively followed up for mortality assessments to 30 days. The mortality causes were liver-related conditions including liver-related infection, HRS, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB. number 357/55) of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, and all participants provided permission for their medical information to be used for research purposes. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Operational definitions of AKI-prone conditions

Volume depletion, e.g. gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, GI fluid loss, over-diuresis, excessive fluid loss in patients with ascites treated with diuretics, large-volume paracentesis [,–].
Bacterial infections, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), skin and soft tissue infections, hepatobiliary infection, spontaneous bacteremia as defined by standard diagnostic criteria for each specific infection.
Recent exposure to nephrotoxic agents, e.g. NSAIDs, contrast agents.
Acute decompensated cirrhosis, e.g. hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, SBP and HRS.

### Reappraisal of the conventional hemostasis tests as predictors of perioperative bleeding in the era of rebalanced hemostasis in cirrhosis [^666b8ac0]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

New global laboratory procedures mimicking the in vivo hemostasis process led to the changing paradigm of cirrhosis from the prototype of hemorrhagic diseases to a condition in which hemostasis is normal but fragile, thus justifying the hemorrhagic/thrombotic tendencies that affect these patients. The new paradigm was instrumental to change the management of cirrhosis. For example, international guidelines warn against the entrenched practice of testing patients with conventional hemostasis tests and infusing those with abnormalities with fresh-frozen plasma, coagulation factor concentrates, or platelets, prior to surgery/invasive procedures. These recommendations are, however, largely disattended. The practice of testing patients with the prothrombin time or viscoelastometry and using arbitrary cutoffs to make decisions on perioperative prophylaxis is still common and probably driven by medicolegal issues. There is no doubt that prothrombin time and congeners tests are unable to predict bleeding in cirrhosis. However, it cannot be excluded that some tests may be useful in patients who are severely decompensated. Large prospective collaborative studies are warranted. Enrolled patients should be randomized to receive perioperative prophylaxis based on laboratory testing (eg, viscoelastometry, thrombomodulin-modified thrombin generation) or to usual care. However, for these trials to be useful, a third group of patients who do not receive prophylaxis should be included. In conclusion, until results from these studies are available, physicians attending cirrhosis should refrain from using laboratory tests with arbitrary cutoffs to make decision on perioperative prophylaxis. Decision should be made by considering the clinical history of individual patients and the risk of hemorrhage of specific procedures.

### Preprocedural prophylaxis with blood products in patients with cirrhosis: results from a survey of the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) [^f4b4b291]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The concept of rebalanced hemostasis in cirrhosis challenges the policy of transfusing plasma or platelets before invasive procedures in patients with prolonged PT or severe thrombocytopenia. Recent guidelines recommend against plasma transfusion and suggest avoiding/minimizing platelet transfusions.

Aim

We assessed how hepato-gastroenterologists manage prolonged PT/INR or severe thrombocytopenia before invasive procedures.

Methods

On May 2021, AISF members were sent a questionnaire addressing the PT/INR and platelet thresholds required before invasive procedures, the use of other markers of bleeding risk or other hemostatic treatments and the burden of pre-emptive plasma and platelet transfusions.

Results

Of 62 respondents, 94% and 100% use PT/INR and platelet count to assess bleeding risk, respectively. Only 37% and 32% require less conservative PT/INR or platelet counts thresholds for low-risk procedures, respectively. As for those applying single thresholds, 68% require PT/INR <1,5 and 86% require platelet counts ≥50 × 10 9 /L. Half respondents use additional indicators of bleeding risk and 63% other hemostatic treatments. Low-risk procedures account for 70% of procedures, and for 50% and 59% of plasma and platelets units transfused, respectively.

Conclusions

the survey indicates lack of compliance with guidelines that advise against plasma and platelet transfusions before invasive procedures and the need for prospective studies and inter-society consensus workshops.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^f29bde76]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Preoperative assessment and management

Hypovolemia, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia are the major concerns during preoperative assessment and resuscitation. Goal-directed fluid administration and use of blood products (Table 1) should be guided, where possible, by hemodynamic monitoring. Low urine output should be interpreted with caution. Oliguria from hormonal and inflammatory changes associated with cirrhosis and the underlying emergency might mislead the clinician to volume overload the patient. Excessive crystalloid and blood product infusion, in turn, can precipitate respiratory failure and variceal hemorrhage.

Table 1 
Management of perioperative coagulopathy in chronic liver disease

Conventional coagulation tests, which commonly focus on measuring defects in specific hemostatic pathways, often do not provide an accurate picture of the overall clotting ability within cirrhosis. Furthermore, these tests are poor predictors of the risk of hemorrhage versus thrombosis. Given that thromboelastography evaluates the viscoelastic properties of blood and therefore provides a comprehensive evaluation of the clotting process, its use has been recommended in the global assessment of clot formation, strength, and dissolution. In a prospective study, thromboelastography differentiated cirrhotic patients from healthy volunteers (AUC = 0.921, p < 0.001), while conventional coagulation tests did not. A growing body of literature supports the use of thromboelastography in liver transplantation, but more studies are still necessary for many other diagnostic tests. Other coagulation studies such as sonorheometry, international normalized ratio calibrated for cirrhosis, and coagulation-like thrombin generation time have also been recommended, but still lack definitive prospective validation for cirrhotic patients.
