## Question

What is the treatment protocol for DKA?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step DKA treatment protocol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and severity stratification. Then, I should verify fluid resuscitation strategy and when to add dextrose. Next, I will review insulin route and dosing, including subcutaneous options and transitions. After that, I need to check potassium and other electrolytes, including phosphate. Then, I will examine monitoring cadence and resolution criteria. I should also consider special populations and precipitating causes. Finally, I will ensure discharge planning and prevention are addressed, and I will double-check areas of controversy like bicarbonate and insulin boluses before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity before initiating therapy, because jumping ahead without criteria can misclassify patients and lead to inappropriate management. DKA is defined by hyperglycemia or known diabetes, elevated ketones, and metabolic acidosis; I should preferentially measure serum β-hydroxybutyrate rather than relying on urine ketones for both diagnosis and monitoring, and I must remember euglycemic DKA, especially with SGLT2 inhibitors, where glucose can be normal despite significant ketosis and acidosis [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^1133osWU] [^117FgVQm]. I need to check severity using venous pH and bicarbonate: mild pH 7.25–7.30, moderate pH 7.00– < 7.24, and severe pH < 7.00, while also assessing mental status, hemodynamics, and comorbidities that would push me toward ICU-level care or IV insulin rather than subcutaneous pathways [^116mHPx6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about insulin before fluids; I should verify that initial resuscitation is prioritized because DKA patients are typically severely volume depleted. For adults without cardiac or renal compromise, I will start isotonic saline at 500–1000 mL/hour for the first 2–4 hours, then tailor to blood pressure, heart rate, urine output, and corrected sodium, aiming to correct the fluid deficit over 24–48 hours while watching for fluid overload in high-risk groups like older adults, those with heart failure, or chronic kidney disease [^notfound]. In children, I should be cautious with rapid fluid shifts; the FLUID trial supports using calculated deficit plus maintenance over 48 hours with careful neurologic monitoring, and recent pediatric RCTs suggest balanced crystalloids and standardized potassium strategies can be safe, though I need to individualize and avoid overly rapid early boluses in those at risk for cerebral edema [^1169hwjv] [^116ZyEoz].

> Wait, let me verify the dextrose timing because glucose often falls before ketosis clears. I should add 5–10% dextrose to IV fluids once plasma glucose drops below about 250 mg/dL to permit continued insulin until ketoacidosis resolves, and in euglycemic DKA I should start dextrose-containing fluids at the outset alongside insulin to avoid hypoglycemia while treating ketosis [^116vxCdp]. Let me consider operational efficiency: a two-bag system with one isotonic fluid and one with dextrose allows seamless titration and has been associated with faster anion gap closure and fewer hypoglycemia episodes compared with serial bag changes, which I should leverage when available [^116P2RQ1] [^113wVYQg].

> I will now examine insulin therapy, and I need to ensure I match route and dose to severity and setting. For moderate-to-severe DKA or hemodynamic instability, continuous IV regular insulin at 0.1 units/kg/hour is standard; if there is a delay in starting the infusion, a one-time IV bolus of 0.1 units/kg can be considered, but I should avoid routine boluses otherwise due to hypokalemia risk and lack of benefit when adequate infusion rates are used [^111Xg7Co]. When glucose falls below about 150–200 mg/dL, I should reduce the infusion to 0.05 units/kg/hour to mitigate hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia while continuing insulin until anion gap closure and acidosis resolution are confirmed [^117Lu9uo].

> But wait, what if the patient has mild-to-moderate DKA and is clinically stable without ICU needs; could subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin be appropriate? I should double-check the evidence: ADA 2025 supports subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs for selected mild or moderate cases, and large real-world data show that a protocol using weight-based subcutaneous glargine plus lispro every 4 hours reduced ICU admissions and readmissions without increasing hypoglycemia, though I must select patients carefully and exclude those with shock, severe acidosis, or unreliable absorption [^117Lu9uo] [^115pkXzZ] [^111rizkt]. Systematic reviews suggest no clear advantage or disadvantage of subcutaneous versus IV insulin in mild-to-moderate DKA, so local expertise, nursing protocols, and patient factors should guide the choice, and I should be prepared to switch to IV if the course is complicated or absorption is uncertain [^115GLxpD] [^116mHPx6].

> Next, I should review potassium because shifts with insulin and acid-base correction can precipitate dangerous hypokalemia. I need to check serum potassium before insulin; if it is below 3.3 mmol/L, I should delay insulin and aggressively replete potassium, often 10–20 mmol/hour via central access if needed, until potassium exceeds 3.5 mmol/L; if potassium is 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, I should add 10–20 mmol/L to each liter of IV fluids and recheck frequently; if potassium is above 5.0 mmol/L, I can start insulin without potassium but must monitor closely as levels often fall quickly [^1135r4eb]. I should confirm that I am checking potassium about 2 hours after starting insulin and then every 4 hours until DKA resolves to catch hypokalemia early [^112qkDfR].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook other electrolytes and acid-base management. Routine bicarbonate is not recommended because it does not improve outcomes and may worsen hypokalemia or cerebral acidosis; I should reserve it for extreme circumstances like life-threatening hyperkalemia with cardiac instability or refractory shock, and even then use with caution [^1155FWi9]. For phosphate, I should consider replacement if levels drop below about 0.32 mmol/L or if there is significant muscle weakness or respiratory depression, typically using potassium phosphate while monitoring calcium and renal function to avoid hypocalcemia [^113KospR]. Magnesium should be repleted if low, particularly when hypokalemia is refractory, as it supports potassium balance and insulin responsiveness.

> Let me think about monitoring cadence and resolution criteria, because premature transitions can cause rebound. I should monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, osmolality, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stable, then space out as parameters normalize; bedside β-hydroxybutyrate can help track ketone clearance, and I should document anion gap closure as a surrogate for resolution of ketoacidosis [^1164uV6V] [^113KospR]. Resolution is generally defined by glucose less than about 200–250 mg/dL, bicarbonate at least 18 mmol/L, venous pH above 7.3, and closure of the anion gap; importantly, I should continue insulin until the anion gap closes even if glucose normalizes earlier to avoid incomplete ketosis reversal [^115ukyhK] [^113YCWWn].

> Hold on, I should verify the transition strategy to avoid rebound hyperglycemia. I need to start basal subcutaneous insulin 2–4 hours before discontinuing the IV infusion to provide overlapping coverage, and I should continue the IV infusion for 1–2 hours after the first subcutaneous dose; this overlap reduces rebound and failed transitions, and I should double-check that the patient can eat and that the precipitating cause is addressed before stopping IV therapy [^1163TwTf] [^113YCWWn]. If I initially used a subcutaneous-only protocol, I should continue scheduled basal and rapid-acting insulin until resolution criteria are met, then consolidate to a maintenance regimen aligned with the patient's prior diabetes therapy or new diagnosis needs [^117Lu9uo].

> I should confirm special populations and precipitating factors are actively managed in parallel. In pregnancy, I will favor continuous IV insulin with close maternal-fetal monitoring; in children, I will prioritize IV insulin and fluids with neurologic surveillance and avoid overly rapid early fluid shifts; in older adults or those with heart or kidney disease, I will resuscitate more cautiously and monitor for fluid overload; and in suspected euglycemic DKA, I must not be reassured by normal glucose and should treat ketosis with insulin and dextrose-containing fluids from the start [^112YtsdG] [^1169hwjv] [^116vxCdp]. I need to check for infection, myocardial ischemia, pancreatitis, medication nonadherence, and new therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors, and I should remember that SGLT2-associated DKA can be euglycemic and requires the same core treatment plus education and risk mitigation if the agent is continued [^112hvzFT] [^1133osWU] [^117FgVQm].

> Next, I should review discharge planning and prevention, because readmissions are common and preventable. Before discharge, I will arrange diabetes education on sick-day rules, ketone monitoring with serum β-hydroxybutyrate, insulin adjustments during illness, and when to seek care; I will ensure timely endocrinology follow-up and, when appropriate, provide SGLT2 DKA risk mitigation tools and counseling if that drug class is used or contemplated [^111e8adi] [^115U7is3] [^112hvzFT]. Let me verify that structured education and follow-up are associated with better outcomes; the large SQ protocol implementation showed reduced readmissions alongside increased endocrine follow-up, supporting this approach even if causality cannot be claimed from observational data [^111rizkt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost recommended a routine insulin bolus at initiation; I should double-check that. Evidence does not support routine loading boluses with continuous infusions, and they may precipitate hypokalemia; therefore, I will avoid priming doses unless there is a compelling delay in starting the infusion and the patient is severely hyperglycemic and acidotic, in which case a single 0.1 units/kg IV bolus can be considered with close monitoring [^111Xg7Co] [^114DnzPQ]. I also briefly considered whether bicarbonate could speed resolution; hold on, I should verify again — multiple guidelines advise against routine bicarbonate because it does not improve outcomes and may cause harm, so I will reserve it for exceptional scenarios only [^1155FWi9].

> Finally, I should confirm that my protocol aligns with a standardized, team-based approach, as this improves safety and efficiency. Using order sets, two-bag fluid systems, and clear insulin transition rules reduces errors, shortens time to resolution, and can safely shift care out of the ICU for appropriately selected patients, though I must embed monitoring safeguards and escalation triggers to manage exceptions [^111wujQm] [^116P2RQ1] [^116CLYbK]. If I maintain vigilance for hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, fluid shifts, and rebound hyperglycemia, and if I individualize based on severity and comorbidities, this stepwise protocol should remain consistent with contemporary evidence and guidelines while allowing flexibility for patient-specific needs [^1117ZCKL] [^1163TwTf].

The DKA treatment protocol centers on **IV fluids, insulin, and electrolytes** with close monitoring and identification of precipitating causes [^1117ZCKL] [^111wujQm]. Start **isotonic saline** at 15–20 mL/kg/h for the first 1–2 hours, then adjust to 4–14 mL/kg/h based on correction of sodium and volume status; add dextrose when glucose falls below 200 mg/dL to allow continued insulin until ketoacidosis resolves [^112YtsdG] [^notfound]. Begin **regular insulin** at 0.1 units/kg/h IV after fluids; if glucose drops below 200 mg/dL, reduce to 0.05 units/kg/h and maintain glucose 150–200 mg/dL until anion gap closes and pH normalizes [^117Lu9uo] [^115LGzuF]. Replace potassium based on levels, and add phosphate if needed; do not use bicarbonate routinely [^1135r4eb] [^1155FWi9]. Transition to subcutaneous insulin 1–2 hours before stopping the infusion, and treat the underlying cause to prevent recurrence [^1164uV6V] [^1117ZCKL].

---

## Fluid resuscitation

Fluid therapy restores intravascular volume, improves perfusion, and reduces counterregulatory hormones; **isotonic saline** is first-line [^112YtsdG].

- **Initial fluid resuscitation**: Start isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) at 15–20 mL/kg/h for the first 1–2 hours; reduce to 4–14 mL/kg/h based on correction of sodium and volume status [^notfound].

- **Addition of dextrose**: When plasma glucose falls below 200 mg/dL, add 5–10% dextrose to allow continued insulin until ketoacidosis resolves [^notfound].

- **Special considerations**: Use caution in patients with renal or cardiac compromise; consider balanced crystalloids in specific cases [^112YtsdG].

---

## Insulin therapy

Insulin suppresses ketogenesis and corrects hyperglycemia; **continuous IV infusion** is standard for moderate-to-severe DKA [^117Lu9uo].

- **Initial insulin infusion**: Start regular insulin at 0.1 units/kg/h IV after initial fluids; avoid bolus unless there is a delay in infusion setup [^117Lu9uo].

- **Adjustment of insulin dose**: When glucose falls below 200 mg/dL, reduce to 0.05 units/kg/h and maintain glucose 150–200 mg/dL until anion gap closes and pH normalizes [^117Lu9uo].

- **Transition to subcutaneous insulin**: Start basal SC insulin 1–2 hours before stopping the infusion to prevent rebound hyperglycemia [^1164uV6V].

---

## Electrolyte management

Electrolyte disturbances are common; **potassium replacement** is critical.

| **Serum potassium** | **Potassium replacement** |
|-|-|
| < 3.5 mmol/L | - 10–20 mmol/L/h until > 3.5 mmol/L <br/> - Central access may be needed for rapid replacement [^1135r4eb] |
| 3.5–5.0 mmol/L | - Add 10–20 mmol/L to IV fluids <br/> - Maintain 4–5 mmol/L [^1135r4eb] |
| > 5.0 mmol/L | - Start insulin <br/> - Do not give potassium <br/> - Monitor every 2 hours [^1135r4eb] |

---

Phosphate replacement is indicated for **severe hypophosphatemia** or **symptomatic patients**, and **bicarbonate** is not routinely used; reserve for severe acidosis with hemodynamic instability [^1155FWi9].

---

## Monitoring and resolution criteria

Frequent monitoring guides therapy and detects complications; **anion gap closure** is the key endpoint [^1164uV6V].

- **Frequency of monitoring**: Check serum electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stable [^1164uV6V].

- **Resolution criteria**: Anion gap ≤ 12 mmol/L, bicarbonate ≥ 18 mmol/L, pH ≥ 7.3, and glucose < 200 mg/dL [^115yTEZQ].

- **Transition to subcutaneous insulin**: Begin SC insulin 1–2 hours before stopping the infusion [^1164uV6V].

---

## Identification and treatment of precipitating causes

Common precipitants include infection, insulin omission, and new-onset diabetes; **targeted treatment** reduces recurrence [^1117ZCKL].

---

## Complications and special considerations

- **Hypoglycemia**: Monitor closely and adjust insulin and dextrose as needed [^1117ZCKL].

- **Hypokalemia**: Aggressive potassium replacement and monitoring are essential [^1135r4eb].

- **Cerebral edema**: Rare but serious; associated with rapid correction of hyperglycemia and osmolarity [^117Q57Pn].

- **Euglycemic DKA**: Treat similarly with insulin and fluids despite normal glucose [^1133osWU].

## DKA treatment protocol

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Fluid resuscitation | Isotonic saline 15–20 mL/kg/h initially; add dextrose when glucose < 200 mg/dL [^112YtsdG] |
| 2 | Insulin therapy | - 0.1 units/kg/h IV <br/> - Reduce to 0.05 units/kg/h when glucose < 200 mg/dL [^117Lu9uo] |
| 3 | Electrolyte management | - Potassium replacement based on levels <br/> - Phosphate if indicated <br/> - No routine bicarbonate [^1135r4eb] [^1155FWi9] |
| 4 | Monitoring | - Frequent labs every 2–4 hours <br/> - Transition to SC insulin when resolved [^1164uV6V] |
| 5 | Precipitating cause | Identify and treat underlying causes [^1117ZCKL] |

---

The DKA protocol emphasizes **fluids, insulin, and electrolytes** with close monitoring and cause identification; **structured protocols** improve safety, efficiency, and outcomes [^111wujQm].

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115pkXzZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Standard diabetic ketoacidosis care in the US includes intravenous insulin treatment in the intensive care unit. Subcutaneous (SQ) insulin could decrease intensive care unit need, but the data are limited.

Objective

To assess outcomes after implementation of an SQ insulin protocol for treating diabetic ketoacidosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study is a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively implemented SQ insulin protocol. The study was conducted at an integrated health care system in Northern California. Participants included hospitalized patients with diabetic ketoacidosis at 21 hospitals between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2019. The preimplementation phase was 2010 to 2015, and the postimplementation phase was 2017 to 2019. Data analysis was performed from October 2020 to January 2022.

Exposure

An SQ insulin treatment protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Difference-in-differences evaluation of the need for intensive care, mortality, readmission, and length of stay at a single intervention site using an SQ insulin protocol from 2017 onward compared with 20 control hospitals using standard care.

Results

A total of 7989 hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis occurred, with 4739 (59.3%) occurring before and 3250 (40.7%) occurring after implementation. The overall mean (SD) age was 42.3(17.7) years, with 4137 hospitalizations (51.8%) occurring among female patients. Before implementation, SQ insulin was the first insulin used in 40 intervention (13.4%) and 651 control (14.7%) hospitalizations. After implementation, 98 hospitalizations (80.3%) received SQ insulin first at the intervention site compared with 402 hospitalizations (12.8%) at control sites. The adjusted rate ratio for intensive care unit admission was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.33–0.56) at the intervention sites, a 57% reduction compared with control sites, and was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25–0.99) for 30-day hospital readmission, a 50% reduction. There were no significant changes in hospital length of stay and rates of death.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that a protocol based on SQ insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis treatment was associated with significant decreases in intensive care unit need and readmission, with no evidence of increases in adverse events.

### Severe complications after initial management of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis with a standard diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^115GLRMT]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is a clinical entity not identical to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and with a markedly higher mortality. Children with HHS can also present with concomitant DKA. Patients with HHS (with or without DKA) are profoundly dehydrated but often receive inadequate fluid resuscitation as well as intravenous insulin therapy based on traditional DKA protocols, and this can lead to devastating consequences. In this article, we briefly review HHS along with a report of an adolescent who presented with HHS and DKA and was initially managed as DKA. She went into hypotensive shock and developed severe, multiorgan failure. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of HHS and its differences from DKA in terms of initial management is crucial to guide management and improve outcomes. Additionally, fluid therapy in amounts concordant with the degree of dehydration remains the mainstay therapy.

### Implementation and outcome of a protocol-based treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department [^113wVYQg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The standardization of clinical practice in emergency treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a prerequisite for improving patient care. For this purpose, a standardized DKA protocol incorporating a two-bag system has been implemented since January 2020 in our center.

Objectives

To assess the impact of the development and utilization of the standard treatment pathway for DKA on patient outcomes.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study involved patients diagnosed with DKA and admitted to the pediatric emergency department (PED). The entire period of the study was from January 2017 to September 2022. Patients with DKA managed before and after implementation of the protocol were compared in terms of clinical outcomes.

Results

Out of 145 patients, 77 (53%) patients were in the pre-protocol group, 68 (47%) were in the protocol group. Age, sex, and severity of DKA were similar between the groups. Implementation of the protocol resulted in shorter resolution time of acidosis and ketosis (p = 0.007, p < 0.001, respectively), higher correction rates of bicarbonate and blood ketones (p = 0.003, p < 0.001, respectively), shorter duration of IV insulin treatment (p = 0.008), more appropriate potassium dosage administrating to IV fluids (p < 0.001), lower incidence of hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypoglycemia (p = 0.008, p = 0.002, p = 0.036, respectively), and smaller number of IV bags use (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Implementation of a protocol-based pathway for DKA involving a two-bag system provided earlier correction of ketoacidosis, decreased the risk of complications, and reduced resource utilization in the PED.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^116KQNjP]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Previous research indicates that adhering to protocol‐driven DKA management improves outcomes. The Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) group formulated guidelines for standardised DKA care. However, compliance with JBDS‐IP guidelines in clinical practice and its impact on clinical and patient‐centred outcomes remains insufficiently explored.
In DKA episodes where fixed‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) rate reduction was adopted, there was a significant delay in adjusting the FRIII rate when glucose was < 14 mmol/L. We did not find any favourable effect on the rate of complications or outcomes in DKA episodes with reduced‐rate FRIII.
Understanding factors that influence adherence to guidelines is crucial in creating resources to implement guidelines effectively.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^111rizkt]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a subcutaneous insulin protocol implemented at a hospital level associated with use of intensive care and other outcomes among adults with diabetic ketoacidosis?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 7989 hospitalizations over a 9-year period, implementation of a subcutaneous insulin treatment protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis at a single intervention site, compared with 20 standard care sites, was not associated with increased hypoglycemia but was associated with a relative reduction of direct intensive care unit admission of 57% and a 50% reduction in hospital readmission, with no change in hospital length of stay.

Meaning

These findings suggest that a subcutaneous insulin protocol for treating diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with reduced hospital resource utilization but was not associated with increased hypoglycemia.

### Fluid treatment for children with diabetic ketoacidosis: how do the results of the pediatric emergency care applied research network fluid therapies under investigation in diabetic ketoacidosis (FLUID) trial change our perspective? [^1169hwjv]. Pediatric Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

The optimal fluid treatment protocol for children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has long been a subject of controversy. Until recently, there was no high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials to support an optimal guideline, and recommendations were mainly based on theoretical considerations. As a consequence, fluid treatment protocols for children with DKA vary between institutions (and countries). In June 2018, the results from the Fluid Therapies Under Investigation in DKA Trial conducted in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network were published. This large, factorial-designed randomized controlled trial assessed neurological outcomes of 1387 children with DKA who were treated with one of four fluid protocols that varied in infusion rate and sodium content. In this commentary, we review and discuss the results of this new study and the implications for clinical care of DKA in children.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes‐related ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life‐threatening yet preventable complication of predominantly type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, it may also occur in ketosis‐prone type 2 diabetes (T2D) and with the use of novel agents such as sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.DKA is characterised by a triad of blood glucose concentration > 11.0 mmol/L or known diagnosis of diabetes, capillary of blood ketone concentration > 3.0 mmol/L or significant ketonuria and bicarbonate concentration of < 15.0 mmol/L and/or venous pH < 7.3.DKA may occur in states of absolute or relative insulin deficiency or as a consequence of a rise in counter‐regulatory hormones including cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon and catecholamines. The alteration in hormone levels contributes to elevated blood glucose, lipolysis, ketone body production and electrolyte imbalances. Mismanagement of DKA may result in increased length of hospital admission and high readmission rates. Previous studies have demonstrated that protocol‐driven management of DKA is a safe approach — decreasing the duration of DKA and length of hospital admission with no difference in hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia.

Though the diagnostic criteria for DKA remain unambiguous in the United Kingdom, there remains a variation in DKA management guidelines between hospital sites. To reduce errors and improve the standard of care, the Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) published national guidelines for DKA management, which have been regularly revised. Initial surveys have demonstrated a high uptake of guidelines. Management within the emergency department or acute medical unit is initiated in a timely manner, presumably due to a higher nursing staff‐to‐patient ratio and familiarisation with guidelines. However, prompt monitoring and review are often overlooked when patients are transferred to general medical wards. Rates of continued guideline adherence in clinical practice and, thus, the impact of guideline revisions on outcomes remains less well explored. A national survey of DKA management demonstrated a high burden of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia episodes, with the use of insulin recognised as the primary driver for these biochemical abnormalities. Therefore, based upon expert consensus, the 2021 revision recommends reducing the fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) rate to 0.05 units/kg/h. when blood glucose reduces to less than 14 mmol/L to avoid complications, including hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. However, whether this guideline change has resulted in the expected improvement in DKA care is unknown.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113aLPgv]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 10% of the population in the United States has diabetes mellitus. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a well-known, serious, acute metabolic complication. While it is primarily associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus two-thirds of the time, it also occurs in type 2 diabetes mellitus approximately 34% of the time, often as a manifestation of the syndrome of ketosis-prone diabetes. The incidence of DKA continues to rise. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were 140 000 hospital discharges from DKA in 2009 in the United States, about 75% increase over the last two decadeswith an estimated cost annually of > $2 billion and accounts for > 500 000 hospital days per year.

Along with identification of triggering factors, management of DKA involves correction of hyperglycemia, volume depletion, acid–base derangements and electrolyte imbalances. Because of the complexities in the management protocol, many cases of DKA are managed in intensive care units (ICUs) across the United States. Losses of fluids and electrolytes are significant causes of mortality and morbidity in DKA. The mortality is < 1% in American adults; however, rises to > 5% in the elderly population with significant comorbidities. In the United States, the age-adjusted mortality rate for hyperglycemic crisis declined between 1980 and 2009. In 2009, hyperglycemic crises caused 64% lower mortality than in 1980.

Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of DKA have been published periodically in North Americaand Europeimproving the understanding and facilitating the development of management protocols. The outcomes of DKA have been shown to improve with adherence to treatment guidelines. Minor variants of the commonly used treatment protocol for DKA based on the published guidelines use insulin infusions and intravenous electrolyte solution and dextrose solution when blood sugar drops below 250 mg/dL. In order to correct dehydration in patients with DKA, intravenous electrolyte solutions are administered at the beginning of the treatment. As the blood glucose levels fall, a new bag of intravenous fluid with different dextrose concentrations would be ordered, and multiple sequential changes of bags would occur during the course of treatment. Despite their proven effectiveness, a varying degree of non-adherence to guidelines has been documented in the literature compromising the success of published protocols. Successful implementation of the conventional DKA protocol requires not only careful assessment of the clinical status of the patient and laboratory values, but frequent changes to intravenous fluids between saline and dextrose solutions.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1113FAhd]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to review history of hyperglycemic crises (DKA and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state) at every clinical encounter in all patients with diabetes at risk for these events.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^113aX4rv]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to modify replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is < 250 mg/dL (< 13.9 mmol/L) to contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to the 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia and allow continued insulin administration until the ketonemia is corrected, as plasma glucose concentrations usually decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis (usually within 4–8 hours).

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^1171A7j8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

### Improving management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^111BeofB]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The optimal fluid management for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is uncertain. In an effort to simplify DKA therapy, we revised the treatment protocol in our institution to use a simpler method of calculating fluid needs, use fluids with higher sodium concentration, and allow glucose concentration to be adjusted easily. We performed a retrospective study to determine the effects of these revisions.

Design

We compared patients treated with traditional and revised protocols (~220 and ~300 patients, respectively, over consecutive 2.75-year intervals). Sixty patient records were randomly selected from the first group (30 treated with each of 2 protocol versions) and 30 from the second group. Biochemical and clinical parameters were analyzed.

Results

Patients selected for detailed analysis were similar in demographics and initial laboratory measurements. Patients treated under the revised fluid protocol received less total fluid, needed fewer intravenous fluid changes, were treated at less cost, and resolved acidosis more rapidly than patients treated under the original protocols. The rate of cerebral edema (0.3%-0.5%) was unchanged.

Conclusion

A DKA protocol that necessitates less fluid delivery and fewer calculations simplifies therapy and is associated with more rapid correction of acidosis.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^112jcM2e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute hyperglycemic emergency with the potential for serious morbidity and mortality if not treated promptly. It is a serious complication of diabetes caused by a decreasein effective circulating insulin and elevations in counter-regulatory hormones, often leading to hyperglycemia, ketone body formation, osmotic diuresis, acid-base and electrolyte derangements, and hypovolemia. The tenets of management of DKA are the administration of insulin and the correction of the fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Standard therapy in the US has included continuous intravenous (IV) regular insulin until the resolution of ketoacidosis, with patients typically managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. As a result, DKA treatment can be costly in the US, resulting in an estimated annual cost of more than $5 billion.

There is growing interest in DKA treatment that can be achieved safely outside the ICU with non-IV insulin administration. In the United Kingdom, for example, national guidelines recommend the early initiation of fixed rate intravenous insulin infusionalongside the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. A recent review, suggested that there were no substantial advantages or disadvantages of using SQ rapid-acting insulin analogs over IV insulin on the basis of the low quality of the evidence. Some studies, have suggested that SQ short-acting insulin analogs may be as effective as IV insulin. Long-acting insulin glargine was also found to be effective and safe compared with IV regular insulin infusion in a small prospective study. Despite guideline recommendations for treatment in general medical-surgical wards, ICU treatment of DKA remains common in US health system and hospital settings.

In this study, we examined the outcomes of patients with DKA treated with an SQ insulin protocol including the early use of both rapid-acting and long-acting insulin, in place of IV insulin infusion, followed by rapid-acting insulin injections given over longer periods than previously studied. This SQ DKA protocol was implemented at a single intervention hospital as a quality improvement effort, and we compared outcomes against those from 20 other standard care hospitals in an integrated health care delivery system.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^111Xg7Co]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Although positive therapeutic responses to low-dose insulin therapy have been established in adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), none of these studies and guidelines for the treatment of DKA, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Consensus and Position Statements, has ever assessed or addressed the use of a continuous insulin infusion without a loading dose of insulin. In the current study, we used a dose of 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose instead of the recommended 0.1 unit · kg⁻¹ · h⁻¹ with a loading dose. This insulin regimen was chosen because one study in a pediatric population used a dosing regimen of 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose that resulted in a total plasma insulin level of 50–60 μU/ml. This level proved to be too low for optimal suppression of hepatic glucose output and optimal glucose uptake. In addition, bolus doses of insulin may result in hypokalemia as well as other undesirable effects, especially when used in a routine hospital setting.

The efficacy of low-dose insulin without a priming dose has not been established in a prospective randomized study. Thus, the following questions have remained unanswered in the treatment of DKA: 1) Is an insulin bolus needed before a continuous insulin infusion? 2) What is the optimal insulin infusion rate if a bolus dose is not used? and 3) What is the dose response of continuous insulin infusion used alone in regard to decremental changes in glucose, metabolic parameters, cortisol, and free fatty acids (FFAs)? Therefore, we evaluated responses to three low-dose insulin regimens in 37 consecutive patients with DKA in a prospective randomized fashion to address these issues. Changes in plasma free insulin, serum potassium levels, and outcome recovery measures were assessed using a higher infusion dose (0.14 unit · kg⁻¹ · h⁻¹ without a bolus dose) compared with a lower infusion dose (0.07 unit · kg⁻¹ · h⁻¹) with and without a loading dose (0.07 unit/kg) of insulin.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115QkyvZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The primary strength of this study was that we were able to examine relative changes resulting from protocol implementation at the intervention site against a large and diverse set of comparator sites. This approach allowed us to address challenges commonly seen with before-and-after studies, which fail to account for ongoing secular changes in practice. In this study, we found that practice at the standard care sites remained largely unchanged in the postimplementation period, suggesting that our findings were the result of changes in practice unique to the intervention site. We were also able to evaluate posthospital outcomes, because patients with DKA are frequently rehospitalized over time, and we found a reduction in readmission rates at the intervention site. Our integrated health care delivery system and comprehensive single EHR system facilitated the identification and tracking of patients after DKA; thus, the protocol's default consultation for endocrinology follow-up and population management among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes may have played a role in reducing readmissions.

There are several limitations that should be noted. First, our study included patients with DKA based on principal diagnosis codes and, thus, represented a subset of all patients who might have received treatment for DKA. Also, although we used clinical EHR data to establish DKA and its severity, it is possible that patients may have been misclassified. Second, our study was conducted within a single regional integrated health care delivery system that incorporates numerous regional care protocols, which may differ from those in place in other hospital and health systems. Thus, additional study will be needed to assess the generalizability of this protocol, particularly in locales where SQ insulin use in DKA is more common. Third, although we did identify an association with the intervention, this was a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively implemented protocol arising from a quality improvement effort; thus, the results should be confirmed with prospective studies. Fourth, the endocrine outpatient follow-up used in the protocol was directed toward patients with type 1 diabetes, and care for patients with type 2 diabetes could still be improved after DKA with careful care coordination. Fifth, we did not examine all adjunctive treatments given to patients with DKA (eg, fluid type and volume, and bicarbonate or potassium treatment), which could impact outcomes. Sixth, a minority of patients at standard care sites before implementation underwent initial SQ insulin treatment, which likely reflects ongoing variability in DKA treatment patterns. Seventh, although we did adjust for patient-level factors, we did not examine variability in practice and outcomes at the comparator sites that might contribute to residual confounding.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^1132uyns]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, we examined the outcomes after implementation of an SQ insulin treatment protocol for DKA at a single intervention site compared with 20 standard care sites over a 9-year period. After implementation, the use of SQ insulin as the first treatment in DKA increased from 13.4% to 80.3% at the intervention site while it remained unchanged at standard care sites. This change in practice had no impact on the mean total insulin dosage received by patients with DKA within their first 48 hours of treatment. Overall, the protocol was associated with a 57% relative decrease in ICU admissions at intervention sites and a 50% relative decrease in 30-day readmissions compared with standard care sites. The use of an SQ insulin-driven protocol appeared to be safe, with no associated increases in the incidence of hypoglycemic events during hospitalization or 30-day mortality.

DKA is the most common acute hyperglycemic emergency among people with diabetes and is associated with significant morbidity and health care cost. Hospitalizations for DKA are also resource-intensive in the US, requiring ICU admission and reportedly costing as much as $26 566 per admission. In the United Kingdom, where ICU utilization for DKA may be lower, the cost of DKA hospitalizations has been reported to be lower. The ICU is a scarce resource that can become critically strained during seasonal influenza surge or as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, many US critical care specialists have routinely identified DKA as a diagnosis well-suited for treatment in non-ICU settings if the right patients can be identified and appropriate treatment and monitoring can be put in place. Despite guidelines recommending non-ICU treatment of DKA, evidence from the general population in the US confirms that many patients are treated in ICU settings.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Current diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemic emergencies [^111xGoif]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality.

### Subcutaneous insulin versus traditional intravenous insulin infusion in treatment of mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis [^113QCagc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) insulin infusions are the current standard of care for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Subcutaneous (SQ) insulin, however, may also be a safe and effective alternative.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare patient-centered outcomes related to the treatment of mild to moderate DKA using two different protocols: an SQ insulin protocol and an IV insulin infusion protocol with an initial bolus (IVB) or without a bolus (IVNB).

Methods

We retrospectively conducted a multicenter cohort study evaluating SQ vs. IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included time to glucose correction, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, hypoglycemia events, readmission rates, and IV insulin use.

Results

Within the study time frame, 257 patients were included in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. There was no significant difference in the time to DKA resolution between the IVB (p = 0.603) or IVNB (p = 0.269) groups compared with the population who received SQ insulin only. Hospital LOS was significantly longer when comparing the SQ group with the IVNB group (p < 0.001), but not when comparing it with the IVB group (p = 0.259). The IV protocols had significantly more hypoglycemic events compared with the SQ protocol (IVB vs. SQ, p < 0.001; IVNB vs. SQ, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

SQ insulin may be an effective alternative option for treating mild to moderate DKA with fewer hypoglycemic effects.

### Relationship between bedside ketone levels and time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis: a retrospective cohort study [^117HEm7Y]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is caused by relative or absolute insulin deficiency and is characterized clinically by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. DKA is frequently encountered in daily clinical practice, in both newly diagnosed cases (up to 70%) and patients with established type 1 diabetes (T1D) (rate, 1–10% per case per year). The common risk factors for DKA include new diagnosis of T1D, young children, adolescent female patients, delayed T1D diagnosis, insulin omission, poor treatment on a sick day, accessibility to hospitals, and insulin pump injection errors.

DKA is one of the most severe and sometimes life-threatening acute complications; therefore, establishing a standard treatment protocol is needed to prevent further complications. There are currently only a few established treatment regimens for DKA treatment. For example, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes released recently consensus guidelines for DKA; however, the guidelines cited only a few solid evidence-based treatment protocols for pediatric patients. Surprisingly, the time to DKA resolution (time between the start of treatment and resolution of DKA) remains ill-defined. DKA resolution is generally judged comprehensively on the basis of clinical signs, such as the ability to eat/drink and/or a few non-specific biomarkers, such as the blood pH value. Of these biomarkers, the Joint British Diabetes Societies recommended using bedside measurement of serum 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) to monitor the response to DKA treatment. In this regard, bedside 3HB has been reported to correlate well with blood pH levels, as well as with plasma ketone. On the basis of this, a number of studies investigated the usefulness of bedside ketone body monitoring to the response to treatment of DKA.

We have experienced numerous cases of acute DKA that were managed clinically at our hospital, including bedside ketone body measurement. To our knowledge, there is little or no information on the usefulness of bedside ketone body monitoring in relation to the time to DKA resolution. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the clinical value of bedside ketone body monitoring and the factors that affect the time to DKA resolution in patients with T1D.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^114DnzPQ]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Although numerous studies have effectively used low-dose insulin in the treatment of DKA, there are no data from a prospective randomized study evaluating an insulin bolus (0.07 U/kg) compared with no bolus in conjunction with an infusion of low-dose insulin (0.07 vs. 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1). Previous studies have demonstrated that although 0.1 unit/h of insulin in patients with DKA can effectively inhibit lipolysis, this dose will only suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis by 50%.

We had previously shown that an intermediate dose of insulin of 0.1 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1 (equivalent of 7 units/h of insulin in a 70-kg patient) by intravenous infusion was much more effective than a dose by the subcutaneous or intramuscular route. In these studies we used a priming dose. In addition, in a selected case report we have used as little as 6 units/h for a patient with modest DKA with further maintenance of euglycemia by 1–2 units/h. However, a bolus dose of insulin preceded the low-dose infusion. Furthermore, a priming dose has not been used for pediatric patients with DKA and has not been recommended in the pediatric age-group in the latest ADA consensus report. Deleterious outcomes with the use of bolus insulin in this group may include hypokalemia as well as possible cerebral edema.

In summary, our study suggests that the use of a bolus or priming dose of insulin is not necessary when an adequate continuous insulin infusion such as 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 (or 10 units/h in a 70-kg patient) is used. However, a dose of 0.07 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without priming is not adequate to obtain desired changes in glucose without supplemental doses of insulin.

SI conversion factors: To convert anion gap to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0; glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555.

At both the intervention and standard care sites, the number of hours until the first documentation of a serum glucose level less than 250 mg/dL increased modestly in the postimplementation vs preimplementation periods (Table 3). The number of hours until the first documented anion gap less than 16 mEq/L was similar at the intervention site and longer at standard care sites. Overall, there was no significant difference in the use of 50% dextrose for treating hypoglycemia in the intervention site, whereas the proportion of patients having evidence of hypoglycemia based on any glucose value less than 70 mg/dL decreased. After hospital discharge, the proportion of hospitalizations having an endocrinology visit within 2 weeks of discharge increased at the intervention site from 7.1% (21 hospitalizations) to 12.3% (15 hospitalizations), whereas there was no change at standard care sites (563 hospitalizations [12.7%] vs 403 hospitalizations [12.9%]).

Conclusions

In conclusion, we found that the implementation of an SQ insulin-driven protocol for treating DKA was associated with substantial changes in practice, including a significantly decreased need for intensive care and reduced rates of readmission, with no increase in hypoglycemia or mortality. Our results suggest that an SQ insulin-driven protocol including the selection of optimal patients can be used effectively in treating DKA, although these results should be confirmed in future prospective studies.

### Safety and efficacy of an algorithm-based protocol in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^116CLYbK]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of an algorithm-based protocol to manage diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

Our study is a retrospective chart review of patients with DKA managed before and after implementation of an algorithm-based DKA protocol at a tertiary care hospital.

Results

There were 88 patients managed 1 year prior (control group) and 70 patients managed one year after (study group) implementation of the algorithm-based DKA protocol. The DKA resolution time was significantly shorter (11.5 [8.1 to 17.1] hours versus 8.5 [5.8 to 12] hours; P = 0.008) and the hypoglycemic events were significantly less (P = 0.042) in the study group in comparison with the control group. There was no difference in the potassium abnormalities and rate of decline of glucose. A survey on a scale of 1 to 10 found the majority of physicians and nurses rated the protocol as safe (83%) and effective (96%). Fifty-four percent of the nurses, however, found the protocol difficult to follow.

Conclusion

Our study showed that implementation of an algorithm-based protocol reduced the DKA resolution time and hypoglycemic events without compromising electrolyte imbalance, and was associated with improved clinical measures of DKA management.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors, their role in type 1 diabetes treatment and a risk mitigation strategy for preventing diabetic ketoacidosis: the STOP DKA protocol [^115v5GkZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent phase 3 clinical trials have evaluated the impact of adding sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) inhibitors to the type 1 diabetes armamentarium. These trials studied SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) and a dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor (sotagliflozin), and demonstrated that these oral non-insulin antihyperglycaemic medications are able not only to improve glycaemic control, but also to reduce body weight and extend time in range without increasing rates of hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a feature of type 1 diabetes and the risk is increased when SGLT inhibitors are used in type 1 diabetes. To minimize the risk of DKA and still gain the multiple benefits, we developed the "STOP DKA Protocol ", an easily accessible and practical tool, that provides a risk mitigation strategy for reducing DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes being treated with SGLT inhibitors.

### Low-dose vs standard-dose insulin in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized clinical trial [^11596cU4]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The standard recommended dose (0.1 U/kg per hour) of insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) guidelines is not backed by strong clinical evidence. Physiologic dose-effect studies have found that even lower doses could adequately normalize ketonemia and acidosis. Lowering the insulin dose may be advantageous in the initial hours of therapy when a gradual decrease in glucose, electrolytes, and resultant osmolality is desired.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose insulin against the standard dose in children with DKA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prospective, open-label randomized clinical trial conducted in the pediatric emergency department and intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in northern India from November 1, 2011, through December 31, 2012. A total of 50 consecutive children 12 years or younger with a diagnosis of DKA were randomized to low-dose (n = 25) and standard-dose (n = 25) groups.

Interventions

Low-dose (0.05 U/kg per hour) vs standard-dose (0.1 U/kg per hour) insulin infusion.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the rate of decrease in blood glucose until a level of 250 mg/dL or less is reached (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). The secondary outcomes included time to resolution of acidosis, episodes of treatment failures, and incidences of hypokalemia and hypoglycemia.

Results

The mean (SD) rate of blood glucose decrease until a level of 250 mg/dL or less is reached (45.1 [17.6] vs 52.2 [23.4] mg/dL/h) and the mean (SD) time taken to achieve this target (6.0 [3.3] vs 6.2 [2.2] hours) were similar in the low- and standard-dose groups, respectively. Mean (SD) length of time to achieve resolution of acidosis (low vs standard dose: 16.5 [7.2] vs 17.2 [7.7] hours; p = 0.73) and rate of resolution of acidosis were also similar in the groups. Hypokalemia was seen in 12 children (48%) receiving the standard dose vs 5 (20%) of those receiving the low dose (P = 0.07); the tendency was more pronounced in malnourished children (7 [88%] vs 2 [28%]). Five children (20%) and 1 child (4%) receiving standard- and low-dose infusion (P = 0.17), respectively, developed hypoglycemia. Treatment failure was rare and comparable. One child in the standard-dose group developed cerebral edema, and no deaths occurred during the study period.

Conclusions and Relevance

Low dose is noninferior to standard dose with respect to rate of blood glucose decrease and resolution of acidosis. We advocate a superiority trial with a larger sample size before 0.05 U/kg per hour replaces 0.1 U/kg per hour in the practice recommendations.

### Pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis, fluid therapy, and cerebral injury: the design of a factorial randomized controlled trial [^114T7a9N]. Pediatric Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment protocols for pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) vary considerably among centers in the United States and worldwide. The optimal protocol for intravenous (IV) fluid administration is an area of particular controversy, mainly in regard to possible associations between rates of IV fluid infusion and the development of cerebral edema (CE), the most common and the most feared complication of DKA in children. Theoretical concerns about associations between osmotic fluid shifts and CE have prompted recommendations for conservative fluid infusion during DKA. However, recent data suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion may play a role in cerebral injury associated with DKA. Currently, there are no existing data from prospective clinical trials to determine the optimal fluid treatment protocol for pediatric DKA. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network FLUID (FLuid therapies Under Investigation in DKA) study is the first prospective randomized trial to evaluate fluid regimens for pediatric DKA. This 13-center nationwide factorial design study will evaluate the effects of rehydration rate and fluid sodium content on neurological status during DKA treatment, the frequency of clinically overt CE and long-term neurocognitive outcomes following DKA.

### Mandatory protocol for treating adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis decreases intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay: results of a nonrandomized trial [^11626KWA]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of a mandatory protocol for treating diabetic ketoacidosis.

Design

Chart review of patients treated before and after protocol implementation.

Setting

University-affiliated U.S. public teaching hospital.

Patients

A total of 241 consecutive nonpregnant patients > 18 yrs old admitted to a medical intensive care unit for diabetic ketoacidosis between January 2000 and January 2005.

Intervention

Implementation of a mandatory treatment protocol in May 2003.

Measurements

Intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay, time to correction of anion gap and ketone clearance, and hypoglycemic episodes.

Results

Before protocol implementation, the mean ± sd intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 44 ± 28 hrs and 91 ± 73 hrs, respectively. After implementation, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay decreased 23% and 30%, to 34 ± 18 hrs and 64 ± 41 hrs, respectively (both p < .007). Time to anion gap closure and ketone clearance also decreased (both p < .05). No difference in the number of hypoglycemic episodes was observed.

Conclusion

Implementing a mandatory protocol for treating adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis decreases intensive care and hospital lengths of stay and time to anion gap closure and ketone clearance, without increasing the rate of hypoglycemia.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^111uooVy]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Our criteria for the diagnosis of DKA included plasma glucose > 250 mg/dl, HCO₃⁻ < 15 mEq/l, pH < 7.3, and moderate ketones in the urine or blood by the nitroprusside method. A total of 37 patients were prospectively randomly assigned to three groups as follows: 1) the load group consisted of 12 patients who received a loading dose of insulin at 0.07 unit/kg body weight followed by an infusion of 0.07 unit · kg body weight⁻¹ · h⁻¹; 2) the no load group consisted of 12 patients who received only an intravenous infusion of insulin at a dose of 0.07 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1 without a loading dose; or 3) the twice no load group consisted of 13 patients who received an infusion of insulin at a dose of 0.14 unit · kg body weight⁻¹ · h⁻¹ without a bolus dose. Responses to therapy were based on the time to achieve a glucose level of ≤ 250 mg/dl, bicarbonate of ≥ 15 mEq/l, and pH ≥ 7.3. All other modes of therapy (hydrating solution, KCl, and HCO₃⁻) were similar in the three groups and followed the recommendations of the first ADA position statement. All patients were seen in the emergency department of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis. Upon arrival, history was obtained and a physical examination was performed. Urine ketones (by nitroprusside) plus glucose by fingerstick and blood gas measurements were obtained immediately. Once a suspected diagnosis of DKA was made, the initial laboratory blood samples were obtained for basal metabolic parameters and complete blood count with differential; urinalysis was performed for blood and urine ketones by both the nitroprusside and enzymatic methods. Patients then received 1 liter of 0.9% NaCl per hour until laboratory results were available. After laboratory confirmation, the intravenous fluids were adjusted, depending on the glucose and corrected serum sodium value, to ½ N saline or dextrose with 1 N or ½ N saline. With confirmation of the diagnosis of DKA and an acceptable potassium level (> 3.3 mEq/l), the patients were then transferred to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) of the University of Tennessee Bowld Hospital after the research study was described to the patients or their next of kin and the consent form, which was approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center of Memphis Institutional Review Board, was signed. On arrival at the CRC, the treatment and care of patients was managed by the DKA team, including the medical housestaff on rotation for the service, following an established protocol with consultation of the staff endocrinologist. Hourly blood glucose measurements and blood samples for free insulin were obtained at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min. Blood for measurement of other hormones and ketone bodies, blood gases, and metabolic profile; urinalysis for ketones; and other parameters were obtained. Random assignment of patients to different insulin regimens was done after arrival at the CRC. Random assignment was not based on sex or ethnicity. Because a priming dose of insulin adds an additional risk of hypokalemia, potassium levels were assessed and corrected on an hourly basis for the first few hours of therapy until glucose reached the predetermined goal of < 250 mg/dl (i.e. ∼4 h) and every 2 h thereafter.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116CPzLg]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A total of 74 patients with DKA were randomly assigned in this study. Of them, six patients were excluded because four withdrew consent before or shortly after initiation of insulin therapy, one patient received glargine insulin before resolution of DKA, and one patient was treated with intravenous aspart insulin instead of regular insulin. The remaining 68 patients served as the study population. The diagnosis of DKA was established by standard criteria. We excluded patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg after the administration of 1 l of normal saline, patients in a comatose state, and patients with acute myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal or hepatic failure, dementia, and pregnancy. This study was conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, and at Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was approved by dual institutional review boards.

Patients with DKA were randomly assigned in the emergency department to receive treatment with regular (n = 34) or glulisine (n = 34) insulin intravenously until resolution of DKA. After resolution of DKA, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to receive subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily. Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to glargine once daily and glulisine before meals.

Treatment protocols

Patients were managed by members of the internal medicine residency programs of the respective institutions, who received copies of the assigned treatment protocol (supplementary Table A in an online appendix, available at). Orders for intravenous fluids, potassium, and bicarbonate administration were similar in both groups and followed current American Diabetes Association guidelines. Initial orders for intravenous regular and glulisine insulin included an initial bolus of 0.1 unit/kg, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion calculated to deliver 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 until blood glucose levels decreased to < 250 mg/dl (< 13.8 mmol/l). At that time, intravenous fluids were changed to dextrose-containing solutions, and the insulin infusion rate was decreased to 0.05 unit · kg⁻¹ · h⁻¹ to maintain blood glucose of ∼200 mg/dl (∼11.1 mmol/l) until resolution of DKA. DKA was considered resolved when blood glucose was < 250 mg/dl, the serum bicarbonate level was ≥ 18 mmol/l, and venous pH was > 7.30.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116mHPx6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review was conducted by following a prespecified protocol and is reported based on the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Our protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD42022339577). Material deviations to the prespecified protocol are described below.

We systematically searched Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS and CENTRAL from inception until April 26th, 2024 to identify studies that compared the use of subcutaneous insulin to continuous IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. Keywords and search strategies used are available in Appendix 1.

We included RCTs and observational studies that compared subcutaneous insulin and a continuous IV insulin infusion in managing adult patients with mild-to-moderate DKA. Subcutaneous insulin included either short-acting or rapid-acting insulin. Inclusion was restricted to studies that included adults age ≥ 18 years old, who were identified as having diabetes with DKA, defined as having arterial pH ≤ 7.3, serum bicarbonate ≤ 18 mmol/L and anion gap is > 12 mmol/L with positive serum and/or urine ketones. Our definition of DKA was based on the criteria outlined in the ADA guidelines. Mild DKA is defined as pH 7.25 to 7.30 and serum bicarbonate 15 to 18 mmol/L, whereas moderate was defined as pH 7.00 to < 7.24 and serum bicarbonate 10 to < 15 mmol/L Studies were required to report at least one of the following outcomes: length of stay, time to resolution of DKA, mortality, need for intensive care stay, hypoglycemia or hypokalemia. Studies that compared subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin in severe DKA, or in patients with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, comatose state, and other medical conditions that warranted ICU admission were excluded.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^112MEhEp]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^115Xw1jv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes. DKA most commonly occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes; however it can also present among people with type 2 diabetes with concomitant insulin deficiency and among people with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes, DKA is a common presentation in the emergency room and an indication for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Ramphul et al. recently showed that the incidence of hospitalizations due to DKA in the United States increased from 2003 to 2017, with the incidence per 10,000 admissions rising from 32.04 in 2003 to 61.60 in 2017 according to the 2017 National Inpatient Sample.

The diagnostic criteria for DKA includes the triad of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, increased total serum ketone concentration and metabolic acidosis. DKA commonly presents with a precipitating cause, such as an acute illness or increased physiological stress. DKA management includes treating the precipitating cause, correcting dehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids, managing electrolyte abnormalities, and administering insulin to correct the ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia. The standard of care for managing DKA is through the administration of a continuous IV insulin infusion. DKA is usually treated in a monitored setting, such as the resuscitation area in the emergency department or the ICU. As per Diabetes Canada, IV insulin is the standard of care for DKA management. On the other hand, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends IV insulin administration for moderate-to-severe DKA and suggests the possibility of using subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin for mild and uncomplicated DKA.

There are few observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of using a subcutaneous insulin protocol in managing DKA outside of a monitored setting. To our knowledge, the last systematic review conducted on this topic was done by Andrade-Castellanos et al. in 2016. The studies presented in this previous review demonstrated that insulin therapy is effective in managing DKA regardless of the route of administration in selected patients. However, it only included RCTs, excluding observational studies. Given that additional studies have been conducted on this topic since 2016, we performed an updated systematic review to assess the safety and efficacy of using subcutaneous insulin in managing DKA compared to IV insulin. The main purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin among adult patients with mild to moderate DKA.

### Outcome of diabetic ketoacidosis among paediatric patients managed with modified DKA protocol at tikur anbessa specialized hospital and yekatit 12 hospital, addis ababa, Ethiopia [^114iozrF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The international society for paediatrics and adolescent medicine has set guidelines for the management of DKA which is currently being practised in most countries. In our set‐up, there was no standard of practice in the management of DKA until the modified DKA management protocol was adopted in 2014 and put into practice. This protocol was developed from the international guideline, standard textbooks and ISPAD; incorporated aiming to have a standard of care and to improve the outcome of paediatric DKA patients.

According to this modified DKA protocol, fluid is given for severe and moderate DKA as per the above protocol except for the management of mild DKA which could be managed with oral rehydration solution, and deficit calculated as some dehydration and 75 ml/kg of fluid is given and patients are encouraged to take PO feeding.

As there is a lack of readily available perfuser, no strict follow‐up of patients with frequent monitoring of RBS and no readily available intensive care in Ethiopia, intermittent SC regular insulin is used in place of Continuous intravenous regular insulin (CIRI); with a loading dose of 0.5 units/kg of regular insulin given in divided doses as half IV and half IM and then 0.5 IU/kg SC every 6 h except the first dose which is administered ½ IM and ½ IV since dehydration in the first hour limits absorption of subcutaneous insulin, and it is then continued until resolution of DKA; that is, two consecutive urine ketones negative. Follow‐up of a patient is with a DKA flow sheet (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Management algorithm for diabetic ketoacidosis in children in Ethiopia [Correction added on 12 September 2022 after first online publication: In figure 1, the word 'recheck' and '10%' were updated in the left last box.]

Even though we currently have a standard of care, the protocol is not supported by previous proven evidence, and also no study was done so far to see the effectiveness as well as the treatment outcome of patients managed with this treatment protocol. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the outcomes of patients managed with the modified DKA treatment protocol used at TASH and Yekatit 12 Hospital.

### Potential role of ultrafast-acting insulin analogues in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115uarmp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

A recently published trial aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of implementing an sc insulin protocol for the treatment of DKA. In a cohort-study design involving 7989 hospitalizations over a 9-year period, Rao et al showed that the sc administration of weight-based lispro every 4 hours led to a reduction by 57% in ICU admission and by 50% in 30-day hospital readmission compared to standard treatment. Moreover, the safety profile of the sc regimen proved to be similar to the standard of care, with no differences in adverse event rates between the intervention and control sites.

The findings of this large trial replicate the results of smaller studies conducted previously. Umpierrez et al have shown that the use of sc lispro in adult patients with uncomplicated DKA was associated with a similar duration of treatment until correction of hyperglycemia and resolution of ketoacidosis, still with 39% lower hospitalization charges compared to patients in the ICU who received an IV regimen. Another study by the same group did not show differences in mortality rates, incidence of hypoglycemia, length of hospital stay, and total insulin dose until resolution of hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis between patients who received sc aspart every hour or every 2 hours compared to those who were treated with IV infusion of regular insulin (n = 15 in each group). Collectively, these data suggest that the implementation of an sc insulin protocol in individuals with mild to moderate DKA could result in the use of fewer resources including ICU beds, lower rates of complications related to IV lines (eg, thrombophlebitis), and less financial burden on health care systems compared to the traditional approach. The findings of a meta-analysis suggested there are neither advantages nor disadvantages when comparing the use of sc rapid-acting insulin vs IV regular insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate severe DKA. It should be noted that the quality of the synthesized evidence was low to very low and that the number of included trials and patients was small (5 and 201, respectively).

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of 3 different management protocols in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^113uL66s]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Management protocols for pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) vary considerably among medical centers. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 3 different fluid protocols in the management of DKA.

Methods

Fluid management protocols with sodium contents of 75, 100, and 154 mEq/L NaCl were compared. In all groups, after the initial rehydration, the protocols differed from each other in terms of the maintenance fluid, which had different rates of infusion and sodium contents. Clinical status and blood glucose levels were checked every hour during the first 12 hours. Biochemical tests were repeated at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 hours.

Results

The medical records of 144 patients were evaluated. Cerebral edema developed in 18% of the patients. The incidence of cerebral edema was lowest in the group that received fluid therapy with a sodium content of 154 mEq/L NaCl at least 4 to 6 hours and had a constant rate of infusion for 48 hours. The patients with cerebral edema had lower initial pH and HCO3 and severe dehydration with higher initial plasma osmolality. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the recovery times of blood glucose, pH, HCO3, and the time of transition to subcutaneous insulin therapy.

Conclusions

Severity of acidosis and dehydration are associated with the development of cerebral edema. It can be concluded that fluid therapy with higher Na content and a constant maintenance rate may present less risk for the patient with DKA.

### Improving care for pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis [^113CK9w6]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to create and implement recommendations from an evidence-based pathway for hospital management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and to sustain improvement. We hypothesized that development and utilization of standard work for inpatient care of DKA would lead to reduction in hypokalemia and improvement in outcome measures.

Methods

Development involved systematic review of published literature by a multidisciplinary team. Implementation included multidisciplinary feedback, hospital-wide education, daily team huddles, and development of computer decision support and electronic order sets.

Results

Pathway-based order sets forced clinical pathway adherence; yet, variations in care persisted, requiring ongoing iterative review and pathway tool adjustment. Quality improvement measures have identified barriers and informed subsequent adjustments to interventions. We compared 281 patients treated postimplementation with 172 treated preimplementation. Our most notable findings included the following: (1) monitoring of serum potassium concentrations identified unanticipated hypokalemia episodes, not recognized before standard work implementation, and earlier addition of potassium to fluids resulted in a notable reduction in hypokalemia; (2) improvements in insulin infusion management were associated with reduced duration of ICU stay; and (3) with overall improved DKA management and education, cerebral edema occurrence and bicarbonate use were reduced. We continue to convene quarterly meetings, review cases, and process ongoing issues with system-based elements of implementing the recommendations.

Conclusions

Our multidisciplinary development and implementation of an evidence-based pathway for DKA have led to overall improvements in care. We continue to monitor quality improvement metric measures to sustain clinical gains while continuing to identify iterative improvement opportunities.

### Addressing pitfalls in management of diabetic ketoacidosis with a standardized protocol [^113YCWWn]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)-Power Plan (PP) for guiding intravenous (IV) insulin infusions prior to anion gap (AG) closure and administering subcutaneous (SC) insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuing IV insulin. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients with DKA before (pre-PP) (n = 60) and following (post-PP) (n = 60) implementation of a DKA-PP. Groups were compared for percentage of patients for whom IV insulin therapy was continued until AG closure, the percentage of patients receiving SC insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuation of IV insulin, and percentage of patients with rebound DKA during the index hospitalization. Results: Admission plasma glucose (514 mg/dL vs. 500 mg/dL; p = 0.36) and venous pH (7.2 vs. 7.2; p = 0.57) were similar in pre- and post-PP groups. Inappropriate discontinuation of IV insulin occurred less frequently in post-PP patients (28% vs. 7%; p = 0.007), with a lower frequency of rebound DKA (40% vs. 8%; p = 0.001) following acute management. More post-PP patients received SC insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuation of IV insulin (65% vs. 78%; p = 0.05). Conclusion: Implementation of a DKA-PP was associated with appropriate discontinuation of IV insulin in more patients, more frequent administration of SC insulin ≥ 1 hour prior to discontinuation of IV insulin, and fewer episodes of rebound DKA.

### 0.9% saline versus Ringer's lactate as initial fluid in children with diabetic ketoacidosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116ZyEoz]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Treatment protocol and monitoring

A bolus of 20 mL/kg of trial fluid was given over an hour to children who presented in shock. For those without hypoperfusion or shock, the trial fluid volume to be given was calculated as a sum of deficit (65–85 mL/kg) and maintenance fluid (Holliday-Segar) for the next 48 hours. This total fluid to be administered over 48 hours was started as an hourly infusion of trial fluid. The clinician's judgment decided the amount of deficit correction needed within the range (65–85 mL/kg). Insulin was started at the rate of 0.05 U/kg/hour after the first hour of fluid therapy. All subjects received 0.45% saline with 5% dextrose once blood glucose decreased to 250 mg/dL. We maintained the blood glucose levels between 150 and 250 mg/dL after the addition of 5% dextrose. Any fall below 150 mg/dL was mitigated with incremental dextrose concentration from 5% to 7.5%, 10% or 12.5% as needed, so as to enable continued insulin administration for correction of ketoacidosis. In children with persistently high blood glucose, the clinician went through a checklist assessing for errors in insulin dose, preparation, patency of vascular access and infusion rate before increasing the rate of insulin infusion to 0.1 U/kg/hour for non-response. Potassium was added at a standard dose of 40 mEq/L in both the trial fluids after urine output was ensured. All children were managed as per standard unit protocol (online supplemental additional 1).

Serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine and venous blood gas (pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate) measurements were undertaken at admission. Capillary blood glucose was monitored hourly. Blood gas and blood ketones (point of care capillary method) were measured every 4 hours, while renal function and serum electrolytes were measured every 8–12 hours until endpoints were achieved. Clinical data that included respiratory rate, heart rate, capillary refill, blood pressure, hydration status, fluid intake, urine output, and neurological status were recorded every 2 hours or more frequently, and the values were entered in a predesigned monitoring sheet. Children were followed until discharge/death from the hospital.

As urine output is not a reliable marker in DKA (osmotic diuresis), serum creatinine was used to define AKI based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) staging. The first creatinine at hospital admission was used to stage AKI according to the KDIGO staging.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: the paradox of delayed correction of acidosis [^112sJP4K]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The effectiveness of standard treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in "euglycemic DKA" (EuDKA, blood glucose (BG) ≤ 250 mg/dL) was evaluated with respect to the time to correction of BG ≤ 200 mg/dL, anion gap (AG) ≤ 12 mmol/L, and serum bicarbonate [HCO3] ≥ 18 mmol/L.

Methods

Data were retrieved from an electronic health record (EPIC) for "diabetic ketoacidosis". Patients were categorized by initial BG as EuDKA, middle range DKA (MrDKA, > 250 < 600 mg/dL) and hyperosmolar DKA (HyperDKA ≥ 600 mg/dL).

Results

There were 56 patients (27men, 29women; age 45.8 ± 15.6 (SD) years. The initial 8-h insulin infusion rate (0.05 ± 0.02, 0.09 ± 0.03, 0.14 ± 0.05units/kg/h, p < 0.001) and the time to correction of BG (3.4 ± 1.9, 6.1 ± 2.9 and 9.6 ± 3.9 h, p < 0.001), differed for EuDKA, MrDKA and HyperDKA. There were no differences in the time to correction of AG or [HCO3]. The earlier time to correction of BG in EuDKA resulted in paradoxical longer lag times for correction of [HCO3] (p = 0.003) and AG (p = 0.048). Changes in BG, AG and [HCO3] correlated with insulin infusion rates of 0.08–0.1units/kg/h whereas in EuDKA the insulin infusion rate was 0.05 ± 0.02 units/kg/h.

Conclusion

In EuDKA, correlation analyses suggest that higher glucose and insulin infusion rates than what would be projected for the level of blood glucose are required to reverse ketoacidosis. Prospective trials are required to optimize the levels of glucose and insulin infusions in EuDKA.

### Subcutaneous regular insulin for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^111iKoNu]. Pediatric Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment protocols vary, however low-dose intravenous administration of regular insulin is the standard care for replacing insulin in most centers. Few studies, the majority in adults, demonstrated subcutaneous injection of rapid-acting insulin every 1–2 hours to be a valid alternative.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous regular insulin administered every 4 hours in pediatric DKA in a clinical setting.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted. Charts of all children treated with subcutaneous regular insulin for DKA and pH ≥ 7.0, between 2007 and 2010, were reviewed. Seventy-six DKA episodes in 52 patients were included. Data regarding clinical characteristics, response to treatment, and the occurrence of complications were analyzed. DKA episodes in patients with new-onset diabetes and in those with established diabetes were compared.

Results

Mean age was 11.6 ± 4.0yr. Eighteen episodes occurred in children with new-onset diabetes. In all episodes, our protocol resulted in recovery from DKA. Median time to DKA resolution (pH > 7.30, HCO3 > 15) was 10.3 (5.5, 14.2)h. The median total insulin dose was 0.05(0.04, 0.06) (unit/kg/h). During DKA treatment, hypoglycemia occurred in one episode and hypokalemia, mostly mild, was documented in 14. No cardiac arrhythmias, incidents of cerebral edema, or mortality occurred.

Conclusion

Subcutaneous regular insulin administered every 4 hours is an effective and safe alternative for the insulin treatment of DKA with pH > 7.0 in children. Such treatment has the potential to simplify insulin administration when compared to either intravenous regular insulin or q1–2 hour subcutaneous rapid insulin and reduce both patient inconvenience and admission costs.

### Commentary: SGLT inhibitors in type 1 diabetes: place in therapy and a risk mitigation strategy for preventing diabetic ketoacidosis-the STOP DKA protocol [^111nJazu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

In the accompanying article, Goldenberg et al. review the promotion of diabetic ketoacidosis by SGLT2 inihibitors. They have carried out a metanalysis showing a 3.5-fold increase in the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with type 1 diabetes under treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors. They make a number of suggestions for attempting to mitigate the risk of DKA in these patients, notably including blood ketone monitoring and the use of supplemental carbohydrates with additional insulin when ketones suggest incipient DKA. Their proposal merits evaluation in a clinical trial involving type 1 diabetes, which should also assess the possible cardiorenal benefits demonstrated with treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: a current appraisal of pathophysiology and management [^114HVCSn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a frequent abnormal metabolic entity seen in high-dependency units such as critical care units and in the emergency department. Having an understanding of its pathophysiology, a consequence of absent to low insulin levels, delineates the clinical presentation. Most clinical features are caused by hyperglycemia and acidosis, including weight loss. The newer management modalities are discussed that include the need for intensive laboratory workup, meticulous monitoring of the insulin, and fluid management. Among the complications, cerebral edema (CE) is the most dreaded, albeit with low incidence. The new insights into its pathophysiology and management are outlined, and a timeline for management of DKA is proposed.

### Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115GLxpD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes that mainly occurs in individuals with autoimmune type 1 diabetes, but it is not uncommon in some people with type 2 diabetes. The treatment of DKA is traditionally accomplished by the administration of intravenous infusion of regular insulin that is initiated in the emergency department and continued in an intensive care unit or a high-dependency unit environment. It is unclear whether people with DKA should be treated with other treatment modalities such as subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues.

Objectives

To assess the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Search Methods

We identified eligible trials by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We searched the trials registers WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of last search for all databases was 27 October 2015. We also examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they were RCTs comparing subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus standard intravenous infusion in participants with DKA of any age or sex with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.

Main Results

Five trials randomised 201 participants (110 participants to subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues and 91 to intravenous regular insulin). The criteria for DKA were consistent with the American Diabetes Association criteria for mild or moderate DKA. The underlying cause of DKA was mostly poor compliance with diabetes therapy. Most trials did not report on type of diabetes. Younger diabetic participants and children were underrepresented in our included trials (one trial only). Four trials evaluated the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue lispro, and one the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart. The mean follow-up period as measured by mean hospital stay ranged between two and seven days. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated trials was unclear in many domains and high for performance bias for the outcome measure time to resolution of DKA. No deaths were reported in the included trials (186 participants; 3 trials; moderate- (insulin lispro) to low-quality evidence (insulin aspart)). There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin lispro versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: mean difference (MD) 0.2 h (95% CI -1.7 to 2.1); P = 0.81; 90 participants; 2 trials. In one trial involving children with DKA, the time to reach a glucose level of 250 mg/dL was similar between insulin lispro and intravenous regular insulin. There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin aspart versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: MD -1 h (95% CI -3.2 to 1.2); P = 0.36; 30 participants; 1 trial. There was low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin on hypoglycaemic episodes: 6 of 80 insulin lispro-treated participants compared with 9 of 76 regular insulin-treated participants reported hypoglycaemic events; risk ratio (RR) 0.59 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.52); P = 0.28; 156 participants; 4 trials. For insulin aspart compared with regular insulin, RR for hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.00 (95% CI 0.07 to 14.55); P = 1.0; 30 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence. Socioeconomic effects as measured by length of mean hospital stay for insulin lispro compared with regular insulin showed a MD of -0.4 days (95% CI -1 to 0.2); P = 0.22; 90 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence and for insulin aspart compared with regular insulin 1.1 days (95% CI -3.3 to 1.1); P = 0.32; low-quality evidence. Data on morbidity were limited, but no specific events were reported for the comparison of insulin lispro with regular insulin. No trial reported on adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, and no trial investigated patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review, which provided mainly data on adults, suggests on the basis of mostly low- to very low-quality evidence that there are neither advantages nor disadvantages when comparing the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin for treating mild or moderate DKA.

### Putting SQuID on the menu: a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^1146gFoZ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Beginning in 2021, we developed and implemented the SQuID (subcutaneous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) protocol for low to moderate severity (LTM) DKA, treating these patients on a single inpatient Hospitalist-run observation floor and demonstrating reductions in emergency department (ED) length of stay of over 3h compared with LTM DKA patients treated in the ED with intravenous (IV) insulin and subsequently admitted to the medical floor. We expanded bed eligibility to a second Hospitalist-only floor from March 2023 to March 2024. We demonstrated equivalent safety and effectiveness of SQuID in LTM DKA compared with treatment on IV insulin, reducing intensive care unit (ICU) utilization for LTM DKA by over 33%, and maintaining high clinician acceptability ratings. Here we discuss lessons learned, keyinsights and pitfalls for the implementation of this innovation.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adult inpatients: a retrospective analysis of rates of hypoglycaemia with variable-rate and fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion protocols [^113J1oty]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Intravenous insulin infusion is a key component of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment, but evidence is limited supporting the ideal administration rate. International guidelines recommend a fixed insulin rate of 0.1 units/kg/h initially, with rate reduction following normoglycaemia.
Hypoglycaemia is a potential complication of insulin administration, with associated morbidity and mortality. Hypoglycaemia incidence did not differ between variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) and fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) protocols, although the FRIII cohort had a higher incidence of early hypoglycaemia.
Further research comparing VRIII and FRIII with dose reduction is needed to determine the optimal insulin infusion regimen in DKA management.

### Clinical and biochemical profile of 786 sequential episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113kn1nc]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

Our study contributes to the understanding of DKA in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We are able to confirm previous reports that DKA can present in people with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, that DKA in type 2 diabetes is over-represented by older people and those from ethnic minority populations, and that the most common precipitants of DKA remain poor compliance with insulin and intercurrent illness.

We contribute new knowledge in that the clinical protocol for managing DKA in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes appears equally effective, that those with higher serum osmolality appear to be more unwell and may require more support, and that new therapies such as SGLT2 inhibitors and cancer immunotherapies are increasingly contributing to the etiology of DKA in type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes, respectively.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117FgVQm]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

SGLT inhibition and risk of ketosis — individuals with type 1 diabetes and insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with SGLT inhibitor therapy; SGLT inhibitor–associated DKA occurs in approximately 4% of people with type 1 diabetes, the risk can be 5–17 times higher than in untreated type 1 diabetes, and SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for use in people with type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, DKA is uncommon with an estimated incidence of 0.6–4.9 events per 1,000 person-years; up to a third of SGLT2-associated DKA cases present with glucose < 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and in one small study 71% presented with glucose ≤ 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L); risk factors include low-carbohydrate diets, decreased caloric intake, alcohol intake, and other common precipitating factors, and it is important to educate individuals about the signs and symptoms of DKA and DKA mitigation and management and to provide accurate tools for ketone measurement.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^117Tk8gx]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Nearly all DKA hospitalizations started in the ED at both intervention (412 hospitalizations [98.1%]) and standard care (7420 hospitalizations [98.0%]) sites (Table 2). At the intervention site, the mean (SD) first serum laboratory glucose values were similar before (510.0 [218.8] mg/dL) and after (532.2 [240.4] mg/dL) implementation. Initial anion gap values were higher in the postimplementation period compared with the preimplementation period (25.4 [6.5] vs 23.1 [6.4] mEq/L), as were serum creatinine values (1.3 [0.5] mg/dL in the postimplementation period vs 1.1 [0.8] mg/dL in the preimplementation period [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]). At the standard care sites, glucose, anion gap, and creatinine were higher in the postimplementation period compared with the preimplementation period.

In the preimplementation period, SQ insulin was the first insulin administered in 40 intervention site hospitalizations (13.4%) and 651 standard care site hospitalizations (14.7%) (Table 3). In the postimplementation period, 98 intervention site hospitalizations (80.3%) and 402 standard care site hospitalizations (12.8%) received SQ insulin as their first insulin treatment. Over the first 48 hours of hospitalization, the total numbers of insulin units administered at the intervention site did not differ between the preimplementation and postimplementation periods (122.5 [70.9] vs 126.2 [75.4] units), whereas the total numbers of insulin units increased at the standard care sites (109.6 [68.3] units before implementation vs 121.9 [74.0] units after implementation).

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^114f1wk7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

At the intervention site, there was a substantial decrease in the proportion of hospitalizations directly admitted to the ICU, from 67.8% (202 hospitalizations) in the preimplementation period to 27.9% (34 hospitalizations) in the postimplementation period (χ 2 1 = 56.027; P < .001), with no change in the proportion of hospitalizations requiring a later admission to the ICU (P = 0.49, Fisher exact test) (Table 3). At standard care sites, direct ICU admission increased from 75.6% (3357 hospitalizations) to 79.5% (2488 hospitalizations) (χ 2 1 = 16.268; P < .001). After implementation, 30-day readmissions decreased at the intervention site from 21.1% (63 hospitalizations) before implementation to 9.8% (12 hospitalizations) after implementation, whereas they were unchanged at the standard care sites (789 hospitalizations [17.8%] before implementation vs 547 hospitalizations [17.5%] after implementation) (Table 4). Mortality within 30 days of DKA hospitalization was not significantly different at the intervention site (1 patient in the postimplementation period) or standard care sites (48 hospitalizations [1.1%] before vs 35 hospitalizations [1.1%] after implementation), whereas the length of stay decreased modestly in both groups after implementation.

Table 4.
Unadjusted Outcome Measures Following Implementation at the Intervention Site vs Regional Comparators

Using difference-in-differences regression (Table 5), the adjusted rate ratio for ICU admission was lower at the intervention site compared with the standard care sites, at 0.43 (95% CI, 0.33–0.56), a 57% reduction, whereas the adjusted rate ratio for 30-day readmission was also lower at 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25–0.99), a 50% reduction. The adjusted rate ratio for hospital length of stay was not significant (0.97; 95% CI, 0.76–1.23). Because only a single death occurred in the intervention site in each of the preimplementation and postimplementation periods, the adjusted rate ratio for mortality could not be estimated reliably.

### Comparison of computer-guided versus standard insulin infusion regimens in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116A4oYx]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This study was performed to investigate the efficacy of Glucommander (GM) (Glytec®), a computer-based algorithm versus standard (paper form-based) continuous insulin infusion (CII) in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

This was a retrospective multicenter study involving 2665 patients with DKA treated with either GM (n = 1750) or standard protocols (n = 915) across 34 institutions in the United States. GM estimates the rate of CII using an insulin sensitivity factor referred to as a "multiplier" that ranges between 0.01 and 0.03. Outcomes of interest were differences in time to resolve DKA (blood glucose [BG] < 200 mg/dL and bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L) and number of hypoglycemic events defined as a BG < 70 mg/dl.

Results

Treatment with GM was associated with lower rates of hypoglycemia during the time of the insulin drip (12.9% vs 35%, P = 0.001), faster time to normalization of blood glucose (9.7 ± 8.9 vs 10.97 ± 10.2 hours, P = 0.0001) and resolution of metabolic acidosis (13.6 ± 11.8 vs 17.3 ± 19.6 hours, P = 0.0001), and shorter hospital length of stay (3.2 ± 2.9 vs 4.5 ± 4.8 days, P = 0.01) compared to standard care. Best treatment outcomes were achieved with an initial multiplier of 0.01 and a glucose target range between 120 and 180 mg/dl.

Conclusion

The GM algorithm in DKA treatment resulted in lower rates of hypoglycemia and faster DKA resolution over standard paper-based algorithms. Prospective randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy and cost of computer-based algorithms versus standard CII regimens are warranted.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^116P2RQ1]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Objective

We compared the conventional 'one-bag protocol' of management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with the 'two-bag protocol' which utilizes two bags of fluids, one containing saline and supplemental electrolytes and the other containing the same solution with the addition of 10% dextrose.

Research design and methods

A retrospective chart review and analysis was done on adult patients admitted for DKA to the Riverside University Health System Medical Center from 2008 to 2015. There were 249 cases of DKA managed by the one-bag system and 134 cases managed by the two-bag system.

Results

The baseline patient characteristics were similar in both groups. The anion gap closed in 13.56 hours in the one-bag group versus 10.94 hours in the two-bag group (p value < 0.0002). None of the individual factors significantly influenced the anion gap closure time; only the two-bag system favored earlier closure of the anion gap. Plasma glucose levels improved to < 250 mg/dL earlier with two-bag protocol (9.14 vs 7.82 hours, p = 0.0241). The incidence of hypoglycemic events was significantly less frequent with the two-bag protocol compared with the standard one-bag system (1.49% vs 8.43%, p = 0.0064). Neither the time to improve serum HCO₃ level > 18 mg/dL nor the hospital length of stay differed between the two groups.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that the two-bag protocol closes the anion gap earlier than the one-bag protocol in adult patients with DKA. Blood glucose levels improved faster with the two-bag protocol compared with the one-bag protocol with fewer associated episodes of hypoglycemia. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these findings.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^113Yv7jR]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was approved by the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) institutional review board and was determined to be exempt from the need for informed consent according to 45 CFR §46.104(d)(4)(iii). This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

SQ Insulin DKA Treatment Protocol

Between January 2010 and January 2016, all 21 KPNC hospitals used a standardized electronic health record (EHR) order set for treating DKA that included IV regular insulin infusion, as well as IV fluids and electrolyte replacement, according to American Diabetes Association guidelines. ICU admission was standard for all patients treated with IV insulin because hourly glucose checks and insulin titration required a higher level of nursing care than is typically available in other hospital wards. Starting in 2016, specialists at the intervention hospital (KP San Jose Medical Center) designed and implemented a clinical DKA protocol using SQ insulin as primary treatment for all adult (aged ≥ 18 years), nonpregnant patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 8 who did not exhibit non-DKA medical conditions requiring ICU admission. The goal of the protocol was to provide a safe management pathway for patients with DKA outside the ICU while also decreasing nursing workload and improving patient experience.

The protocol was divided into 3 parts: initial emergency department (ED) management, general medical-surgical ward management, and discharge recommendations (Table 1). In the ED, patients meeting DKA protocol criteria were administered weight-based SQ glargine and lispro simultaneously, IV lactated ringer fluid boluses, dextrose 5% with normal saline infusion, and potassium repletion with a primary focus on patients with mild or moderate DKA (Table 1). Patients with severe DKA were also eligible for the SQ insulin protocol if they did not meet the exclusion criteria. DKA severity classifications were determined on the basis of American Diabetes Association criteria (Table 1).

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112hvzFT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Ketoacidosis risk mitigation with SGLT inhibitors: The page directs that clinicians "assess the underlying susceptibility; provide education regarding the risks, symptoms, and prevention strategies; and prescribe home monitoring supplies for β-hydroxybutyrate", noting that these processes "may have contributed to the lower rates of ketoacidosis seen in some of the studies of these agents for adjunctive glycemic management in people with type 1 diabetes compared with those that did not include preventative strategies". Ongoing safety steps are emphasized: "Reassessment of susceptibility, education, and provision of monitoring supplies should reoccur throughout the duration of SGLT inhibitor treatment, particularly as preventative strategies and monitoring can minimize, but not eliminate, the risk of ketoacidosis in those who are susceptible".

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the era of SGLT-2 inhibitors [^1133osWU]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is an emerging complication of diabetes associated with an increasing use of sodium-glucose transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor drugs. This review highlights the growing incidence of EDKA and its diagnostic challenges due to the absence of hallmark hyperglycemia seen in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The paper presents a classification system for the severity of EDKA, categorizing it into mild, moderate, and severe based on serum pH and bicarbonate levels. Another classification system is proposed to define stages of EDKA based on anion gap and ketones at the time of diagnosis and during the treatment period. A treatment algorithm is proposed to guide clinicians in managing EDKA. This treatment algorithm includes monitoring anion gap and ketones to guide insulin and fluid management, and slower transition to subcutaneous insulin to prevent a relapse. Increased awareness of EDKA is essential for a timely diagnosis because an early diagnosis and treatment can improve clinical outcomes.

### Comparison of a' two-bag system' versus conventional treatment protocol (' one-bag system') in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115U69D9]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

All adult patients over the age of 18 years with an admitting diagnosis of DKA were retrospectively identified from the medical record searching through ICD-9-CM codes 250.10 (DKA in type 1 diabetes) and 250.11 (DKA in type 2 diabetes) diagnosis. Once a list of the patients was gathered, the diagnosis of DKA was verified. The following criteria were used to define DKA, a blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL and two of the following three criteria: serum bicarbonate (HCO₃) < 18 mEq/L; serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) > 3 mmol/L; and pH < 7.30. Patients with a diagnosis of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state as a final diagnosis in the chart were excluded. Ketosis from any other etiology, for example, alcoholic ketoacidosis, starvation ketosis, as a final diagnosis in the chart was excluded. Our chart review confirmed that there were no pregnant patients on our list eliminating any case of DKA associated with pregnancy. During initial chart review, we did not include any patient with DKA who was not started on an insulin drip eliminating cases of DKA treated with a subcutaneous insulin protocol. We identified 383 patients admitted with DKA that received treatment with either the one-bag system (n = 249) or the two-bag system (n = 143). Data were extracted from individual chart review using a standard data collection instrument that recorded the following information at the time of admission: patient's age and sex, hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), body weight, body mass index (BMI), pH, anion gap, admission blood glucose, comorbidities, HCO 3, serum BHB, and the time of initiation and discontinuation of the DKA protocol. We also captured changes in anion gap, serum glucose, and bicarbonate level as patients received treatment for DKA.

Study outcomes

During the treatment of DKA, hyperglycemia is corrected faster than the ketoacidosis. Thus, we chose closure of the anion gap as our primary outcome measure which served as a surrogate for the resolution of DKA. Our secondary outcome was time to reach plasma glucose < 250 mg/dL, time to reach HCO₃ level > 18 mmol/L, and hospital length of stay.

### Management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adult inpatients: a retrospective analysis of rates of hypoglycaemia with variable-rate and fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion protocols [^116VgP39]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an endocrine emergency, involving hyperglycaemia, elevated ketones, and metabolic acidosis. Urgent management requires reversal of metabolic derangement, correction of electrolyte imbalance and volume depletion through the administration of intravenous fluids, electrolytes and short acting insulin, as well as investigation and correction of any underlying precipitants. There is variability across different hospitals and societies regarding the specifics of acute DKA management, including rates of insulin administration, fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement.

Insulin therapy suppresses ketogenesis and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, and as such is a vital part in the management of DKA. Continuous insulin infusion is widely accepted as the standard of care for moderate and severe DKA. International guidelines support the use of a fixed insulin rate of 0.1 units/kg/h during the initial stage of management, with a rate reduction step following normoglycaemia.

One of the main concerns regarding the insulin infusion rate is hypoglycaemia, which has been associated with increased length of stay in hospital and increased mortality in hospitalised patients. Recent data from a retrospective analysis by Mårtensson et al. conducted across intensive care units (ICU) in New Zealand and Australia, determined that intensive early correction of hyperglycaemia, when compared with partial early correction according to DKA‐specific guidelines, was independently associated with hypoglycaemia, hypo‐osmolarity and death.

Although fixed‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) protocols are widely endorsed, they have been associated with higher rates of hypoglycaemia when compared to variable‐rate protocols. In the United Kingdom National Survey in 2013, 27.6% of people experienced hypoglycaemia < 4.0 mmol/L on the FRIII protocol of 0.1 units/kg/h. A retrospective cohort study by Bohach et al. found 50% of participants on a fixed‐rate protocol to have severe hypoglycaemia to < 2.8 mmol/L compared to 7% in the variable‐rate group. The high rates of hypoglycaemia in fixed‐rate protocols have been shown to be reduced with a rate reduction step after normoglycaemia is achieved. Analysis of variable‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) protocols revealed lower hypoglycaemia rates between 6% and 8%.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^116DNLPT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Although SQ regular insulin has not been accepted as a therapy for DKA given its pharmacokineticsand slower attainment of effective plasma insulin concentrations, rapid-acting SQ insulin lispro has a substantially earlier and greater peak serum insulin concentration. Prior studies, have reported large IV insulin doses in DKA treatment, with 1 study showing an average administration of 216 units within the first 3 hours of treatment. Our protocol included a dose of long-acting insulin glargine administered up front along with SQ insulin lispro at every 4 hours, which is an approach used in United Kingdom DKA guidelines. We found that the protocol was effective with a similar time needed to reach a glucose less than 250 mg/dL and, more importantly, to anion gap closure without evidence of increased adverse outcomes. More recently, another studyhas found that short-acting insulin given SQ up to every 2 hours was safe and effective in treatment of DKA.

Given that the insulin is administered SQ, factors that affect absorption into the bloodstream, including obesity, the use of vasoconstricting drugs, and blood pressure, are important to consider in identifying the right patients for SQ insulin treatment. Typically, 100-unit insulin volumes of no greater than 0.5 mL are injected into a discrete area because a larger volume of insulin may impede absorption. Although the protocol used in this study did not have a specific weight limitation, we have recently revised our protocol to exclude patients whose weight is 166 kg or more out of concerns related to insulin absorption.

### Outcomes associated with a variable rate insulin infusion diabetic ketoacidosis protocol [^113e6HcR]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

To relate adverse events with glucose correction rates in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) using variable rate intravenous insulin-infusions (VRIII).

Methods

Retrospective, observational study in adults with DKA who received insulin infusions between 2012 and 2017 at St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne. Early correction of hyperglycaemia (< 10 mmol/L) was evaluated for association with hypoglycaemia (< 4.0 mmol/L), hypokalaemia (potassium < 3.3 mmol/L) and clinical outcomes via regression analysis.

Results

The study involved 97 patients, with 93% having type 1 diabetes. The mean age was 38 years, 47% were women and 35% were admitted to intensive care. Hypoglycaemia rates during 12 and 24 h of treatment were 6.2% and 8.2%, respectively with 58% of patients recording their first BGL < 10 mmol/L within 12 h and 88% within 24 h. Ketone clearance time averaged at 15.6 h. Hyperglycaemia correction rates to < 10 mmol/L were not different in those with/without hypoglycaemia at 12/24 h, in multivariate analysis including admission BGL. Hypokalaemia occurred in 40.2% of patients and was associated with lower pH but not BGL correction rates.

Conclusion

The VRIII protocol achieved early hyperglycaemia correction and ketoacidosis reversal with low hypoglycaemia risk. However, high hypokalaemia rates suggest the need for aggressive potassium replacement, especially in markedly acidotic patients.

### Efficacy of subcutaneous insulin lispro versus continuous intravenous regular insulin for the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^115ukyhK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous insulin lispro with that of a standard low-dose intravenous infusion protocol of regular insulin in patients with uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized open trial, 20 patients treated with subcutaneous insulin lispro were managed in regular medicine wards (n = 10) or an intermediate care unit (n = 10), while 20 patients treated with the intravenous protocol were managed in the intensive care unit. Patients treated with subcutaneous lispro received an initial injection of 0.3 unit/kg followed by 0.1 unit/kg/h until correction of hyperglycemia (blood glucose levels < 250 mg/dL), followed by 0.05 to 0.1 unit/kg/h until resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis (pH ≥ 7.3, bicarbonate ≥ 18 mEq/L). Patients treated with intravenous regular insulin received an initial bolus of 0.1 unit/kg, followed by an infusion of 0.1 unit/kg/h until correction of hyperglycemia, then 0.05 to 0.1 unit/kg/h until resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Results

Mean (± SD) admission biochemical parameters in patients treated with subcutaneous lispro (glucose: 674 ± 154 mg/dL; bicarbonate: 9.2 ± 4 mEq/L; pH: 7.17 ± 0.10) were similar to values in patients treated with intravenous insulin (glucose: 611 ± 264 mg/dL; bicarbonate: 10.6 ± 4 mEq/L; pH: 7.19 ± 0.08). The duration of treatment until correction of hyperglycemia (7 ± 3 hours vs. 7 ± 2 hours) and resolution of ketoacidosis (10 ± 3 hours vs. 11 ± 4 hours) in patients treated with subcutaneous lispro was not different than in patients treated with intravenous regular insulin. There were no deaths in either group, and there were no differences in the length of hospital stay, amount of insulin until resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis, or in the rate of hypoglycemia between treatment groups. Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis in the intensive care unit was associated with 39% higher hospitalization charges than was treatment with subcutaneous lispro in a non-intensive care setting ($14,429 ± $5243 vs. $8801 ± $5549, P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Treatment of adult patients who have uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis with subcutaneous lispro every hour in a non-intensive care setting may be safe and more cost-effective than treatment with intravenous regular insulin in the intensive care unit.

### Abstract… [^117UPrdD]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Table 1. 4 The therapeutic regimen, which consists of replacing fluid and electrolyte losses and administering low-dose insulin, is based on an understanding of the pathogenesis of the condition. Although protocols for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis are well established, a 1 to 2 percent mortality rate has persisted since the 1970s, 5 emphasizing the need for careful, ongoing evaluation of this sometimes "routine" medical emergency. Treatment The therapeutic goals for diabetic ketoacidosis consist of improving circulatory volume and tissue perfusion, reducing blood glucose and serum osmolality toward normal levels, clearing ketones from serum and urine at a steady rate, correcting electrolyte imbalances and identifying precipitating factors. A suggested flow sheet for monitoring therapeutic response is provided in Figure 3.
6.

The initial priority in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is the restoration of extra-cellular fluid volume through the intravenous administration of a normal saline solution. This step will restore intravascular volume, decrease counterregulatory hormones and lower the blood glucose level. 9 As a result, insulin sensitivity may be augmented. INSULIN THERAPY Modern management of diabetic ketoacidosis has emphasized the use of lower doses of insulin. This has been shown to be the most efficacious treatment in both children and adults with diabetic ketoacidosis. 11–14 The current recommendation is to give low-dose insulin after the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis has been confirmed by laboratory tests and fluid replacement has been initiated. 5 The typical presentation is onset of headache and decreased mental status occurring several hours after the start of treatment.

Cerebral edema is associated with a mortality rate of up to 70 percent.
15. Immediate Posthyperglycemic Care When diabetic ketoacidosis has been controlled, subcutaneous insulin therapy can be started. The half-life of regular insulin is less than 10 minutes. Therefore, to avoid relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis, the first subcutaneous dose of regular insulin should be given at least one hour before intravenous insulin is discontinued. Milder forms of diabetic ketoacidosis can be treated in the emergency department using the same treatment guidelines described in this review. Successful outpatient therapy requires the absence of severe intercurrent illness, an alert patient who is able to resume oral intake and the presence of mild diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis… [^115yTEZQ]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

1 Use of a standard protocol provides consistent results in treating DKA. 2 An evidence-based guideline for the management of DKA from the American Diabetes Association is the basis for much of this article.
3. Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation of patients with DKA includes diagnosis and treatment of precipitating factors. The most common precipitating factor is infection, followed by noncompliance with insulin therapy. 3While insulin pump therapy has been implicated as a risk factor for DKA in the past, most recent studies show that with proper education and practice using the pump, the frequency of DKA is the same for patients on pump and injection therapy.
19. Treatment A priority of treatment should be to protect and maintain the airway, particularly in the obtunded patient, and to treat shock if present. Patients should be monitored closely and frequently.

Blood glucose should be evaluated every one to two hours until the patient is stable, and the blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels should be monitored every two to six hours depending on the severity of DKA. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT TREATMENT Selected patients with mild DKA who are alert and taking fluids orally may be treated under observation and sent home without admission. 3 The ADA admission guidelines are a plasma glucose concentration greater than 250 mg per dL with an arterial pH level below 7. 30, a serum bicarbonate level of less than 15 mEq per L, and a moderate or greater level of ketones in the serum or urine. 27 Patients with severe DKA should be admitted to the intensive care unit. Regular insulin should be used intravenously. Lispro and aspart insulin are more expensive and do not work faster than regular insulin when given intravenously.

A newly published regimen is treatment of DKA with subcutaneous aspart or lispro insulin. Transition to Standard Regimen and Prevention of Recurrence A blood glucose concentration of less than 200 mg per dL, a bicarbonate level of 18 mEq per L or greater, and a venous pH level of greater than 7. 3 indicate that the DKA has resolved. 3 Typical duration of therapy is about 48 hours. 3 If the patient can eat when DKA has resolved, a standard subcutaneous insulin regimen by injection or insulin pump should be started.

This has been shown to be the most efficacious treatment in both children and adults with diabetic ketoacidosis. 11–14 The current recommendation is to give low-dose insulin after the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis has been confirmed by laboratory tests and fluid replacement has been initiated. Standard low-dose insulin therapy consists of an initial intravenous bolus of 0. 15 unit of regular insulin per kg followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin prepared in normal saline or hypotonic saline solution at a rate of
0. 1 unit per kg per hour. In clinical situations in which continuous intravenous insulin cannot be administered, the recommended initial insulin dose is 0. 3 unit per kg, with one half of the dose given as an intravenous bolus and the remainder given subcutaneously or intramuscularly. One protocol entails using insulin and intravenous fluids until the serum potassium concentration is less than 5. 5 mEq per L. At this time, potassium chloride is added to intravenous fluids in the amount of 20 to 40 mEq per L. The exact amount of potassium that is administered depends on the serum potassium concentration. 1, 22 A protocol for the administration of subcutaneous insulin is included in Figure 2. In patients who are unable to eat, 5 percent dextrose in hypotonic saline solution is continued at a rate of 100 to 200 mL per hour. Blood glucose levels are monitored every four hours, and regular insulin is given subcutaneously every four hours using a sliding scale (. Patients with known diabetes can typically be given the dosage they were receiving before the onset of diabetic ketoacidosis.
