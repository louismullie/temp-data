## Question

7. (4 points) In an opaque cloth bag, there are 10 chopsticks each of black, white, and yellow colors. The minimum number of chopsticks to be taken out to ensure that there is a pair of chopsticks of the same color is.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the minimum number of chopsticks that must be drawn from an opaque bag to guarantee at least one pair of the same color, given 10 black, 10 white, and 10 yellow chopsticks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the worst-case scenario to guarantee certainty. Then, I should verify the pigeonhole principle and how it applies here. Next, I will calculate the exact number and double-check the logic. Finally, I will consider whether any edge cases or misinterpretations could change the answer and confirm the conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the setup and the goal: there are three colors (black, white, yellow) with 10 chopsticks each, and we want the smallest number to draw to ensure at least two chopsticks share the same color. The key is to ensure certainty in the worst-case draw, not just probability, so I need to think about the maximum number of draws that could still avoid a pair.

> I will now examine the worst-case scenario: drawing one chopstick of each color first. That means 1 black, 1 white, and 1 yellow, totaling 3 chopsticks, and still no pair. Wait, let me verify that this is indeed the worst case before proceeding; yes, this sequence maximizes the number of draws without matching colors.

> Next, I should apply the pigeonhole principle. With 3 colors, the next draw (the 4th chopstick) must match one of the colors already drawn, thereby creating a pair. Hold on, I should verify the principle's applicability here: with n categories, n+1 items guarantee a repeat, so with 3 colors, 3+1 = 4 guarantees a pair. That aligns with the logic.

> Therefore, the minimum number to guarantee at least one pair of the same color is 4. I should double-check that I'm not overlooking any constraint like limited quantities; since there are 10 of each color, the supply does not constrain the worst-case sequence, so the answer remains 4.

> Final answer: 4.

---

The minimum number of chopsticks you must draw to guarantee a pair of the same color is **4**. This follows from the pigeonhole principle: with 3 colors, drawing 3 chopsticks could still yield one of each color; the 4th draw must match one of the existing colors, ensuring a pair.

---

## Step-by-step reasoning

- **Total colors**: 3 (black, white, yellow).
- **Worst-case scenario**: Draw 1 black, 1 white, and 1 yellow (3 chopsticks) — no pair yet.
- **Next draw**: The 4th chopstick must match one of the existing colors, forming a pair.

Thus, the minimum number is **4**.

### Use of metabolomics in treating critically ill trauma patients… [^f5e39f99]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Generated using mass spectrometry–based metabolomics. Box and whisker plots display median, interquartile range, maximum, and minimum values. Comparisons between trauma patients and healthy volunteers are based on multiple regression with adjustments for body mass index and processing batch. Comparisons between day-1 and day-7 trauma patients are based on paired t tests. Multiple testing is accounted for by a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method.
23. Generated using mass spectrometry–based metabolomics. Each data point represents a biologic pathway with quantified plasma metabolites. Based on the available metabolite's centrality and importance to the pathway of interest, a level of pathway impact is assigned. Larger pathway impact is communicated by moving rightward on the x-axis and by increasing diameter of circles. Based on paired differences in metabolite concentration between comparison groups, a P value is assigned to the pathway.

A more significant result is communicated by moving upward on the y-axis and by a color scale, which goes from white to yellow to orange to red. Venous blood samples were obtained in 5-mL K2 EDTA Vacutainer tubes within 24 hours of injury and on hospital days 3 and 7. Healthy volunteers donated samples the morning after 12 hours or more of fasting. Samples were immediately placed on ice and centrifuged at 2500g for 10 minutes within 1 hour of collection. The plasma supernatant was then removed, divided into 0. 5-mL aliquots, and stored at −80°C. In addition, medical records for trauma patients were reviewed to obtain hospital-based plasma glucose levels acquired within 4 hours of venous blood sampling for this study. Plasma samples were thawed for MS-based analysis in 2 processing batches of 15 and 20 samples. Detailed protocols for metabolomics analyses are reported in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

Briefly, samples were analyzed using a targeted liquid chromatography and quadrupole MS approach, and metabolites were identified by comparison with known standards to obtain relative concentrations. All processing batches included 3 quality-control samples derived from the same pooled serum sample. All metabolite signals were normalized to these standardized QCs using the mean QC value in each batch, consistent with established techniques. 20 A total of 210 metabolites were assayed.

### Learning about color from language [^227d3afc]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Experiment 2: do some text corpora contain better data for learning color-adjective associations?

To better understand where in language the models may be learning these human-like color-adjective associations, we first examined whether word embeddings learned from different language genres differ in predicting the ratings of blind and sighted participants.

We applied the semantic projection method to 300-dimensional word embeddings trained on several English text corpora: (a) Embeddings (pre)trained on Web Common Crawl and English Wikipedia using the fastText implementation of the continuous bag of words (CBOW) model, (b) embeddings pretrained on the OpenSubtitles corpus using the fastText implementation of the skipgram model, and (c) embeddings trained on each section of the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). We separately trained models on the fiction, news, academic texts, spoken texts, and magazine article components. We cleaned the corpora (removing extraneous whitespace, punctuation, and non-standard characters), ran 5 iterations of the word2phrase algorithm with decreasing threshold to convert common bigrams like "New York" into single tokens. We then ran the fastText implementation of the skipgram algorithmwith the following parameters: minimum word occurrences = 5; minimum length of subword ngram = 3; maximum length of subword ngram = 6; sampling threshold = 0.0001; learning rate = 0.05; learning rate update rate = 100; dimensions = 300; context window size = 5; epochs = 10; negative samples = 10. As an additional point of comparison, we also elicited responses from GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large transformer language model with many orders of magnitude more parameters and training input. We prompted GPT-4 to rate colors on the same dimensions as our human participants and assessed how GPT-4 predicts human judgments compared to word embedding models. For each color-dimension rating, we prompted GPT-4 10 times with a 0.8 temperature setting and took the average of the responses. To complement these ratings and better approximate GPT-4's underlying probability distributions, we also implemented a sampling-based method, where we presented GPT-4 with binary choices about colors (e.g. "Is red cold or hot?", "Is yellow ripe or unripe?"), sampling 500 responses per color-dimension pair using a temperature setting of 1.0. By treating these responses as Bernoulli trials, we could estimate the model's probabilistic preferences through the relative frequency of choosing each option.

### Color, scent and size: exploring women's preferences around design characteristics of drug-releasing vaginal rings [^04a29be4]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Ranking of Vaginal Ring Colors

Participants were shown six vaginal rings of different colors/shades (including white, mellow yellow, light pink, pastel orange, pastel green and mauve) and asked which color they preferred (Table 1, Fig. 4). Group 1 participants largely preferred the white vaginal ring, one suggesting that the white color would enable her to detect any discharge/disease. Although some participants in the group noted that different people would have different preferences, and suggested individuals should be able to choose their preferred option.

"Because white might help me to see if there is some dirt in my vagina, be able to spot discharge, but the coloured ones, no. I like it like this". (Group 1, Participant 1, product experienced group)

"I think all the colors that are here are not a problem. I like all of them, and then have a person choose which one they like. There is no need to add more, the ones that are available are fine. A person can decide which color they like". (Group 1, Participant 2, product experienced group)

Participants from Groups 2 and 3 chose a range of colors related to individual preference.

F: "Okay, number 1 chose mauve, 2 and 3 chose peach [referring to pastel orange], 4 chose white and 5 and 6 chose… "

Note-taker: "Lime (pastel green)". (Group 2, product inexperienced group)

Furthermore, some participants suggested a few additional colors be added to the options including yellow, pink, black and red. Although yellow (mellow yellow) and pink (light pink) rings were included in the study, yellow and pink may have been mentioned as additional colors as the intensity of the study colors was not very strong.

P: "I think black as well, people like color black".

F: "You think people like black and you think they can use black?"

P: "Uhm hum. I think they can love it".

F: "Okay. Can you tell me why you think people might like black?"

P: "Uhm, black is calm, so, ya". (Group 1, Participant 3, product experienced group)

A REMINDER

If you forget any of the 7 white "reminder" pills in WEEK 4: THROW AWAY the pills you missed. Keep taking 1 pill each day until the pack is empty. You do not need a back-up method.

FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED:

Use a BACK-UP METHOD anytime you have sex.

KEEP TAKING ONE "ACTIVE" PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your healthcare professional.

How to Use the Blister Cards

The blister card comes to you set up for Sunday Start. If your physician has instructed you to start pill-taking on the SUNDAY after your menstrual period has begun or if your period begins on Sunday you will take your first pill that very same day. Start with the Sunday pill in row #1. Take one active pill daily for 21 days followed by one white placebo pill daily for 7 days.
If you start pill-taking on a day other than SUNDAY, peel the attached sticker by selecting the day of the week you plan to start. Place the sticker over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills. This sticker will help to remind you to take your pill every day. Take the light yellow pill which corresponds to the day in row #1 of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period. After taking all of the pills at the end of row #3, go back to row #1 and complete the "active" pills. Once all of the active pills have been taken, proceed to row #4 and take the 7 "reminder" pills to complete the pack.
When you start taking the pill for the first time, use an additional method of protection until you have taken your first 7 pills.
Your tablet dispenser consists of three parts, the foil pouch, wallet, and a blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills each with the days of the week printed above them. The 21 colored pills are "active" birth control pills. The 7 white pills are inactive; their purpose is to help make your pill-taking schedule simple and easy to remember.
You must take your pills in order, one pill each day at intervals of 24 hours. Always start with the colored pills in row #1. To remove a pill, push down on the pill with your thumb and forefinger so that the pill releases through the back of the dispenser. See diagram below:

### Aging and quality control of color LCDs for radiologic imaging [^541ecf09]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Our practice has long been concerned with the effects of display quality, including color accuracy and matching among paired color displays. Three years of data have been collected on the historical behavior of color stability on our clinical displays. This has permitted an analysis of the color-aging behavior of those displays over that time. The results of that analysis show that all displays tend to yellow over time, but that they do so together. That is, neither the intra- nor inter-display color variances observed at initial deployment diverge over time as measured by a mean radial distance metric in color space (Commission Internationale d'Eclairage L', u', v' 1976). The consequence of this result is that color displays that are matched at deployment tend to remain matched over their lifetime even as they collectively yellow.

### Impact of fingernail Polish on pulse oximetry measurements: a systematic review [^75a73822]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of application of fingernail polish on S pO2 measurement remains unclear. We conducted this systematic review to ascertain the impact of fingernail polish on S pO2 measurement.

Methods

We queried PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases for publications indexed through December 2022. We included studies providing paired S pO2 data from fingertips without and after nail polish application or reporting the number of subjects whose S pO2 could not be measured due to fingernail polish. We used random effects modeling to summarize standardized mean differences (SMDs) and corresponding 95% CI for different nail polish colors from comparative studies.

Results

We retrieved 122 studies and included 21 publications, mostly performed on healthy volunteers. Of these, 17 (81.0%) studies had a low risk of bias. We summarized mean SMD for 10 nail polish colors (black, blue, brown, green, orange, pink, purple, red, white, and yellow) from 25 paired data sets on S pO2 across 20 studies. We found small (likely clinically insignificant) but statistically significant differences in mean S pO2 when fingers were coated with black, blue, brown, or purple nail polish (SMD -0.57, -0.47, -0.33, and -0.25, respectively; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.29, -0.84 to -0.10, -0.59 to -0.07, and -0.48 to -0.02, respectively). Only one of 4 studies reported a high proportion of unsuccessful oximeter readings from fingers painted with black (88.0%) or brown (36.0%) nail polish.

Conclusions

Although fingernail polish of some colors can marginally reduce S pO2 reading or occasionally impede S pO2 measurement, the variability is clinically insignificant.

Blood Collection

Required Supplies:

Scale and/or blood mixing device
Tubing sealer
Evacuated blood collection tubes
If it is part of your institution's SOP, make a loose knot in the collection tubing between white clamp E and the whole blood bag.
Separate the sample/diversion bag from the other bags.
Load the bags onto a scale and/or blood mixing device according to your institution's SOP. Ensure that the whole blood bag and the sample bag are lower than the donor's arm.
Close blue clamp B.
Apply a blood pressure cuff or a tourniquet to the donor's arm.
Prepare the venipuncture site.
Twist the needle cap until the resistance stops and then pull the needle cap straight off.
Perform the venipuncture according to your institution's SOP.
Open blue clamp B.
Position the sample/diversion bag with blue clamp B at the top and the sample tube holder/luer adapter at the bottom (see Figure 1). Allow the desired volume of whole blood to flow into the sample/diversion bag. The nominal volume of the sample bag is 60 mL. When the volume reaches the marking, approximately 40 mL has been collected.
Close blue clamp B.
Break CLIKTIP D to allow the whole blood to flow into the whole blood bag. Bend the CLIKTIP in both directions to ensure that you break it completely.
Seal the sample/diversion tubing as near as possible to Y connector A. Seal the tubing according to your institution's SOP.
Invert the sample/diversion bag and transfer donor blood samples from the sample/diversion bag, using evacuated blood collection tubes. Transfer samples as soon as possible after venipuncture to avoid possible clot formation in the sample/diversion bag.
Hold the sample/diversion bag and sample tube holder/luer adapter in one hand with blue clamp B positioned at the bottom (see Figure 2).
Using the other hand, insert a blood collection tube firmly into the sample tube holder/luer adapter. After filling the blood collection tube, remove the tube from the sample tube holder. Repeat the process to take additional samples.
Mix the whole blood and the anticoagulant during collection according to your institution's SOP.
Collect the target volume of blood ± 10%, as specified on the whole blood bag label.
Close white clamp E and perform one of the following steps:
If you made a knot in the collection tubing in step 1, tighten the knot firmly.
If you did not make a knot in step 1, seal the collection tubing near CLIKTIP D.
Hold the needle hub and then slide the NIP partially over the needle hub (see Figure 3).
Gently pull on the tubing to withdraw the needle from the donor's arm and into the NIP until the needle locks securely (see Figure 4).
Seal the collection tubing near CLIKTIP D if you did not do so in step 17. Disconnect the sealed tubing that includes the needle and the sampling assembly. Dispose of the needle, the NIP, and the sample tube holder safely according to your institution's SOP and/or local regulations.
Immediately after collection is complete, invert the whole blood bag several times to thoroughly mix the whole blood and the anticoagulant.
If required, strip the blood in the collection tubing into the whole blood bag according to your institution's SOP.
Seal and disconnect the collection tubing between 1 in and 2 in (2.5 cm and 5.0 cm) away from the whole blood bag. Dispose of the collection tubing safely according to your institution's SOP and/or local regulations.
Place the whole blood unit into a temperature-controlled environment according to your institution's SOP.
Pack and transport the whole blood unit to the processing laboratory according to your institution's SOP.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

Beach umbrellas and sun-shade shelters — Several types of shade shelters are available, and people should choose a shelter made with a fire-resistant UPF 50 fabric, usually nylon or polyester, with a durable yet lightweight frame. Additional considerations include size, weight and portability, water-resistant fabric, open or mesh sides for air circulation, and secure anchoring with stakes or fillable sandbags; standard camping tents generally are unsuitable for shade shelters unless they are rated as such. Travelers should select beach umbrellas with ample diameter and directional tilt so the protective field can be adjusted as the sun rises and crosses the sky.

### Healthcare personnel attire in non-operating-room settings [^2f2681f2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Healthcare personnel attire — white coats: Facilities that mandate or strongly recommend use of a white coat for professional appearance should institute one or more of the following measures: HCP engaged in direct patient care (including house staff and students) should possess 2 or more white coats and have access to a convenient and economical means to launder white coats (eg, institution-provided on-site laundering at no cost or low cost), and institutions should provide coat hooks that would allow HCP to remove their white coat prior to patient contact or contact with the patient's immediate environment; rationales state these considerations may help maintain desired professional appearance while allowing a higher frequency of laundering and limiting patients' direct contact with potentially contaminated attire.

All images were checked for quality and similarity by at least 2 members of the research team. If images were deemed unsatisfactory during the quality check, replacement images were found. After compilation of images was complete, the image bank was evaluated by an independent rater for similarity in shape, color, visual complexity, and size, and to ensure that food and non-food images could be readily identified as such. All images were then converted to 96.00 ppi on both the x- and y-axes, scaled to 150 × 150 pixels, and saved as JPEG files via GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). If necessary, images were further edited using GIMP to maximize similarity measures.

2.6	Preparation for Administration - Prefilled Syringe

The PAVBLU prefilled plastic syringe is sterile and for one-time use in one eye only.

The prefilled syringe should be inspected visually prior to administration. It is a clear to opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, or if the package is open or damaged. The appearance of the syringe cap on the prefilled syringe may vary (for example, color and design).

Do not use if any part of the prefilled syringe is damaged or if the syringe cap is detached from the Luer lock.

The intravitreal injection should be performed with a 30-gauge × ½-inch injection needle (not provided).

The prefilled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept-ayyh (equivalent to 50 microliters). The excess volume must be discarded prior to the administration.

PREFILLED SYRINGE DESCRIPTION - Figure 1:

Use aseptic technique to carry out the following steps:

PREPARE

When ready to administer PAVBLU, open the carton and remove sterilized blister pack. Carefully peel open the sterilized blister pack ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the syringe in the sterile tray until you are ready for assembly.

REMOVE SYRINGE

Using aseptic technique, remove the syringe from the sterilized blister pack.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

2.1 Important Administration Information

NOURESS is for intravenous infusion after dilution and admixing use only. Prior to administration, NOURESS must be diluted and used as an admixture in parenteral nutrition solutions.

The resulting solution is for intravenous infusion into a central or peripheral vein. The choice of a central or peripheral venous route should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate. Solutions with osmolarity of 900 mOsm/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Preparation and Administration Information

Prior to administration, NOURESS must be diluted and used as an admixture in parenteral nutrition solutions.
NOURESS is to be prepared only in a suitable work area such as a laminar flow hood (or an equivalent clean air compounding area). The key factor in the preparation is careful aseptic technique to avoid inadvertent touch contamination during mixing of solutions and addition of other nutrients.
NOURESS is for addition to amino acid solutions prior to further admixing with dextrose injection using a parenteral nutrition container.
Calcium and phosphate ratios must be considered. Excess addition of calcium and phosphate, especially in the form of mineral salts, may result in the formation of calcium phosphate precipitates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Use a dedicated line for parenteral nutrition solutions.
Intravenous lipid emulsions can be infused concurrently into the same vein as NOURESS-containing amino acid and dextrose solutions by a Y-connector located near the infusion site; flow rates of each solution should be controlled separately by infusion pumps.
For administration, use a 0.22 micron in-line filter.
To prevent air embolism, use a non-vented infusion set or close the vent on a vented set, avoid multiple connections, do not connect flexible containers in series, fully evacuate residual gas in the container prior to administration, do not pressurize the flexible container to increase flow rates, and if administration is controlled by a pumping device, turn off pump before the container runs dry.
Visually inspect the diluted parenteral nutrition solution containing NOURESS for particulate matter and discoloration before admixing, after admixing, after removal from refrigeration, and prior to administration. The solution should be clear and there should be no precipitates. A slight yellow color does not alter the quality and efficacy of this product.

### Holographic colour prints for enhanced optical security by combined phase and amplitude control [^4c60306d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

For simplicity, we first demonstrate the multiplexing of two holograms into a two-tone image, here a QR code. Although we designed these holograms for red and blue laser illumination, we note that there is no need for the colour filters used for multiplexing to be red and blue as long as their transmission amplitudes are mutually exclusive (orthogonal) at the design wavelengths. Because the requirement for wavelength selectivity constrains the spectra at only two points, there are a number of possible spectra and therefore colours that can be used. As such, we have some flexibility to choose colour filters with transmission spectra that best match both the desired image colours and the hologram design wavelengths ("spectral freedom"), or that otherwise achieve an optimal trade-off between these objectives.

Indeed, we found that red-and-blue QR codes provided very poor contrast and were difficult to read. To improve the visibility of our QR code for scanning under broadband white light illumination, we chose the colours yellow (with a high average transmittance of 48% over the range 450–650 nm, which contains most of the power of a typical white light source) and blue (low average transmittance of 22%) for the light and dark pixels, respectively. This choice of colours maximises the grayscale image contrast in white light while still retaining wavelength selectivity for the multiplexed holograms under monochromatic red and blue light (Fig. 3b).

Having selected suitable colours, exploiting the spatial degree of freedom in the multiplexed holograms allowed us to arrange the pixels into a print that shows a meaningful binary image (Fig. 3c), here a QR code that stores a 2620-bit message at error correction level H, which can be retrieved by scanning the image with a mobile phone or other reader. Notably, the holographic projection switches cleanly between the Chinese seal (Fig. 3d) and the Penny Black stamp (Fig. 3e) when toggling between red and blue laser illumination, despite both projections occupying the same region in space (Supplementary Fig. 7). Viewing at high magnification reveals the multiscale hierarchical structure of the print (Fig. 3f–h), in which pillar array colour filters of different dimensions and hologram phase plates of varying thickness are seamlessly integrated into the QR code pixels.

### Temporal stability of stimulus representation increases along rodent visual cortical hierarchies [^0e045292]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To verify correctness of this interpretation, we repeated our analysis with 21 pairs of movie segments of identical duration (967 ms, or 29 movies frames) that contained a single object (either black or white) moving roughly horizontally, either from left to right or from right to left (examples in Fig. 6a). This allowed defining four types of classification tasks, based on whether the color and/or motion direction of the objects to discriminate were (or not) the same (Fig. 6a, b). We expected that, at least for tasks where the difference in object luminance was small, extrastriate areas would reach the same absolute performance as V1 and possibly surpass it at sufficiently long lags from the training bin.

Fig. 6
Classifier analysis restricted to hand-matched pairs of movie segments.

Each movie segment was exactly 29 frames long, and the frames shown here are frames number 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 (left to right). As indicated by the black/white arrows in each quadrant, each pair of movie segments was distinguished from the others, based on whether the objects in the segments had the same color and whether they moved along the same direction. b Classifier performance vs. lag from the training bin for each of the four conditions.

### Strategies to enhance the effects of pictorial warnings for cigarettes: results from a discrete choice experiment [^81c7362f]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

To measure the effects of changing attributes of pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) on cigarette packs in a country that has already implemented pictorial HWLs.

Measures

For each choice set, participants were presented with two cigarette packs and asked the following three questions: (1) 'If only these two cigarette packs were available, which would you buy?'; (2) 'Each of these two packs has warnings on the front and back about the health effects of smoking. Which of these warnings best informs you about the dangers from smoking?'; and (3) 'Which warning most makes you think about quitting smoking?'. As recommended for best practices in discrete choice experiments, each of these questions was followed by an 'opt-out' question for participants to indicate whether they really believed there was a difference between the options presented (i.e. 'Would you really choose one of them?'; 'Do you really think that either of these warnings informs you about dangers from smoking?'; or 'Do you really think that either of these warnings would make you think about quitting smoking?', respectively). Each choice set could be viewed for as long as the participant wished. For each choice question (i.e. willingness to buy, informative, motivating to quit), the pack chosen was coded as 1 and the other pack as 0, with both packs being given a value of 0 if the participant 'opted out'.

Design

A within-subject discrete choice experiment that involved systematic manipulation of pictorial HWL size [75 versus 30% (current policy)]; inclusion of imagery on the back of the pack [versus none (current policy)]; and color formatting [black on yellow versus yellow on black (current policy)].

Setting

Mexico, on-line panel.

Participants

Adult smokers (n = 705).

Measurements

For each choice set, participants selected one pack as having the most informative HWL about smoking harms, the one that makes them think the most about quitting and the one they were most willing to buy. We assessed the independent and interactive effects of HWL attributes on choices.

Findings

Larger HWL size on the pack front (75 versus 30%) and inclusion of a pictorial image on the pack back were both independently associated with lower willingness to buy a pack [b = -0.228, standard error (SE) = 0.023 and -0.089, SE = 0.016, respectively] and greater perception of an HWL as informative (b = 0.214, SE = 0.022, and 0.191, SE = 0.017, respectively) and motivating to quit (b = 0.251, SE = 0.023 and 0.194, SE = 0.017, respectively). HWL with black text and yellow background were perceived as less informative (b = -0.037, SE = 0.016) and less motivating to quit (b = -0.032, SE = 0.015) compared with yellow text on a black background.

Conclusions

Among adult Mexican smokers, pictorial health warning labels on cigarette packages that are larger or cover both sides of the pack appear more effective at lowering purchase intentions and increasing risk perceptions and motivation to quit than smaller health warning labels or health warning labels with imagery only on the pack front.

### The misuse of colour in science communication [^ade40fa2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Colour map classes and types.

The various classes of colour maps (sequential; diverging; multi-sequential; cyclic) and types (continuous; discrete; categorical). Only sequential colour maps can be faithfully applied to categorical types of data.

Fig. 6
Guideline for choosing the right scientific colour map.

For effective data representation, the nature of a given data set has to be matched by a suitable colour map class, type, and colour combination.

An intuitive colour gradient becomes imperative if data are displayed without the provision of the colour bar (the axis relating colours to data values). Unfortunately, missing colour bars are more common than most would expect, as scales are sometimes cropped out or omitted during reproduction or subsequent dissemination (e.g. refs.). It is imperative to ensure the colour bar is included on all figures where a colour scale is used, as even the most intuitive colour map could be rendered useless with no colour bar for the reader to refer to. Excluding a colour bar would be equivalent to not including the axis labels and tick marks on the x - or y -axis of a plot. Additionally, attention has to be paid to the lightness (i.e. light or dark) of the background on which the colours are displayed. Background creates contrast, in lightness and colour, to the displayed data (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Movie 1).

To optimise the use of the currently available perceptually uniform colour maps listed in Box 2, there are certain requirements to prevent them from becoming distorted (e.g. ref.). As the colour bar has to be handled similarly to the position axis, parts of a scientifically derived colour map cannot be subsequently deformed by being partly squeezed or elongated. If the spacing between a position axis' ticks were squeezed or elongated, it would visually distort the data in the figure. Simply put, a linear graph would no longer appear linear (Fig. 3h, j). Therefore, altering any available scientifically derived colour map is not recommended. Additionally, avoiding certain types of graphs and plots is important to not alter the local perception of individual colours. Common heatmaps with directly connected colour tiles, as opposed to tiles with gaps in between, can alter individual colours significantly(Supplementary Fig. 3).

High-quality image set-up includes an orientation view showing the entire body or affected body part with the lesion's location obvious, a mid-distance view centered on the lesion with an anatomical landmark for orientation and size, and a close-up view that can be physically close (under 18 inches) using the camera's macro function or from farther away if using a zoom lens; ensure the lesion is in the center and fills most of the frame with some normal skin, include a scale or size comparison using a ruler, measuring tape, or a standard object like a pencil, paper clip, or US coin, and take as many pictures as necessary and send sharply focused, well-lit photos only because blurry pictures are not helpful.

### Drinking water advisory communication toolbox. updated 2013 [^5d8734f1]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Boil water advisory — household water preparation and disinfection steps include boiling instructions and bleach-based alternatives when boiling is not possible. For boiling, "Once the water reaches a rolling boil, let it boil for 1 minute". If you are unable to boil, the document states to "disinfect it instead" and to "Use unscented bleach (bleach that does not have an added scent)". For clear tap water, add "1/8 teaspoon (8 drops or about 0.75 milliliters)" of unscented household liquid bleach to "1 gallon (16 cups)" of water and "Mix well and wait 30 minutes or more before drinking". For cloudy water, first "Filter water using clean cloth", then add "1/4 teaspoon (16 drops or 1.5 milliliters)" per "1 gallon (16 cups)" and again "Mix well and wait 30 minutes or more before drinking". For container sanitation, make a sanitizing solution by mixing "1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of unscented household liquid bleach in 1 quart (32 ounces, 4 cups, or about 1 liter) of water" and "Pour this sanitizing solution into a clean storage container and shake well, making sure that the solution coats the entire inside of the container".

### The neural origin for asymmetric coding of surface color in the primate visual cortex [^80a4d6c4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Next, to compare the feedforward/feedback connectivity (e.g. from LGN to V1, V1 to V2 and V1 to V4) between the dominant color/polarity and the opponent color/polarity, we calculated the differences in the modulatory connections caused by the two colors in each color pair for the significant connections identified in Matrix A. Contrasts that exceeded the threshold (p < 0.05) are shown as solid lines in Fig. 4b–d. We found that red, blue, and black stimuli had stronger feedforward connections than green, blue, and white stimuli, respectively (Fig. 4e–g: red vs. green: LGN-V1: t = 4.09, p < 0.001; V1-V2: t = 5.41, p < 0.001; V1-V4: t = 4.72, p < 0.001; blue vs. yellow: LGN-V1: t = 3.05, p = 0.003; V1-V2: t = 4.25, p < 0.001; V1-V4: t = 5.41, p < 0.001; black vs. white: LGN-V1: t = 3.07, p = 0.002; V1-V2: t = 5.74, p < 0.001; V1-V4: t = 6.38, p < 0.001). These results demonstrated that functional connectivity from the LGN to V1 and then V1 to V2/V4 were more modulated by red, blue, and black than their paired colors (green, yellow, and white, respectively). Notably, we also looked into the modulatory effects evoked by stimuli on the feedback connections (i.e. V1-LGN and V2-V1), which were not significant in Matrix A (see Supplementary Fig. 9 for the results of all the connections). The differences in modulatory effects between red and green, blue and yellow, and black and white on feedback connections were minor or negative. Note that the negative difference indicated a stronger inhibitory feedback modulation effect evoked by red, blue, and black stimuli than by green, yellow, and white stimuli, respectively. In addition, red and black modulated the self-connections of the LGN and V1 more than green and white, indicating that the LGN and V1 were more sensitive to red and black than to green and white. Taken together, these results suggested a feedforward mechanism for the magnification of end-spectral bias in V1.

### Infants distinguish between two events based on their relative likelihood [^5747a7bc]. Child Development (2018). Low credibility.

Likelihood estimations are crucial for dealing with the uncertainty of life. Here, infants' sensitivity to the difference in likelihood between two events was investigated. Infants aged 6, 12, and 18 months (N = 75) were shown animated movies of a machine simultaneously drawing likely and unlikely samples from a box filled with different colored balls. In different trials, the difference in likelihood between the two samples was manipulated. The infants' looking patterns varied as a function of the magnitude of the difference in likelihood and were modulated by the number of items in the samples. Looking patterns showed qualitative similarities across age groups. This study demonstrates that infants' looking responses are sensitive to the magnitude of the difference in likelihood between two events.

Flow cytometer configuration — critical features include the laser source, mirrors, filters, and detectors, and 'A cytometer's configuration should be reported in all flow cytometry publications — at a minimum, the cytometer make and model (2)'. Laser counts vary from 'one to three lasers' to high-end analyzers with 'more than five lasers', and detectors are commonly photomultiplier tubes. One generally accepted protocol for photomultiplier tube voltage optimization is the stain index voltration method, and 'it is important to interact with individuals with flow cytometry expertise to ensure cytometry panels are designed appropriately for a given instrument's optical configuration'. Recommendation: 'Identify if the configuration of the flow cytometer is optimized for the flow cytometry panel and the experimental design. We recommend consulting with a flow cytometry core staff or an individual with the expertise to assist with panel design to ensure optimal pairing of fluorochromes/antibodies to the instrument's optical configuration'.
