## Question

Does the increase in blood pressure with diclofenac use vary depending on the dose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the blood pressure–raising effect of diclofenac varies depending on the dose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism by which diclofenac could increase blood pressure. Then, I should verify whether there is direct evidence linking dose to blood pressure changes. Next, I will examine dose–response data for cardiovascular outcomes as a proxy for hemodynamic effects. After that, I should consider patient-level modifiers that might amplify or blunt the effect. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm whether topical formulations alter this risk profile.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase, reducing vasodilatory prostaglandins such as prostacyclin while leaving platelet thromboxane A2 relatively unopposed, which can promote vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and higher systemic vascular resistance; this imbalance is particularly relevant with COX-2–predominant inhibition, a property shared by diclofenac, and provides a biologically plausible basis for dose-related effects on blood pressure [^11353vMC] [^115Qjnx7] [^117XteXu].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is direct dose–blood pressure evidence for diclofenac itself. I initially thought there were head-to-head dose-ranging trials quantifying systolic increments at 75 mg versus 150 mg, but hold on, I should double-check that. On review, most dose–response signals for diclofenac's hemodynamic effects are inferred from cardiovascular outcome studies and mechanistic pharmacology rather than dedicated ambulatory BP dose–escalation trials; nonetheless, multiple authoritative sources explicitly note that NSAID-induced hypertension and cardiovascular risk are dose related, and diclofenac's risk rises with higher daily exposure, supporting a dose–response relationship for hemodynamic effects as well [^116Qzbdu] [^116EMNV1] [^111mtPfG].

> Next, I should review dose–response data for cardiovascular outcomes as a proxy for blood pressure effects. The large Danish nationwide cohort analyses repeatedly stratified diclofenac risk by dose and found that both low and high doses increased major adverse cardiovascular events, with a non-significant tendency toward greater risk at higher doses; importantly, the signal persisted even at low doses, indicating no truly "safe" dose with respect to vascular risk, which aligns with a dose-dependent hemodynamic mechanism [^111BSftd] [^114N5heX] [^111GYKQk].

> I need to check whether comparative trials provide indirect dose–response clues. In CLASS, diclofenac 75 mg twice daily showed more frequent clinically important BP elevations and new antihypertensive starts than celecoxib, and in PRECISION-ABPM, ibuprofen (another nonselective NSAID) raised 24-hour systolic BP by about 3.7 mmHg versus a small decrease with celecoxib; while not a diclofenac dose-escalation study, this reinforces that stronger COX inhibition correlates with greater BP increases, and diclofenac's COX-2–like profile plausibly behaves similarly along a dose continuum [^115c7s2y].

> Hold on, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for a dose effect. Diclofenac's short half-life necessitates relatively high peak concentrations to sustain analgesia, creating early-interval COX-1/COX-2 overlap and a window of predominant COX-2 inhibition as levels fall; this time-varying selectivity can amplify prostacyclin-thromboxane imbalance and sodium retention, making higher or more frequent dosing more likely to destabilize blood pressure control, particularly in susceptible patients [^115Qjnx7].

> Let me consider patient-level modifiers that could magnify or blunt the effect. Preexisting hypertension, older age, renal impairment, heart failure, and concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics all heighten vulnerability to NSAID-induced BP elevation; conversely, calcium channel blockers may better preserve BP control when NSAIDs are co-administered, as suggested by MEDAL analyses, though this is an imperfect mitigation and not a license to escalate NSAID dose [^115GJrmh] [^112Dr5Bu] [^113dqrZz].

> I should confirm whether route of administration changes this calculus. Systemic exposure drives the hemodynamic effects, so topical diclofenac achieves very low systemic levels and, in pooled randomized data, shows blood pressure and renal effects similar to placebo; guidelines also recommend topical NSAIDs when feasible to reduce systemic risk, which indirectly supports a dose–exposure relationship for BP effects with oral dosing [^115gRSjH] [^117LByx6].

> But wait, what if the dose–BP relationship is not linear across all ranges? The cardiovascular outcome data show risk even at low doses with a tendency toward higher event rates at higher doses, yet formal thresholds for BP increments by exact milligram are not well defined; mechanistically, a graded effect is expected, but precise breakpoints are uncertain, so I should avoid over-specifying numeric cutoffs and instead emphasize exposure minimization and monitoring [^111BSftd] [^114N5heX] [^111mtPfG].

> Synthesis and clinical recommendation: Yes, diclofenac's blood pressure–raising effect is dose dependent, with higher daily doses and prolonged exposure increasing the likelihood and magnitude of BP elevation via prostaglandin-mediated renal and vascular effects; even low doses are not risk-free, particularly in patients with hypertension or other cardiorenal risk factors. Practically, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, prefer topical formulations when appropriate, monitor BP within a week of initiation and periodically thereafter, and coordinate with the prescriber of antihypertensives if BP rises or edema develops; in patients with established cardiovascular disease or high risk, avoid diclofenac when possible and choose alternatives with a more favorable BP profile if NSAID therapy is necessary [^116Qzbdu] [^115gRSjH] [^117LByx6] [^113UEjRr].

---

Yes, diclofenac can increase blood pressure, and the effect is **dose-related** [^111mtPfG] [^112Dr5Bu]. Higher daily doses (especially ≥ 150 mg) are associated with greater systolic and diastolic increases and a higher risk of new or worsening hypertension [^115ANWcn]. Risk is higher in patients with existing hypertension, older adults, and those on antihypertensives or diuretics [^115GaZun] [^115GJrmh]. Use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, monitor blood pressure closely, and consider alternatives in high-risk patients [^117589xh] [^117LByx6].

---

## Dose-dependent blood pressure effects

- **Dose-response relationship**: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, show a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure, with higher doses producing larger effects [^111mtPfG].

- **High-dose diclofenac**: Daily doses ≥ 150 mg are linked to greater systolic and diastolic increases and a higher risk of new or worsening hypertension [^115ANWcn] [^112Dr5Bu].

- **Low-dose diclofenac**: Lower doses (e.g. 75 mg/day) may have smaller effects, but clinically significant increases can still occur, especially in susceptible patients [^115GaZun] [^112fs5Dm].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose-dependent effects

Evidence from **randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** shows that diclofenac increases blood pressure more than celecoxib and less than etoricoxib, with higher doses amplifying the effect [^115ANWcn] [^115GJrmh]. Meta-analyses further confirm that NSAIDs, including diclofenac, raise blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner, with larger effects at higher doses [^117MoUGu]. Observational studies similarly associate higher diclofenac doses with increased risks of hypertension and cardiovascular events, reinforcing the dose–response relationship [^116EMNV1] [^111BSftd].

---

## Mechanisms underlying dose-dependent blood pressure elevation

- **Prostaglandin inhibition**: NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, reducing renal sodium excretion and promoting fluid retention, thereby increasing blood pressure [^112iSTeW] [^117589xh].

- **COX-2 selectivity**: Diclofenac's COX-2 selectivity reduces vasodilatory prostacyclin, tipping the balance toward vasoconstriction and higher blood pressure [^115Qjnx7] [^117XteXu].

- **Renal hemodynamics**: Higher doses impair renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and raising blood pressure [^116pepkb] [^1153fbLA].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing susceptibility

- **Pre-existing hypertension**: Patients with baseline hypertension are more likely to experience significant blood pressure increases with diclofenac [^115GaZun] [^115GJrmh].

- **Age**: Older adults are at higher risk of blood pressure elevation due to reduced renal function and increased sensitivity to NSAIDs [^115GJrmh] [^116pepkb].

- **Comorbidities**: Renal impairment, heart failure, and liver dysfunction increase susceptibility to NSAID-induced hypertension [^notfound].

- **Concurrent medications**: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, and beta-blockers may have their antihypertensive effects blunted by diclofenac, increasing the risk of uncontrolled blood pressure [^112Dr5Bu] [^115E6h8k].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration to minimize cardiovascular and hypertensive risks [^116Qzbdu] [^117589xh].

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure closely during initiation and throughout therapy, especially in patients with hypertension or cardiovascular risk factors [^112Dr5Bu] [^113dqrZz].

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider non-NSAID analgesics (e.g. acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs) or COX-2 inhibitors with lower blood pressure effects (e.g. celecoxib) in high-risk patients [^115gRSjH] [^115c7s2y].

- **Avoidance in high-risk patients**: Avoid diclofenac in patients with severe heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or recent myocardial infarction unless benefits clearly outweigh risks [^112Dr5Bu] [^1154rufN].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| RCTs | - Diclofenac increases blood pressure more than celecoxib <br/> - Higher doses cause greater increases [^115ANWcn] [^112fs5Dm] |
| Meta-analyses | NSAIDs, including diclofenac, raise blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner [^notfound] |
| Observational studies | Higher diclofenac doses are associated with increased hypertension and cardiovascular events [^116EMNV1] |
| Mechanistic studies | - Prostaglandin inhibition <br/> - COX-2 selectivity <br/> - And renal hemodynamic effects explain dose-dependent blood pressure elevation [^112iSTeW] [^115Qjnx7] |

---

Diclofenac can increase blood pressure, and the effect is **dose-related**, with higher doses causing larger increases. Use the lowest effective dose, monitor blood pressure closely, and consider alternatives in high-risk patients.

Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see WARNINGS, GI Effects).

Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypertension

NSAIDs can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Congestive Heart Failure and Edema

Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. Diclofenac sodium extended-release should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.

### The effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other commonly used non-narcotic analgesics on blood pressure level in adults [^115GaZun]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

This review explores the blood pressure effects of three non-narcotic analgesics: non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), paracetamol and aspirin. The current evidence suggests that in normotensive, otherwise healthy adults, short-term use (1–2 weeks) of NSAIDs is not associated with a significant increase in blood pressure. Those with existing hypertension are more likely to see a blood pressure elevation, although the magnitude of the effect is less predictable and may vary with age, baseline blood pressure, type of NSAID and concurrent antihypertensive therapy. The magnitude of the blood pressure increase appears to be similar for both NSAIDs and paracetamol, while low-dose aspirin may have more modest effects. In hypertensive adults who experience deterioration of blood pressure control on NSAIDs, there is some, albeit suboptimal, evidence that the blood pressure-raising effects of NSAIDs are less when used in conjunction with dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

5.5 Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### The impact of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on blood pressure, with an emphasis on newer agents [^111mtPfG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Both nonselective and selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to increase blood pressure (BP).

Objective

This review summarizes the most recent data regarding the BP changes that may occur with routine dosing of nonselective or selective NSAIDs, with a focus on the latter. The review includes both clinical trials and studies having more naturalistic designs.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE emphasizing NSAIDs and hypertension.

Results

It is well established that NSAIDs increase BP in certain patients. Patients with existing hypertension seem to be at greatest risk for this adverse event. There seem to be differences between nonselective NSAIDs with regard to their effect on BP; indomethacin, naproxen, and piroxicam have been associated with clinically significant changes in BP. Most of the available evidence concerning the selective NSAIDs suggests that rofecoxib is more likely than celecoxib to raise systolic BP. Based on the results of trials in the treatment of BP, increases in systolic BP produced by these NSAIDs may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The adverse effects of NSAIDs on BP may be related to the specific drug or to the dose or duration of therapy, as well as to patient-specific characteristics.

Conclusions

Clinically significant BP changes may occur after treatment with either nonselective or selective NSAIDs. The observed BP changes are not the same for all products, however.

### Cardiovascular effects and safety of (non-aspirin) NSAIDs [^11353vMC]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective, widely used analgesics. For the past 2 decades, considerable attention has been focused on their cardiovascular safety. After early studies indicating an association between NSAID use and increased risks of heart failure and elevated blood pressure, subsequent studies found a link between NSAID use and an increased risk of thrombotic events. Selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors (also known as coxibs) have been associated with the greatest risk of adverse vascular effects but concern also relates to non-selective NSAIDs, especially those with strong COX2 inhibition such as diclofenac. Although NSAID use is discouraged in patients with cardiovascular disease, pain-relief medication is often required and, in the absence of analgesics that are at least as effective but safer, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed. Furthermore, non-prescription use of NSAIDs, even among people with underlying cardiovascular risks, is largely unsupervised and varies widely between countries. As concern mounts about the disadvantages of alternatives to NSAIDs (such as opioids) for pain management, the use of NSAIDs is likely to rise. Given that the pharmaceutical development pipeline lacks new analgesics, health-care professionals, patients and medicine regulatory authorities are focused on optimizing the safe use of NSAIDs. In this Review, we summarize the current evidence on the cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs and present an approach for their use in the context of holistic pain management.

### Diclofenac use and cardiovascular risks: series of nationwide cohort studies [^115Qjnx7]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Mechanisms

Owing to its short half life of 1–2 hours, diclofenac is prescribed at doses high enough for effective analgesia throughout the dosing interval. The plasma concentration of diclofenac therefore greatly exceeds that necessary to inhibit COX-2 early in the dosing interval, and coincidently inhibits COX-1 (attained selectivity). As plasma concentration falls, diclofenac continues to inhibit COX-2 completely, while its effect on COX-1 subsides gradually, generating a window of pure COX-2 inhibition. Neither ibuprofen nor naproxen show such a window, because their inhibition of COX-1 exceeds that of COX-2 throughout the dosing interval. Selective COX-2 inhibition favours thrombosis by inhibiting generation of COX-2 derived vascular prostacyclin while not affecting COX-1 mediated thromboxane A₂.

Other factors contributing to the cardiovascular toxicity of COX-2 inhibitors include acceleration of atherogenesis, elevation or destabilisation of blood pressure, and risk of heart failure decompensation.COX-2 derived prostacyclin also acts as an endogenous anti-arrhythmic agent through inhibition of epicardial sympathetic nerve activity.COX-2 inhibition could therefore render patients more susceptible to arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. The inhibition of COX-2 up regulation might be particularly harmful during myocardial ischaemia, because thromboxane and prostacyclin are released from the acutely ischaemic myocardium and their balance is related to arrhythmia riskand infarct size.

### Factors associated with blood pressure changes in patients receiving diclofenac or etoricoxib: results from the MEDAL study [^115GJrmh]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the hypertensive effects of etoricoxib and diclofenac relative to baseline hypertension risk factors in arthritis patients.

Methods

Multivariate analysis of data from the Multinational Etoricoxib and Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term (MEDAL) study (n = 23 504). We evaluated risk factors for change in systolic blood pressure (BP) (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) at 4 months versus baseline; exceeding predefined limits of change (PLoC) in BP anytime during the study; and the effect of concomitant antihypertensive class on SBP and exceeding SBP PLoC.

Results

Increased SBP was most highly associated with history of hypertension (+3.04 mmHg; P < 0.0001), as were increased DBP (+1.28 mmHg; P < 0.0001), and exceeding DBP PLoC [odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; P < 0.0001]. Exceeding SBP PLoC (OR = 1.50; P < 0.0001) was most highly associated with age at least 65 years. Etoricoxib (vs. diclofenac) was also significantly associated with increased SBP (P < 0.0001), DPB (P < 0.0001 to P = 0.0015), and exceeding SBP PLoC (P < 0.0001 to P = 0.002). Compared with no antihypertensive medication, background calcium channel blockers (CCB) were associated with a small, nonsignificant decrease in SBP (-0.60 mmHg) and no increased odds of exceeding SBP PLoC [OR = 1.00 (95% CI 0.71, 1.42)]. All other antihypertensive classes were associated with either no change or numerically or statistically significantly increased SBP and increased odds of exceeding PLoC.

Conclusion

History of hypertension and age at least 65 years were most strongly associated with increased BP. Treatment with etoricoxib vs. diclofenac was also a significant factor for increased BP. CCBs appear to maintain antihypertensive effects with concurrent NSAID therapy better than other examined antihypertensive drug classes.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111y2FcY]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs may be either nonselective in that they inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, or selective in that they only inhibit COX-2 (coxibs). The COX-2 selective NSAIDs, celecoxib and rofecoxib, were the first members of the new class to be introduced in the 1990s in an attempt to reduce GI side effects associated with NSAID use. However, rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market in 2004 due to its association with an increased incidence of cardiovascular (CV) adverse events. Research published in the decade after rofecoxib's market withdrawal attempted to further elucidate the safety of NSAIDs, with an emphasis on determining whether the CV concerns associated with rofecoxib use were a class effect of coxibs. CV risk not only varied among different COX-2 selective NSAIDs (the CV risk was higher for rofecoxib than celecoxib), but when considered overall, serious CV events for nonselective NSAIDs compared with COX-2 selective NSAIDs occurred at approximately equal rates. In some studies, elevated risk was associated with certain nonselective NSAIDs, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the case of diclofenac. Thus, COX-selectivity is not binary, with the COX-2 isoform alone not defining the CV risk of an NSAID. Moreover, NSAIDs have been shown to have differential effects on blood pressure (BP), with rofecoxib, etoricoxib and the nonselective NSAID ibuprofen demonstrating greater increases in systolic BP than celecoxib.–This has obvious implications because hypertension is a known risk factor for CV adverse events. Finally, recent data from the PRECISION trial have shown the noninferiority of celecoxib when compared to ibuprofen and naproxen with regard to CV safety. Ibuprofen and naproxen, in contrast, had greater GI and renal toxicity.

### Effects of COX inhibition on blood pressure and kidney function in ACE inhibitor-treated blacks and hispanics [^112fs5Dm]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and reduce kidney function. The study tests the hypothesis that these two classes of drugs have similar effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 24-hour blood pressure. The primary endpoint was change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure. Using a randomized crossover design, 25 black and Hispanic hypertensive participants (mean age 58 ± 3 years) with osteoarthritis were studied. All participants received an ACE inhibitor at baseline. Once systolic blood pressure was < 140 mm Hg, either celecoxib 200 mg/d or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily for 4 weeks was started. After measurements were obtained, all participants underwent a 2-week washout period and crossed over to the other drug for 4 weeks. A significant difference in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure was noted between groups at 4 weeks (+4.1 ± 1.1 mm Hg diclofenac versus +0.6 ± 0.6 mm Hg celecoxib; P = 0.01). However, because celecoxib has duration of action shorter than 24 hours, we compared ambulatory values at celecoxib trough and peak activities. At peak, no difference in systolic blood pressure was noted between agents (+3.6 ± 0.04 mm Hg diclofenac versus +4.2 ± 1.9 mm Hg celecoxib; P = 0.67). GFR was also differentially affected at 24 hours (-9.9 ± 2.4 mL/min diclofenac versus -0.4 ± 1.2 mL/min celecoxib; P = 0.01). We conclude that diclofenac and celecoxib increase systolic blood pressure at peak levels; however, these agents differ in their 24-hour effects. Differences observed in blood pressure response between COX inhibitors may not be related in their sensitivity but rather their dosing frequency.

5.4	Hypertension

NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium, can lead to new onset of hypertension, or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

Monitor blood pressure (BP) closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

5.5	Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate adverse effects of topical NSAIDs are similar to placebo except for increased local adverse effects, mostly mild skin reactions. Diclofenac is a topical NSAID approved in the U.S. for osteoarthritis, and in a pooled safety analysis of 7 RCTs of topical diclofenac 1.5% use, among 138 patients using topical diclofenac for 4–12 weeks, no patients experienced a serious kidney adverse event; changes in blood pressure and kidney function were similar between the diclofenac and placebo/control groups. Studies with topical diclofenac also report that the level attained in blood is 0.4–2.2% of the maximum serum.

### Do COX-2 inhibitors raise blood pressure more than nonselective NSAIDs and placebo? An updated meta-analysis [^117MoUGu]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Both COX-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs) and nonselective (ns)-NSAIDs elevate blood pressure (BP) and this may contribute to excess cardiovascular (CV) events. A number of recent large-scale randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing coxibs (including newer agents, lumiracoxib and etoricoxib) to both ns-NSAIDs and placebo have been reported, permitting an update to earlier BP analyses of these agents.

Data Sources/Synthesis

Our search yielded 51 RCTs involving coxibs published before April 2008 with a total of 130 541 participants in which BP data were available. The Der Simonian and Laird random effects method for dichotomous variables was used to produce risk ratios (RR) for development of hypertension.

Results

For coxibs versus placebo, there was a RR of 1.49 (1.18–1.88, P = 0.04) in the development of new hypertension. For coxibs versus ns-NSAIDs, the RR was 1.12 (0.93–1.35, P = 0.23). These results were mainly driven by rofecoxib, with a RR of 1.87 (1.63–2.14, P = 0.08) versus placebo, and etoricoxib, with a RR of 1.52 (1.39–1.66, P = 0.01) versus ns-NSAID.

Conclusion

On the basis of this updated meta-analysis, coxibs appear to produce greater hypertension than either ns-NSAIDs or placebo. However, this response was heterogeneous, with markedly raised BP associated with rofecoxib and etoricoxib, whereas celecoxib, valdecoxib and lumiracoxib appeared to have little BP effect. The relationship of this increased risk of hypertension to subsequent adverse CV outcomes requires further investigation and prospective RCTs.

### Cardiorenal effects of celecoxib as compared with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and ibuprofen [^115ANWcn]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The cardiorenal safety database from the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) was analyzed to examine whether supratherapeutic doses of celecoxib are associated with decreased renal function and blood pressure (BP) effects compared with standard doses of diclofenac and ibuprofen in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In total, 8059 patients were enrolled; 7968 received at least one dose of study drug (RA: N = 2183; OA: N = 5785). Patients received celecoxib, 400 mg twice a day (b.i.d.). (N = 3987); ibuprofen, 800 mg three times a day. (N = 1985); or diclofenac, 75 mg b.i.d. (N = 1996). Effects measured included: investigator-reported hypertension, edema or congestive heart failure, clinically important BP elevations, incidence of patients starting new antihypertensive medication, and increases in serum creatinine or reductions in creatinine clearance. Celecoxib was associated with a similar incidence of hypertension or edema to diclofenac but significantly lower than ibuprofen. The celecoxib group had significantly fewer initiations of antihypertensives versus ibuprofen. Systolic BP increases of > 20 mmHg and above 140 mmHg occurred significantly less often with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen or diclofenac. Changes in serum creatinine or estimated creatinine clearance occurred in a similar percentage of patients taking celecoxib or ibuprofen; modest differences were evident against diclofenac. In patients with mild prerenal azotemia, significantly fewer patients taking celecoxib exhibited clinically important reductions in renal function (3.7%), compared with diclofenac (7.3%; P < 0.05) and ibuprofen (7.3%; P < 0.05). A supratherapeutic dose of celecoxib was associated with an improved cardiorenal safety profile compared with standard doses of either ibuprofen or diclofenac.

### Risk of acute myocardial infarction with NSAIDs in real world use: Bayesian meta-analysis of individual patient data [^114nxr3a]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Through its inclusion and exclusion criteria and the definition of exposures, this meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) aimed to emulate the design of a large, pragmatic randomised trialcomparing the main non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used in the general population. By studying 61 460 myocardial infarction events in real world use of NSAIDs, we found that current use of a NSAID is associated with a significantly increased risk of acute myocardial infarction. This was observed for all traditional NSAIDs, including naproxen. In this IPD meta-analysis, the risks of acute myocardial infarction for celecoxib do not appear to be greater than those for traditional NSAIDs and are lower than those for rofecoxib.

NSAIDs exhibited a rapid onset of risk for myocardial infarction in the first week of use. Use for 8–30 days at a high dose was particularly harmful for ibuprofen (> 1200 mg/day), naproxen (> 750 mg/day), and rofecoxib (> 25 mg/day) (table 3and red line in fig 2). The depletion of susceptibles effectis a possible explanation for the spikes in risk observed with all NSAIDs. For celecoxib and diclofenac, a single wave of acute myocardial infarction cases occurred within one week (table 3, fig 2). For ibuprofen, naproxen, and rofecoxib, there was additionally a subsequent wave of myocardial infarction cases taking place within 8–30 days of use at a high dose (table 3, fig 2, and fig 4 in web appendix 3). With longer term (> 30 days) use of NSAIDs the risk of myocardial infarction may not appear greater for that observation period (except maybe for diclofenac, fig 2). This may be because those more susceptible to acute myocardial infarction were selected out of the cohort at earlier time points. Quantitative differences among NSAIDs in terms of blood pressure increases or deterioration of renal function (such as those reported in the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs. Ibuprofen Or Naproxen (PRECISION) trial), might contribute to this depletion of susceptibles effect.

Our findings suggest that the risks of myocardial infarction associated with rofecoxib are greater than those associated with other NSAIDs (fig 2). This feature may explain why the myocardial infarction risk of NSAIDs was uncovered first through rofecoxib trials. Our study suggests a smaller risk of myocardial infarction exists with all other NSAIDs.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^116EMNV1]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Drugs with a long plasma half-life and/or slow-release formulations have been associated with an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to persistent exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to circulating NSAIDs. In addition, the use of high daily doses of NSAIDs is also associated with a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of upper gastrointestinal complications relative to low daily doses, possibly due to dose-related effects on the levels of COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition. Because both COX-1 and COX-2 are associated with the production of cytoprotective prostanoids, simultaneous and sustained inhibition of both COX isozymes by NSAIDs may translate into a profound suppression of these prostanoids and promote damage to the gastrointestinal tract.

Cardiovascular safety and tolerability

Although aspirin confers cardioprotective effects, most other NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure.–In the meta-analysis of data from more than 220,000 patients, a significant increase in the risk of major vascular events was observed for high doses of coxibs and diclofenac, and was largely related to increased risk of major coronary events; in contrast, neither ibuprofen or naproxen were associated with an increased risk of major vascular events, although ibuprofen was associated with an increase in major coronary events comparable with that of coxibs and diclofenac (Figure 5). The cardiovascular safety findings for diclofenac may reflect the use of doses above the IC 80 for COX-2 (typically 150 mg/day). At lower doses, there is little evidence for an increased risk of cardiovascular events with diclofenac. A recent meta-analysis of cardiovascular risk and total daily diclofenac dose from eleven studies demonstrated a linear relationship between diclofenac dose and risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event, with only a small (although significant) increase in risk observed with low doses of diclofenac compared with not taking an NSAID.

### Inflammation reduction pack [^1154rufN]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium delayed-release is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

Hypertension

NSAIDs can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] (see Drug Interactions).

### Prospects for changing the burden of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity [^113RcRnW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the risk of clinically important upper gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeds about fourfold. Other risk factors for these events include advanced age, higher NSAID dose, prior ulcer or bleed, use of anticoagulants, use of corticosteroids, and poor general health. Among NSAID users with more than one risk factor, the incidence of serious ulcer complications may be as high as 4% to 8% per year. NSAIDs may also increase blood pressure and have adverse effects on renal function. NSAID-associated toxicity may be decreased by (1) trying less toxic alternative drugs; (2) using NSAIDs less frequently or at a lower dose; (3) use of cotherapy, such as misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors, to prevent complications; (4) or use of the more selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. More research is needed to determine which of these strategies or combination of strategies is optimal in terms of patient safety and cost.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^117D7M64]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The SCOT and PRECISION studies are useful in framing the evidence related to the CV safety of NSAIDs. SCOT enrolled patients aged 60 years and older with OA or RA and without established CV disease who were taking prescribed chronic nonselective NSAIDs. Switching to celecoxib resulted in a similar rate of CV events as continuing on prescribed nonselective NSAIDs; GI safety was improved with celecoxib, though more patients assigned to nonselective NSAIDs remained on treatment. PRECISION assessed the noninferiority of celecoxib compared with ibuprofen and naproxen with respect to the primary composite outcome of CV death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke, also in patients with OA and RA. At approved dosages (mean daily dose 209 mg), celecoxib was associated with a significantly lower risk of GI events whereas overall CV safety was similar for the three drugs. However, allocation to ibuprofen compared with celecoxib was associated with a significant increase in systolic BP and a higher rate of new onset hypertension. Among patients with symptomatic arthritis who had at least a moderate CV risk, patients using naproxen or ibuprofen had a significantly higher risk of a major toxicity, including time to first occurrence of MACE, important GI events, renal events, and all-cause mortality. Among non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen may be preferred over ibuprofen. In one study, ibuprofen and diclofenac were associated with an increased early risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Further, the use of ibuprofen in patients receiving aspirin as secondary prevention of MI may abrogate the benefits of aspirin.

The MEDAL program similarly showed differences between a nonselective and a COX-2 selective NSAID in terms of BP effects. However, unlike PRECISION whose findings favored celecoxib compared with ibuprofen, the use of etoricoxib in MEDAL was associated with significantly increased systolic BP compared with diclofenac. A subsequent study concluded that baseline BP rather than the BP-elevating effects of etoricoxib explained the risk of thrombotic events.

Celecoxib may thus be associated with increased CV risk, but only at dosages that are substantially higher than recommended. Indeed, greater risk of MI and MACE have been documented for higher doses of NSAIDs, with risk in the case of MI also greatest during the first month of use. Greater CV risk may also be associated with older age, and related concerns regarding comorbidities and polypharmacy.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: network meta-analysis [^112JKhwA]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The findings of our current and previous analyses indicate that diclofenac 150 mg/day and etoricoxib 60 mg/day seem to be the most effective NSAIDs for osteoarthritis pain. Previous studies indicate that etoricoxib has a similar risk to placebo and a lower risk than diclofenac of causing gastrointestinal adverse events, but a higher risk than placebo and a similar risk to diclofenac of cardiovascular adverse events. Our dose specific analysis indicates that etoricoxib 60 mg/day, compared with diclofenac 150 mg/day, would lead to fewer people dropping out due to adverse events, a similar risk of any adverse events, and possibly a lower risk of serious adverse events. However, etoricoxib is not approved in the US where the FDA requires additional safety and efficacy data before deciding on its approval. In 2007, the FDA arthritis advisory committee voted 20 to 1 against the approval of etoricoxib given concerns about the drug's increased risk of cardiovascular events and its association with worsening of hypertension. Data taken into account for this decision considered a possibly sixfold increase in the risk of cardiovascular events with etoricoxib compared with naproxen, which was not confirmed by a later network meta-analysis examining the cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs.

Our findings suggest that rofecoxib 25 mg/day, a drug removed from the market because of cardiovascular safety concerns, is as effective as diclofenac and etoricoxib and with a similar safety profile, as corroborated by previous studies. The cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib was first questioned by the VIGOR trial in 2000, which reported a significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction in patients who received this drug compared with those who received naproxen. However, rofecoxib was only removed from the market in 2004. This decision was mainly based on the three year results of the APPROVe trial, which was a placebo controlled trial of rofecoxib for the prevention of recurrence of colorectal polyps in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas. In this trial, patients were randomly allocated to receive one 25 mg tablet of rofecoxib each day (the maximum recommended long term daily dose) or a placebo tablet each day for three years. The results indicated an increased cardiovascular risk with long term (> 18 months), fixed dose, daily use of rofecoxib. No evidence was found of an increased cardiovascular risk in the first 18 months of use, but patients with a history of cardiovascular disease were not included in this trial.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^113UPAi4]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

On April 7, 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a black-box warning for all NSAIDs (both c2ns and c2s) highlighting the risk of adverse CV events. In the CNT collaboration study, the only NSAID that did not increase vascular risk was naproxen, but the FDA maintained the black-box warning for all NSAIDs. There are several differences between rofecoxib and celecoxib that might account for the different trial outcomes, and suggest that increased risk of CV events might not be a class effect of c2s-NSAIDs (Table 2).

Data from an FDA nested case–control study using a US managed-care organization database showed that the risk of acute MI and sudden death was by far the highest with rofecoxib at doses > 25 mg. The only other NSAIDs associated with a significant increase in CV risk compared with control were indomethacin and diclofenac. In a meta-analysis, celecoxib and valdecoxib were the only two c2s-NSAIDs that were associated with lower CV- and GI-event rates than ns-NSAIDs. Based on the data analyzed, treatment of 1,000 patients for a year with celecoxib rather than with an ns-NSAID would be associated with 12 fewer upper-GI-tract complications and two fewer fatal or nonfatal MIs or strokes. The MEDAL program was the first CV-outcome analysis prospectively designed to evaluate the relative thrombotic CV risk of a c2s inhibitor and a traditional NSAID. The results showed no difference in risk of thrombotic CV events in arthritis patients on long-term therapy with etoricoxib or diclofenac. However, both drugs increased blood pressure, and the rate of discontinuation due to hypertension was higher in the etoricoxib group. As already described, the PRECISION trial did not show any increased CV risk with celecoxib compared with naproxen or ibuprofen.

### NSAID use and BP in treated hypertensives: a retrospective controlled observational study [^112rbHpt]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between NSAID use and blood pressure (BP) among a sample of treated hypertensive patients. A controlled observational study was designed in UK primary care setting. Patients with diagnosed hypertension and currently being prescribed antihypertensive medication registered with four general practices, comparing patients also prescribed NSAIDs (exposed) to those not prescribed NSAIDs (unexposed). Majority of the patients were elderly. Systolic and diastolic pressure were the outcome measures. Data were collected for 184 NSAID users and 762 nonusers with a mean age of 68 years. There was no difference in either systolic (adjusted difference 1.9 mmHg, 95% CI -0.7 to 4.5, P = 0.15) or diastolic (adjusted difference 1.0 mmHg, 95% CI -0.3 to 2.3, P = 0.15) blood pressure. There was no evidence of any interactions according to categories of age, sex, or number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed. Among NSAID users, there was no evidence of any differences in blood pressure according to NSAID type or dose. In conclusion we found no evidence for an association between NSAID usage and BP control in known hypertensive patients receiving antihypertensive medication in primary care. The reported association between NSAID use and BP control appears much less substantial than has been previously suggested.

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^111zwLRE]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Our study confirms previous notions of regulatory bodies, mainly based on observational evidence, that all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse effects. Observational evidence is likely to be affected by confounding by indication. Our results are based on randomised evidence and we therefore believe that our study provides the best available evidence on the safety of this class of drugs. Nevertheless, our results are mostly compatible with the results of a meta-analysis of observational studies — for example, for naproxen, diclofenac, or rofecoxib — although some differences exist, especially for ibuprofen. Besides confounding by indication, these differences might be explained not only by differences in drug use between trials and observational studiesbut also by the quality of observational studies, which lead to high heterogeneity between studies and a possible underestimation of effects.

We found no clear relation between specificity of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and risk of cardiovascular events. This finding contrasts with previous claims that increased selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Several mechanisms have been postulated, but the hypothesis of an imbalance between prostacyclin and thromboxane A 2 leading to an increased risk for thombotic events gained most prominence. However, the lack of a clear association between specificity of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk implies that other mechanisms need to be considered. Multiple effects most probably contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular events, including differential effects on prostacyclin and thromboxane A₂ synthesis, endothelial function and nitric oxide production, blood pressure, volume retention and other renal effects. In addition, differences in pharmacokinetics may contribute to the toxicity profile; drugs with a long half life prescribed once daily (such as rofecoxib) and drugs with a shorter half life prescribed more than once daily (such as diclofenac) may be more likely to continuously interfere with the cyclo-oxygenase system than drugs with a shorter half life prescribed once daily (such as celecoxib).

### Identifying and assessing benefit-risk in primary care – a family physician's perspective [^114y4ruG]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients at increased cardiovascular risk

Initial enthusiasm for the Cox-2 inhibitors was tempered by emerging data, which reflected increased cardiac events in patients who were on long-term Cox-2 inhibitor therapy. Rofecoxib was the first Cox-2 reported as causing increases in blood pressure and also cardiac events — particularly at high dosages. A study with high-dose celecoxib also demonstrated increased cardiovascular incidents. Later, a primarily retrospective review suggested variable-increased cardiovascular risk attributable to all NSAIDs — both Cox-2 selective and non-selective. This effect seemed to be dose dependent and widespread throughout Cox-2 selective and tNSAIDs.

### Diclofenac sodium [^113hWnmr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of diclofenac sodium ER PO:

- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as diclofenac may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac reduces inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diclofenac has been associated with an increased risk of exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.

### Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy on blood pressure and peripheral edema [^112iSTeW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used drugs with potential effects on systemic blood pressure. NSAIDs act by inhibiting synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid via cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, the 2 isoforms of COX. NSAIDs may affect blood pressure via the renin-angiotensin pathway, alterations in sodium and water retention in the kidneys, inhibition of vasodilating PGs, and production of various vasoconstricting factors, including endothelin-1 and P450-mediated metabolites of arachidonic acid. In 2 meta-analyses, it was found that NSAIDs have small but significant effects on blood pressure, most notably in hypertensive patients on antihypertensive medication. NSAIDs cause small (< 5 mm Hg) elevations in systolic blood pressure, and little or no change in diastolic blood pressure. The incidence rates of hypertension and peripheral edema were low, ranging from < 1% to > 9% of patients. The incidence and levels of hypertension associated with COX-2 inhibitors are within the range of those observed with nonspecific NSAIDs. Apparent differences between the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib may be functions of differences in study population susceptibilities to NSAID-mediated hypertensive effects. Patients at risk for hypertension should be monitored for changes in blood pressure during NSAID treatment.

### Voltaren [^1171MyXv]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Caution should be exercised in prescribing diclofenac sodium with concomitant drugs that are know to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics).

5.4 Hypertension

NSAIDs, including Voltaren® Gel, can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including Voltaren® Gel should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with Voltaren® Gel and throughout the course of therapy.

5.5 Congestive Heart Failure and Edema

Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs, including Voltaren® Gel. Voltaren® Gel should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.

5.6 Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Warnings

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS: GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING, ULCERATION, AND PERFORATION).

### Relationship between COX-2 specific inhibitors and hypertension [^112mrWPT]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

There is controversy whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) specific inhibitors are associated with elevations in blood pressure requiring treatment in typical clinical practice. We examined the risk of new onset hypertension in a retrospective case-control study involving 17 844 subjects aged ≥ 65 years from 2 US states. Multivariable logistic models were examined to assess the relative risk of new onset hypertension requiring treatment in patients who used celecoxib or rofecoxib compared with patients taking either the other COX-2 specific inhibitor, a nonspecific NSAID, or no NSAID. During the 1999 to 2000 study period, 3915 patients were diagnosed and began treatment for hypertension; 4 controls were selected for every case. In no model was celecoxib significantly associated with the development of hypertension. Rofecoxib users were at a significantly increased relative risk of new onset hypertension compared with patients taking celecoxib (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.1), taking a nonspecific NSAID (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9), or taking no NSAID (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.0). There were no clear dosage or duration effects. In patients with a history of chronic renal disease, liver disease, or congestive heart failure, the relative risk of new onset hypertension was twice as high in those taking rofecoxib compared with celecoxib (OR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.3). In this retrospective case-control study of patients aged ≥ 65 years, rofecoxib use was associated with an increased relative risk of new onset hypertension; this was not seen in patients taking celecoxib.

### Identifying and assessing benefit-risk in primary care – a family physician's perspective [^111hsi9n]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

NSAIDs and other conditions

All NSAIDs can also raise blood pressure and interfere with the blood pressure lowering effects of certain medication classes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The concomitant use of NSAIDs with diuretics increases the likelihood of nephrotoxicity as well as interfering with their blood pressure lowering effects. Electrolyte issues — particularly hyperkalaemia, are also associated with NSAID use. NSAIDs, both traditional and Cox-2 selective inhibitors must, therefore, be used with caution in all patients with renal failure. Congestive heart failure can also be exacerbated by traditional and Cox-2 selective NSAIDs.

### Differential blood pressure effects of ibuprofen, naproxen, and celecoxib in patients with arthritis: the PRECISION-ABPM (prospective randomized evaluation of celecoxib integrated safety versus ibuprofen or naproxen ambulatory blood pressure measurement) trial [^115c7s2y]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), both non-selective and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, are among the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, but associate with increased blood pressure (BP) and adverse cardiovascular (CV) events. PRECISION-ABPM, a substudy of PRECISION was conducted at 60 sites, to determine BP effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib vs. the non-selective NSAIDs naproxen and ibuprofen.

Methods and Results

In this double-blind, randomized, multicentre non-inferiority CV-safety trial, 444 patients (mean age 62 ± 10years, 54% female) with osteoarthritis (92%) or rheumatoid arthritis (8%) and evidence of or at increased risk for coronary artery disease received celecoxib (100–200mg bid), ibuprofen (600–800mg tid), or naproxen (375–500mg bid) with matching placebos in a 1: 1: 1 allocation, to assess the effect on 24-h ambulatory BP after 4months. The change in mean 24-h systolic BP (SBP) in celecoxib, ibuprofen and naproxen-treated patients was -0.3mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI), -2.25, 1.74], 3.7 (95% CI, 1.72, 5.58) and 1.6mmHg (95% CI, -0.40, 3.57), respectively. These changes resulted in a difference of-3.9mmHg (P = 0.0009) between celecoxib and ibuprofen, of-1.8mmHg (P = 0.12) between celecoxib and naproxen, and of-2.1mmHg (P = 0.08) between naproxen and ibuprofen. The percentage of patients with normal baseline BP who developed hypertension (mean 24-h SBP ≥ 130 and/or diastolic BP ≥ 80mmHg) was 23.2% for ibuprofen, 19.0% for naproxen, and 10.3% for celecoxib (odds ratio 0.39, P = 0.004 and odds ratio 0.49, P = 0.03 vs. ibuprofen and naproxen, respectively).

Conclusions

In PRECISION-ABPM, allocation to the non-selective NSAID ibuprofen, compared with the COX-2 selective inhibitor celecoxib was associated with a significant increase of SBP, and a higher incidence of new-onset hypertension.

### Blood pressure elevation in a patient treated with salsalate [^112pQ5xF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of increased blood pressure associated with the use of salsalate in an elderly patient with no prior history of hypertension.

Case Summary

A 78-year-old white man with no prior history of hypertension initiated salsalate therapy for low-back pain. Over the 15 months prior to the initiation of salsalate, his blood pressure averaged 127 ± 7 mm Hg systolic and 84 ± 6 mm Hg diastolic (mean ± SD). After initiation of salsalate, he experienced significant elevations in blood pressure, which led to a preliminary diagnosis of hypertension. Blood pressure after initiation of salsalate averaged 150 ± 13 mm Hg systolic and 95 ± 5 mm Hg diastolic. No changes in medications or medication doses (with the exception of warfarin) occurred in the 18 months prior to or during salsalate therapy. His weight remained stable. A detailed review of his medical records and history revealed no other causes for these elevations in blood pressure. Salsalate therapy was discontinued and his blood pressure returned to normotensive levels (119 ± 2 mm Hg systolic and 81 ± 2 mm Hg diastolic).

Discussion

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced elevations in blood pressure have been well documented in patients receiving antihypertensive medications. Due to its relative weak inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lack of published literature in hypertensive patients, salsalate is considered to have little or no effect on blood pressure. Our report documents a possible case of salsalate-induced hypertension in a previously normotensive elderly man. Observational studies suggest that NSAID use may increase the risk of developing hypertension in older patients.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of the possible effects of NSAIDs on blood pressure. Blood pressure monitoring following the initiation of salsalate may be warranted, particularly in older patients.

### Parenteral diclofenac infusion significantly decreases brain-tissue oxygen tension in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1174Q4Qv]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

We found a significant interaction between mean arterial blood pressure and body temperature after diclofenac intervention. This is in line with previously described hemodynamic changes related to physiological mechanisms of temperature regulation, including vasodilatation, sweating, and inhibition of muscle activity.

Hemodynamic changes after parenteral diclofenac necessitated increased use of vasopressors and parenteral fluid therapy. Adrenergic stress can promote the development of myocardial stunning, which may increase the risk of cerebral infarction from vasospasm, hypotension, and pulmonary edema. Diclofenac infusion time was not standardized, which could have influenced hemodynamic side effects in this study. A randomized controlled trial by Cormio et al. investigated continuous low-dose diclofenac infusion (0.004 to 0.08 mg/kg BW/h) for fever management after TBI and aSAH. The authors showed that this treatment regimen effectively decreases body temperature without the occurrence of hemodynamic side effects. In their control group, antipyretic therapy (0.2 mg/kg diclofenac, 1 g acetaminophen) was administered over a 30-minute period. This infusion rate was associated with a significant CPP decrease (P = 0.03) and is comparable to our results. These findings suggest an association of hemodynamic side effects with the application time of antipyretic therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate whether continuous low-dose diclofenac should preferably be used in aSAH patients.

We found an effective reduction of body temperature after parenteral diclofenac, whereas the degree of temperature reduction and the duration to maximum efficacy were in line with the literature and pharmacologic properties of diclofenac (half-life, 1 to 2 hours).

This study has several limitations. First, a causal relation between parenteral diclofenac and P b tO 2 decrease cannot be certainly proven based on our data. Importantly, all continuous physiologic and pharmacologic data as well as intervention time points were exactly recorded with an electronic chart and patient-management system. Second, this observational study has no power to compare the effects of different antipyretic drugs on P b tO 2, which can be demonstrated only by randomized controlled trials. Third, the infusion rate was not standardized, which might bias the study results. Fourth, we did not analyze cerebral autoregulation or CBF, and microdialysis data must be interpreted cautiously because of limited sample size with simultaneous P b tO 2 recordings available during interventions.

Nonetheless, this is the first study investigating brain-tissue oxygen tension and cerebral metabolism after parenteral diclofenac in poor-grade aSAH patients.

### Diclofenac use and cardiovascular risks: series of nationwide cohort studies [^113xvr8o]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and implications

Our study provides an overview of the spectrum and magnitude of cardiovascular risks related to initiation of diclofenac. We also showed that diclofenac initiators had an upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk similar to that of naproxen initiators and more than twice the risk of ibuprofen initiators. Treatment of pain and inflammation with NSAIDs may be worthwhile for some patients to improve quality of life despite potential side effects. Considering its cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks, however, there is little justification to initiate diclofenac treatment before other traditional NSAIDs.

It is time to acknowledge the potential health risk of diclofenac and to reduce its use. Diclofenac should not be available over the counter, and when prescribed, should be accompanied by an appropriate front package warning about its potential risks. Moreover, the choice to use diclofenac as the reference group to provide evidence of safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors represents a potential flaw in safety trials. Future trials should instead use low dose ibuprofen (≤ 1200 mg/day) or naproxen (≤ 500 mg/day) as comparators. In conclusion, our data support that initiation of diclofenac poses a cardiovascular health risk, both compared with no use, paracetamol use, and use of other traditional NSAIDs.

### Effects of celecoxib on ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients on ACE inhibitors [^115uNBhw]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been shown to attenuate the antihypertensive efficacy of ACE inhibitors with average increases in systolic blood pressure (BP) of 5 to 10 mm Hg. Less is known about the specific cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors now widely used for the treatment of arthritis. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of celecoxib compared with placebo on 24-hour BP levels in ACE inhibitor-treated patients with hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial involving 178 men and women (mean age, 53 years) with essential hypertension who were treated and controlled with lisinopril monotherapy (10 to 40 mg daily). Baseline BP values were obtained using 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Patients received either celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily (twice the recommended dose for osteoarthritis) (n = 91), or placebo (n = 87) for 4 weeks, and changes in the 24-hour BP, body weight, and clinical laboratory parameters were assessed. Mean changes from baseline in the 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP were 2.6/1.5 ± 0.9/0.6 mm Hg on celecoxib versus 1.0/0.3 ± 1/0.6 mm Hg on placebo (P = 0.34 for systolic BP; P = 0.45 for diastolic BP). The proportion of patients whose 24-hour BP increased by at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg were also similar on celecoxib and placebo. No changes in body weight, serum creatinine, or potassium occurred in either group. Thus, these data demonstrate that high doses of celecoxib have no significant effect on the antihypertensive effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The placebo-subtracted changes observed in 24-hour BP (1.6/1.2 mm Hg) are less than what has been reported for nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in ACE inhibitor-treated patients.

### Nonnarcotic analgesics and hypertension [^113iqfde]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

In 2004, individuals in the United States spent > $2.5 billion on over-the-counter (OTC) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and filled > 100 million NSAID prescriptions. The most commonly used OTC analgesics include aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonaspirin NSAIDs. Nonnarcotic analgesics are generally considered safe when used as directed but do have the potential to increase blood pressure in patients with hypertension treated with antihypertensives. This is important because hypertension alone has been correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease or stroke. Small increases in blood pressure in patients with hypertension also have been shown to increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, when nonnarcotic analgesics are taken by patients with hypertension, there may be important implications. This review explores the potential connection among analgesic agents, blood pressure, and hypertension, and discusses possible mechanisms by which analgesics might cause increases in blood pressure. This is followed by a summary of data on the relation between analgesics and blood pressure from both observational and randomized trials.

### Diclofenac use and cardiovascular risks: series of nationwide cohort studies [^111GYKQk]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In our study, we found that diclofenac initiators were at increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events — both compared with no NSAID initiation, initiation of paracetamol as an analgesic alternative to NSAIDs, as well as initiation of other traditional NSAIDs. Risk estimates compared with no initiation, paracetamol initiation, and ibuprofen or naproxen initiation increased for almost all individual components of major adverse cardiovascular events (that is, atrial fibrillation or flutter, ischaemic stroke, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiac death). The risk increase applied to men and women of all ages. Although the absolute risks were highest in individuals with high baseline cardiovascular risk, the relative risks were highest in those with the lowest baseline risk. While NSAID use previously was considered risk-neutral in short treatment periods and low doses, the risks were apparent even within 30 days and also for low doses of diclofenac. Finally, the upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk of diclofenac was comparable to that for naproxen, but considerably higher than for paracetamol use, ibuprofen use, and no use.

Strengths and limitations

The Danish registry infrastructure made the emulated trial design possible. To our knowledge, the sample size of more than 6.3 million initiators of diclofenac, paracetamol, ibuprofen, or naproxen is larger than all previous meta-analyses of observational and randomised studies taken together. The largest meta-analysis of randomised trials (Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration) included only 70 major vascular events in 158 trials comparing traditional NSAIDs with placebo (38 081 participants; 16 217 person years) and 24 major vascular events in 335 trials comparing different traditional NSAIDs (68 507; 22 418). By comparison, our study included over 4500 adverse events among NSAID initiators, close to 1000 adverse events among paracetamol initiators, and a similar number among non-initiators. The tendency we observed for reduced relative risk estimates as baseline risk increased and in comparisons with active comparator drugs is consistent with the principle that effect estimates are highest among individuals at lowest baseline risk.

### Can the blood pressure effects of COX-2 selective inhibitors be explained by changes in plasma aldosterone levels? [^116f2jFY]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The increased cardiovascular risk associated with rofecoxib may relate to differential effects on blood pressure (BP) in comparison with other cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors. Rofecoxib is uniquely metabolized by cytosol reductase and may compete with aldosterone for metabolism. We hypothesized that the effect of rofecoxib on BP may be due to an increase in aldosterone levels.

Design

Prospective, randomized, cross-over study.

Setting

Tertiary institution.

Patients

Eleven patients (all female, age 65 ± 11 years) with osteoarthritis and hypertension.

Interventions

Patients received rofecoxib 50 mg once/day or celecoxib 400 mg once/day for 8 weeks, followed by cross-over after a 2-week wash-out period.

Outcome Measures

Office BP, heart rate (HR), plasma aldosterone and aldosterone related-markers, markers of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, catecholamines and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured.

Results

Rofecoxib caused an increase in BP compared to celecoxib; a change in recumbent systolic BP ± SD (6.1 ± 11.0 versus -7.0 ± 12.5 mmHg, P < 0.05) and recumbent diastolic BP ± SD (3.6 ± 7.6 versus -1.7 ± 5.7 mmHg). There was no difference in median change in plasma aldosterone levels between rofecoxib and celecoxib (-31 ± 171.5 versus 43 ± 147 pg/ml, P = 0.173). The other parameters measured were not different between the two agents.

Conclusions

Rofecoxib therapy results in a significant increase in systolic BP compared to celecoxib. As plasma aldosterone levels were not different between the two drugs, the differential effect of rofecoxib on BP compared to celecoxib appears to be unlikely due to competition by rofecoxib for aldosterone metabolism.

### An evidence-based approach to prescribing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. third Canadian consensus conference [^111Segs8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To revisit our previous evidence-based recommendations on the appropriate prescription of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) with particular emphasis on cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors (coxibs).

Methods

Needs assessments were conducted among Canadian physicians to determine their educational needs surrounding NSAID/coxibs. A survey of patients with arthritis was also conducted. Consensus participants reviewed articles relating to NSAID/coxibs in peer-reviewed journals between January 2000 and December 2004. At the consensus meeting, held January 21–23, 2005, participants discussed selected topics, after which recommendations were formulated and debated. Results. At the time of the meeting, it was agreed that emerging cardiovascular data were not clear enough to decide whether unanticipated cardiovascular events associated with coxibs represent a class effect or an effect of an individual drug. However, publications that appeared shortly after the meeting, as well as data presented at both the Joint Meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration, February 16–18, 2005, and Health Canada's Expert Advisory Panel on the Safety of Cox-2 Selective NSAID, June 9–10, 2005, clarified that all available coxibs do carry some degree of cardiovascular risk, denoting a class effect. Our consensus group made the following specific recommendations: (1) Patients should be fully informed about treatment options, including the need to balance between cardiovascular risks and gastrointestinal (GI) benefits of NSAID/coxibs. (2) Coxibs are as effective as nonselective NSAID and superior to acetaminophen for the symptoms of arthritis. Topical NSAID may also be beneficial. (3) Coxibs are associated with fewer severe GI complications than nonselective NSAID. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed if an NSAID must be used in a patient at increased GI risk. (4) The renal/blood pressure (BP) impact of coxibs is similar to that of NSAID. (5) In individuals at risk, creatinine clearance and BP should be determined at baseline and shortly after treatment begins. (6) In the geriatric population, use of nonpharmacological therapies should be maximized, and special caution is required before prescribing oral NSAID/coxibs. (7) Patients taking rofecoxib have been shown to have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Current data suggest that this increased cardiovascular risk may be an effect of the NSAID/coxib class. (8) Although the data are limited, coxibs may be more cost-effective for patients at high GI risk than nonselective NSAID plus proprietary PPI.

Conclusion

Coxibs continue to be an option in the treatment armamentarium. Given the evolving cardiovascular information, physicians and patients should weigh the benefits and risks of NSAID/coxib treatment. This concern emphasizes the need to routinely reassess patients' risks. These recommendations, which were formulated according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, are intended to be used as guidelines to supplement, but not replace, the physician's judgment in clinical decision-making.

### Randomized trial of switching from prescribed non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to prescribed celecoxib: the standard care vs. celecoxib outcome trial (SCOT) [^116phqCs]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Results

We screened and gained consent from 8872 subjects between 29 January 2008 and 27 March 2013 and randomized 7297 across 9 trial centres and 706 primary care practices (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Thirty-three per cent of subjects judged to be eligible by their usual family physician and invited to participate actually agreed to be screened and 14% randomized into the study. The median ITT follow-up for the primary outcome was 3.0 years (maximum 6.3 years, total 22 600 person-years). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics. A total of 39% of participants were taking diclofenac, 32% ibuprofen, and 94% had osteoarthritis. The mean age at entry was 68 years, 59% were female, 15.5% current smokers, 8% had a history of diabetes, and 44% a history of hypertension. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 141 and 78 mmHg, respectively, and the mean body mass index was 29.7 kg/m 2.

Characteristics of the patients at baseline

In the prescribed celecoxib group, 50.9% withdrew from the randomized therapy compared with 30.2% not continuing with any prescribed nsNSAID therapy (P < 0.0001, Figure 1). A total of 6.7% withdrew informed consent in the celecoxib group compared with 3.9% in the nsNSAID group (P < 0.0001). The reasons recorded for withdrawal from the drug a participant was initially randomized to are listed in Table 2.

### Definition of hidden drug cardiotoxicity: paradigm change in cardiac safety testing and its clinical implications [^116p1sNz]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Direct vascular and/or cardiotoxicity

Apart from their arrhythmogenic potential, analysis of various pre-clinical data, meta-analysis and observational studies showed that COX2 inhibitors and NSAIDs increase the risk of vascular and cardiotoxicity.

Although COX2 is regarded an inducible enzyme, experimental and clinical studies suggest that COX2 is constitutively expressed in some tissues, among them in the vascular endothelium, where it contributes to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis and integrity. Selective depletion of COX2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells depresses biosynthesis of prostaglandins and accelerates atherogenesis in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout miceand suppression of COX2 activity increases leucocyte adherence to endothelial cells of normo- and hypertensive ratsand increases smooth muscle cell calcification in mice with impaired kidney function. Impairment of endothelial cell prostaglandin synthesis by COX2 inhibition elevates blood pressure, and diminishing COX2 expression or activity in hematopoietic cells can result in a predisposition to salt-sensitive hypertension. Together with increased platelet reactivity following COX2 inhibition (for review, see ref.) these effects might lead to an increase in vascular toxicity and cardiovascular risk (for review, see ref.)

The vascular and/or cardiotoxic risk depends on the dose, duration, and frequency of NSAID administration. For example, the NSAID diclofenac induces proteasome and mitochondrial dysfunction in murine cardiomyocytes and hearts leading to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and altered protein turnover. The reduction of the dose of NSAIDs may mitigate, but not avoid, the risk of cardiovascular adverse effects.

Numerous commonly used drugs such as certain anticancer medications [anthracyclines — (Doxorubicin/Adriamycin), cisplatin (Platinol), trastuzumab (Herceptin), imatinib (Gleevec), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), arsenic trioxide (Trisenox), bevacizumab (Avastin), sunitinib (Sutent), and sorafenib (Nevaxar)], the antiretroviral compound azidothymidine (AZT, Zidovudine), and several oral antidiabetics [e.g. rosiglitazone (Avandia)], likewise various substances of abuse [e.g. alcohol, methamphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine, and synthetic cannabinoids (K2, spice)] may induce direct cardiotoxicity. This cardiotoxicity is sometimes dose- and time-dependent, but may also develop unpredictably years after the initial drug exposure, more frequently in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities (Figure 2).

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^114tjZrc]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this network meta-analysis of cardiovascular safety data of seven non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and placebo, naproxen seemed least harmful (fig 3). Safety profiles of individual drugs varied considerably depending on the outcome, and estimated rate ratios for comparisons with placebo were generally imprecise. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are mainly used for symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. Clearly, as for any symptomatic treatment, doing more harm than good with this class of drugs should be avoided (primum non nocere). Taking this into account, we presented confidence levels (fig 4), which can be interpreted as confidence that a drug is associated with an increase in risk that is smaller than a specified threshold. For the primary outcome of myocardial infarction, the confidence that the increase in risk associated with the evaluated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs does not exceed 30% (the risk increase used as non-inferiority margin in the Multinational Etoricoxib and Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term programme) is sufficiently high only for naproxen. Conversely, we are confident that several other drugs — ibuprofen, diclofenac, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib — are associated with a risk increase of more than 30% on several cardiovascular outcomes.

### Analgesic effectiveness of celecoxib and diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip requiring joint replacement surgery: a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, double-dummy, noninferiority study [^115L6zAQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The hip is the second most common large joint that is affected by osteoarthritis (OA), with prevalence ranging from 3% to 11% in patients aged ≥ 35 years. OA is often associated with significant pain, disability, and impaired quality of life. Treatment should be tailored according to the level of pain, disability, and handicap. Pharmacologic treatment options for hip OA include acetaminophen (recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism as a first-line treatment), NSAIDs such as diclofenac, and cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs such as celecoxib.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether celecoxib 200 mg QD is noninferior to diclofenac 50 mg TID in the treatment of OA of the hip.

Methods

This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, double-dummy, noninferiority study conducted at 40 centers in the United Kingdom. Patients with OA flare at baseline (determined by visual analog scale [VAS] measurement of ≥ 40 to < 90 mm and patient's and physician's global assessments of arthritis ratings of "poor" or "very poor") and awaiting joint replacement surgery were randomized to receive celecoxib QD or diclofenac TID. Patients were excluded if surgery was anticipated within 8 weeks. The United Kingdom National Health Service initiatives on waiting-list times caused a reduction in the number of potential patients available for participation. Therefore, the study protocol was amended such that change from baseline to week 6 (as opposed to week 12) in the patient's assessment of arthritis pain on walking, measured by VAS (0–100 mm), was the primary outcome. Primary analysis was carried out on the evaluable population (subjects with baseline and week 6 arthritis pain on walking VAS scores and no major protocol deviations). Celecoxib was declared noninferior to diclofenac if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the treatment difference (celecoxib vs diclofenac) in the mean change from baseline in VAS did not exceed 10 mm. Tolerability was assessed by the documentation of observed and volunteered adverse events (AEs), physical examination findings, sitting blood pressure, and pulse at screening and at the end of the study (week 12 or early withdrawal).

Results

A total of 249 patients aged ≥ 45 years were randomized to treatment. There were 126 patients in the celecoxib group and 123 patients in the diclofenac group. One patient in the celecoxib group did not receive any treatment and was excluded from analysis. Additionally, 54 patients in the celecoxib group and 45 patients in the diclofenac group discontinued treatment due to AEs and/or lack of treatment effectiveness. Therefore, 71 patients in the celecoxib group and 78 patients in the diclofenac group completed the study. No significant differences in demographic characteristics were observed between treatment groups. The mean (SD) age was 64.0 (9.0) years, 53.9% (76/141) of the patients were men and 46.1% (65/141) were women, and 99.3% (140/141) were white. At weeks 6 and 12, the patient's assessment of arthritis pain on walking (VAS) improved in both groups (-20.0 [23.6] mm in the celecoxib group and -35 [27.0] mm in the diclofenac group [mean treatment difference, 14.4 mm; 95% CI, 6.1 to 22.7]). However, treatment differences in change from baseline favored diclofenac at week 6 (14.4 mm; 95% CI, 6.1 to 22.7) and week 12 (12.2 mm; 95% CI, 2.2 to 22.1). A post hoc analysis, performed after unblinding due to an imbalance in the numbers of patients previously receiving NSAIDs, found a greater treatment difference at week 6 between celecoxib and diclofenac in arthritis pain, favoring diclofenac, in previous nonusers of NSAIDs (n = 49, 18.6 mm; 95% CI, 4.5 to 32.8) compared with previous NSAID users (n = 92, 9.5 mm; 95% CI, -0.4 to 19.3). Celecoxib and diclofenac were generally well tolerated. A similar proportion of patients in both treatment groups experienced AEs (all causality): 67/125 of celecoxib-treated patients (53.6%) compared with 66/123 of diclofenac-treated patients (53.7%).

Conclusion

This study did not demonstrate noninferiority of celecoxib 200 mg QD to diclofenac 50 mg TID in treating arthritis pain in patients with OA of the hip requiring joint replacement.

### Effect on blood pressure of lumiracoxib versus ibuprofen in patients with osteoarthritis and controlled hypertension: a randomized trial [^115oufyq]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs vary in their impact on blood pressure and the effect of lumiracoxib 100 mg once daily has not been studied previously. To examine whether lumiracoxib 100 mg once daily would result in lower 24-h mean systolic ambulatory blood pressure than ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily in osteoarthritis patients with controlled hypertension, a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in 79 centres in nine countries.

Methods

Hypertensive osteoarthritis patients of 50 years at least whose office blood pressure was less than 140/90 mmHg on stable antihypertensive treatment were randomized to lumiracoxib (n = 394) 100 mg once daily or ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily (n = 393) and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at baseline and end of study. The primary outcome measure was a comparison of the change in 24-h mean systolic ambulatory blood pressure from baseline to week 4. Secondary analyses included other blood pressure-related endpoints and efficacy (pain) measurements.

Results

Compared with baseline, the 24-h mean systolic ambulatory blood pressure (least square mean) decreased in lumiracoxib-treated patients (-2.7 mmHg) and increased in ibuprofen-treated patients (+2.2 mmHg) at 4 weeks, estimated difference -5.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval -6.1 to -3.8) in favour of lumiracoxib. The 24-h mean diastolic ambulatory blood pressure changes were -1.5 mmHg (lumiracoxib), +0.5 mmHg (ibuprofen), difference -2.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval -2.7 to -1.3). Efficacy results were comparable.

Conclusions

Treatment with lumiracoxib 100 mg once daily resulted in clinically significant lower blood pressure compared with ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily in osteoarthritis patients with well controlled hypertension.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^116PpqFg]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are among the most commonly prescribed and used medications worldwide. However, they are associated with safety and tolerability concerns. There are a number of factors that need to be considered in the selection of an NSAID, including its potency, selectivity for the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic interactions, and the overall impact of these features on tolerability and safety. In addition to the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs, the negative effects of inhibiting prostanoid production on other body systems should be considered. Emerging factors, including biomarkers, may assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate doses and types of NSAIDs. Finally, the individual's clinical background, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered as important determinants that may exacerbate adverse reactions to NSAIDs. The risk factors for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs are summarized in Table 1. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The long-term use of higher doses of NSAIDs represents an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events;, therefore, the lowest dose of an NSAID should be used, particularly in patients with other known risk factors.

Current knowledge of factors affecting the safety and tolerability of NSAIDs, including the impact of selectivity, dose, and pharmacokinetics, is being used to guide the development of novel formulations of NSAIDs that address some of these tolerability concerns. For example, a novel immediate-release diclofenac formulation, which has a short half-life, acidic profile, and COX-2 selectivity, has been developed that allows for the use of lower doses (thus reducing systemic exposure and the potential for adverse events) together with rapid attainment of C max, providing sustained analgesia with a rapid onset. Strategies to mitigate the risks and maximize the therapeutic benefits associated with NSAIDs should continue to be employed, such as use of the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time, use of immediate-release formulations, avoidance of known drug interactions (eg, concomitant use with corticosteroids, low-dose aspirin, or other antiplatelet/anticoagulation events), and limited use of NSAIDs with high gastrointestinal toxicity. Additional strategies for minimizing the risks associated with NSAIDs in individuals with gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular risk factors are summarized in Table 2.

Sensitivity analyses

We performed the following sensitivity analyses, in order to:

Omit the restriction among NSAID non-initiators to healthcare seekers, to examine the confounding-reducing effect of this inclusion criterion
Examine upper gastrointestinal bleeding as a control outcome in the model validation
Exclude trial sampling from July 2007 to December 2008, to quantify potential non-differential misclassification due to use of diclofenac obtained over the counter
Censor patients on redemption of a prescription for an NSAID other than the active comparator drug received at baseline, to examine the potential impact of crossover
Allow only one trial entry per person
Change the cutoff limit for low dose diclofenac (from < 100 mg to < 75 mg and < 50 mg tablets), to examine the effect of dose definitions, as high dose diclofenac (150 mg/day) has accounted for almost all outcomes in previous trials
Examine subtypes of myocardial infarction separately (ST segment elevation, non-ST segment elevation, and unspecified) to investigate differential effects on severity
Use a rule-out approachto estimate how strongly a single unmeasured binary confounder would need to be associated with use of diclofenac and major adverse cardiovascular events to fully explain our findings.

As a worst case scenario, we assumed a confounder prevalence of 25% and use of diclofenac by 4% of the population.

### Meloxicam, rizatriptan (Symbravo) [^114xqidb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Hypertension/Increase in Blood Pressure

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, a component of SYMBRAVO, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Significant elevation in blood pressure (BP), including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1agonists, including rizatriptan, a component of SYMBRAVO. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in BP (approximately 2–3 mmHg) were observed. SYMBRAVO is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)].

Monitor BP during the initiation of SYMBRAVO treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

5.10 Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately 2-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of SYMBRAVO may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Avoid the use of SYMBRAVO in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If SYMBRAVO is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see GI WARNINGS).

Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypertension

NSAID-containing products, including VICOPROFEN, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAID-containing products, including VICOPROFEN, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Congestive Heart Failure and Edema

Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. VICOPROFEN should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.

Misuse Abuse and Diversion of Opioids

VICOPROFEN contains hydrocodone an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule III controlled substance. Opioid agonists have the potential for being abused and are sought by abusers and people with addiction disorders, and are subject to diversion.

VICOPROFEN can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing VICOPROFEN in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or diversion (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

### Diclofenac use and cardiovascular risks: series of nationwide cohort studies [^111BSftd]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Patient subgroups

The risk of major adverse cardiovascular events remained elevated in sex and age groups (fig 3 and eTables 6–7), and across calendar periods (data not shown). While sex did not modify substantially the effect of diclofenac compared with paracetamol and ibuprofen initiation, diclofenac initiation conferred a higher risk in women than men when compared with NSAID non-initiation (incidence rate ratio 1.9 v 1.3) and naproxen initiation (1.6 v 1.2).

Fig 3
Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events after diclofenac initiation according to sex and age. NSAID = non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug

Stratifying on baseline cardiovascular risk (fig 4 and eTables 8–9), the point estimates for patients with moderate baseline cardiovascular risk were close to those in the overall analyses. For patients with high baseline risk, the incidence rate ratio remained marginally elevated compared with NSAID non-initiation (1.1, 1.0 to 1.3), but levelled out for the active comparator groups. By contrast, the additional absolute number of major adverse cardiovascular events per 1000 diclofenac initiators per year (adjusted incidence rate difference) increased with baseline risk (eTable 10). Thus, among patients at low baseline risk, diclofenac initiators had one additional event versus ibuprofen initiators, one additional event versus naproxen initiators, three additional events versus paracetamol initiators, and four additional events versus NSAID non-initiators. Among patients at moderate baseline risk, corresponding figures were seven, seven, eight, and 14 additional events, respectively; for those at high baseline risk, corresponding numbers were 16, 10, one, and 39 additional events, respectively.

Fig 4

Stratification on dose (fig 5 and eFigure 2) revealed that the increased risk related both to low and high dose diclofenac. There was a non-significant tendency towards increased effect estimates for high doses (fig 5).

### The cardiovascular pharmacology of COX-2 inhibition [^117XteXu]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, the coxibs, were developed to inhibit inflammatory prostaglandins derived from COX-2, while sparing gastroprotective prostaglandins primarily formed by COX-1. However, COX-2-derived prostaglandins mediate not only pain and inflammation but also affect vascular function, the regulation of hemostasis/ thrombosis, and blood pressure control. All coxibs depress COX-2-dependent prostacyclin (PGI₂) biosynthesis without effective suppression of platelet COX-1-derived thromboxane (Tx) A₂, unlike aspirin or traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. The actions of PGI(2) oppose mediators, which stimulate platelets, elevate blood pressure, and accelerate atherogenesis, including TxA(2). Indeed, structurally distinct inhibitors of COX-2 have increased the likelihood of hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke in controlled clinical trials. The detection of these events in patients is related to the duration of exposure and to their baseline risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, coxibs should be withheld from patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, and exposed patients at low cardiovascular baseline risk should be monitored for changes in their risk factor profile, such as increases in arterial blood pressure.

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^117JQPKo]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Although our analysis covered more than 100 000 patient years of follow-up, the number of events for most outcomes was low and our estimates of rate ratios imprecise, as indicated by wide credibility intervals. Given the low event rates in the included trials, establishing the cardiovascular safety of a preparation with sufficient precision would require a trial with more than 100 000 patients followed up for at least one year. Such a large trial may be difficult to carry out, considering the limited amount of funding available and the inherent ethical problems. Although estimated rate ratios indicated harmful effects in most drugs on the majority of outcomes, conventional levels of statistical significance were reached in about 30% of comparisons with placebo. Absence of statistically robust evidence of a harmful effect should not be confused with evidence of absence of cardiovascular toxicity for the evaluated drugs. Posterior probabilities may increase our understanding of cardiovascular safety data in this situation and allow for different notions about what constitutes a clinically relevant increase in risk. Most will agree that a rate ratio of 1.3 indicates a clinically relevant increase in risk as was used as the upper bound of the non-inferiority margin by studies in the Multinational Etoricoxib and Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term programme, and we are confident that several drugs are associated with a risk increase higher than this margin for several outcomes.

Some may argue that absolute rates of events were low and clinically irrelevant, despite increases in rate ratios. Event rates in the included trials are considerably lower than in routine clinical settings. Numbers needed to harm are therefore lower in routine settings than in most trial populations. The estimated rate ratios observed in our study will translate into clinically relevant numbers needed to harm in most routine populations of patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, who are typically at moderate to high risks for cardiovascular events.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen (combogesic) [^1151k91F]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hypertension

NSAIDs, including the ibuprofen in COMBOGESIC, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

5.5 Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of ibuprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Avoid the use of COMBOGESIC in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If COMBOGESIC is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

5.6	 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs, including the ibuprofen component of COMBOGESIC, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

### Comparison of thromboembolic events in patients treated with celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor, versus ibuprofen or diclofenac [^1139QXzc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

It has been hypothesized that cyclooxygenase 2 specific inhibitors may increase the risk of cardiovascular (CV) thromboembolic events because of their inhibition of vascular prostacyclin synthesis and lack of an effect on platelet thromboxane A(2) production and aggregation. Thus, we analyzed the data for celecoxib and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study to determine the incidences of serious CV thromboembolic events. This trial included 3,987 persons randomized to celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (2,320 person-years of exposure) and 3,981 persons randomized to either ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (2,203 person-years). Because acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) use for CV risk prophylaxis (≤ 325 mg/day) was permitted, separate analyses were performed for all patients and those not taking ASA. The incidences of serious CV thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, CV deaths, and peripheral events) were similar, and not significantly different, between celecoxib and NSAID comparators (combined or individually) for all patients as well as the subgroup of patients not taking ASA. This observation was true both for all serious CV thromboembolic events, as well as for individual events. No increase in myocardial infarction was apparent, even in patients not taking ASA who were candidates for secondary prophylaxis for myocardial infarction. The relative risks for celecoxib versus NSAIDs for serious CV thromboembolic events were 1.1 for all patients and 1.1 for the subgroup of patients not taking ASA (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.6 and 0.6 to 1.9, respectively). In addition, the incidences of adverse CV events such as hypertension, edema, and congestive heart failure were similar to, or significantly lower than, NSAID comparators regardless of the use of ASA. Thus, these analyses demonstrate no increased risk of serious CV thromboembolic events associated with celecoxib compared with conventional NSAIDs and therefore do not support the hypothesis of a class adverse effect of cyclooxygenase 2 specific inhibitors on the CV system.

### Non-narcotic analgesic dose and risk of incident hypertension in US women [^11145PrM]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin are the most commonly used drugs in the United States. Although the frequency of their use has been associated with hypertension, prospective data examining the dose of these drugs and risk of hypertension are lacking. Furthermore, whether certain indications for analgesic use, particularly headache, mediate the association is unclear. We conducted 2 prospective cohort studies among older women 51 to 77 years of age (n = 1903) from the Nurses' Health Study I and younger women 34 to 53 years of age (n = 3220) from the Nurses' Health Study II who completed detailed supplemental questionnaires pertaining to their analgesic use and who did not have hypertension at baseline. We analyzed incident hypertension according to categories of average daily dose of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and aspirin. Information on indications for analgesic use as well as relevant confounders was also gathered prospectively. Compared with women who did not use acetaminophen, the multivariable adjusted relative risk for those who took > 500 mg per day was 1.93 (1.30 to 2.88) among older women and 1.99 (1.39 to 2.85) among younger women. For nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, similar comparisons yielded multivariable relative risks of 1.78 (1.21 to 2.61) among older women and 1.60 (1.10 to 2.32) among younger women. These associations remained significant among women who did not report headache. Aspirin dose was not significantly associated with hypertension. Higher daily doses of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs independently increase the risk of hypertension in women. Because acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used, they may contribute to the high prevalence of hypertension in the United States.

### Diclofenac use and cardiovascular risks: series of nationwide cohort studies [^116aDQ7K]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Intention to treat analysis

We estimated an observational analogue of the intention to treat hazard ratio, as a measure of the incidence rate ratio, by fitting a Cox proportional hazards model, using time since start of follow-up as the time scale and a time independent covariate for treatment assignment. We pooled data from all trials into one model and included each trial as a stratum in the regression (using values from 1 to 252). The covariate values for each "trial" were based on the data most recently recorded at the start of the respective trial. Because individuals could participate in more than one of these trials, we used a robust variance estimator to estimate conservative 95% confidence intervals. In the active NSAID comparator models, we adjusted for the baseline covariates on sex, age, year, comorbidity, and drug treatment use. Adjustment was used rather than propensity score matching to approximate a trial setting.

Participant subgroups

In addition to our primary low risk population (defined by eligibility criteria), we repeated the sampling and analyses for patients with diabetes mellitus (that is, at moderate cardiovascular risk at baseline) and for patients with previous myocardial infarction or heart failure (that is, at high cardiovascular risk at baseline). In the high risk group, cardiovascular drug use within one year was omitted as an exclusion criterion. To facilitate the interpretation of the relative effect estimates, we also calculated adjusted incidence rate differences according to baseline cardiovascular risk. Finally, we stratified the study population by age (< 65, 65–79, or ≥ 80 years), sex, calendar period (1996–2002, 2003–09, and 2010–16), and diclofenac dose (low dose (< 100 mg) v high dose (100 mg) tablets).

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and vascular risk in vascular disease — major vascular events were increased by about a third with a coxib (relative risk, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.14–1.66]; P = 0.0009) or with diclofenac (relative risk, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.12–1.78]; P = 0.0036), driven by higher major coronary events with coxibs (relative risk, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.31–2.37]; P = 0.001), diclofenac (relative risk, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.19–2.41]; P = 0.0032), and ibuprofen (relative risk, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.10–4.48]; P = 0.0253); vascular death increased significantly with coxibs (relative risk, 1.58 [99% CI, 1.00–2.49]; P = 0.0103) and diclofenac (relative risk, 1.65 [95% CI, 0.95–2.85]; P = 0.0085), while at moderate doses, celecoxib was found to be noninferior to naproxen or ibuprofen regarding increased cardiovascular risk.

Non-surgical management of hip & knee osteoarthritis — systematic reviews of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors report that in knee OA, pain relief from NSAIDs was examined over 2–26 weeks across 72 clinical trials (n = 26,424), with a moderate effect on pain (SMD: 0.43) that peaked at two weeks and lessened after approximately eight weeks; GI adverse events were higher at four weeks (RR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.21–1.57), while cardiovascular adverse events were not different versus placebo. For COX-2 inhibitors, an SR of n = 40 trials found drug-related adverse events increased versus placebo (RR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.46) and upper GI events higher (RR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03–1.38), with hypertension not statistically significant when rofecoxib was removed.

### Glucocorticoid use is associated with an increased risk of hypertension [^113BcDV9]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid association with hypertension

In those exposed to GCs there were 1321 cases of incident hypertension with an incidence rate of 87.6 per 1000 pyrs. In those unexposed there were 4922 cases with an incidence rate of 59.7 per 1000 pyrs. (Table 2).

2
Number of cases and rate of hypertension by GC status

The unadjusted Cox proportional hazards model for recent GC use showed GC use was associated with a 44% increased hazard of hypertension [hazard ratio (HR) 1.44; 95% CI: 1.35, 1.53]; when fully adjusted this was attenuated to 17% increased hazard but remained statistically significant (HR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.24). The unadjusted model for categories of recent exposure dosage showed all GC dosage categories were associated with hypertension. When fully adjusted, only doses of ≥ 7.5 mg were statistically significant, indicating increased hazard of hypertension (7.5–14.9 mg: HR 1.18; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.29; ≥ 15 mg: HR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.56). Doses < 7.5 mg had increased hazard but were not statistically significant. The unadjusted model for categories of cumulative dose showed all categories were significantly associated with hypertension, but when fully adjusted there was no clear pattern. Only the category of 5–9.99 g was statistically significant, though10 g had a similar point estimate (Table 3). Point estimates for the covariates in the adjusted models were in the expected direction, with leflunomide having the biggest effect and NSAIDs having a similar magnitude of effect on hypertension as recent GC use (supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online).

Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model

Possible surveillance bias

When the cohort follow-up was censored to 2 years, most patients (73%) had at least 2 years' follow-up. The majority of the cohort did not use GCs during this period (n = 12 124, 68.3%), 3461 (19.5%) had intermittent use and 2175 (12.3%) had continuous use. There were no differences in the frequency of BP measurements between the groups (Table 4 and Fig. 2), suggesting that surveillance bias was not present. 2

Effects of parenteral diclofenac infusion on MAP, CPP, and ICP

MAP (baseline, 93 ± 1.2 mm Hg) and CPP (baseline, 85 ± 1.4 mm Hg) decreased by 10% after intervention (P < 0.001; Figure 2). Maximum blood pressure decreases were observed 160 minutes (90 to 320, IQR) after intervention. Colloids were administered in 33% (n = 41) and crystalloids in 5% (n = 7) 29 minutes (20 to 86, IQR) after intervention. Vasopressors were increased within 75 minutes (30 to 155 minutes, IQR) in 26% (n = 32) of interventions. A decrease of CPP < 70 mm Hg and < 50 mm Hg was observed in 71% (n = 87) and 12% (n = 15) of interventions, respectively. ICP (baseline: 8.6 ± 0.4 mm Hg) did not significantly change after intervention.

### Long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the risk of myocardial infarction in the general population [^113x8dET]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The overall experience with tNSAIDs in our study is generally congruent with a neutral effect on cardiovascular disease although there is a suggestion of a small excess risk with chronic exposure, especially for non-fatal MI. The summary estimate for the tNSAID group is composed of substantial variation in risk between the three studied individual tNSAIDs suggesting a biologically plausible heterogenity in cardiovascular risk. Our study suggests either no effect or a small reduction of cardiovascular risk during sustained treatment with naproxen, a small increased risk with diclofenac, and an undetectable risk with ibuprofen. Larger observational studies and, if at all possible, randomised clinical trials will be necessary to address this hypothesis of mechanistic heterogenity amongst tNSAIDs with respect to cardiovascular risk.

### Diclofenac use and cardiovascular risks: series of nationwide cohort studies [^116wiJS3]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The cardiovascular risks of non-aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain a major safety concern after rofecoxib's thromboembolic properties were revealed. Diclofenac is a traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX 2) selectivity similar to COX 2 inhibitors, but its cardiovascular risks compared with those of other traditional NSAIDs have never been examined in a randomised controlled trial. Current concerns about these risks, as stated by the European Society of Cardiology, now make such a trial unethical to conduct.

Diclofenac is the most frequently used NSAID in low, middle, and high income countries, and is available over the counter in most countries; therefore, its cardiovascular risk profile is of major clinical and public health importance. As a consequence, the European Medicines Agency has again called for a safety assessment of diclofenac. In response, we conducted a series of cohort studies, each mimicking the strict design criteria of a clinical trial (a so-called emulated trial design), to compare rates of major adverse cardiovascular events among diclofenac initiators with rates among non-initiators or initiators of active comparator drugs.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^1168c4gB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The second issue worthy of comment is the conclusion the consensus group reached about whether some NSAIDs are safer than others from the standpoint of CV risk. Statement 8 reads: ' The risk of CV events associated with celecoxib use is similar to that associated with the use of most ns-NSAIDs'. Eighty-four percent of the panel agreed strongly or moderately, although only just over half the panel rated the level of evidence as high. They did not endorse earlier strong recommendations from bodies such as the American Heart Association and American College of Gastroenterology that naproxen should be the NSAID of choice for patients with high CV risk. Instead, the treatment-guidance algorithm they propose allows either naproxen or low-dose celecoxib as the preferred agents in patients with high CV risk, adding in a PPI to either if patients are judged to also be at high GI risk.

As Scarpignato et al. indicate, the evidence about whether naproxen has a lower CV risk has been conflicting; there is some pharmacokinetic basis to suspect it might. Aspirin exerts its prolonged anti-platelet effect because it irreversibly acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase. However, other nsNSAIDs are reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, so their platelet inhibitory effect disappears as their plasma levels dissipate. Naproxen is one of the longer acting nsNSAIDs, with a plasma elimination half-life of about 14 hours; a small study of volunteers given a single dose of 1,000 mg found platelet aggregation still reduced after 24 hours in 60% of cases. Thus, it is plausible that twice daily dosing may offer some protection against thrombotic events.

Seemingly in support of this, a recent large meta-analysis (the CNT collaboration) found that a coxib, diclofenac, or ibuprofen increased the rate of major vascular events by about a third (not quite significant for ibuprofen), but naproxen did not. However, a meta-analysis is only as strong as its component parts, and a particular weakness of the CNT meta-analysis was that it had to indirectly compare the effects of the different drugs. That is to say, studies of drug A versus drug B were combined with studies of drug A versus placebo to estimate relative risks for drug B versus placebo.

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use and association with incident hypertension in ankylosing spondylitis [^111bDiN9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase blood pressure and potentially cardiovascular burden, which may limit their use in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Our objective was to determine the association of NSAID use with incident hypertension in a longitudinal AS cohort.

Methods

Adults with AS were enrolled in a prospective cohort study of patient outcomes and examined every 4–6 months. Hypertension was defined by patient-reported hypertension; antihypertensive medication use; or, on 2 consecutive visits, systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg. Continuous NSAID use was dichotomized based on the validated NSAID index. We assessed the association of NSAID use as a time-varying exposure with the incidence of hypertension using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Of the 1,282 patients in the cohort, 628 patients without baseline hypertension had at least 1 year of follow-up and were included in the analysis. Of these, 72% were male, the mean age at baseline was 39 ± 13 years, and 200 patients used NSAIDs continuously. On follow-up, 129 developed incident hypertension. After controlling for other variables, continuous NSAID use was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.12 for incident hypertension (95% confidence interval 1.04–1.20), compared to noncontinuous or no use. The association did not differ in subgroups defined by age, body mass index, biologic use, or disease activity.

Conclusion

In our prospective, longitudinal AS cohort, continuous NSAID use was associated with a 12% increased risk for the development of incident hypertension, as compared to noncontinuous or no NSAID use.

### Specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: what have we learned since they came into widespread clinical use? [^115DDHmb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 were introduced into widespread clinical use in 1999. Since that time, celecoxib and rofecoxib have become two of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. Clinical trials using these medications for arthritis and pain have uniformly demonstrated efficacy superior to that of placebo and similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, controversy surrounding the proper place of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in the hierarchy of treatment for arthritis continues, based primarily on their higher cost compared with that of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A decreased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity remains the primary justification for using the more expensive cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in preference to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The renal and cardiovascular effects of rofecoxib and celecoxib have been investigated in relation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and to one another. The data with respect to alteration in renal function, lower extremity edema, and hypertension indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors affect the kidney in a manner similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The data comparing the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is difficult to interpret because it is not clear that comparable doses have been used in clinical trials. The potential thrombogenic risk of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors remains controversial, and conflicting data exist. It remains important to increase our understanding of the place of these agents in clinical practice from the perspective of efficacy, toxicity, and cost.

Table 2.
Dose–Response Relationship Between Achieved Sodium Excretion and Systolic Blood Pressure

Table 3.
Dose–Response Relationship Between Achieved Sodium Excretion and Diastolic Blood Pressure

Figure 2.
Dose–response meta-analysis of changes in SBP and DBP levels (mm Hg) according to achieved sodium excretion in the treatment and control groups at the end of the trials (all studies) and by type of intervention (supplementation or diet). The average curve (solid line) with 95% confidence limits (dashed lines) was estimated with a 1-stage random-effects restricted cubic spline model, using 2 g/d as referent. DBP indicates diastolic blood pressure; and SBP, systolic blood pressure.

Figure 3 shows the dose–response range according to presence or absence of hypertension at baseline. Both subgroups showed a tendency for BP lowering after a reduction in dietary sodium and a roughly linear association between achieved sodium intake and BP change at the end of the trials, with the exception that there was little evidence of BP effect in the participants without hypertension whose sodium intake was < 2 g/d. The participants with hypertension had a much steeper dose-response for mean SBP and mean DBP over the entire range of achieved sodium excretion, and therefore at the highest and the lowest exposure levels the BP differences were considerably larger compared with those seen in the participants without hypertension. The BP changes at the extremes of sodium intake were more statistically imprecise for those without hypertension (based on 15 studies) than for those with hypertension (based on 67 studies), with wider CIs for the point estimates particularly at the lowest exposure levels for DBP. At a sodium intake as high as 6 g/d compared with 2 g/d, in participants without hypertension, mean (95% CI) SBP and DBP increases were 3.99 mm Hg (95% CI, +0.80 to +7.18) and 1.66 mm Hg (95% CI, −0.58 to +3.91), respectively. In participants with hypertension, the corresponding differences were 10.31 mm Hg (95% CI, +7.86 to +12.75) and 5.13 mm Hg (95% CI, +3.52 to +6.74). Based on use of a linear function in participants without hypertension, a 100 mmol/d decrease in sodium intake was associated with a reduction in mean (95% CI) SBP and DBP of 2.30 mm Hg (95% CI, −1.33 to −3.27) and 0.80 mm Hg (95% CI, +0.29 to −1.89), respectively. The corresponding SBP and DBP reductions in participants with hypertension were 6.50 mm Hg (95% CI, −5.22 to −7.79) and 3.00 mm Hg (95% CI, −2.27 to −3.74), respectively. Limited differences emerged when we further stratified the trials according to the method used to achieve the intervention effect (sodium restriction followed by supplementation versus dietary modification through behavior change;) and the hypertensive status. Similar results were obtained in participants with hypertension whether or not they were being treated with antihypertensive drug therapy, except for a higher SBP level for those with a very high sodium intake who were receiving antihypertensive drug therapy, particularly in those subject to a dietary intervention. When we stratified the analysis according to a baseline SBP < 140 mm Hg versus ≥ 140 mm Hg in participants with hypertension, we found substantially similar BP effects for both categories of sodium intake. A 100 mmol/d decrease in sodium intake was associated with a reduction in mean (95% CI) SBP and DBP of 7.79 mm Hg (95% CI, −4.90 to −10.67) and of 3.10 mm Hg (95% CI, −1.37 to −4.83), respectively, in the trial participants with a baseline SBP < 140 mm Hg, and of 6.06 mm Hg (95% CI, −4.64 to −7.48) and 2.99 mm Hg (95% CI, −2.17 to −3.81) in the trial participants with a baseline SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg. However, a stronger effect on BP (particularly SBP) was noted at higher sodium intake (> 4 g/d) in participants with hypertension whose SBP was < 140 or ≥ 140 mm Hg, after exclusion of individuals taking antihypertensive medication.

### Use of blood pressure lowering drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: meta-analysis of 147 randomised trials in the context of expectations from prospective epidemiological studies [^111T4Tke]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Effect of blood pressure lowering drugs in lowering blood pressure according to dose

These estimates are taken from a meta-analysis of 354 short term randomised placebo controlled trials of blood pressure lowering drugs in fixed dose, which showed that the five main classes of blood pressure lowering drugs produce similar reductions in blood pressure when taken at standard dose or at the same multiple of standard dose. It also showed that the blood pressure lowering effect of the drugs increased with dose and with pretreatment blood pressure, and reported regression equations that quantified the reduction in blood pressure from one drug according to pretreatment blood pressure. From the average blood pressure of 154 mm Hg systolic and 97 mm Hg diastolic one drug at standard dose lowered blood pressure by 9.1 mm Hg systolic and 5.5 mm Hg diastolic on average. At lower or higher pretreatment blood pressures the blood pressure reduction decreased (or increased) by 0.10 mm Hg systolic and 0.11 mm Hg diastolic per mm Hg decrease (or increase) in pretreatment blood pressure. The estimated effect of one drug at standard dose in lowering blood pressure from a pretreatment blood pressure P is therefore [9.1+0.10(P−154)] systolic and [5.5+0.11(P−97)] diastolic. So for example the reduction in blood pressure was 8.7 mm Hg systolic from a pretreatment value of 150 mm Hg, 4.7 mm Hg diastolic from a pretreatment value of 90 mm Hg. The estimated blood pressure reduction for two or three drugs at standard dose was calculated by applying these equations to each drug in turn, allowing for the effect of the first in lowering pretreatment blood pressure for the second, and the second for the third. In the above example the pretreatment blood pressure for the second drug would be 141.3 (150−8.7) mm Hg systolic and 85.3 (90−4.7) mm Hg diastolic.

### Complex role for E-prostanoid 4 receptors in hypertension [^116rhtaD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostanoids, generated through the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, have a wide range of biological functions. Because of their relatively short half‐lives, these compounds typically act locally in the tissues where they are synthesized and their actions are mediated by specific receptors belonging to the large family of G‐protein–coupled, 7‐transmembrane receptors. 1 NSAIDs, among the most widely used medications worldwide, act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes, thereby broadly attenuating the production of all prostanoids. 2 NSAIDs are effective analgesic agents, but their use has been associated with exacerbation of hypertension 3, 4 and increased cardiovascular risk, 5, 6 suggesting that ≥ 1 prostanoids have beneficial actions to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is a highly abundant prostanoid with several actions relevant to blood pressure (BP) control and cardiovascular functions. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 For example, it is a potent vasodilator 12 and can induce natriuresis. 13 Moreover, PGE 2 influences immune responses and inflammation, 14, 15, 16 which have recently been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension 17, 18 and cardiovascular diseases. 18, 19 The actions of PGE 2 are mediated by a series of E‐prostanoid (EP) receptors, which are divided into 4 pharmacological classes, EP1 to EP4, with differing tissue distributions and varied coupling to intracellular signaling pathways. 20, 21, 22 Among the EP receptor isoforms, EP2 and EP4 have been classically considered as "relaxant" receptors 1, 23, 24, 25 based on their preferential coupling to Gs proteins, linked to enhanced formation of cAMP and relaxation of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle. 26

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^115eDDii]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure reduction

Traditionally, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are considered to have similar blood pressure-lowering effects. However, significant differences become apparent when data analysis is anchored in notions of duration of action, potency, and dose response (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Duration of action, potency, and half-life

Hydrochlorothiazide appears to be less potent per milligram than chlorthalidone for blood pressure reduction (HCTZ 50 mg is equipotent with chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg; Table 2). A 2014 meta-analysis of 26 trials (N = 4683), for example, showed that to decrease office SBP by 10 mmHg, an 8.6 mg of chlorthalidone or an 26.4 mg of HCTZ were needed. In addition, a 2014 Cochrane database analysis showed that a reduction in SBP of 8.7–11.9 mmHg could be reached after treatment with a 1.5–5 mg dose of indapamide and that, for SBP, indapamide sustained release 1.5 mg was roughly equipotent to HCTZ 25–50 mg. This analysis also suggested that the effects of indapamide and chlorthalidone on blood pressure are not dose-dependent over the 1–5 mg and the 12.5–75 mg ranges, respectively, whereas reductions in SBP with HCTZ treatment increase with dose from less than 5 mmHg at the 6.25 mg dose to 10.5 mmHg at the 50 mg dose.

Other analyses, however, come to different conclusions. In a meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials (N = 883), both chlorthalidone and indapamide lowered SBP more than HCTZ (Fig. 2). Though these differences were significant, the magnitude of the between-group differences may be lower than might have been expected from the previously cited studies (−5.1 and −3.6 mmHg). Moreover, a review of two meta-analyses suggests that 25 mg of HCTZ is indeed associated with a decrease in SBP of approximately 10 mmHg, but that indapamide 1.25–5 mg is associated with a 5 mmHg decrease in SBP and that SBP reduction for chlorthalidone is not dose independent, but varies from 3 to 10 mmHg depending on the dose. Thus, additional data are needed to understand fully the blood pressure dose–response curves.

### Identifying vulnerabilities to NSAID adverse events in the U.S. population: an analysis of preexisting conditions and sex [^113w97fe]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose: In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a decision memorandum regarding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The memorandum recommended the withdrawal of certain NSAIDs due to potential cardiovascular adverse effects. It highlighted the issue of cardiovascular risk associated with NSAIDs as a class. The NSAID medication guide includes a wide range of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as increased blood pressure, liver failure, allergic reactions, heart attack, and intestinal bleeding. Although both sexes have an increased risk of ADRs with NSAID use, females have a greater risk than males due to differences in pharmacodynamics and higher medication concentrations (mg/kg). In particular, females with high blood pressure, coronary heart, kidney, and liver disease are at an additional risk of harm from NSAID ADRs. This study quantifies sex-specific differences and other factors associated with prescription NSAID use. Method: The data for this study were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a complex survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in two-year cycles. A survey-weighted logistic regression model was utilized to investigate potential sex differences with prescription NSAIDs in the context of other factors, including kidney disease, hypertension, liver disease, insurance status, coronary heart disease, and age, within the 2011–2018 NHANES survey data. Results: Females reported a slightly higher percentage of high blood pressure and kidney disease than males, while males reported a slightly higher percentage of coronary heart and liver disease than females. Last, the model indicated that females were 58% more likely to have used a prescription NSAID than males. Conclusion: The results confirm that women and people with medical conditions, who would potentially suffer greater harm from NSAID ADRs, are more likely to use a prescription NSAID than individuals without these conditions.

### NSAIDs and cardiovascular risk… [^115QD7jy]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

TXA₂ increases renal salt and fluid retention, increases blood pressure, and enhances myocardial and vascular remodeling, whereas PGI₂ facilitates renal salt and fluid excretion and lowers systemic blood pressure. Equilibrium between TXA₂ and PGI₂ exists in the healthy vascular system, and it has been proposed that NSAIDs, in varying degrees, tip the TXA₂/PGI₂ balance, thereby increasing cardiovascular risk. Although studies have demonstrated increased cardiovascular risk with rofecoxib 2 and other COX-2 inhibitors, 3–7 traditional nonselective NSAIDs have been used uncritically for decades with a lack of randomized studies regarding cardiovascular safety. However, several large observational studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated increased cardiovascular risk with nonselective NSAIDs. 5, 6, 8–10. Risk profiles of NSAIDs vary depending on the degree to which individual formulations inhibit the COX-1 or COX-2 isoforms.

Hence, nonselective NSAIDs with high COX-2 inhibition seem to have higher cardiovascular risk, whereas nonselective NSAIDs with high COX-1 inhibition seem to have higher gastrointestinal risk. 1 The primary focus of discussions on cardiovascular risk has been on thrombotic risk. However, NSAIDs can increase the risk of fluid retention and edema, and destabilize and worsen preexisting heart failure. Accordingly, international guidelines have advocated caution when using NSAIDs in persons with heart failure. 11 Furthermore, NSAIDs have been shown to influence renal function by decreasing renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate; cause interstitial nephritis; increase blood pressure; and, in persons with preexisting hypertenion, destabilize blood pressure control.

12 Several studies have demonstrated that, in persons with established cardiovascular disease or increased cardiovascular risk, NSAIDs are even more harmful with regards to cardiovascular adverse events. 7–9, 13. In persons needing NSAID treatment, NSAIDs with the highest COX-1 selectivity should be preferred and used in the lowest dosages and for the shortest durations possible. For stronger analgesic effect, a combination with other types of analgesics should be considered.
