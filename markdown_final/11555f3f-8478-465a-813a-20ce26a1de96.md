## Question

Lisinopril monotherapy in black patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lisinopril monotherapy is appropriate in Black patients with hypertension and, if not, what the evidence-based alternatives and strategies are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic rationale for ACE inhibitor effectiveness across renin phenotypes. Then, I should verify the magnitude of racial differences in blood pressure response to lisinopril monotherapy. Next, I will review hard cardiovascular outcomes data, especially ALLHAT subgroup analyses. After that, I need to check safety signals like angioedema risk. Then, I should confirm what contemporary guidelines recommend for initial therapy in Black patients. I will also examine when ACE inhibitors are still indicated despite monotherapy limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and ensure it aligns with the highest-quality evidence and labels.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic plausibility. Black patients with hypertension are more often low-renin, volume-expanded, and salt-sensitive, which diminishes the antihypertensive effect of renin–angiotensin system blockade; ACE inhibitors still work, but the average blood pressure reduction is smaller in low-renin physiology, which is consistently reflected in FDA labeling for lisinopril and related ACE inhibitors noting a smaller average response in Black patients compared with non-Black patients [^114WwFoL] [^112d2mrF] [^1165Ry3b] [^1151UigR].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of the attenuated response. Multiple meta-analyses and large trials show that Black adults have approximately 4–6 mm Hg smaller systolic and 2–3 mm Hg smaller diastolic blood pressure reductions with ACE inhibitor monotherapy compared with White adults. ALLHAT specifically found about a 5/2 mm Hg disadvantage for lisinopril versus chlorthalidone in Black participants, and this pattern persists across ACE inhibitors, not just lisinopril [^114jRnSr] [^111vxmje] [^113H6sFS] [^113g8vUN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical outcomes from blood pressure differences alone. I should confirm hard endpoints. In ALLHAT's prespecified subgroup analysis, Black participants randomized to lisinopril had higher risks of stroke, heart failure, and combined cardiovascular disease compared with chlorthalidone, and these differences persisted even after accounting for achieved blood pressure to some degree, suggesting that both BP and class-specific effects contribute; longer-term follow-up also showed persistent legacy effects, including higher stroke mortality with lisinopril in Black patients [^113H6sFS] [^117KpA1Y] [^113g8vUN].

> I need to check safety next. ACE inhibitors carry a higher risk of angioedema in Black patients, and this is consistently flagged in FDA labeling across multiple ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril and fosinopril. This risk signal strengthens the case to avoid ACE inhibitor monotherapy when equally or more effective alternatives exist for initial therapy in this population [^111g1vmM] [^115AmmCW] [^1151UigR].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure my interpretation aligns with standards. Contemporary guidelines converge on not using ACE inhibitors or ARBs as monotherapy in Black adults with uncomplicated hypertension; instead, initial therapy should include a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and many recommend starting with two agents if blood pressure is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal, given the likelihood of needing combination therapy and the importance of early control [^115dbKMN] [^113TaGwi] [^115frrgt] [^1151utcj] [^1115n7eo] [^113JSXaD].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD or diabetic kidney disease? I should confirm exceptions. ACE inhibitors remain first-line in the presence of albuminuria or CKD with proteinuria because of their renoprotective effects, and in such cases they should be used, typically with a thiazide-type diuretic or a calcium channel blocker to achieve blood pressure targets and mitigate the attenuated monotherapy response; VA/DoD and KDIGO-aligned commentaries explicitly endorse this approach [^116mB1qu] [^115grVaK].

> Let me consider combination therapy data to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing monotherapy findings. When lisinopril is combined with a thiazide diuretic, the blood pressure response becomes approximately additive and racial differences largely disappear. CREOLE in sub-Saharan African patients showed that amlodipine-based combinations outperformed perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide, reinforcing that calcium channel blocker–based regimens are particularly effective in Black patients, while still allowing for RAS blockade when indicated [^112FL8sY] [^115b56gG] [^1158aPUb].

> I should double-check practical dosing and escalation. If, despite guidance, lisinopril monotherapy is attempted or continued, higher doses may be required to achieve meaningful blood pressure reductions, but this must be balanced against cough, hyperkalemia, and angioedema risks. In most cases, it is more efficient to pair lisinopril with a thiazide or a calcium channel blocker early rather than pushing monotherapy to high doses [^111vxmje] [^116ET2nc].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise approach and make sure it aligns with the evidence. For Black adults with uncomplicated hypertension, do not initiate lisinopril monotherapy; start with a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and consider initial two-drug therapy if blood pressure is 20/10 mm Hg or more above goal, preferably as a single-pill combination to improve adherence; if CKD with albuminuria is present, include an ACE inhibitor or ARB as part of combination therapy; if an ACE inhibitor is already on board and tolerated, add a thiazide or calcium channel blocker rather than escalating the ACE inhibitor alone [^113JSXaD] [^115frrgt] [^115grVaK] [^116ET2nc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "never use ACE inhibitors in Black patients", but that overstates the evidence; I should correct that. ACE inhibitors are not contraindicated in Black patients — they are simply less effective as monotherapy for blood pressure and are associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes versus thiazide-based therapy in ALLHAT, yet they retain important roles in proteinuric CKD, diabetic nephropathy, and as components of combination regimens where their BP effect is adequate and their organ-protective benefits may apply [^113H6sFS] [^116mB1qu] [^112FL8sY].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. Lisinopril monotherapy is not recommended as initial therapy for Black patients with uncomplicated hypertension because of attenuated blood pressure response, inferior cardiovascular outcomes in ALLHAT, and higher angioedema risk. Preferred initial strategies are thiazide-type diuretics or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, often in combination, with ACE inhibitors reserved for specific indications like albuminuric CKD or as part of combination therapy to reach targets efficiently [^115dbKMN] [^113TaGwi] [^113H6sFS] [^111g1vmM].

Lisinopril monotherapy is **less effective in Black patients** [^114WwFoL] due to lower renin levels [^112d2mrF], with smaller average BP reductions than in non-Black patients [^114jRnSr]. It is **not recommended as first-line monotherapy** in Black patients without compelling indications [^115dbKMN]; thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred [^115frrgt] [^1151utcj]. If lisinopril is used, it should be combined with a thiazide or CCB [^1158aPUb] to overcome attenuated response [^112FL8sY] and improve control [^113JSXaD]. ACE inhibitors also carry a higher risk of angioedema in Black patients [^111g1vmM], reinforcing the need for caution and close monitoring [^115AmmCW].

## Blood pressure response to lisinopril monotherapy in Black patients

- **Attenuated response**: Black patients typically have a smaller average BP reduction with lisinopril monotherapy than non-Black patients [^114WwFoL].

- **Magnitude of difference**: Meta-analyses show ~4.6 mmHg less systolic and ~2.8 mmHg less diastolic reduction in Black patients [^1131p2ZY] [^111vxmje].

- **Mechanism**: Lower renin levels in Black patients [^112d2mrF] limit ACE inhibitor efficacy [^114WwFoL].

---

## Clinical outcomes and cardiovascular risk

- **ALLHAT findings**: In Black participants, lisinopril was associated with higher risks of stroke, heart failure, and combined cardiovascular disease compared with chlorthalidone or amlodipine [^113H6sFS].

- **Stroke risk**: Stroke risk was 40% higher with lisinopril vs chlorthalidone in Black patients (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.17–1.68) [^113H6sFS].

- **Heart failure risk**: Heart failure risk was 30% higher with lisinopril vs chlorthalidone in Black patients (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10–1.54) [^113H6sFS].

---

## Safety considerations

Angioedema risk is **higher in Black patients** [^111g1vmM] receiving ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, than in non-Black patients [^115AmmCW]. Hyperkalemia risk is also present, particularly when combined with potassium-sparing agents or in patients with renal impairment [^notfound].

---

## Guideline recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred for initial therapy in Black patients without compelling indications [^115frrgt] [^1151utcj].

- **Combination therapy**: If lisinopril is used, it should be combined with a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker to improve efficacy [^114WwFoL] [^113JSXaD].

- **Compelling indications**: ACE inhibitors remain indicated for CKD with proteinuria, diabetes, or heart failure, but monotherapy is not recommended [^115grVaK] [^116mB1qu].

---

## Clinical scenarios where lisinopril monotherapy may be considered

Lisinopril monotherapy may be considered in Black patients with **compelling indications** such as chronic kidney disease with proteinuria, diabetes mellitus with nephropathy, or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It may also be used when other first-line agents are contraindicated or not tolerated, though close monitoring is required.

## Alternative antihypertensive therapies

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Rationale in black patients** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide diuretics | - Chlorthalidone <br/> - Hydrochlorothiazide | - Effective due to salt sensitivity <br/> - Lower stroke and heart failure risk vs lisinopril [^113H6sFS] |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Amlodipine <br/> - Felodipine | - Effective monotherapy <br/> - Lower stroke risk vs lisinopril [^116nM2Lr] |
| Combination therapy | - Lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide <br/> - Lisinopril + amlodipine | - Overcomes attenuated ACE inhibitor response <br/> - Improves BP control [^112FL8sY] [^1158aPUb] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Avoid monotherapy**: Do not use lisinopril monotherapy as first-line in Black patients without compelling indications [^115dbKMN] [^113TaGwi].

- **Prefer combination**: Use lisinopril with a thiazide or CCB to improve efficacy and outcomes [^114WwFoL] [^113JSXaD].

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for angioedema, hyperkalemia, and renal function changes [^111g1vmM] [^114WwFoL].

- **Individualize therapy**: Tailor to comorbidities, tolerance, and response [^115grVaK] [^1124e2kh].

## References

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^116sCT5N]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

These findings must also be taken in the context of other clinical trials that have demonstrated the benefit of ACEI therapy among blacks with certain complications such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus despite lesser reduction in blood pressure. Also, use of ACEIs as part of a combination for treatment of hypertension has proven to be effective among black adults. In fact, according to one meta-analysis, combination therapy including ACEIs may actually result in a greater blood pressure reduction in black adults than white adults. Since black adults are disproportionately affected by heart and kidney disease and many will require at least 2 hypertensive agents for blood pressure control, the use of a combination therapy including an ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker may be particularly beneficial in this population.

This meta-analysis has several important limitations. First, all of the studies included in this meta-analysis except one were done in the USA and therefore may not be applicable to black adults living in other regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Although this is a limitation, we also believe that this meta-analysis is important in providing context for the much-anticipated results of the first large, randomized, controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs among hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, this meta-analysis was performed on pooled study results and not individual level data. The consistency of the difference in mean blood pressure reduction, however, does point to a real difference in reduction by race. Finally, as with any meta-analysis, this study is limited by the variables that were studied and reported in the component trials. Since hypertension is multifactorial, some important confounders such as nutrition, salt intake and handling, nephron number or hormone levels may have been missed.

### Fosinopirl sodium (fosinopril sodium) [^114i4GZy]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. They may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics.

Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS).

In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema).

### Lisinopril [^114WwFoL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of lisinopril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 6% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had a mean decrease in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L; approximately 4% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 12% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.

ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.

While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non Black patients.

Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and non-Black patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident.

### A randomized controlled crossover trial evaluating differential responses to antihypertensive drugs (used as mono-or dual therapy) on the basis of ethnicity: the comparIsoN oF optimal hypertension regiMens; part of the ancestry informative markers in HYpertension program-AIM-HY INFORM trial [^113MrwkL]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The evidence for differential responses to antihypertensive drugs on the basis of ethnicity in the United Kingdom is more limited, with an analysis from 203 African, 132 South Asian, and 4,368 white participants in the UK arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial perhaps the most robust source of data. This sought to determine whether there were ethnic variations in response to monotherapy using β-blockers (atenolol) or calcium channel blockers (amlodipine) and then to add-on therapy with a thiazide diuretic (bendroflumethiazide) or ACEi (perindopril). The degree of BP reduction achieved in black patients receiving atenolol monotherapy was significantly lower when compared to white patients; South Asian patients achieved an intermediate treatment effect. Amlodipine monotherapy resulted in similar BP-lowering effects across all 3 ethnic groups, as did the addition of bendroflumethiazide to atenolol. However, the addition of perindopril to amlodipine resulted in statistically significant BP differences; white patients achieved a further 1.7–mm Hg fall in SBP (95% CI: −2.8 to −0.7 mm Hg), black patients exhibited a diminished response (SBP change: −0.8 mm Hg; 95% CI: −2.5 to +4.2 mm Hg), whereas South Asians demonstrated a greater response (SBP change: −6.2 mm Hg; 95% CI −10.2 to −2.2 mm Hg).

The AIM-HY INFORM trial aims to optimize first- and second-line antihypertensive therapies for the multiethnic population of the United Kingdom. In doing so, it will refine the "black versus white" approach embodied in the current NICE guideline and further codify the treatment of hypertension. The systematic and robust trial data produced will also compare the value of SDE against genetically defined ancestry and metabolomics, informing future studies in low- and middle-income countries, where the utilization of existing generic drugs in a resource-efficient manner is imperative.

### Major outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients randomized to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker vs diuretic: the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT) [^114Hncor]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

The study ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) was published by ALLHAT Officers and Coordinators for the ALLHAT Collaborative Research Group. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial. and colleagues in 2002 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension and Coronary artery disease. In the ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) study, the trial question was: is lisinopril superior to chlorthalidone in high-risk patients with hypertension? In the ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) study, the population was: 24309 patients (11358 female, 12951 male). The inclusion criteria were patients ≥ 55 years of age with hypertension and at least 1 other coronary artery disease risk factor. The key exclusion criteria were history of hospitalized or treated symptomatic HF and/or known LVEF < 35%. In the ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) study, the interventions were: n = 9054 lisinopril (a dose of 10–40 mg/day) n = 15255 chlorthalidone (a dose of 12.5–25 mg/day). In the ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of fatal coronary artery disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction within 6 years (11.4% vs. 11.5%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.91 to 1.08). In the ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of death from all causes within 6 years (17.2% vs. 17.3%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08) No significant difference in the rate of coronary artery disease within 6 years (20.8% vs. 19.9%; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.11) Significant increase in the rate of stroke within 6 years (6.3% vs. 5.6%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.3). In the ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding. In the ALLHAT (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) study, the conclusion was: in patients ≥ 55 years of age with hypertension and at least 1 other coronary artery disease risk factor, lisinopril was not superior to chlorthalidone with respect to the rate of fatal coronary artery disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction within 6 years.

### A randomized controlled crossover trial evaluating differential responses to antihypertensive drugs (used as mono-or dual therapy) on the basis of ethnicity: the comparIsoN oF optimal hypertension regiMens; part of the ancestry informative markers in HYpertension program-AIM-HY INFORM trial [^1113kxc3]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ethnicity, along with a variety of genetic and environmental factors, is thought to influence the efficacy of antihypertensive therapies. Current UK guidelines use a "black versus white" approach; in doing so, they ignore the United Kingdom's largest ethnic minority: Asians from South Asia.

Study design

The primary purpose of the AIM-HY INFORM trial is to identify potential differences in response to antihypertensive drugs used as mono- or dual therapy on the basis of self-defined ethnicity. A multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized study with 2 parallel, independent trial arms (mono- and dual therapy), AIM-HY INFORM plans to enroll a total of 1,320 patients from across the United Kingdom. Those receiving monotherapy (n = 660) will enter a 3-treatment (amlodipine 10 mg od; lisinopril 20 mg od; chlorthalidone 25 mg od), 3-period crossover, lasting 24 weeks, whereas those receiving dual therapy (n = 660) will enter a 4-treatment (amlodipine 5 mg od and lisinopril 20 mg od; amlodipine 5 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od; lisinopril 20 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od; amiloride 10 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od), 4-period crossover, lasting 32 weeks. Equal numbers of 3 ethnic groups (white, black/black British, and Asian/Asian British) will ultimately be recruited to each of the trial arms (ie, 220 participants per ethnic group per arm). Seated, automated, unattended, office, systolic blood pressure measured 8 weeks after each treatment period begins will serve as the primary outcome measure.

Conclusion

AIM-HY INFORM is a prospective, open-label, randomized trial which aims to evaluate first- and second-line antihypertensive therapies for multiethnic populations.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to do not use α-blockers as first-line therapy in patients with uncomplicated HTN. Do not use β-blockers as first-line therapy in ≥ 60 years old patients with uncomplicated HTN. Do not use ACEis as first-line therapy in black patients with uncomplicated HTN.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^113TaGwi]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatment — For hypertension: We recommend offering a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, or either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker as primary pharmacologic therapy for hypertension for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. In African American patients with hypertension, we recommend against using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker as monotherapy. In hypertensive patients 65 years and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of another medication.

### A review of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in black patients with hypertension [^115wLCZt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current guidelines and recent data evaluating the efficacy and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in black hypertensive patients.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating race-specific outcomes in hypertension were gathered using a MEDLINE search with keywords black, African American, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin system, and hypertension. Studies published from 2000 through April 2018 were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Six guidelines, 8 monotherapy publications, and 5 combination therapy publications included race-specific results and were included in the review. The authors individually compared and contrasted the results from each publication.

Data Synthesis

Numerous monotherapy trials indicate that black patients may have a reduced blood pressure (BP) response with ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with white patients. Conversely, additional studies propose that race may not be the primary predictor of BP response. Reduced efficacy is not observed in trials involving combination therapy. Some studies suggest increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality with ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy in black patients; however, data are conflicting. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This article clarifies vague guideline statements and informs clinicians on the appropriate use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs for hypertension treatment in black patients through an in-depth look into the evidence.

Conclusions

Potentially reduced efficacy and limited outcomes data indicate that ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not routinely be initiated as monotherapy in black hypertensive patients. Use in combination with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic is efficacious in black patients, and there are no data showing that this increases or decreases cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes.

### Race / ethnicity-specific changes in antihypertensive medication in Medicare beneficiaries… [^114vr9ok]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this serial cross-sectional study of 41 340 Medicare beneficiaries, there was no statistically significant change in the proportion of Black beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker following publication of the panel members' report. The proportion initiating β-blocker monotherapy remained high among all race/ethnicity groups. Overall, 66% of Black beneficiaries initiated antihypertensive medication monotherapy, whereas 78% of White and other race/ethnicity beneficiaries initiated monotherapy. There was no evidence of trends in the proportion of Black beneficiaries or beneficiaries of other race/ethnicity initiating monotherapy with a thiazide-type diuretic. The proportion of White beneficiaries initiating monotherapy with a thiazide-type diuretic decreased. The proportion of beneficiaries initiating CCB monotherapy increased from 27. 6% in 2011 to
38.

0% in 2018 among Black beneficiaries and from 14. 6% in 2011 to
20. 3% in 2018 among White beneficiaries. Black beneficiaries were less likely than White beneficiaries to initiate monotherapy with an ACEI or ARB, but there was no evidence of a change in the proportion of Black vs White beneficiaries initiating ACEI or ARB monotherapy after vs before publication of JNC8 panel member report. The proportion of beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive monotherapy who did so with a β-blocker decreased from before to after publication of the JNC8 panel member report. Black beneficiaries were less likely than White beneficiaries to initiate monotherapy with a β-blocker.

Although Black Medicare beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive monotherapy were less likely than White beneficiaries to do so with an ACEI or ARB, a high proportion initiated treatment with an ACEI or ARB, and this did not change from before to after publication of the JNC8 panel member report.

### Nebivolol hydrochloride (Bystolic) [^111LnxLd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.400000000000000e+01 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Hypertension

The antihypertensive effectiveness of BYSTOLIC as monotherapy has been demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials at doses ranging from 1.25 to 40 mg for 12 weeks (Studies 1, 2, and 3). A fourth placebo-controlled trial demonstrated additional antihypertensive effects of BYSTOLIC at doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg when administered concomitantly with up to two other antihypertensive agents (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and thiazide diuretics) in patients with inadequate blood pressure control.

The three monotherapy trials included a total of 2016 patients (1811 BYSTOLIC, 205 placebo) with mild to moderate hypertension who had baseline diastolic blood pressures (DBP) of 95 to 109 mmHg. Patients received either BYSTOLIC or placebo once daily for twelve weeks. Two of these monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2) studied 1716 patients in the general hypertensive population with a mean age of 54 years, 55% males, 26% non-Caucasians, 7% diabetics and 6% genotyped as PMs. The third monotherapy trial (Study 3) studied 300 Black patients with a mean age of 51 years, 45% males, 14% diabetics, and 3% as PMs.

Placebo-subtracted blood pressure reductions by dose for each study are presented in Table 2. Most studies showed increasing response to doses above 5 mg.

✱ p < 0.05 based on pair-wise comparison vs. placebo

¶Study enrolled only African Americans.^Study on top of one or two other antihypertensive medications.

Study 4 enrolled 669 patients with a mean age of 54 years, 55% males, 54% Caucasians, 29% Blacks, 15% Hispanics, 1% Asians, 14% diabetics, and 5% PMs. BYSTOLIC, 5 mg to 20 mg, administered once daily concomitantly with stable doses of up to two other antihypertensive agents (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and thiazide diuretics) resulted in significant additional antihypertensive effects over placebo compared to baseline blood pressure.

Effectiveness was similar in subgroups analyzed by age and sex. Effectiveness was established in Blacks, but as monotherapy the magnitude of effect was somewhat less than in Caucasians.

The blood pressure lowering effect of BYSTOLIC was seen within two weeks of treatment and was maintained over the 24-hour dosing interval.

There are no trials of BYSTOLIC demonstrating reductions in cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, but at least one pharmacologically similar drug has demonstrated such benefits.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^115grVaK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Racial and ethnic differences in treatment — initial therapy and medication number in black adults: Guideline statement 10.1.1.1 says, "In black adults with hypertension but without HF or CKD, including those with DM, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. (COR I, LOE B-R)", and 10.1.1.2 states, "Two or more antihypertensive medications are recommended to achieve a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg in most adults with hypertension, especially in black adults with hypertension. (COR I, LOE B-R)". The commentary adds that medication selection "should consider all aspects of the patient, including their comorbid conditions, age, and lifestyle factors", and highlights that with "severely elevated urinary albumin excretion, an ACE inhibitor or an ARB would be first-line therapy".

### A randomized controlled crossover trial evaluating differential responses to antihypertensive drugs (used as mono-or dual therapy) on the basis of ethnicity: the comparIsoN oF optimal hypertension regiMens; part of the ancestry informative markers in HYpertension program-AIM-HY INFORM trial [^113P7xM7]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ethnicity, along with a variety of genetic and environmental factors, is thought to influence the efficacy of antihypertensive therapies. Current UK guidelines use a "black versus white" approach; in doing so, they ignore the United Kingdom's largest ethnic minority: Asians from South Asia.

Study Design

The primary purpose of the AIM-HY INFORM trial is to identify potential differences in response to antihypertensive drugs used as mono- or dual therapy on the basis of self-defined ethnicity. A multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized study with 2 parallel, independent trial arms (mono- and dual therapy), AIM-HY INFORM plans to enroll a total of 1,320 patients from across the United Kingdom. Those receiving monotherapy (n = 660) will enter a 3-treatment (amlodipine 10 mg od; lisinopril 20 mg od; chlorthalidone 25 mg od), 3-period crossover, lasting 24 weeks, whereas those receiving dual therapy (n = 660) will enter a 4-treatment (amlodipine 5 mg od and lisinopril 20 mg od; amlodipine 5 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od; lisinopril 20 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od; amiloride 10 mg od and chlorthalidone 25 mg od), 4-period crossover, lasting 32 weeks. Equal numbers of 3 ethnic groups (white, black/black British, and Asian/Asian British) will ultimately be recruited to each of the trial arms (ie, 220 participants per ethnic group per arm). Seated, automated, unattended, office, systolic blood pressure measured 8 weeks after each treatment period begins will serve as the primary outcome measure.

Conclusion

AIM-HY INFORM is a prospective, open-label, randomized trial which aims to evaluate first- and second-line antihypertensive therapies for multiethnic populations.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^113yrpr4]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study confirms and quantifies the hypothesis that adult black hypertensive patients do generally have a lesser mean reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response to ACEI monotherapy when compared to whites. This meta-analysis provides evidence for current guidelines that recommend that drugs other than ACEI should be preferred for uncomplicated, mild-moderate hypertension in blacks, guidelines that have particular import in sub-Saharan Africa. These results, though, must be taken in the context of other research that provides strong evidence for the benefits of ACEIs in some subgroups of hypertensive black adults, particularly those with certain complications such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and those requiring multi-drug therapy for their hypertension. For hypertensive black adults in whom ACEI monotherapy is indicated, higher doses may be necessary to obtain the desired reduction in blood pressure.

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^116UJkcQ]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study explored how Dutch GPs manage newly diagnosed primary, uncomplicated hypertension, identifying three key themes: contextual factors when initiating treatment, AHM class preferences, and considerations on combination therapy.

Contextual factors when initiating treatment included lifestyle modifications, patient age, initial BP, and patient preferences. GPs prioritized lifestyle changes, particularly for younger patients, to avoid early medicalization, balancing short-term side effects with long-term benefits. Contrary to the guideline's stance that AHM classes are largely equivalent for treating primary hypertension, most GPs in our study did not consider them interchangeable. Their preferences were shaped by perceived efficacy, side effects, patient-specific characteristics, and earlier guideline recommendations.

Likewise, the proposed recommendation to initiate treatment with two AHM classes simultaneously — a pending guideline change at the time of the interviews — was met with limited enthusiasm. This raises questions about how easily such recommendations will be adopted in practice, although attitudes may shift over time. Interviewed GPs often preferred a stepped approach, starting with monotherapy to better identify side effects and promote shared decision-making. They also voiced concerns that a sudden BP drop initiating dual therapy could undermine patient adherence. These findings are consistent with a 2007 phone survey among GPs, that found a similar preference for monotherapy as initial treatment. Rather than dismissing these concerns, acknowledging them in the guideline — with room for initial monotherapy followed by timely escalation — may support a more effective uptake of recommendations while still promoting evidence-based care.

Interviewed GPs generally preferred ACE inhibitors for younger patients. Although this was not explicitly confirmed in the data, their choices may reflect the influence of earlier guidelines — particularly the AB/CD rule, which recommended ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers for younger, non-black patients, and calcium channel blockers or diuretics for older or black patients. ARBs were mainly prescribed for patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors, likely due to their more recent introduction and less established role in practice. We expected to find other prescribing patterns, such as increased use of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers among GPs trained under earlier guidelines, but no consistent trends were observed. Consistent with guidelines, CCBs were preferred for patients of African ancestry. They were also commonly used in patients with higher initial BP, which is not supported by current guidelines. Meanwhile, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers have declined in popularity as first-line options.

### Outcomes in hypertensive black and nonblack patients treated with chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril [^113H6sFS]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Few cardiovascular outcome data are available for blacks with hypertension treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (CCBs).

Objective

To determine whether an ACE inhibitor or CCB is superior to a thiazide-type diuretic in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in racial subgroups.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prespecified subgroup analysis of ALLHAT, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, clinical outcome trial conducted between February 1994 and March 2002 in 33,357 hypertensive US and Canadian patients aged 55 years or older (35% black) with at least 1 other cardiovascular risk factor.

Interventions

Antihypertensive regimens initiated with a CCB (amlodipine) or an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) vs a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone). Other medications were added to achieve goal blood pressures (BPs) less than 140/90 mm Hg.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was combined fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), analyzed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CVD (CHD death, nonfatal MI, stroke, angina, coronary revascularization, heart failure [HF], or peripheral vascular disease), and end-stage renal disease.

Results

No significant difference was found between treatment groups for the primary CHD outcome in either racial subgroup. For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone only, HF was the only prespecified clinical outcome that differed significantly (overall: relative risk [RR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–1.51; blacks: RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24–1.73; nonblacks: RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.17–1.49; P < .001 for each comparison) with no difference in treatment effects by race (P = 0.38 for interaction). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, results differed by race for systolic BP (greater decrease in blacks with chlorthalidone), stroke, and combined CVD outcomes (P < .001, P = 0.01, and P = 0.04, respectively, for interactions). In blacks and nonblacks, respectively, the RRs for stroke were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.17–1.68) and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.85–1.17) and for combined CVD were 1.19 (95% CI, 1.09–1.30) and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.00–1.13). For HF, the RRs were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.10–1.54) and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00–1.28), with no significant interaction by race. Time-dependent BP adjustment did not significantly alter differences in outcome for lisinopril vs chlorthalidone in blacks.

Conclusions

In blacks and nonblack subgroups, rates were not lower in the amlodipine or lisinopril groups than in the chlorthalidone group for either the primary CHD or any other prespecified clinical outcome, and diuretic-based treatment resulted in the lowest risk of heart failure. While the improved outcomes with chlorthalidone were more pronounced for some outcomes in blacks than in nonblacks, thiazide-type diuretics remain the drugs of choice for initial therapy of hypertension in both black and nonblack hypertensive patients.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^1122WjAN]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Our systematic literature search revealed 909 articles: 252 from PubMed, 137 from Embase and 520 from Web of Science. After removal of duplicates, 795 articles were reviewed on the basis of the title and the abstract. This led to the removal of 734 articles. The 61 remaining articles were examined in full text. Of these, 14 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. These 14 articles reported 13 different studies and provided 17 different patient groups for evaluation. The main reasons for exclusion are described in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Flow diagram for identification, screening, and inclusion of papers for this meta-analysis.

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 13 clinical trials included in our meta-analysis. Studies recruited between 25 and 8887 patients and were conducted between 1982 and 2009. All but one, were conducted in the USA. The mean age ranged from 47.5 to 66 years and was typical for hypertensive cohorts. A large variety of ACEIs across the recommended dose range were used. See Additional file 2: Table S2 for details regarding study designs and type of ACEI. Table 2 shows the findings of these 13 clinical trials.

### Baseline characteristics of participants in the antihypertensive and lipid lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT) [^115qQWfk]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

-Diuretics and ss-blockers have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people with hypertension in long-term clinical trials. No study has compared newer more costly antihypertensive agents (calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and alpha-adrenergic blockers) with diuretics for reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease in an ethnically diverse group of middle-aged and elderly hypertensive patients. The study is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial designed to determine whether the incidence of the primary outcome, fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction, differs between treatment initiation with a diuretic versus each of 3 other antihypertensive drugs. Men and women aged ≥ 55 years with at least 1 other cardiovascular disease risk factor were randomly assigned to chlorthalidone (12.5 to 25 mg/d), amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg/d), lisinopril (10 to 40 mg/d), or doxazosin (2 to 8 mg/d) for planned follow-up of 4 to 8 years. This report describes the baseline characteristics of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) participants. A total of 42 448 participants were randomized from 625 sites in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. The mean age was 67 years, with 35% aged ≥ 70 years. Among those randomized, 36% were black, 19% were Hispanic, and 47% were women. The sample includes a high proportion of people with diabetes (36%), patients with existing cardiovascular disease (47%), and smokers (22%). There were no important differences between the randomized treatment groups at baseline. ALLHAT will add greatly to our understanding of the management of hypertension by providing an answer to the following question: are newer antihypertensive agents similar, superior, or inferior to traditional treatment with diuretics?

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^1115n7eo]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to black patients, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating combination therapy including a CCB combined with either a thiazide diuretic or a renin-angiotensin system blocker in black patients from Sub-Saharan Africa requiring BP-lowering treatment.

---

### Fosinopril (fosinopril sodium) [^1151UigR]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics.

Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS).

In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema).

### Comparative effectiveness of calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme / angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics on cardiovascular events likelihood in hypertensive African-American and non-hispanic caucasians: a retrospective study across HCA healthcare [^113sqMu1]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study showed lower odds of being diagnosed with CVE in patients using CCBs compared to ACE/ARBs in both Black and non‐Hispanic Caucasian patient subgroups. ALLHAT trial reported a numerically higher rate of cardiovascular disease in patients using ACEi compared to the CCBs; however, this difference was more prominent in the Black subgroup, which is similar to our finding. In addition, a multi‐center retrospective large‐population study demonstrated a higher risk of composite adverse cardiac outcome in HTN Black patients treated with ACEi compared to CCBs with a Hazard Ratio of 1.45. On the other hand, a subgroup analysis of the Valsartan Antihypertensive Long‐term Use Evaluation (VALUE), which compared clinical outcomes of valsartan and amlodipine‐based treatment, reported no significant difference in terms of composite cardiac mortality and morbidity between these two treatment group regardless of ethnicity. However, because other antihypertensive medications were added to the treatment plan in most cases, these results could not be interpreted as the efficacy of ARB and CCBs in the monotherapy regimen.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide) [^114fJeuK]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension.

These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In using Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk. (See WARNINGS .)

In considering the use of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, it should be noted that ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients.(See WARNINGS, Lisinopril .)

### Treating hypertension in children with-of-1 trials [^1125SV7c]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Clinicians prescribe antihypertensive medication to children with primary hypertension, but without data to define a particular choice as first-line therapy. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be appropriate for these patients. Our aim was to develop a personalized approach to hypertension treatment, using repeated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in n -of-1 trials (single-patient randomized crossover trials).

Methods

Children undergoing hypertension management at a single pediatric referral center were offered participation in an n -of-1 trial with repeated ABPM to compare 3 commonly used medications. The medication producing the greatest blood pressure reduction, and without unacceptable side effects, was selected as the preferred therapy for the individual.

Results

Forty-two children agreed to participate; 7 were normotensive without medication; and 3 failed to complete one treatment cycle. Of the remaining 32 patients, lisinopril was preferred for 16, amlodipine for 8, hydrochlorothiazide for 4, and 4 had uncontrolled blood pressure on maximum doses of monotherapy. In conservative Bayesian analyses, the proportion of patients who preferred lisinopril was 49% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 32% to 69%), 24% (95% CrI: 12% to 41%) preferred amlodipine, and 12% (95% CrI: 4% to 26%) preferred hydrochlorothiazide. The preferred therapy for the majority (67%) of African American participants was lisinopril. Unacceptable side effects were reported in 24% of assessments for hydrochlorothiazide, 16% for lisinopril, and 13% for amlodipine.

Conclusions

No single medication was preferred for more than half of hypertensive children. n of-1 trials with repeated ABPM may promote better informed and individualized decisions in pediatric hypertension management.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^111vxmje]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of 13 unique clinical trials of ACEI therapy for hypertensive adults providing race-stratified systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure results, black race was associated with a consistently lesser response in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after ACEI therapy (4.6 and 2.8 mmHg respectively). The observed differences in blood pressure response are not only statistically significant but also clinically important since a reduction of 4–5 mmHg in SBP and 2–3 mmHg in DBP has been associated with a 8–20% reduction in risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This difference in BP response is also similar to the hypotensive effect of some classes of anti-hypertensive agents such as beta-blockers. These results provide evidence for recent recommendations that ACEI should not preferred for monotherapy in black adults with uncomplicated hypertension, and that calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics may be a better choice. These data have particularly important public health implications for black adults with hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa where hypertension is epidemic and guidelines for the treatment of hypertension must consider cost, availability and population-level, average blood pressure responses.

The difference in blood pressure response to ACEI monotherapy between blacks and whites observed in this meta-analysis appears to be related to race and is not entirely explainable by other factors. One-study-removed analysis and funnel plots showed no evidence of overinfluence by a single study or of publication bias. We also performed careful metaregression to estimate the impact of possible confounders such as age, baseline blood pressure, duration of treatment, study quality and ACEI dose. Of these factors, only ACEI dose had some mitigating effect on the difference in blood pressure response. Higher doses of ACEI may be beneficial among black adults who require ACEI therapy for hypertension although higher doses may be associated with more adverse effects. One additional, possible confounder in the relationship between race and ACE-inhibitor response is salt intake. Three of the studies included in this meta-analysis investigated the impact of salt intake on the relationship race and ACE-inhibitor with mixed results. The most rigorous of these studies demonstrated that salt-sensitive black adults had a consistently lesser blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors whether the subjects were consuming a high or low salt diet. It also showed that a low salt diet was associated with less response to ACEIs among all races.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^117RaNna]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Black patients of African or Caribbean descent

Latin American Society of Hypertension and ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a thiazide-like diuretic or a CCB as the first-line treatment for black patients in monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy.

Several studies support the idea that diuretics are particularly efficacious in this patient population. In a sub-analysis of ALLHAT in black patients (n = 11 792), the relative risks for stroke, heart failure, and combined endpoints for coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease were significantly lower with chlorthalidone treatment than with lisinopril treatment. Moreover, in an analysis of an electronic record database, after propensity score matching (n = 10 674), treatment of black patients with ACE inhibitors was associated with a significantly higher risk of the primary outcome [composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke: hazard ratio 1.65 (95% CI: 1.33–2.05), P < 0.0001], myocardial infarction [hazard ratio 4.00 (95% CI: 1.34–11.96), P = 0.01], stroke [hazard ratio 1.97 (95% CI: 1.34–2.92), P = 0.001], heart failure [hazard ratio 3.00 (95% CI: 1.99–4.54), P < 0.0001], and all-cause mortality [hazard ratio 1.35 (95% CI: 1.03–1.76), P = 0.03] compared with treatment with diuretics.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^116mB1qu]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

African American hypertension with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — AASK and ALLHAT findings and add-on diuretic rationale are summarized. In the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), ACEIs were found to be more effective than beta-blockers or LA DHP CCBs in slowing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline among African American patients with proteinuria, and the AASK trial would suggest that African Americans with CKD should be placed on an ACEI, but the ALLHAT study reported that chlorthalidone was superior to lisinopril for CVD outcomes in African Americans; therefore, for African American patients with CKD on monotherapy with an ACEI or an ARB, the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic would be appropriate as additional therapy, and providers may refer to the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Disease for further discussion of use of an ACEI or ARB in patients with CKD.

### Revisiting race and the benefit of RAS blockade in heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115desuu]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Concerns have arisen that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are less effective in Black patients than non-Black patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Objective

To determine whether the effects of RAS blockers on cardiovascular outcomes differ between Black patients and non-Black patients with HFrEF.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Embase databases through December 31, 2023.

Study Selection

Randomized trials investigating the effect of RAS blockers on cardiovascular outcomes in adults with HFrEF that enrolled Black and non-Black patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Individual-participant data were extracted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Independent Personal Data (PRISMA-IPD) reporting guidelines. Effects were estimated using a mixed-effects model using a 1-stage approach.

Main Outcome and Measure

The primary outcome was first hospitalization for HF or cardiovascular death.

Results

The primary analysis, based on the 3 placebo-controlled RAS inhibitor monotherapy trials, included 8825 patients (9.9% Black). Rates of death and hospitalization for HF were substantially higher in Black than non-Black patients. The hazard ratio (HR) for RAS blockade vs placebo for the primary composite was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69–1.03) in Black patients and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.67–0.79) in non-Black patients (P for interaction = .14). The HR for first HF hospitalization was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.70–1.13) in Black patients and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.56–0.69) in non-Black patients (P for interaction = .006). Conversely, the corresponding HRs for cardiovascular death were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.65–1.07) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77–0.93), respectively (P for interaction = .99). For total hospitalizations for HF and cardiovascular deaths, the corresponding rate ratios were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66–1.02) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.66–0.80), respectively (P for interaction = .27). The supportive analyses including the 2 trials adding an angiotensin receptor blocker to background angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment (n = 16 383) gave consistent findings.

Conclusions and Relevance

The mortality benefit from RAS blockade was similar in Black and non-Black patients. Despite the smaller relative risk reduction in hospitalization for HF with RAS blockade in Black patients, the absolute benefit in Black patients was comparable with non-Black patients because of the greater incidence of this outcome in Black patients.

### A randomized controlled crossover trial evaluating differential responses to antihypertensive drugs (used as mono-or dual therapy) on the basis of ethnicity: the comparIsoN oF optimal hypertension regiMens; part of the ancestry informative markers in HYpertension program-AIM-HY INFORM trial [^113N5ELT]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Although data relating to Asians in the North American literature are limited — and where it is available, "Asian" frequently equates to "Far Eastern" (Chinese, Japanese, etc), — results from several large US studies provide some evidence of ethnic variation in response to antihypertensive drugs. In broad terms, greater falls in BP are achieved with thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics in black subjects with hypertension when compared to their white peers; conversely, ACEi are less effective in this cohort. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, patients on chlorthalidone achieved better BP control than those receiving lisinopril or amlodipine. Those using lisinopril had a greater risk for stroke (risk ratio [RR]: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17–1.68), combined cardiovascular disease (RR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09–1.30), and heart failure (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.10–1.54) compared with those receiving chlorthalidone, treatment differences which were far more pronounced in African Americans when compared with whites. Furthermore, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial researchers reported a higher risk of stroke in African American hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril as opposed to amlodipine (RR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.22–1.86), an association which was not observed in non–African Americans (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.89–1.28). Subsequent meta-analyses reiterate these findings, demonstrating no evident benefit from ACEi in achieving diastolic blood pressure (DBP) goals for African American hypertensive patients. Conversely, ACEi may offer substantial benefits for African Americans with hypertensive renal disease; in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, ramipril slowed renal disease progression in African Americans irrespective of whether proteinuria was present, more so than amlodipine or metoprolol. However, demographic differences with the United Kingdom (eg, a large South Asian population, population "admixture", first/second-generation immigrants as opposed to a population resident for 2–3 centuries), along with variations in vascular risk, diet, and weight, restrict the utility of US data.

African American hypertension — ALLHAT and LIFE trial findings identify differential effects by drug class. Among ALLHAT participants, 35% were African American, and subgroup analyses found that the ACEI (lisinopril) was less effective in lowering blood pressure than the thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone) or the long-acting dihydropyridine (LA DHP) CCB (amlodipine); African American participants randomized to the ACEI versus the thiazide-type diuretic were at a 40% greater risk of stroke, 30% greater risk of heart failure, 19% greater risk of CVD, and 15% greater risk of combined CHD, with no difference in major CVD outcomes between the thiazide-type diuretic and the LA DHP CCB other than a higher incidence of heart failure with the CCB, and amlodipine showed greater adherence and fewer medications to reach blood pressure goals than lisinopril, while the LIFE study reported better cardiovascular outcomes with the beta-blocker (atenolol) than with the ARB (losartan) in African Americans.

### Comparison of dual therapies for lowering blood pressure in black Africans [^1158aPUb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

The prevalence of hypertension among black African patients is high, and these patients usually need two or more medications for blood-pressure control. However, the most effective two-drug combination that is currently available for blood-pressure control in these patients has not been established.

Methods

In this randomized, single-blind, three-group trial conducted in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we randomly assigned 728 black patients with uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg while the patient was not being treated or was taking only one antihypertensive drug) to receive a daily regimen of 5 mg of amlodipine plus 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, 5 mg of amlodipine plus 4 mg of perindopril, or 4 mg of perindopril plus 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide for 2 months. Doses were then doubled (10 and 25 mg, 10 and 8 mg, and 8 and 25 mg, respectively) for an additional 4 months. The primary end point was the change in the 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure between baseline and 6 months.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 51 years, and 63% were women. Among the 621 patients who underwent 24-hour blood-pressure monitoring at baseline and at 6 months, those receiving amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide and those receiving amlodipine plus perindopril had a lower 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure than those receiving perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (between-group difference in the change from baseline, -3.14 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.90 to -0.38; P = 0.03; and -3.00 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.8 to -0.20; P = 0.04, respectively). The difference between the group receiving amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide and the group receiving amlodipine plus perindopril was -0.14 mm Hg (95% CI, -2.90 to 2.61; P = 0.92). Similar differential effects on office and ambulatory diastolic blood pressures, along with blood-pressure control and response rates, were apparent among the three groups.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that in black patients in sub-Saharan Africa, amlodipine plus either hydrochlorothiazide or perindopril was more effective than perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide at lowering blood pressure at 6 months.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide) [^1118i5xQ]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS).

ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.

While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to lisinopril monotherapy than non-black patients.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of lisinopril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with Zestril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 6% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with Zestril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had a mean decrease in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L; approximately 4% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 12% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.

ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of Zestril remains to be elucidated.

While the mechanism through which Zestril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, Zestril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although Zestril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non Black patients.

Concomitant administration of Zestril and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and non-Black patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident.

### WITHDRAWN: effect of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure in blacks [^116YyP1F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Black people have a greater prevalence of elevated blood pressure leading to excess morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

To systematically review the effects of different antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure black adults with elevated blood pressure.

Search Strategy

Medline, Embase, LILACS, African Index Medicus, the Cochrane Library November 2003; Pubmed September 2003 to March 2004. Searches were conducted without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of drugs versus placebo (blood pressure outcomes) or versus placebo or other drugs (morbidity and mortality outcomes).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data unblinded. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Authors were contacted twice to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Full reports or abstracts from more than 2900 references of papers yielded 30 trials considering 53 interventions with 8 classes of antihypertensive drugs in 20,006 black patients from Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States of America, aged 18 to > 80 years. In one large trial the main morbidity and mortality outcomes did not differ significantly between initial treatment drug classes when drugs were added to reach goal blood pressures. However, the comparison ACE Inhibitors vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for stroke 1.40 [1.17 to 1.68]; combined CHD 1.15 [1.02 to 1.30] and combined CVD 1.19 [1.09 to 1.30] and the comparison alpha blocker vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for combined CVD 1.40 [1.25 to 1.57]. In addition, all comparisons for heart failure favoured diuretic (1.47 [1.24 to 1.74] vs calcium blocker; 1.32 [1.11 to 1.58] vs ACE Inhibitor; and 2.18 [1.73 to 2.74] vs alpha blocker. The results also showed a greater occurrence of diabetes with diuretics. No significant differences were detected between placebo and beta adrenergic blockers in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference [95% CI], -3.52 [-7.50 to 0.46] mm Hg). In addition, ACE inhibitors did not significantly differ from placebo in achievement of goal diastolic blood pressure (risk difference [95% CI], 5% [-10% to 21%]). Calcium blockers, diuretics, centrally acting agents, alpha adrenergic blockers and angiotensin II antagonists were all more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure in the pooled analyses. Only calcium blockers remained effective in all prespecified subgroups, including baseline diastolic blood pressure > 109 mm Hg.

Authors' Conclusions

When first-line drugs from different classes are compared in the treatment of black people, there is no evidence of differential effects on most mortality and morbidity outcomes. Those morbidity differences that were found favoured diuretics. Drugs differ in their ability to reduce blood pressure in black people. Calcium blockers were the only drug class that reduced blood pressure in all subgroups of black people including those with severe hypertension. Beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blocker, alpha blockers and ACE Inhibitors were least good at reducing blood pressure in black adults.

### Comparison of valsartan 160 mg with lisinopril 20 mg, given as monotherapy or in combination with a diuretic, for the treatment of hypertension: the blood pressure reduction and tolerability of valsartan in comparison with lisinopril (PREVAIL) study [^113bCLCF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to provide good blood pressure (BP) control without eliciting adverse effects.

Objective

This study compared the risk-benefit profile of the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan with that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril in patients with mild to severe hypertension. The primary objective was to show that the equipotent BP-lowering effect of the valsartan-based treatment is accompanied by a better tolerability profile.

Methods

This 16-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted at 88 outpatient centers across Italy. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients aged ≥ 18 years with mild to severe hypertension (systolic BP [SBP], 160–220 mm Hg; diastolic BP [DBP], 95–110 mm Hg) were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive once-daily, oral, self-administered treatment with valsartan 160-mg capsules or lisinopril 20-mg capsules under double-blind conditions for 4 weeks. Responders continued monotherapy, whereas nonresponders had hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg added for the final 12 weeks of the study. The 2 primary variables used to assess the equivalence of therapeutic efficacy of the 2 regimens were sitting SBP and sitting DBP, which were measured at weeks 0 (baseline), 4, 8, and 16. The rate of drug-related adverse events (AEs) was used to assess whether 1 treatment had a better tolerability profile than the other. Tolerability was assessed by collecting information about AEs by means of questioning the patient or physical examination at each visit.

Results

A total of 1213 patients were enrolled (635 men, 578 women; mean [SD] age, 54.5 [10.1] years [range, 28–78 years]). The study was completed by 1100 patients (553 receiving valsartan and 547 receiving lisinopril). Fifty-one patients (8.4%) treated with valsartan and 62 (10.2%) treated with lisinopril withdrew, mainly because of AEs (9 [1.5%] and 23 patients [3.8%], respectively). The valsartan- and lisinopril-based treatments were similarly effective in reducing sitting BP, with mean SBP/DBP reductions of 31.2/15.9 mm Hg and 31.4/15.9 mm Hg, respectively. At the end of the study, BP was controlled in 82.6% of the patients receiving valsartan and 81.6% of those receiving lisinopril. AEs were experienced by 5.1% of the patients treated with valsartan and 10.7% of those treated with lisinopril (P = 0.0001), with dry cough observed in 1.0% and 7.2% of patients, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Valsartan and lisinopril were both highly effective in controlling BP in these patients with mild to severe hypertension, but valsartan was associated with a significantly reduced risk for AEs, especially cough.

### Rationale and design of the comparison of 3 combination therapies in lowering blood pressure in black Africans (CREOLE study): 2 × 3 factorial randomized single-blind multicenter trial [^1141XyuP]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current hypertension guidelines recommend the use of combination therapy as first-line treatment or early in the management of hypertensive patients. Although there are many possible combinations of blood pressure(BP)-lowering therapies, the best combination for the black population is still a subject of debate because no large randomized controlled trials have been conducted in this group to compare the efficacy of different combination therapies to address this issue.

Methods

The comparison of 3 combination therapies in lowering BP in the black Africans (CREOLE) study is a randomized single-blind trial that will compare the efficacy of amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide versus amlodipine plus perindopril and versus perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide in blacks residing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Seven hundred two patients aged 30–79 years with a sitting systolic BP of 140 mm Hg and above, and less than 160 mm Hg on antihypertensive monotherapy, or sitting systolic BP of 150 mm Hg and above, and less than 180 mm Hg on no treatment, will be centrally randomized into any of the 3 arms (234 into each arm). The CREOLE study is taking place in 10 sites in SSA, and the primary outcome measure is change in ambulatory systolic BP from baseline to 6 months. The first patient was randomized in June 2017, and the trial will be concluded by 2019.

Conclusions

The CREOLE trial will provide unique information as to the most efficacious 2-drug combination in blacks residing in SSA and thereby inform the development of clinical guidelines for the treatment of hypertension in this subregion.

### Determinants of blood pressure response to quinapril in black and white hypertensive patients: the quinapril titration interval management evaluation trial [^116L327H]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Race has been considered an important factor in determining blood pressure response to treatment and selection of antihypertensive drug therapy. Data collected during a clinical trial that evaluated rapidity of medication up-titration with blood pressure response to monotherapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril were used to characterize response in 533 black and 2046 white participants. Our objectives were to examine the influence of race and other factors on blood pressure response and to assess the degree to which nonrace factors account for apparent racial differences in response. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses (baseline minus follow-up) to treatment were assessed with treatment groups combined. Crude systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses averaged 4.7 and 2.4 mm Hg less, respectively, in black compared with white participants; however, the response distributions largely overlapped. In multivariate linear regression models adjusted for study design variables and measured participant characteristics, the racial difference in systolic response was reduced by 51% to 2.3 mm Hg, and diastolic response by 21% to 1.9 mm Hg. In these models, participant characteristics, including age, gender, body size, and pretreatment blood pressure severity, significantly predicted either attenuated or enhanced blood pressure response to treatment. Our findings demonstrate that a large source of variability of blood pressure response to treatment is within, not between, racial groups, and that factors that vary at the level of the individual contribute to apparent racial differences in response to treatment.

Hypertension in ethnic groups — treatment recommendations: It is recommended that a two-drug combination, usually as an SPC, is used as initial therapy for most black patients (Class I, Level C). In black patients, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a diuretic or a CCB, either in combination or with a RAS blocker (Class I, Level B). In other ethnic groups, BP-lowering treatment may be based on the core treatment algorithm (Class IIb, Level C). Except in patients with low grade 1 hypertension or frail older patients, in whom initial treatment with a single drug may be more appropriate, and angioedema is more common with ACE inhibitors and thus ARBs may be preferred.

### Clinical events in high-risk hypertensive patients randomly assigned to calcium channel blocker versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial [^116nM2Lr]. Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) provides a unique opportunity to compare the long-term relative safety and efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker-initiated therapy in older hypertensive individuals. Patients were randomized to amlodipine (n = 9048) or lisinopril (n = 9054). The primary outcome was combined fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, combined cardiovascular disease (CVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. Blood pressure control was similar in nonblacks, but not in blacks. No significant differences were found between treatment groups for the primary outcome, all-cause mortality, ESRD, or cancer. Stroke rates were higher on lisinopril in blacks (RR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.86) but not in nonblacks (RR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.28), and in women (RR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.79), but not in men (RR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.31). Rates of combined CVD were higher (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12) because of higher rates for strokes, peripheral arterial disease, and angina, which were partly offset by lower rates for heart failure (RR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.96) on lisinopril compared with amlodipine. Gastrointestinal bleeds and angioedema were higher on lisinopril. Patients with and without baseline coronary heart disease showed similar outcome patterns. We conclude that in hypertensive patients, the risks for coronary events are similar, but for stroke, combined CVD, gastrointestinal bleeding, and angioedema are higher and for heart failure are lower for lisinopril-based compared with amlodipine-based therapy. Some, but not all, of these differences may be explained by less effective blood pressure control in the lisinopril arm.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^116ET2nc]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

More than 70% of adults treated for primary hypertension will eventually require at least two antihypertensive agents, either initially as combination therapy or as add-on therapy if monotherapy and lifestyle modifications do not achieve adequate blood pressure control. Four main classes of medications are used in combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension: thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACEIs and ARBs should not be used simultaneously. In black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should be treated initially with a beta blocker and an ACEI or ARB (or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor), followed by add-on therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a diuretic based on volume status. Treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria should include an ACEI or ARB plus a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be treated similarly to those without diabetes unless proteinuria is present, in which case combination therapy should include an ACEI or ARB.

### Mortality and morbidity among individuals with hypertension receiving a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117KpA1Y]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial comparing initial antihypertensive treatment with a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), or an α-blocker (doxazosin), all compared with a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone) for the composite outcome of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). The doxazosin group was terminated early due to a higher incidence of cardiovascular events. Participants in the other 3 groups were followed up for a mean (SD) of 4.9 (1.3) years during the trial, with 6-year primary outcome rates per 100 persons ranging from 11.3 to 11.5. No significant differences were detected among the 3 treatment groups for the primary outcome and all-cause mortality. Compared with the chlorthalidone group, the amlodipine group had a higher rate of heart failure (HF), and the lisinopril group had higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and HF.

A previous study reported mortality and morbidity outcomes of ALLHAT participants during 8 to 13 years after randomization using in-trial data plus posttrial data from administrative databases to assess the long-term effects of first-step antihypertensive treatment. During the posttrial period, no significant differences were detected among the 3 treatment groups for the primary outcome. Compared with chlorthalidone, the risk of HF was higher for the amlodipine group, and the risk of stroke mortality was higher for the lisinopril group (particularly for Black participants).

We linked the data to obtain an additional 11 years of passive administrative data since the last report, for a total of 19 to 24 years of follow-up after randomization. We aimed to determine whether the aforementioned legacy effects (ie, the observed in-trial differences) persisted after the trial and whether the increase in the incidence of events resulting from longer follow-up led to sufficient power to detect differences among the randomization groups.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^1124e2kh]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### Lisinopril (qbrelis) [^116gjyMs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1 Hypertension

Two dose-response studies utilizing a once-daily regimen were conducted in 438 mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic. Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dosing. An antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was seen with 5 mg of lisinopril in some patients. However, in both studies blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with 10, 20 or 80 mg of lisinopril than patients treated with 5 mg of lisinopril.

In controlled clinical studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20–80 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily or atenolol 50‑200 mg daily; and in other studies of patients with moderate to severe hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20–80 mg daily or metoprolol 100–200 mg daily. Lisinopril demonstrated superior reductions of systolic and diastolic compared to hydrochlorothiazide in a population that was 75% Caucasian. Lisinopril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure.

Lisinopril had similar blood pressure reductions and adverse effects in younger and older (> 65 years) patients. It was less effective in reducing blood pressure in Blacks than in Caucasians.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^116FTHSg]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The appropriateness of using the Black race to guide the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy, therefore, warrants careful consideration. While practice guidelines, favor calcium-channel blockers and diuretics for Black adults with hypertension, these are typically recommended as part of combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker rather than as monotherapy. Importantly, race-specific differences in average blood pressure responses do not reliably predict individual responses to single-drug therapy, as the BP response distributions overlap significantly between Black and White adults. Therefore, there is no clear advantage to using race as a determinant for selecting single-drug therapy in patients for whom monotherapy is otherwise appropriate.

The Kaiser Permanente's Gardena Medical Offices in the United States implemented a comprehensive hypertension control program to address racial disparities in blood pressure management. The program that included a patient population that was 65% Black utilized a team-based approach, culturally tailored communication, physician-led initiatives to reduce therapeutic inertia, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. A race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm was also introduced to guide treatment decisions. The program initially aimed to close the racial gap in blood pressure control (< 140/90 mm Hg), which stood at 6.3% (76.6% control in Black patients versus 82.9% in others). Over several years, blood pressure control rates among Black patients improved to 81.4%, reducing the disparity to 2.8%. This demonstrated that high blood pressure control rates and reduced racial disparities can be achieved without race-specific prescribing, particularly when combined with intensive, guideline-aligned care and efforts to avoid therapeutic inertia.

### Valsartan in combination with lisinopril versus the respective high dose monotherapies in hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria: the VALERIA trial [^11387McU]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Microalbuminuria is known as an independent predictor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. The purpose of the VALERIA trial was a comparison of the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of valsartan and lisinopril with valsartan and lisinopril high-dose monotherapy in patients with hypertension and microalbuminuria.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, interventional, parallel-group study. After a washout/placebo-run-in phase of 3 weeks, 133 patients were randomized to treatment (1: 1:1) with either lisinopril 40 mg, valsartan 320 mg, or a combination of valsartan/lisinopril 320/20 mg for 30 weeks.

Results

At baseline, the urine albumin creatinine ratio was similar for the three treatment groups (geometric means, lisinopril 9.6 mg/mmol, valsartan 9.1 mg/mmol, and valsartan/lisinopril 9.5 mg/mmol). After 30 weeks of treatment, the geometric mean urine albumin creatinine ratio had decreased in all three groups by 41, 51, and 62% to 5.7 mg/mmol (lisinopril), 4.5 mg/mmol (valsartan), and 3.6 mg/mmol (valsartan/lisinopril). The decrease for valsartan/lisinopril was statistically significantly greater compared with lisinopril [adjusted ratio 60%, confidence interval (38–94%), P = 0.029]. Normalization of microalbuminuria was greatest with valsartan and valsartan/lisinopril (lisinopril 17%, valsartan 31%, and valsartan/lisinopril 38% of patients) and was statistically significant for lisinopril in contrast with valsartan/lisinopril (P = 0.034). Differences in blood pressure reduction between the groups were not statistically significant. All treatments were safe and well tolerated.

Conclusion

The combination of valsartan and lisinopril provided a significantly better reduction of urine albumin creatinine ratio and more than doubled the rate of patients with normalized urine albumin creatinine ratio compared with lisinopril alone. All treatments were safe and well tolerated.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^114jrrGo]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacogenomic factors studied include polymorphisms in the ACE gene. The ACE insertion/deletion genotype ACE DD (30% of all participants; 33% of all participants of African ancestry, n = 13,070) had a poorer response to lisinopril treatment than to any of the other three drugs in the GenHAT study. However, the effect was small, a difference of 0.85 mm Hg systolic (SE 0.51) and 0.50 mm Hg diastolic (SE 0.28), with "similar" results reported for the subgroup analysis for patients of African ancestry.

In the AASK study, participants randomized to ramipril (n = 347) were genotyped at three polymorphisms on ACE, downstream from the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism: G12269A, C17888T and G20037A. Only participants with a homozygous genotype at G12269A and C17888T, and randomized to the usual mean arterial pressure goal (≤ 107 mm Hg) reached a blood pressure goal significantly faster than those with a heterozygous genotype (adjusted hazard ratio respectively 1.86; 95% CI 1.32 to 3.23, and 1.49; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.13, potentially due to linkage disequilibrium with ACE I/D.

### Efficacy of different drug classes used to initiate antihypertensive treatment in black subjects… [^112K2Uyo]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

At 13 months, more patients continued receiving monotherapy with nifedipine or verapamil than hydrochlorothiazide or enalapril. A sustained decrease of left ventricular mass with no between-group differences was achieved at 4 and 13 months. Similarly, at 13 months, more patients continued to receive monotherapy with nifedipine GITS or verapamil SR than with hydrochlorothiazide or enalapril. Because many patients proceeded to combination therapy, the BP differences observed on monotherapy at 2 months disappeared at 13 months. At 2 months the rate of BP control was higher for the patients receiving nifedipine GITS treatment than for those patients receiving verapamil SR, hydrochlorothiazide, or enalapril.

Monotherapy with nifedipine GITS reduced BP significantly more than hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril. At 13 months more patients continued receiving monotherapy with nifedipine GITS or verapamil SR than hydrochlorothiazide or enalapril. Low rates of BP control have been previously documented in black patients with hypertension who were receiving treatment with captopril, 12 enalapril, 16, 17 or hydrochlorothiazide. 18 On balance, the evidence available suggests that ACE inhibitors should not be used as monotherapy in black patients with hypertension, but only in combination with other medications. 14 At 13 months, the addition of hydrochlorothiazide and/or other drugs achieved BP control in 79. 3% of patients randomized to enalapril treatment. Furthermore, at the end of the study, the addition of reserpine and/or enalapril to hydrochlorothiazide treatment resulted in a control of 66. 7%.

### Efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in reducing progression from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to symptomatic heart failure in black and white patients [^111ECQWD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was undertaken to determine whether enalapril had comparable efficacy in black and white patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD) in preventing the development of symptomatic heart failure (HF).

Background

Recent studies have suggested that black patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction may derive less benefit than white patients with HF when treated with the same medication.

Methods

This is a post hoc analysis of the 4,054 black and white participants of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction Prevention Trial.

Results

Randomization to enalapril was associated with a comparable reduction in the relative risk of the development of symptomatic HF in black (relative risk [RR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49, 0.92, p = 0.01) and white patients (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.53, 0.70, p < 0.001). Treatment with enalapril was also associated with a comparable reduction in the risk of the development of HF requiring medical therapy and the composite end point of death or development of HF in black and white patients. Black as compared with white patients with ALVD were at increased risk of the development of symptomatic HF (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.51, 2.17, p < 0.001) despite adjustment for available measures of disease severity.

Conclusions

Despite the increased absolute risk in black patients compared with white patients for the progression of ALVD, enalapril was equally efficacious in reducing the risk of progression of ALVD in these two ethnic groups.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to black patients, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend to use a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB for initial antihypertensive treatment in black adults with HTN but without HF or CKD, including those with diabetes mellitus.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^1131p2ZY]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Among African-Americans adults, arterial hypertension is both more prevalent and associated with more complications than among white adults. Hypertension is also epidemic among black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The treatment of hypertension among black adults may be complicated by lesser response to certain classes of anti-hypertensive agents.

Methods

We systematically searched literature for clinical trials of ACE-inhibitors among hypertensive adults comparing blood pressure response between whites and blacks. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response. Further analysis including meta-regressions, funnel plots, and one-study-removed analyses were performed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity or bias.

Results

In a meta-analysis of 13 trials providing 17 different patient groups for evaluation, black race was associated with a lesser reduction in systolic (mean difference: 4.6 mmHg (95% CI 3.5–5.7)) and diastolic (mean difference: 2.8 mmHg (95% CI 2.2–3.5)) blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors, with little heterogeneity. Meta-regression revealed only ACE-inhibitor dosage as a significant source of heterogeneity. There was little evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions

Black race is consistently associated with a clinically significant lesser reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to ACE-inhibitor therapy in clinical trials in the USA and Europe. In black adults requiring monotherapy for uncomplicated hypertension, drugs other than ACE-inhibitors may be preferred, though the proven benefits of ACE-inhibitors in some sub-groups and the large overlap of response between blacks and whites must be remembered. These data are particularly important for interpretation of clinical drug trials for hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa and for the development of treatment recommendations in this population.

### Quinapril hydrochloride (Accupril) [^117UcuSQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure

ACCUPRIL is indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics and/or digitalis.

In using ACCUPRIL, consideration should be given to the fact that another ACE inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that ACCUPRIL does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS).

Angioedema in black patients: Black patients receiving ACE inhibitor monotherapy have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks. It should also be noted that in controlled clinical trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (Zestoretic) [^115b56gG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide

As a result of its diuretic effects, hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, and decreases serum potassium. Administration of lisinopril blocks the renin-angiotensin aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.

In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The ZESTORETIC 10–12.5 combination worked equally well in black and white patients. The ZESTORETIC 20–12.5 and ZESTORETIC 20–25 combinations appeared somewhat less effective in black patients, but relatively few black patients were studied. In most patients, the antihypertensive effect of ZESTORETIC was sustained for at least 24 hours.

In a randomized, controlled comparison, the mean antihypertensive effects of ZESTORETIC 20–12.5 and ZESTORETIC 20–25 were similar, suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter combination may be controlled with ZESTORETIC 20–12.5 (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has little or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug. The combination tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets (lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide) [^115AmmCW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In using lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk. (See WARNINGS .)

In considering use of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, it should be noted that Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-Black. (See WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema .)

### Lisinopril [^111jFMkL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Hypertension

Two dose-response studies utilizing a once-daily regimen were conducted in 438 mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic. Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dosing. An antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was seen with 5 mg of lisinopril in some patients. However, in both studies blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with 10 mg, 20 mg or 80 mg of lisinopril than patients treated with 5 mg of lisinopril.

In controlled clinical studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20 mg to 80 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg to 50 mg daily or atenolol 50 mg to 200 mg daily; and in other studies of patients with moderate to severe hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20 mg to 80 mg daily or metoprolol 100 mg to 200 mg daily. Lisinopril demonstrated superior reductions of systolic and diastolic compared to hydrochlorothiazide in a population that was 75% Caucasian. Lisinopril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure.

Lisinopril had similar blood pressure reductions and adverse effects in younger and older (> 65 years) patients. It was less effective in reducing blood pressure in Blacks than in Caucasians.

### Renal outcomes in hypertensive black patients at high cardiovascular risk [^1164qBdF]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The ACCOMPLISH trial (Avoiding Cardiovascular events through Combination therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) was a 3-year multicenter, event-driven trial involving patients with high cardiovascular risk who were randomized in a double-blinded manner to benazepril plus either hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine and titrated in parallel to reach recommended blood pressure goals. Of the 8125 participants in the United States, 1414 were of self-described Black ethnicity. The composite kidney disease end point, defined as a doubling in serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease, or death was not different between Black and non-Black patients, although the Blacks were significantly more likely to develop a greater than 50% increase in serum creatinine to a level above 2.6 mg/dl. We found important early differences in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) due to acute hemodynamic effects, indicating that benazepril plus amlodipine was more effective in stabilizing eGFR compared to benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in non-Blacks. There was no difference in the mean eGFR loss in Blacks between therapies. Thus, benazepril coupled to amlodipine was a more effective antihypertensive treatment than when coupled to hydrochlorothiazide in non-Black patients to reduced kidney disease progression. Blacks have a modestly higher increased risk for more advanced increases in serum creatinine than non-Blacks.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^112hemUj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Additional Insights

While JNC 8 has the same treatment recommendations for people with or without diabetes, most other societies suggest that only ACEIs or ARBs should be first‐line treatment for patients with diabetes. In the case of patients with diabetes and a history of CKD, we agree that ACEIs or ARBs should be first line.

In the black population with hypertension, CCBs and thiazide diuretics generally tend to be favored as initial therapy over renin‐angiotensin system blockers. 13, 14, 45 The evidence for this recommendation comes from ALLHAT, which showed in prespecified subgroup analysis that black patients treated with lisinopril had higher rates of stroke, CVD, and HF plus 4 mm Hg higher SBP compared with those treated with chlorthalidone. 49

On the other hand, the primary and secondary outcomes were similar in the chlorthalidone and amlodipine groups except for higher rates of HF with amlodipine. Compared with lisinopril, the black patients in the amlodipine group had lower stroke rates and improved BP control. Therefore, both CCBs and thiazide diuretics are considered first line for black patients with hypertension.

If a black patient has coexisting CKD, initial treatment should be an ACEI or ARB if the patient also has albuminuria, as supported by the KDIGO guidelines. This recommendation, for starting with CCBs and thiazides is generalized to black patients with diabetes, because nearly half of the black patients in ALLHAT had diabetes. Given that most patients require > 1 agent to control hypertension, it is important to know that combination treatment with CCB or diuretics plus rennin‐angiotensin system blockade leads to the same efficacy in black or white patients. The International Society for Hypertension in Blacks suggests starting with a CCB or thiazide diuretic if < 10 mm Hg above target or using a 2‐drug approach if > 15/10 mm Hg over with a CCB or diuretic plus a rennin‐angiotensin system blocker. 13

### Recommendations for the management of special populations: racial and ethnic populations [^116gQdVh]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

One of the current challenges in the treatment of hypertension is the variation in the incidence and morbidity among ethnic populations. For example, in the recent Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), in which 35% of the patients were African American, the diuretic chlorthalidone was associated with greater reductions in blood pressure (BP) than the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and was also associated with a relative risk reduction in stroke compared with lisinopril. However, the increased stroke risk associated with lisinopril was experienced among African American but not non-African American patients. ALLHAT did not permit combination therapy with ACE inhibitors plus diuretics; therefore, the benefits of such regimens in this patient population could not be assessed. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, in contrast to the overall study population, African American patients with left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol were at lower risk of experiencing the primary composite end point (death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) than African Americans treated with losartan, with or without diuretics. On the other hand, in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, African American patients treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril had a significantly lower incidence of the primary composite end point (glomerular filtration rate reduction, end-stage renal disease, or death) than African Americans treated with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Although the use of diuretics in African American patients may be a logical first-line choice for BP reduction, most patients will require combination therapy. African American patients with systolic BP ≥ 15 mm Hg above target level or a diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg above target should be considered for first-line combination therapy. Although certain combinations have been shown to be effective in non-African American patients, the choice of drugs for combination therapy in African American patients may be different.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Combination therapy and SPCs — Combination therapy "is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering BP and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy", though "a stepped-care approach can be effective for BP lowering if well-executed". "Initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably in an SPC to improve adherence and BP control". For candidates for initial combination therapy, thresholds include "SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 10 mm Hg above their goal", and "starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence". "Available RCT evidence supports using an RAS blocker with either a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB as initial therapy". "Several small RCTs have demonstrated that low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together reduce BP more effectively than monotherapy over 3 to 6 months of treatment; however, none of these trials have evaluated CVD prevention". "In general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk". "However, BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop".

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^111Qh1e8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Another double blind, parallel group randomized study for 12 weeks comparing the combination therapy of felodipine and metoprolol (5/50mg) with either monotherapy exhibited significantly greater antihypertensive response (98%) with combination compared to monotherapy (felodipine- 79% and metoprolol- 82%). A significant greater reduction in mean systolic/diastolic BP (28/18 mmHg) with combination therapy was evinced compared to either felodipine (18/12 mm hg) or metoprolol (19/12 mm hg).

The long-term (I year) efficacy and safety between lisinopril and trichlormethazide combination therapy and lisinopril monotherapy was investigated in a multi-centre open label trial on 466 patients. It showed effective BP reduction to < 150/90 mmHg in both the groups throughout the study period. Additionally the combination of trichlormethazide reversed the increase in serum potassium observed in the monotherapy group.

The results of these studies emphasize that multiple-drug therapy was both safe and effective compared to monotherapy and will be required in most patients to attain BP goals.

Many panels including Hypertension in African Americans Working Group (HAAWG), JNC 7, The Task Force for the Management of arterial Hypertension of the ESH and of the European Society of Cardiology have strongly supported that treatment initiation with 2 or if needed 3 drugs is justified in many cases of hypertension management. There are other various advantages with combination therapy. Combining the drugs makes them available in a convenient dosing format, lowers the dose and can be given in once daily schedule thus improving compliance. There is an additive or synergistic antihypertensive effect at lower doses of individual components and at the same time the drugs in combination counteract the side effects of each other. This helps more patients to achieve normal BP and even can be effective in hard-to-treat populations. Early normalization of BP may greatly motivate the patients to adhere to lifelong treatment.

### Hypertension in black people: pathophysiology and therapeutic aspects [^1125wTe8]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Salt sensitivity is regarded as an important contributor to the higher risk of hypertension in black people as compared with whites. This finding is in agreement with a better response to diuretics than to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in black subjects. It is important to remember that the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitor is augmented in patients on a thiazide diuretic. Moreover, the antihypertensive response to a specific drug varies among black patients. Thus, ACE inhibitors should also be viewed as important options to treat hypertensive black subjects. Results from clinical trials support an emphasis on lifestyle modification and a more intensive blood pressure lowering by pharmacological interventions to reduce the large black-white gap in cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) attributed to hypertension.

### Fallacies and dangers of practicing race-based medicine | AAFP… [^112FiR6u]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The guidelines from the Joint National Committee on the management of high blood pressure recommend against using monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of Black patients with hypertension. 4 This recommendation was heavily influenced by the findings of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, which showed worse cardiovascular outcomes for Black patients treated with lisinopril. 5 This is sometimes translated into the idea that ACE inhibitors are ineffective in Black people, despite the fact that these questionable findings have not been shown in Black patients treated with combination therapy. 6, 7. Even taken at face value, a racial difference in the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor monotherapy is explained by social factors, not genetic causes.

More than a decade ago, the American Heart Association published a report from the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks that linked poor blood pressure control in Black patients to nonphysiologic factors, such as high stress levels, less physical activity, higher rates of obesity, and low-potassium diets. 8 Racial differences in renin-angiotensin activity resolve when Black patients decrease sodium intake, and there is more variation in renin-angiotensin activity within the Black race than there is when comparing Black and White people. 8 Treating Black patients as a monolithic group stereotypes them without considering that they are not all obese and that many follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet and exercise regularly. Despite Black patients having worse outcomes for chronic kidney disease, race-based equations assign a higher GFR to Black patients with the same creatinine value as people of other races.

This is based on questionable racial differences in muscle mass, bone density, and nutritional status. 9–11 As is the case with hypertension, these racial differences are often presented without considering nonbiologic causes or the significant variation within individual races. As one expert asserted, the use of race-based GFR equations will "systematically miss a high-risk group of blacks at a time in the disease course when interventions are crucial. " 12 Inflating GFR in Black patients leads to underdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease in this population and makes it less likely that they will be referred to a nephrologist or become eligible for kidney transplantation. Additionally, the erroneous beliefs about lower effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in Black patients mentioned earlier can prevent those with chronic kidney disease from receiving one of the key medications that can stop disease progression.

### Vulnerability to hypertension is a major determinant of racial disparities in Alzheimer's disease risk [^116c48zr]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary pathway by which morbidity profiles with hypertension influenced disparities in AD risk between Black and White Americans was vulnerability (i.e. differences in the effect on AD risk); although, exposure (i.e. differences in prevalence) played an important role in specific individual morbidity profiles. This suggests that blood pressure control is an important aspect of reducing White/Black disparities in AD risk. Indeed, recent studies have shown that intensive blood pressure control, in addition to significant cerebrovascular and mortality benefits, was associated with lower risk of mild cognitive impairmentand dementia onset. Consequently, differences in antihypertensive pharmacological therapy may be an important, easily modifiable, factor influencing the vulnerability of the Black population to AD risk. Previous studies showed antihypertensive treatment reducing the risk of AD and dementia, but these results remain inconsistent. It has been suggested that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) acting medications––namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB)––are more effective in reducing AD risk than other antihypertensive medications by reducing the risk of development of AD-related neurofibrillary tangle pathology. It has been hypothesized that ARBs are potentially more effective in reducing AD risk in White and Black females and White males. The impacts of ACE inhibitors on AD risk are more complex due to ACE-mediated conversion of amyloid-β 1–42 to amyloid-β 1–40: the role of different ACE-inhibitors (e.g. enalapril, captopril, perindopril, and lisinopril) in inhibiting the potentially protective mechanisms of conversion of amyloids-β varies depending on the specific medication. There are also well-documented race-specific differences in the effectiveness of hypertension medication between White and Black patients: arterial hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medications is more prevalent in Black Americansand ACE inhibitors and ARB monotherapy were less effective at controlling blood pressure in Black patients, with higher endogenous sodium and lower renin levels. Together with the fact that Black older adults with hypertension and dementia have been shown less likely to receive ARBs and/or ACE inhibitors and are more likely to have lower levels of adherence to antihypertensive medications than White patients, it is possible that lower use of RAS medications by Black patients could be associated with their higher vulnerability to AD risk found in our study. It should be noted that estrogen has a role in RAS-mediated effects on AD risk and that this effect also varies across race-specific population groups. Therefore, the differences in the race-specific relationships between antihypertensive therapy and AD risk could be indicative of effects that are independent of blood pressure.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^116PAbmg]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The ALLHAT (Antihypertensive Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) was one of the largest BP trials performed to date, which enrolled over 33 000 patients with HTN and one CHD risk factor. The objective of this landmark trial was to determine whether the incidence of CHD or other CV diseases would be lower in those patients treated with a CCB, an ACEI, or a diuretic. Patients were randomised to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril with a mean follow-up of about 4.9 years. Primary outcomes included fatal CHD or non-fatal MI and secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. There was no significant difference among the groups for the reduction in the primary or secondary outcome of all-cause mortality. It was determined that thiazide diuretics are superior in preventing one or more forms of CV disease and also since they are less expensive should be a first-line agent in the treatment of HTN. However, other commentaries suggested that this finding may be attributed to the fact that thiazides are better at treating volume-dependent HTN, such as the elderly and African-Americans who comprised a large portion of the patient demographics for this study. Although this may be the case, this very large study showed that amlodipine was neither superior nor inferior to thiazide diuretics or ACEIs in managing HTN in patients with other comorbid conditions.

### Systematic review: antihypertensive drug therapy in black patients [^114gaBx3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension occurs more frequently and is generally more severe in black persons than in white persons, leading to excess morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To systematically review the efficacy of different antihypertensive drugs in reducing blood pressure, morbidity, and mortality in hypertensive black adults.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched from their inception through November 2003: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS (Literatura Latino-Americana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud), African Index Medicus, and the Cochrane Library. PubMed was also searched from September 2003 through March 2004. Searches were conducted without language restriction.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of drugs versus placebo (blood pressure outcomes) or drugs versus placebo or other drugs (morbidity and mortality outcomes).

Data Extraction

2 reviewers independently extracted data.

Data Synthesis

The efficacy of beta-blockers in reducing systolic blood pressure and the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in achieving diastolic blood pressure goals did not significantly differ from that of placebo (weighted mean difference for beta-blockers, -3.53 mm Hg [95% CI, -7.51 to 0.45 mm Hg]; relative risk for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 1.35 [CI, 0.81 to 2.26]). In the pooled analyses, other reviewed drugs (calcium-channel blockers, diuretics, central sympatholytics, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers) were more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure, but only calcium-channel blockers remained effective in all prespecified subgroups, including patients with a baseline diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater. Main morbidity and mortality outcomes did not differ significantly between treatment groups when drugs were combined to reach blood pressure goals. However, trial results indicated a greater occurrence of diabetes with diuretics and a higher risk for cardiovascular events with drug regimens that included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Limitations

This meta-analysis evaluated the blood pressure lowering-efficacy of monotherapy only.

Conclusions

Drugs differ in their efficacy for reducing blood pressure in black patients, but there is no solid evidence that efficacy for reducing morbidity and mortality outcomes differs once patients achieve the blood pressure goal.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets (lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide) [^116Mpq4m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS)

ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.

While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to lisinopril monotherapy than non-Black patients.

### Familial factors in the antihypertensive response to lisinopril [^1111pWSC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although it is widely recognized that there are familial elements in the pathogenesis of hypertension, remarkably little is known about the influence of family history on response to specific antihypertensive agents.

Methods

This study was designed to address that issue by comparing the depressor response to lisinopril in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg in 74 patients enrolled as sibling pairs. Because all patients were treated with lisinopril, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), an objective measure not influenced by the investigators, was used to assess the primary blood pressure (BP) outcome variable.

Results

Diastolic BP was highly correlated between sibling pairs at baseline (r = 0.476; P < .03) and on treatment (r = 0.524; p = 0.0021). Ethnicity/race had a striking influence on lisinopril dose and response rate. Among African American patients, 23 of 28 reached the top dose of 40 mg/day, whereas only 14 of 36 Caucasian patients reached that dose level. Among Caucasians, 92% responded, and only 48% of African Americans. Responders were characterized by being younger and heavier, having significantly lower microalbuminuria at baseline, higher baseline renal plasma flow (RPF), and higher urinary kallikrein.

Conclusion

Among Caucasians, the presence of a hypertensive sibling predicts a striking therapeutic response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.

### Effect of race and ethnicity on antihypertensive medication utilization among women in the United States: study of women's health across the nation (SWAN) [^1147wQWZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In the SWAN cohort, black patients were almost 3 times as likely to report using a CCB compared with white patients. Investigators for the MESA (Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) trial observed that CCBs were the second most common antihypertensive medication class used by blacks, with ACEIs/ARBs being the most common. 18, 24 Among black participants, ALLHAT investigators observed no significant difference between the CCB amlodipine and the THZD chlorthalidone for the primary outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease mortality, or secondary outcomes including all‐cause mortality, stroke, combined coronary heart disease, or combined CVD. 8 Higher rates of HF were observed among black participants randomized to amlodipine compared with those randomized to chlorthalidone. 25, 26 In long‐term follow‐up of ALLHAT participants, investigators observed that black participants had an increased HF risk associated with amlodipine compared with chlorthalidone. 27 However, it should be noted that participants were no longer blinded to treatments during the 8 to 10 years of post‐trial follow‐up and may have had their antihypertensive medication doses and class modified. Furthermore, use of ACEIs/ARBs are still the most commonly reported antihypertensive medication among blacks in SWAN. ALLHAT observed an increased risk for stroke, combined coronary heart disease, combined CVD, and HF in black participants randomized to lisinopril compared with those randomized to chlorthalidone. 8 Given the ALLHAT results, and the recent 2014 guidelines, it is surprising to see no decline in the use of ACEIs/ARBs or CCBs among blacks.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Treatment of special populations — recommendations specify that groups of patients including (a) high-risk ethnic minority groups (e.g., blacks), (b) groups underrepresented in clinical trials, and (c) any groups believed to be underserved should, in the absence of specific evidence to direct otherwise, have clinical screening and therapy in a manner identical to that applied to the broader population (Level of Evidence: B). It is recommended that evidence-based therapy for HF be used in the elderly patient, with individualized consideration of the elderly patient's altered ability to metabolize or tolerate standard medications (Level of Evidence: C). For Class IIa, the addition of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine to a standard medical regimen for HF, including ACEIs and beta-blockers, is reasonable and can be effective in blacks with NYHA functional class III or IV HF. Others may benefit similarly, but this has not yet been tested (Level of Evidence: A).

### Prescribing biDil: is it black and white? [^1119f7sK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The approval of BiDil as an adjunct treatment in self-identified blacks with heart failure raises questions regarding the underlying etiology of drug response in this target population and the ability to accurately identify patients who are most likely to benefit. Preliminary data have indicated that differences in nitric oxide synthesis between groups may account for differences in response to BiDil and genetic studies have begun to elucidate the mechanism of these differences. Until more accurate selection criteria are developed to identify patients who are most likely to benefit, both clinicians and the general public will need to consider the unique issues raised by BiDil.

### Tolerability and blood pressure-lowering efficacy of the combination of amlodipine plus valsartan compared with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide in adult patients with stage 2 hypertension [^114sXtHk]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with hypertension in the United States and Europe fail to achieve the recommended target blood pressure (BP) of < 140/90 mm Hg. Combination therapy is required in approximately two thirds of all patients whose BP is > 20/10 mm Hg above the goal. Combination therapy with agents having complementary mechanisms of action, such as a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II-receptor blacker, would be a potentially useful therapeutic option.

Objectives

This study evaluated the overall safety profile of combination therapy with amlodipine plus valsartan compared with a combination of lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with stage 2 hypertension (mean sitting diastolic BP [MSDBP] ≥ 110 and < 120 mm Hg) over the short term (6 weeks). A secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the 2 regimens in achieving BP reduction.

Methods

This was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study. Patients were randomized to receive once-daily treatment with amlodipine 5 to 10 mg + valsartan 160 mg or lisinopril 10 to 20 mg + HCTZ 12.5 rig for 6 weeks. Safety assessments included monitoring of all adverse events, vital signs, and hematology and biochemistry variables. Efficacy variables included the changes from baseline in MSDBP and mean sitting systolic BP (MSSBP), the response rate (MSDBP < 90 mm Hg, or a ≥ 10-mm Hg reduction from baseline), and the rate of DBP control (< 90 mm Hg). The overall rate of BP control (proportion of patients with MSSBP/MSDBP < 140/90 mm Hg) was evaluated in a post hoc analysis. Efficacy variables were summarized at each visit and at the end of the study (week 6, applying last-observation-carried-forward methodology) using descriptive statistics for the intent-to-treat population (all randomized patients with a baseline BP measurement and at least 1 post baseline BP measurement). Subgroup analyses of BP changes were performed in prespecified age groups (< 65 and ≥ 65 years) and post hoc in patients with a baseline systolic BP < 180 and ≥ 180 mm Hg.

Results

Of 130 patients who were randomized to treatment, 128 completed the study: 63 in the amlodipine + valsartan group and 65 in the lisinopril + HCTZ group. The majority of patients in both groups were white (amlodipine + valsartan: 59.4% lisinopril + HCTZ: 60.6%) and female (57.8% and 54.5%, respectively). The mean age was similar in the 2 groups (56.5 and 57.6 years), as was the mean weight (85.1 and 82.0 kg). Both regimens were generally well tolerated. Adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and most were not considered related to study drug. At the 6-week end point, both the amlodipine + valsartan and lisinopril + HCTZ groups had achieved significant reductions from baseline in MSSBP (-35.8 [11.8] and -31.8 [14.7] mm Hg, respectively; both, P < 0.001) and MSDBP (-28.6 [7.7] and -27.6 [8.6] mm Hg; both, P < 0.001). Response rates were similar for the 2 treatment groups (100% and 95.5%), as were rates of DBP control (79.7% and 77.3%).

Conclusions

The combinations of amlodipine 5 to 10 rug + valsartan 160 mg and lisinopril 10 to 20 mg + HCTZ 12.5 mg were well tolerated and efficacious, and both treatments were associated with achievement of BP goals in the majority of these adult patients with stage 2 hypertension.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^111C9nXE]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a growing problem among black adults worldwide. Black adults have the highest age-adjusted rates of hypertension among all racial groups in the United States of America (USA) and Europe. Among black adults in the USA, for example, 44.4% of men and 43.9% of women have hypertension compared to 33.3% in the general population. Black adults also suffer from increased adverse consequences of hypertension due to: 1) more severe hypertension (> 180/110 mmHg), 2) less adequate blood pressure control over the long term, and 3) more comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.

In sub-Saharan Africa, hypertension is epidemic among black adults. Although previously considered rare, the prevalence of hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa is rising rapidly due to the effects of urbanization and industrialization on diet, exercise and obesity. In a recent large community-based study in Tanzania, for example, 21% of black adults between the ages of 35–44 years had hypertension; of these, only 18% were aware of their diagnosis, only 14% were on treatment, and only 5% were controlled. Several studies among black adults in Nigeria and South Africa have consistently reported that 15–20% of all hospital admissions in Africa are due to hypertension-related diagnoses. Autopsy and death certificate studies show that a large proportion of in-hospital deaths are hypertension-related even among younger adults.

One frequently cited challenge of treating hypertension among black adults is the lesser blood pressure response to certain medications such as ACE-inhibitors (ACEI). The objectives of this meta-analysis were to combine all currently available evidence from clinical trials of ACEIs to identify the following: 1) if a significant difference in blood pressure response to ACEIs exists between black and non-black populations, 2) the magnitude of this potential difference and 3) whether this potential difference may be explainable by factors other than race.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^111g1vmM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (eg., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In using lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets USP, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk. (See WARNINGS).

In considering the use of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets USP, it should be noted that ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in black than in nonblack patients. (See WARNINGS, Lisinopril).

### Evolving the role of black race in hypertension therapeutics [^1161NWso]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Black race has been used to guide antihypertensive drug selection for Black patients based on predominant between race (same drug) and intra-race (different drugs) blood pressure (BP) response patterns. Accordingly, thiazide diuretics and calcium antagonists have been recommended over renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and beta blockers for Black patients. Current antihypertensive drug prescribing reflects historical guidance as calcium antagonists and thiazide diuretics are prescribed more and RAS blockers less in Black than White patients. Hypertension control rates in Blacks, lag those for Whites despite their greater use of combination drug therapy and lesser use of monotherapy. This is also true across drug regimens containing any of the 4 recommended classes for initial therapy as well as for evidence-based combination drug therapy (calcium antagonist or thiazide diuretic+RAS blocker) regimens for which there is no known racial disparity in BP response. Current recommendations acknowledge the need for combination drug therapy in most, especially in Black patients. One exemplary comprehensive hypertension control program achieved > 80% control rates in Black and White patients with minimal racial disparity while utilizing a race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm. Black patients manifest robust, if not outsized, BP responses to diet/lifestyle modifications. Importantly, race neither appears to be a necessary nor sufficient consideration for the selection of effective drug therapy. Accordingly, we urge the initiation of adequately intense race-agnostic drug therapy coupled with greater emphasis on diet/lifestyle modifications for Black patients as the cornerstone of a race-informed approach to hypertension therapeutics.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^114f9JGZ]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for any prospective clinical trials providing race specific data on blood pressure lowering during treatment with ACEIs for adults with arterial hypertension on 3 August 2012. The search strategies were created by practicing clinicians and a research librarian and are provided in the Additional file 1: Table S1. No publication date or publication status restrictions were applied, and all languages were allowed. In addition, reference lists of review articles and the selected articles were searched for additional sources.

Once the systematic literature search was complete, two independent reviewers appraised all articles according to a standard set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. In cases of differing results, a third reviewer adjudicated. In the first step, articles were excluded or included based on a review of their titles and abstracts. The remaining articles were then evaluated in full text. All articles fulfilling the below-mentioned criteria were selected and data were extracted.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria were as follows. The study must be a prospective clinical trial providing race specific data on blood pressure lowering during treatment with ACEI. Study participants must be aged ≥ 18 years. Studies were included only if they enrolled patients for treatment of confirmed arterial hypertension. In order to evaluate the pure effect of ACEI therapy itself on blood pressure reduction, studies that used combination therapy were excluded from the analysis. The minimum treatment duration was 4 weeks; the minimum patient number was ten.

Two independent reviewers performed data extraction in duplicate. In the case of disagreement, a 3rd reviewer examined the article in order to correct the difference. Data were all entered into a standardized evidence table (see Additional file 2: Table S2). The dual primary metameters and measures of variance in this meta-analysis were change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in mmHg and standard deviation from before start of ACEI treatment to the end of the study period.

### Management of high blood pressure in blacks: an update of the international society on hypertension in blacks consensus statement [^112Vs4ER]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Since the first International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on the "Management of High Blood Pressure in African American" in 2003, data from additional clinical trials have become available. We reviewed hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment guidelines, pharmacological hypertension clinical end point trials, and blood pressure-lowering trials in blacks. Selected trials without significant black representation were considered. In this update, blacks with hypertension are divided into 2 risk strata, primary prevention, where elevated blood pressure without target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, or overt cardiovascular disease for whom blood pressure consistently < 135/85 mm Hg is recommended, and secondary prevention, where elevated blood pressure with target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, and/or a history of cardiovascular disease, for whom blood pressure consistently < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. If blood pressure is ≤ 10 mm Hg above target levels, monotherapy with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker is preferred. When blood pressure is > 15/10 mm Hg above target, 2-drug therapy is recommended, with either a calcium channel blocker plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker or, alternatively, in edematous and/or volume-overload states, with a thiazide diuretic plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Effective multidrug therapeutic combinations through 4 drugs are described. Comprehensive lifestyle modifications should be initiated in blacks when blood pressure is ≥ 115/75 mm Hg. The updated International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on hypertension management in blacks lowers the minimum target blood pressure level for the lowest-risk blacks, emphasizes effective multidrug regimens, and de-emphasizes monotherapy.

or lisinopril groups than in the chlorthalidone group for either the primary CHD or any other prespecified clinical outcome, and diuretic-based treatment resulted in the lowest risk of heart failure. While the improved outcomes with chlorthalidone were more pronounced for some outcomes in blacks than. less in blacks compared with nonblacks and less than in blacks randomized to receive chlorthalidone, especially during the early time periods. At 2 years, blacks experienced a 5/2-mm Hg greater BP reduction on average with chlorthalidone than with lisinopril; this difference decreased to 4/1 mm Hg. groups, respectively. The corresponding percentages among blacks were 63% for chlorthalidone, 60% for amlodipine, and 54% for lisinopril. By 5 years of follow-up, 56% to 70% of black participants and 61% to 63% of nonblack. treated with ACE inhibitors, especially in blacks, 11 the incidence of serious adverse events was small and did not differ across treatment groups.

Overall, 6-year event rates were significantly lower in black vs nonblack participants for the primary outcome, nonfatal MI plus fatal CHD; effects on SBP also differed in blacks and nonblacks. In both racial subgroups as in the whole cohort, neither the ACE inhibitor nor the CCB was. was greater in blacks.

The diuretic also was more effective in lowering and controlling BP in blacks, and the difference in effect on stroke in blacks and nonblacks is likely explained in part by the BP differences. In considering the race-specific differences between treatment groups, BP correlated less with HF than with stroke, a finding confirmed by the recent prospective meta-analysis.

An estimated 76 million adults have hypertension (HTN), which translates into 1 of 3 adults. 1 After age 55, women have equal or greater prevalence of HTN compared with men. 2 Life expectancy for women with HTN is on average 4.9 years shorter than women with normal blood pressure (BP) at the age of 50. 3 The prevalence of HTN among black women in the United States is one of the highest in the world, at more than 40%. 1 Furthermore, blacks develop HTN at younger ages than other racial/ethnic groups and are at higher risk for adverse outcomes including stroke and renal failure. 4, 5

Effective management of HTN results in reduction of cardiovascular events including stroke and heart disease. 6, 7, 8 In 2002, the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double‐blind, multicenter trial, compared 4 classes of antihypertensive medications; angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), represented by lisinopril; calcium channel blockers (CCBs), represented by amlodipine; α‐blockers, represented by doxazosin; and thiazide diuretics (THZDs), represented by chlorthalidone. 8 The doxazosin arm was terminated early because of increased risk for stroke, combined cardiovascular disease (CVD), and heart failure (HF) compared with chlorthalidone. 9 Among both blacks and non‐blacks, chlorthalidone, compared with lisinopril, was associated with significantly lower rates of HF, combined coronary heart disease, and combined CVD. In addition, for blacks, chlorthalidone was associated with significantly lower rates of stroke. Compared with amlodipine, chlorthalidone was associated with significantly lower risk for HF in both blacks and non‐blacks. 8 The ALLHAT investigators recommended THZDs as first‐step therapy for HTN given equivalency between the treatment groups for the primary outcome and the superiority of chlorthalidone compared with amlodipine for HF, and compared with lisinopril for combined cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and HF, as well as the lower expense of chlorthalidone compared with lisinopril and amlodipine. 8

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^115w1TWQ]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss. There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^112FL8sY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide

As a result of its diuretic effects, hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, and decreases serum potassium. Administration of lisinopril blocks the renin-angiotensin aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.

In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/12.5 mg combination worked equally well in black and white patients. The lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/12.5 mg and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/25 mg combinations appeared somewhat less effective in black patients, but relatively few black patients were studied. In most patients, the antihypertensive effect of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was sustained for at least 24 hours.

In a randomized, controlled comparison, the mean antihypertensive effects of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/12.5 mg and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/25 mg were similar, suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter combination may be controlled with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/12.5 mg. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)

Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has little or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug. The combination tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^114jRnSr]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The magnitude of the difference in blood pressure response to ACEI therapy observed in this meta-analysis is quantitatively similar to that observed in other literature. In the largest randomized, controlled trial that compared outcomes to ACEI therapy among black and white adults with hypertension (the ALLHAT study), the differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response to lisinopril were 5.6 and 2.5 mmHg respectively, almost identical to the differences seen in our meta-analysis. The ALLHAT study was not included in this meta-analysis, though, because many participants received combination therapy and no data for those patients receiving monotherapy were extractable from trial publications. These differences are also similar to the results of 2 prior, smaller meta-analyses of ACEI response in blacks and whites.

It is important to note that the variability of response to ACEI monotherapy is greater within races than between races. As seen in Table 2, the standard deviation for blood pressure responses among whites and blacks was consistently greater than the difference between these 2 groups. These results affirm the meta-analysis of Sehgal, which showed that the percentage of whites and blacks with similar drug-associated changes in diastolic blood pressure was 90% for diuretics, 90% for beta-blockers, 95% for calcium channel blockers, and 81% for ACEI. Clearly we are, as races, more similar than we are different.

Both the USA JNC-7 guidelines and the UK NICE guidelines have noted the difference in in ACEI response between white and black adults. According to the NICE guidelines, calcium channel blockers are preferred over ACE-inhibitors for monotherapy of uncomplicated hypertension in black adults of any age and in white adults over the age of 55 years. The cutoff of 55 years is an interesting one. Of the studies included in this meta-analysis only 1 looked at the difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors between blacks and white in different age groups. In this study, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure response to ACEI therapy was similar in younger vs. older whites and younger vs. older black adults and was consistently less in younger and older blacks vs. younger and older whites. The recommendation in the NICE guidelines to prefer calcium channel blockers is also notable and further meta-analysis is needed to better define the relationship between race and blood pressure response to calcium channel blockers.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Combination therapy and single-pill combinations (SPCs) — use and candidate criteria: Combination therapy is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering blood pressure (BP) and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy, although a stepped-care approach can be effective for BP lowering if well-executed. Initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably an SPC; available randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports using an RAS blocker with either a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB as initial therapy. Several small RCTs have demonstrated that low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together reduce BP more effectively than monotherapy over 3 to 6 months of treatment, although none of these trials have evaluated cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. In general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk. For candidates for initial combination therapy — nonfrail adults with SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 10 mm Hg from target — starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence; BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop. In most cases, SPCs are a cost-effective alternative to multiple pill combination therapy and allow longer follow-up intervals between medication intensifications, but because SPCs are not available with every possible combination, in some cases the use of separate agents may be more or equally effective.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^116YkKhY]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The following parameters were also extracted and included in the evidence table: number of patients in each race group, Jadad score (for quality), average age, age difference between races, gender distribution, ACE-inhibitor used and average dose, time interval between start of treatment and blood pressure measurement. Of note, the Jadad score is a standard measure of the quality of clinical trials ranging from 0 (low quality) to 5 (high quality) that takes into account the following components: randomization, blinding, and loss to follow-up. ACE-inhibitor doses were standardized as "enalapril adjusted doses". The doses of fosinopril, quinapril, benazepril and lisinopril were identical to those of enalapril; the trandolapril dose was multiplied by 10; the ramipril dose was multiplied by 4; perindopril doses of 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg and captopril daily doses of 18.75, 37.5, 75, and 150 mg were equivalent to enalapril doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg.

For one study, two references were used for data extraction. For that study, the authors were contacted in order to get the standard deviations of the mean blood pressures. ImageJ (free share software, NIH, USA) was used in two articles to obtain measures of mean and standard deviation from a graph.

The meta-analysis was performed using random effects model. Mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. We tested for heterogeneity by Q test and I² statistics. We assessed possibility of publication bias by evaluating a funnel plot for asymmetry and by Egger's regression intercept. To evaluate the possible sources of heterogeneity we performed metaregression and stratification according to the above-mentioned factors. As two studies in the meta-analysis had a much larger sample sizes than the other studies, we performed a one-study-removed analysis to assess whether the removal of any one study changed the overall results of the meta-analysis.

We hypothesized that black race was associated with a lesser reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in response to ACE-inhibitor therapy. We also hypothesized that possible sources of heterogeneity between studies could include: age, ACE-inhibitor dose, study quality (i.e. Jadad score), treatment duration and/or baseline blood pressure.
