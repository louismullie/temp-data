## Question

Acne treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acne treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify acne severity and why that matters. Then, I should verify first-line topical strategies and the principle of multimodal therapy. Next, I will review when and how to escalate to systemic therapy, including antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin. After that, I need to check special populations and safety, including pregnancy, pediatrics, and skin of color. I will then examine procedural options and their evidentiary footing. Finally, I should confirm maintenance strategies, adherence counseling, and cost-effectiveness considerations to close the loop on longitudinal care.

> Let me first confirm the importance of severity classification because treatment selection hinges on it; most contemporary guidance stratifies acne as mild, moderate, or severe based on lesion type and burden, with scarring and psychosocial impact also informing intensity of therapy, even though no universal grading system is endorsed, so I need to ensure I document lesion counts, predominant morphology, anatomic sites, and sequelae at baseline and follow-up to track response and adjust therapy accordingly [^112yp3ej] [^112CYLLY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monotherapy; I should verify that guidelines consistently endorse multimodal topical therapy targeting multiple pathogenic pathways, with topical retinoids as foundational agents because they normalize keratinization and are anti-inflammatory, and with benzoyl peroxide added to mitigate resistance when antibiotics are used, so for mild-to-moderate disease a fixed-dose retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide combination is preferred over monotherapy when feasible [^115osGxh] [^1162UVfh] [^114iXepC].

> Wait, let me verify the specific first-line combinations; the strongest comparative evidence supports adapalene 0.1–0.3% with benzoyl peroxide 2.5% for efficacy and tolerability, and tretinoin or trifarotene with benzoyl peroxide are reasonable alternatives, while clascoterone 1% offers a topical anti-androgen option particularly useful for women with hormonally driven acne; I should also remember that azelaic acid and salicylic acid are adjuncts, especially for dyspigmentation or sensitive skin, and that starting low and titrating helps minimize irritation [^114iXepC] [^117HQq3g] [^1162UVfh].

> I need to ensure I set expectations about onset and tolerability; patients often stop too early, so I should counsel that visible improvement typically takes 6–8 weeks, that transient dryness and irritation are common and manageable with moisturizers and gradual titration, and that combining a retinoid with benzoyl peroxide can both accelerate clearance and reduce resistance risk compared with antibiotic monotherapy, which I should explicitly avoid [^116Z9EP4].

> Next, I should review escalation thresholds; if there is no meaningful improvement by about 12 weeks, if disease is moderate-to-severe at onset, or if scarring or significant psychosocial burden is present, I should escalate to systemic therapy while maintaining topical therapy, and I must confirm that guidelines prioritize limiting antibiotic duration and always pairing systemic antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid to curb resistance [^1162UVfh] [^116Z9EP4].

> Let me consider oral antibiotics carefully; doxycycline or lymecycline are preferred first-line tetracyclines for about 3–4 months, with explicit plans to discontinue and transition to maintenance topicals, and I should double-check that minocycline and sarecycline are options when first-line agents are not tolerated, though cost and safety profiles differ and should be individualized [^116Z9EP4] [^1162UVfh].

> For women with persistent acne, I should confirm the role of hormonal therapy; combined oral contraceptives and spironolactone are effective, with spironolactone particularly useful for flares around menses or when androgen sensitivity is suspected, and I need to screen for contraindications and monitor for hyperkalemia with spironolactone while counseling on delayed onset of 3–6 months [^116Z9EP4] [^1162UVfh].

> Now, isotretinoin; I should verify indications include severe nodulocystic acne, treatment failure after appropriate topical and oral therapy, scarring, or significant psychosocial distress, and I must implement pregnancy prevention counseling, baseline labs including lipids and LFTs, and monthly monitoring during therapy, recognizing that cumulative dosing of about 120–150 mg/kg is standard but lower-dose, longer-course regimens can be effective with fewer adverse effects in select patients [^1162UVfh] [^115UTVrt].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy; I need to ensure safety by avoiding systemic retinoids and tetracyclines, favoring topical azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, topical clindamycin or erythromycin, and physical modalities as needed, and I should document counseling on teratogenic risks and contraception if any systemic therapy is contemplated [^116TGu5N].

> For pediatric patients, I should confirm age-appropriate choices; topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide are safe and effective from childhood through adolescence, oral tetracyclines are avoided under age 8 and generally reserved for older children with moderate-to-severe disease, and isotretinoin is appropriate in adolescents with severe scarring or refractory acne under specialist supervision, with attention to growth and bone health counseling [^113E4PhY] [^1162UVfh].

> In patients with skin of color, I need to ensure early intervention to prevent dyspigmentation and keloidal scarring, integrate anti-inflammatory topicals like azelaic acid, and proactively address post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation using retinoids, azelaic acid, chemical peels, or antioxidants, tailoring to tolerance and pigmentary response [^117QsGTh] [^1162UVfh].

> Let me reconsider procedural therapies; chemical peels, phototherapy, and photodynamic therapy can be adjuncts, with network meta-analyses suggesting meaningful benefit in selected contexts, but I should confirm that evidence quality varies, access and costs differ, and these are best positioned as adjuncts rather than replacements for pharmacologic therapy, especially given heterogeneity in devices and protocols [^114iXepC] [^1153NjFm].

> I should double-check maintenance therapy; once control is achieved, continued topical retinoid with or without benzoyl peroxide reduces relapse risk, and I need to build adherence by simplifying regimens, providing written instructions, and aligning choices with patient preferences and skin phenotype to sustain remission [^116TrUiV] [^116Z9EP4].

> Next, I should review adherence and education; many patients stop topicals early due to irritation or unrealistic timelines, so I must counsel on gradual titration, moisturizer use, and the 6–8 week onset window, and I should screen for mood symptoms given the bidirectional links between acne and mental health, offering support and timely referral when indicated [^116Z9EP4] [^116Va5KA].

> Finally, I need to ensure cost-effectiveness is considered; for mild-to-moderate acne, fixed-dose topical combinations and photochemical therapy are among the most cost-effective options, whereas for moderate-to-severe acne, topical combinations, oral antibiotics with topicals, and isotretinoin are most cost-effective, and I should communicate these trade-offs transparently when aligning treatment with patient values and access constraints [^114D7zTx] [^115R7pf9].

Acne treatment should be tailored to severity and patient factors, with **topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide as first-line therapy** for mild-to-moderate disease [^114iXepC]. For moderate-to-severe acne, **add oral antibiotics** (doxycycline, minocycline, sarecycline) [^1162UVfh] or hormonal therapy (spironolactone, combined oral contraceptives) [^116Z9EP4], and use isotretinoin for severe, scarring, or refractory cases [^112LPiES]. Combination therapy targeting multiple pathogenic factors improves outcomes [^1151Czj9], and maintenance with topical retinoids helps prevent relapse [^116TrUiV]. Address adherence, side effects, and patient preferences to optimize results [^1158HTxH].

## Topical therapies

Topical therapies are **first-line for mild-to-moderate acne** and are commonly used with systemic therapies in more severe cases [^111sXWYh].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Indication** | **Common side effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benzoyl peroxide | Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory | Mild-to-moderate acne | Irritation, dryness, bleaching of clothing |
| Topical retinoids (adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene) | Normalize keratinization, reduce comedones, anti-inflammatory | Mild-to-moderate acne | Irritation, dryness, photosensitivity |
| Topical antibiotics (clindamycin, erythromycin) | Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory | Mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne | Irritation, antibiotic resistance |
| Azelaic acid | Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, keratolytic | Mild-to-moderate acne, sensitive skin | Irritation, hypopigmentation |
| Topical dapsone | Anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial | Inflammatory acne, particularly in females | Irritation, dryness |

---

Combination therapy (e.g. retinoid plus benzoyl peroxide) is recommended to **target multiple pathogenic factors** and enhance efficacy [^115osGxh] [^114iXepC].

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapies are indicated for **moderate-to-severe acne**, refractory cases, or when topical therapies are insufficient [^1162UVfh].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Indication** | **Common side effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oral antibiotics (doxycycline, minocycline, sarecycline) | Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory | Moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne | Gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, antibiotic resistance |
| Hormonal therapies (spironolactone, combined oral contraceptives) | Anti-androgenic, reduce sebum production | Female patients with hormonal acne | Menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, mood changes |
| Oral isotretinoin | Reduces sebum, normalizes keratinization, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory | Severe nodulocystic acne, refractory cases | Teratogenicity, dry mucosa, elevated lipids, mood changes |

---

Isotretinoin is the **most effective treatment for severe acne** but requires careful monitoring due to potential adverse effects [^114iXepC] [^115UTVrt].

---

## Procedural therapies

Procedural therapies are adjunctive options for **refractory acne or acne scarring** [^114f59ic].

- **Chemical peels**: Salicylic acid, glycolic acid peels for mild-to-moderate acne and scarring.
- **Laser and light therapies**: Blue light, photodynamic therapy for inflammatory acne.
- **Microneedling and radiofrequency**: For acne scarring and textural improvement [^112JBMbb].

---

## Emerging therapies

Recent developments include topical anti-androgens (clascoterone), new retinoids (trifarotene), and biologics targeting inflammatory pathways, offering additional options for **refractory acne** [^117HQq3g] [^113eF3AR].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Treatment should be individualized based on age, gender, pregnancy status, comorbidities, and patient preferences. Pediatric acne requires **age-appropriate therapies** and careful monitoring [^113E4PhY], while pregnancy necessitates avoidance of teratogenic medications [^116TGu5N].

---

## Adherence and patient education

Adherence is critical to success; patients should be educated about expected outcomes, side effects, and proper application techniques. Nonadherence is common, particularly with topical therapies, and can be improved through **clear instructions and follow-up** [^1158HTxH].

---

## Maintenance therapy

Maintenance therapy with topical retinoids or other topical agents is recommended to **prevent relapse** after initial control [^116Z9EP4].

---

Acne treatment spans topical, systemic, and procedural options, with **combination therapy and individualized care** optimizing outcomes.

### Current issues in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11745Dtg]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extraordinarily common skin condition in adolescents. The mainstays of acne treatment have remained largely unchanged over recent years. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, there is a global movement away from antibiotic monotherapy toward their more restrictive use. Classically reserved for nodulocystic acne, isotretinoin has become the drug of choice by dermatologists for moderate to severe acne. Given the virtually ubiquitous nature of acne in teenagers, there remains an appreciable need for novel therapies. In this article, we will cover the currently used acne treatments, evaluate the issues and data supporting their use, explore the issues of compliance and the mental health implications of acne care, and recommend directions for the field of acne management in adolescents in the years ahead.

### Phototherapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris: what is its role? [^112bDhK3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common dermatosis affecting 80% of the population. To date, different treatments have been used to manage this condition. Antibacterials and retinoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for acne, but their success rate varies. Phototherapy is emerging as an alternative option to treat acne vulgaris. Studies examining the role of different wavelengths and methods of light treatment have shown that phototherapy with visible light, specifically blue light, has a marked effect on inflammatory acne lesions and seems sufficient for the treatment of acne. In addition, the combination of blue-red light radiation seems to be superior to blue light alone, with minimal adverse effects. Photodynamic therapy has also been used, even in nodular and cystic acne, and had excellent therapeutic outcomes, although with significant adverse effects. Recently, low energy pulsed dye laser therapy has been used, and seems to be a promising alternative that would allow the simultaneous treatment of active acne and acne scarring. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of phototherapy as a monotherapy or an adjuvant treatment in the current management of acne vulgaris.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113HZAsS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally, affecting over 0.5 billion people. Acne can have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. Acne severity may be determined by clinical presentation (number and type of lesions), secondary sequelae (scarring, pigmentation), and its psychological and social impact on the patient. Uncertainty around acne treatment effectiveness may be a barrier to treatment. Various topical, oral and physical acne treatments are available, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness, especially in relation to acne severity.

Network meta‐analysis (NMA) allows simultaneous estimation of relative effects for any number of treatments, even if some have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), provided that treatments create a 'network of evidence' where every treatment is linked to at least another treatment through direct comparisons.,

Two NMAs assessing the effectiveness of treatments for acne vulgaris have been published to date, both focusing on mild‐to‐moderate acne. Therefore, our study examined the relative effectiveness, acceptability and tolerability of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments separately for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features, to identify suitable first‐line treatments.

### Is there a place for biologics in acne? [^113eF3AR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acne Treatment: Why Consider Biologics?

Acne is among the most prevalent dermatological conditions, affecting over 85% of adolescents. While commonly associated with teenagers, it can occur across various age groups and often persists into adulthood. Acne significantly impacts emotional well-being, social interactions, relationships, daily routines, academic performance, and professional life. It is linked to higher risks of stigmatization, bullying, low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Although numerous topical and systemic therapies are available, these treatments often fail to meet patient expectations for rapid improvement, sustained remission, lack of side effects, and prevention of recurrence and scarring.

Given the success of biological treatments in managing various inflammatory skin diseases, it is worth exploring whether these therapies could provide similar benefits for acne. Biologic therapies, with their targeted mechanisms of action, might present promising options by addressing chronicity, reducing antibiotic dependence, and preventing progression to severe disease (Table 1).

### Adolescent acne vulgaris: current and emerging treatments [^1132g3WX]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2023). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the commonest inflammatory skin diseases seen worldwide, affecting all ethnicities and races, with a peak prevalence between age 15 years and 20 years. The burden of this condition, and the resulting clinical and psychological sequelae, is substantial. The visual appearance of acne and its sequelae, including scarring and pigment changes, frequently results in psychological and social morbidity because of concerns about appearance. As understanding of the pathophysiology has evolved, approaches to achieving the optimal outcomes with effective treatment regimens continue to emerge. In the past few years, several novel therapeutics have been developed, including new agents aimed at reducing antimicrobial resistance and products with specific actions targeting retinoid receptors and androgen receptors. This Review considers the management approaches of an adolescent with acne vulgaris and reviews treatment options from the evidence base and international expert opinion. Approaches to selecting current treatments and novel and emerging treatment regimens are discussed.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^113XqcGQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne is a common, chronic inflammatory condition affecting millions of people worldwide, with significant negative impact on quality of life and mental health. Acne is characterized by comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodulocystic lesions, with long-lasting sequelae including scarring and dyspigmentation, the latter of which is more common in skin of color. The four main pillars of acne pathophysiology include alteration of sebum production and concentration, hyperkeratinization of the follicular unit, Cutibacterium acnes strains, and an inflammatory immune response. Newer research has provided greater insight into these pathophysiologic categories. This greater understanding of acne pathogenesis has led to numerous new and emerging treatment modalities. These modalities include combinations of existing treatments, repurposing of existing agents historically used for other conditions, new topical treatments, novel antibiotics, topical and oral probiotics, and various procedural devices. This article will provide an overview of emerging treatments of acne and their link to our current and improved understanding of acne pathogenesis.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^112ZDptp]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical features and diagnosis

The diagnosis of acne is made on the clinical history and examination. There are no diagnostic criteria and the skin lesions seen are open comedones (whiteheads), closed comedones (blackheads), papules/nodules, cysts and scarring. There is no strong evidence base for different treatments for different acne subtypes (comedonal vs inflammatory), and NICE and most other guidelines provide different guidance on the basis of severity rather than acne subtypes. While classifications vary, the majority of acne is mild, with moderate or severe acne combined making up less than 15% of cases of acne. See table 2 for severity classifications and linked treatment choices.

### Treatment of acne in children [^115mGhs4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne is a common skin condition in adolescents. It is not uncommon in childhood and it persists into adulthood. A broad range of acne treatments are available and have been shown to be safe and effective in adolescents and adults. However, there is limited literature regarding acne treatment in childhood and its available therapeutic options. It seems reasonable to extrapolate findings of the various studies reported on treatment of acne in the adolescent and adult age group, with the exclusion of the use of tetracycline derivatives. As clinicians, we must be more familiar with the clinical presentation of acne and available treatment options in our younger patients. Early recognition of acne with prompt and appropriate initiation of therapy in childhood will help prevent severe scarring in children.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^113KPk7C]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As knowledge of acne pathogenesis expands, novel approaches for targeting inflammation are rapidly emerging in the form of topical, systemic, procedural, and combination therapies. New or modified medications within familiar classes, the repurposing of drugs used to treat other inflammatory conditions, and the development of novel treatment modalities may all be efficacious in treating acne. Some of these treatments have the added benefit of decreasing and treating acne sequelae, including atrophic scarring and dyspigmentation. The diverse mechanisms of action include direct bactericidal activity against C. acnes, inhibition of pro-inflammatory factor release, reduction of oxidative stress, activation of the immune system, and modulation of the microbiome. With growing concerns over antimicrobial resistance and with certain individuals unable to tolerate well-established therapies, additional treatment options that are safe and effective in all skin types and colors are needed.

### Acne treatment review and future perspectives [^112eF9nc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne affects approximately 9% of people worldwide and is the most common skin condition in the United States. There are abundant topical and oral treatment options available for patients with acne. First-line agents include topical retinoids, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and combinations of these agents. For recalcitrant or more severe acne, oral medications, including oral antibiotics, isotretinoin, or hormonal therapy, may be considered. This review will also discuss the many advances being made in the treatment of acne vulgaris, from the development of microencapsulated medications to targeted treatments.

### Acne scarring: a review and current treatment modalities [^111BahJm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne is a prevalent condition in society and often results in secondary damage in the form of scarring. Of course, prevention is the optimal method to avoid having to correct the physically or emotionally troublesome scars. However, even with the best efforts, scars will certainly arise. This article attempts to give a broad overview of multiple management options, whether medically, surgically, or procedurally based. The hope is that a general knowledge of the current available alternatives will be of value to the physician when confronted with the difficult task of developing a treatment plan for acne-scarred individuals, even in challenging cases.

### Acne vulgaris [^115z9LLV]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease - rather than a natural part of the life cycle as colloquially viewed - of the pilosebaceous unit (comprising the hair follicle, hair shaft and sebaceous gland) and is among the most common dermatological conditions worldwide. Some of the key mechanisms involved in the development of acne include disturbed sebaceous gland activity associated with hyperseborrhoea (that is, increased sebum production) and alterations in sebum fatty acid composition, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity. Grading of acne involves lesion counting and photographic methods. However, there is a lack of consensus on the exact grading criteria, which hampers the conduction and comparison of randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating treatments. Prevention of acne relies on the successful management of modifiable risk factors, such as underlying systemic diseases and lifestyle factors. Several treatments are available, but guidelines suffer from a lack of data to make evidence-based recommendations. In addition, the complex combination treatment regimens required to target different aspects of acne pathophysiology lead to poor adherence, which undermines treatment success. Acne commonly causes scarring and reduces the quality of life of patients. New treatment options with a shift towards targeting the early processes involved in acne development instead of suppressing the effects of end products will enhance our ability to improve the outcomes for patients with acne.

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^1151Czj9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne [^113E4PhY]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions in children and adolescents. The presentation, differential diagnosis, and association of acne with systemic pathology differs by age of presentation. Current acknowledged guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pediatric acne are lacking, and there are variations in management across the spectrum of primary and specialty care. The American Acne and Rosacea Society convened a panel of pediatric dermatologists, pediatricians, and dermatologists with expertise in acne to develop recommendations for the management of pediatric acne and evidence-based treatment algorithms.

Methods

Ten major topic areas in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne were identified. A thorough literature search was performed and articles identified, reviewed, and assessed for evidence grading. Each topic area was assigned to 2 expert reviewers who developed and presented summaries and recommendations for critique and editing. Furthermore, the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, including ratings for the strength of recommendation for a body of evidence, was used throughout for the consensus recommendations for the evaluation and management of pediatric acne. Practical evidence-based treatment algorithms also were developed.

Results

Recommendations were put forth regarding the classification, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pediatric acne, based on age and pubertal status. Treatment considerations include the use of over-the-counter products, topical benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin. Simplified treatment algorithms and recommendations are presented in detail for adolescent, preadolescent, infantile, and neonatal acne. Other considerations, including psychosocial effects of acne, adherence to treatment regimens, and the role of diet and acne, also are discussed.

Conclusions

These expert recommendations by the American Acne and Rosacea Society as reviewed and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics constitute the first detailed, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of pediatric acne including issues of special concern when treating pediatric patients.

### Unmet needs in the management of acne vulgaris: a consensus statement [^115r98L1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the US, affecting up to 50 million Americans. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines on acne treatment were developed to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of acne in adolescents and adults to support clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making process. The most recent acne guidelines were published in 2016, and the approach to care and the therapeutic landscape of acne have evolved since that time. The Acne Management Consensus Roundtable was convened in 2022 to discuss unmet needs in the management of acne. The main focus of the meeting was the role of androgens in acne pathology; the evaluation of clascoterone, the first topical anti-androgen that specifically addresses sebum production in acne; and the identification of the place of clascoterone in therapy. Clascoterone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older in 2020. This report aims to highlight important limitations of the 2016 AAD treatment guidelines and to familiarize practitioners with clascoterone and its indication, efficacy and safety profile, and potential use across diverse patient populations. With its new mechanism of action, clascoterone may be able to fulfill important unmet needs in acne treatment. Baldwin H, Farberg AS, Frey C, et al.

### Optimizing isotretinoin treatment of acne: update on current recommendations for monitoring, dosing, safety, adverse effects, compliance, and outcomes [^115UTVrt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease treated by dermatologists. It can be severe and result in permanent scars. Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne and has the potential for long-term clearance. Prescribing and monitoring protocols can vary widely among prescribers. Recent studies, reports, and consensus statements help shed light on optimizing the use of isotretinoin for acne. A recent literature review is summarized in this article to help the practitioner optimize isotretinoin use for acne. The article outlines the advantages and disadvantages of standard, high-dose, and low-dose isotretinoin regimens; discusses the current status of controversies surrounding isotretinoin (including depression/suicide, pregnancy, and inflammatory bowel disease); reviews monitoring recommendations and treatment for hypertriglyceridemia and elevated transaminase levels; and discusses common adverse effects seen with isotretinoin, along with their treatment and prevention.

### New developments in topical acne therapy [^117HQq3g]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory disease with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Although myriad acne treatments are available, current options may not be sufficient because of a lack of efficacy, limited tolerability, or burden of cost to patients. In this review, we highlight recently approved topical acne treatments, as well as those currently in clinical trials. Novel formulations of tretinoin, tazarotene, and minocycline provide modifications of and improvements to existing products. Trifarotene, a novel fourth-generation retinoid, has demonstrated improved tolerability compared with existing topical retinoids. Clascoterone is a novel first-in-class antiandrogen that topically addresses the hormonal etiology of acne. The late-phase clinical trials pipeline consists of agents with bactericidal and anti-sebum mechanisms. Although it is evident that acne treatments continue to evolve, it is important to recognize the need for further comparative studies among new and existing agents to define optimal treatment algorithms that address not only safety and efficacy but also cost-effective care.

### Acne scarring-pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention and education: part I [^111ejxuX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acne scarring is common and can occur even with effective acne management. In addition, patients with acne scarring suffer from significant psychosocial morbidity, including depression and suicidality. Despite the availability and advancement of therapeutic modalities, treatment for acne scarring is not always optimized and often overlooked in patients with acne encounters. Using acne scarring assessment tools and identifying specific acne scar subtypes allows for a tailored therapeutic approach. Part I of this continuing medical education series covers the pathophysiology and morphology of textural and pigmented acne scars, scarring assessment tools, and medical treatment options. The principles reviewed will aid in approaching and initiating acne scar treatment in the outpatient setting.

### Energy-based devices for the treatment of acne scars: 2022 international consensus recommendations [^117CYokR]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acne scars are one of the most distressing and long-term consequences of acne vulgaris, with damaging effect on a person's physical, mental, and social well-being. Numerous treatment options are available including surgical and nonsurgical techniques, depending on the clinical presentation. Although considerable advances in the development of new treatment technologies and applications have been made in the last decade, international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes have not yet caught up with current knowledge and practice in many centers. The authors intend to highlight the potential utility of energy-based devices (EBDs) for acne scarring, offer recommendations for safe and efficacious treatment, and provide consensus-based EBD treatment options based on varying presentations demonstrated in a series of real-life clinical photographs.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

An international panel of 24 dermatologists and plastic surgeons from 12 different countries and a variety of practice backgrounds was self-assembled to develop updated consensus recommendations for the treatment of acne scars. A two-step modified Delphi method took place between March 2020 and February 2021 consisting of two rounds of emailed questionnaires. The panel members approved the final manuscript via email correspondence.

Results

The manuscript includes a comprehensive discussion and panel recommendations regarding the following topics: 1. the role of EBD in mitigating and treating acne scars in a patient with active acne, 2. the use of various EBDs for the treatment of different acne scar types with special focus on commonly used laser platform such as vascular lasers, ablative fractional lasers (AFLs) and non-AFLs (NAFLs), 3. treatment combinations, and 4. acne scar treatments in skin of color. The last part comprised of 10 photos of real-life clinical cases with the panel recommendation treatment plan to achieve best aesthetic outcome.

Conclusion

Panel members were unanimous in their view that EBDs have a role in the management of acne scars, with AFLs, NAFLs, vascular lasers, and RF devices preferentially selected by most of the panel experts. EBDs are considered a first-line treatment for a variety of acne scar types and patients without access to these treatments may not be receiving the best available care for optimal cosmetic results. Future high-quality research and updated international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes should reflect this status.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114D7zTx]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis explored the relative cost‐effectiveness of a wide range of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne stratified by severity level. All treatments were more cost‐effective than treatment with placebo (modelled as GP visits without active treatment). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most cost‐effective treatments included topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light). For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most cost‐effective treatments included topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin.

To our knowledge, this is the first analysis exploring the relative cost‐effectiveness of a wide range of treatment options for acne from a healthcare perspective, considering, in addition to drug acquisition costs, HCP resource use, including costs associated with inadequate response to treatment or relapse. Previous economic studies (identified through a systematic search conducted to inform the NICE guideline)made limited comparisons of acne treatments, and the majority considered exclusively drug acquisition costs. A number of studies were simple cost analyses and most of them were characterized by important methodological limitations (Supplementary Data S10). Therefore, no robust conclusions can be drawn from the existing economic literature.

In our analysis, we used efficacy and discontinuation data derived from a large systematic review and NMA. This approach combines direct (i.e. head‐to‐head comparisons) and indirect evidence (e.g. comparisons through a common comparator) and allows simultaneous comparisons across all options while preserving randomization. There was some inconsistency between the direct and indirect evidence synthesized in the NMA, possibly reflecting heterogeneity in populations, treatments or study design across the included RCTs. However, NMA conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence. The RCTs included in the NMAs were of moderate to very low quality. The strengths and limitations of the source NMA and included RCTs should be considered when interpreting the cost‐effectiveness results.

The size of the evidence differed considerably across the examined treatments. Topical treatments had the largest evidence base on efficacy (several topical treatments had > 500 observations each), followed by oral treatments alone or combined with topical treatments, whereas the evidence for physical therapies (chemical peels, photochemical therapies, PDT) was based on < 300 observations for each treatment class.

### Management of acne scars: fulfilling our duty of care for patients [^116fqrCP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Inflammatory lesions commonly associated with acne have a propensity to form scars which can substantially impact an individual's quality of life. As a result of variations in collagen levels during the wound-healing process, different types of scars can form requiring a tailored approach to treatment; treatment success depends on the modality of the treatment chosen. Here, I briefly discuss the different acne scar types, and their relationship with skin anatomy and histology, in relation to the different treatment options available. This paper was developed to accompany my state of the art presentation at 'The Changing Faces of Acne' meeting in June 2014 and I aim to share my personal experiences in order to offer guidance for appropriate treatment decisions.

### Therapeutic update: acne [^112MYvUh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a multi-factorial disease affecting a significant proportion of the population. A patient-centered approach is most effective for the treatment of acne, focusing both on life style interventions as well as pharmacologic therapy. Lifestyle modifications include dietary counseling, as a link between dietary choices and acne continues to grow. Pharmacologic regimens must account for the severity of disease, emergence of resistant bacterial strains and ease of patient compliance. Combination topical therapy is often required for patients with mixed inflammatory and comedonal acne, while oral medications are frequently needed for severe cases or those involving large surface areas such as the chest or back. With or without a photosensitizer, light based treatments present an alternative or adjuvant to traditional pharmacologic therapy. Novel formulations of existing medications in addition to original compounds continue in development, expanding therapeutic possibilities for the future. With the emergence of antibiotic resistance, we are forced to prescribe antibiotics more responsibly, while exploring alternatives to this longstanding standard of care. This article discusses current and emerging therapies for the treatment of acne.

### Truncal acne and scarring: a comprehensive review of current medical and cosmetic approaches to treatment and patient management [^111BkGx4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin disorders worldwide. It typically affects skin areas with a high density of sebaceous glands such as the face, upper arms, chest, and/or back. Historically, the majority of research efforts have focused on facial acne vulgaris, even though approximately half of patients with facial lesions demonstrate truncal involvement. Truncal acne vulgaris is challenging to treat and poses a significant psychosocial burden on patients. Despite these characteristics, studies specifically examining truncal acne vulgaris are limited, with treatment guidelines largely derived from facial protocols. Therefore, truncal acne remains an understudied clinical problem. Here, we provide a clinically focused review on the epidemiology, evaluation, and available treatment options for truncal acne vulgaris. In doing so, we highlight knowledge gaps with the goal of spurring further investigation into the management of truncal acne vulgaris.

### Practical considerations in acne treatment and the clinical impact of topical combination therapy [^113jUK2G]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent, multifactorial disease process affecting the pilosebaceous units of the dermis. The effects of acne are profound both physically and psychosocially across all age groups and ethnicities; therefore, prompt recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches range from simple monotherapy to multimodal treatments with a variety of topical and systemic agents. Optimal patient outcomes in acne management, however, are based both on treatment efficacy as well as overall patient satisfaction. In an effort to comprehensively address these key clinical considerations in acne management, we examine the diverse nature of acne patients, the factors in optimizing treatment outcomes, and the clinical impact of current medications, particularly topical combination therapy.

### Multimodal treatment of acne, acne scars and pigmentation [^111e1zkA]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

Acne is a common skin disease that affects nearly 80% of adolescents and young adults aged 11 to 30 years. Lesions appear primarily on the face, back, chest, and other areas with a high concentration of pilosebaceous glands. The development of inflammatory lesions often drives acne patients to seek treatment. If a lesion becomes severely inflamed it may leave a scar. Severe scarring caused by acne is associated with substantial physical and psychological distress, particularly in adolescents. This article reviews the causes of acne, the treatment options, and grading scales.

### An algorithm integrating acneceuticals into the management of acne vulgaris [^116PVRne]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common, chronic cutaneous disorder with numerous efficacious prescription and procedural treatments. Therapy, however, is hampered by medication intolerability and compromised by non-adherence. The use of acneceuticals is an effective way to improve patient outcomes.

Methods

A panel of 5 dermatologists met for a consensus conference in October 2023 to identify a practical acne treatment and maintenance algorithm integrating acneceuticals with prescription medications and procedures.

Results

The algorithm stratifies the use of acneceuticals first as monotherapy, adjunctive therapy, or maintenance therapy and then further diverges by skin phenotype (oily or dry/sensitive) and primary lesion morphology (comedonal or inflammatory). Finally, specific acneceuticals are recommended for each phenotypic description.

Conclusion

The algorithm is intended to serve as a guideline for integrating active nonprescription skin care into prescription acne therapy, improving efficacy, tolerability, and adherence, resulting in superior patient outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(4):376–380. doi:10.36849/JDD.8887.

### Treatment recommendations for acne-associated hyperpigmentation: results of the Delphi consensus process and a literature review [^117QsGTh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris can be associated with hyperpigmentation, particularly in individuals with skin of color. This acne-induced macular hyperpigmentation (AMH), also called postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, is often long lasting and negatively impacts quality of life. Large-scale, randomized, controlled clinical trials with regard to the treatment of acne and AMH are lacking. For this reason, evidence-based treatment recommendations cannot be made. However, AMH is a common condition, and it is important for clinicians to have guidance on management strategies. The authors, a group of 10 board-certified dermatologists, conducted a modified Delphi consensus process to reach a consensus on first-line therapy for AMH and determine whether therapeutic choices change in different patient subgroups. We reached a consensus that most patients with acne and AMH should receive early and efficacious acne treatment with a topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. Therapies aimed at addressing AMH-including hydroquinone, azelaic acid, chemical peel, or antioxidants-may also be considered for enhancing the effect of the treatment regimen on acne and pigmentation. Chemical peels may be used as adjunctive or second-line therapy. This article details the results of the Delphi process, reviews relevant literature for providing recommendations for AMH, and discusses appropriate treatment options.

### Can we define acne as a chronic disease? If so, how and when? [^117JgjFJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

There is widespread misunderstanding of acne amongst both the medical and lay community, who often perceive the condition to be a simple, self-limited affliction of adolescents. Because many think that the disease "will go away on its own", they do not feel an urgency to aggressively treat acne. However, very often the reality is that acne treatment can be quite difficult. Furthermore, acne can be a devastating disease for the patient, since it manifests on visible body parts and in children near puberty, who are vulnerable both socially and psychologically. Most typically, acne is not an acute disease but rather a condition that continuously changes in its distribution and severity. Usually, acne treatment is necessary for many months and sometimes years. Despite treatment, acne may cause scarring and associated negative psychological effects. It is important for both patients and physicians to be aware that very effective treatments are available. It is also important to realize that new studies have proven the benefit of maintenance therapy with topical retinoids; these agents can minimize the potential for relapse, which is part of the natural history of acne. This article reviews the evidence suggesting that acne is a chronic disease in at least a subset of individuals. The members of the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne believe that acne should be recognized and investigated as a chronic disease. This will change expectations of clinical trial design and treatment and will highlight gaps in the knowledge of acne epidemiology. The result should be an improvement in patient outcomes.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114HLtTy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globallyand a common presentation to dermatologists. Acne may have a detrimental physical, psychological and social impact. A network meta‐analysis (NMA), assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments, found that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying treatment costs, including drug acquisition, time of the healthcare professional [HCP; general practitioner (GP) or specialist dermatologist] and special equipment. Evidence on the cost‐effectiveness of acne treatments is currently lacking. Thus, our study objective was to examine the cost‐effectiveness of effective treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England, using decision–analytical economic modelling.

This economic analysis informed the development of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for the management of acne in England.NICE considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national guidance for health and social care services. The guideline was developed by a committee of clinical academics, HCPs and service users with expertise and experience in acne. The committee contributed to the development of the economic model by providing advice on the natural history of acne and its treatment patterns in England, and on model assumptions where evidence was lacking.

### Targeting inflammation in acne: current treatments and future prospects [^116Va5KA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiology

Acne vulgaris is one of the most encountered dermatologic conditions by dermatologists worldwide. Although the true prevalence is difficult to approximate, it is estimated to affect about 9% of the population. In the US alone, 5 million physician visits are attributed to acne annually, costing > 2 billion dollars. Cumulative prevalence approaches 100% in adolescence and decreases with age, affecting up to 64% of individuals aged 20–29 years and 43% of individuals aged 30–39 years, respectively. Age, oily skin, family history, and obesity are all risk factors for developing acne. While well-powered studies comparing acne in various racial and ethnic groups are lacking, acne is regarded as very common across global populations.

Clinical Presentation

Acne is classified morphologically, including comedonal, inflammatory, nodulocystic, and mixed phenotypes with varying severity. Acne can affect the face, chest, and back, or a combination of these areas. Scarring and pigmentary changes are frequent, with post-inflammatory dyspigmentation and keloidal scarring being more common in skin of color.

Quality of Life

Acne may profoundly impair quality of life by limiting self-esteem and self-confidence, placing individuals at a significantly increased risk for developing psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety. Acne is associated with increased risk of self-injury and suicide attempts, highlighting the concerning and significant connection between acne and mental health. The widespread presence of acne along with its effects on quality of life underscore the importance of having a broad spectrum of treatment options targeting its various pathogenetic factors.

### Acne vaccines: therapeutic option for the treatment of acne vulgaris? [^112CzuKP]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne, one of the most common skin diseases, is caused by multiple factors, including Propionibacterium acnes. Studies suggest that responses to P. acnes by host immunity play important roles in its pathogenesis. Identifying immune modulators that attenuate inflammatory responses against P. acnes and the inhibition of bacterial growth may lead to novel avenues of immunologic intervention.

### Young people's perceptions of acne and acne treatments: secondary analysis of qualitative interview data [^1158HTxH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition affecting approximately 95% of adolescents to some extent. First‐line treatments are topical preparations but nonadherence is common. A substantial proportion of patients take long courses of oral antibiotics, associated with antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

This study aimed to explore young people's views and experiences of acne and its treatments.

Methods

We report a secondary thematic analysis of interview data collected by researchers in the Health Experiences Research Group, University of Oxford. A total of 25 transcripts from young people aged 13–24 years with acne were included.

Results

Acne is often perceived as a short‐term self‐limiting condition of adolescence and this appears to have implications for seeking treatment or advice. Participants widely perceived topical treatments as being ineffective, which seemed related to unrealistic expectations around speed of onset of action. Many participants felt they had tried all available topical treatments, although were unsure what was in them or unaware of differences between cosmetic and pharmaceutical treatments. They had concerns around how to use topicals 'properly' and how to avoid side‐effects. They were also concerned about the side‐effects or necessity of oral treatments, although few seemed aware of antibiotic resistance.

Conclusions

People with acne need support to manage their condition effectively, particularly a better understanding of different topicals, how to use them and how to avoid side‐effects. Unrealistic expectations about the onset of action of treatments appears to be a common cause of frustration and nonadherence. Directing people towards accessible evidence‐based information is crucial.

What's already known about this topic?

There is a common perception that acne is a short‐term condition that will resolve without treatment.
Previous research has shown that nonadherence to topical treatments is common and that oral antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed treatment for acne in the U.K.
Further research is needed to understand how young people perceive acne treatments and the implications of this for treatment adherence and self‐management.

What does this study add?

People often said they had tried all available topical preparations for acne, but seemed confused between cosmetic and pharmaceutical treatments.
People seemed unsure how to use topical treatments 'properly' or how to avoid side‐effects. This was rarely discussed with health professionals.
People's perception of acne as a short‐term condition appeared to influence their expectations around onset of action of treatment and their views about its effectiveness and necessity.

What are the clinical implications of the work?

The perception of acne as a short‐term condition has implications for self‐management and motivation to seek and adhere to treatments.
Providing advice about onset of action of treatments and how to prevent side‐effects is crucial, including directing people towards accessible, written, evidence‐based information.
People's confusion about the different topical treatments available may be alleviated by such information, or by encouraging photos or other recordings of treatments tried and for how long.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^115R7pf9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that may cause psychosocial distress. There is evidence that topical treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) are effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne, while topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy are most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Effective treatments have varying costs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England considers cost‐effectiveness when producing national clinical, public health and social care guidance.

Aim

To assess the cost‐effectiveness of treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne to inform relevant NICE guidance.

Methods

A decision–analytical model compared costs and quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) of effective topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, from the perspective of the National Health Service in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a network meta‐analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion.

Results

All of the assessed treatments were more cost‐effective than treatment with placebo (general practitioner visits without active treatment). For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) were most cost‐effective. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, and oral isotretinoin were the most cost‐effective. Results showed uncertainty, as reflected in the wide confidence intervals around mean treatment rankings.

Conclusion

A range of treatments are cost‐effective for the management of acne. Well‐conducted studies are needed to examine the long‐term clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of the full range of acne treatments.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^115SANvA]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris (hereafter referred to as acne) is extremely common, affecting over 90% of teenagers. Among people with acne, approximately 40%–60% have acne persisting into their twenties and it leads to some degree of scarring in approximately 20% of the population. Acne can cause significant distress, decreased self-confidence and increased rates of depression and suicidal thoughts, particularly among women and people identifying as non-white.

As well as limiting quality of life, acne makes a major contribution to antibiotic use among young people: long courses of oral antibiotics are common and acne accounts for the majority of antibiotic exposure among people aged 11–21 years in England. There is high-quality evidence supporting use of topical treatments for acne, which are recommended as first line treatment for mild-to-moderate acne. However, treatment adherence is low and barriers to effective self-management include people discontinuing treatment early due to skin irritation or not seeing early treatment effects, and not differentiating between effective topical treatments and ineffective cosmetic products. Healthcare professionals need to promote treatment adherence by advising about delayed onset of action and how to avoid skin irritation. Providing information to patients is therefore crucial and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) guideline provides a list of information that should be provided for people with acne (see table 1). This may be difficult to cover in brief consultations, highlighting the need for signposting patients towards evidence-based resources, such as those listed in box 1.

### Post-adolescent acne in women: more common and more clinical considerations [^116b7PkU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Current evidence suggests that post-adolescent acne in women is on the rise. Acne in this subgroup of patients commonly follows a specific pattern that can often be treatment resistant and/or prone to relapse, including after oral isotretinoin therapy. With a plethora of medications to choose from for acne treatment, many of which have been used in the past by patients without success, dermatology practitioners often find oral contraceptives and spironolactone to be of benefit in otherwise healthy adult females. Also, some of these patients may have concurrent hormonal anomalies such as polycystic ovarian syndrome or other underlying endocrine disorders, which should also be appropriately worked up by the clinician and managed accordingly. This article reviews some of the underlying pathophysiological factors, available treatment options, and screening guidelines to assist clinicians in the management of acne in adult females.

Acne vulgaris can be easy to diagnose yet difficult to evaluate and manage, especially when it presents in infancy and childhood. The differential diagnosis of acne varies by age and, in some cases, may warrant a work-up in order to rule out underlying systemic abnormalities. Likewise, treatment strategies can be influenced by the patient's age. In this article, we present an overview of the clinical presentations of acne by age, an approach to patient evaluation, and a general strategy for management of this common and important disease.

### The many faces of pediatric acne: a practical algorithm for treatment, maintenance therapy, and skincare recommendations for pediatric acne patients [^115PsGEb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric acne is a common, complex, multifactorial inflammatory skin disease with various expressions in childhood that can be categorized by age, severity, and pubertal status.

Methods

The Faces of Pediatric Acne Project (FoPAP) aims to improve patient outcomes. The FoPAP group developed an algorithm that follows a consensus paper and a clinical case series on pediatric acne by applying the selected literature and drawing from the clinical knowledge and experience of each group member.

Results

The algorithm addresses neonatal, infantile, mid-childhood, preadolescent, and adolescent acne and starts with education on acne, general measures for prevention, treatment, maintenance, and ongoing skin care. Evaluation of pediatric acne requires a directed medical history and physical examination. For mid-childhood acne patients, a workup is warranted, and endocrine-associated abnormalities necessitate referral to a pediatric dermatologist. The second section of the algorithm identifies the type of pediatric acne, followed by the third section on acne treatment using a prescription or nonprescription treatment and skincare options. After successfully controlling the disease, maintenance treatment with topical agents and skincare using gentle cleansers and moisturizers containing lipids such as ceramides is important.

Conclusions

The pediatric acne algorithm offers a comprehensive approach to treating and maintaining pediatric acne. In addition, it may support healthcare providers to bring more attention to pediatric acne patients and improve outcomes. Schachner LA, Andriessen A, Latanya Benjamin L, et al.

### Common and alternate oral antibiotic therapies for acne vulgaris: a review [^114wfhAk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extremely common disorder affecting many adolescents and adults throughout their lifetimes. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial and is thought to involve excess sebum, follicular hyperkeratinization, bacterial colonization, and inflammation. Many therapeutic options exist for treating acne, including topical benzoyl peroxide, topical and oral antibiotics, topical and oral retinoids, and oral contraceptives. Oral antibiotics have been a mainstay in the treatment of acne for decades and function by exerting an antibacterial effect by reducing the follicular colonization of Propionibacterium acnes. Systemic antibiotics also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This article reviews the English language literature on the efficacy of various systemic antibiotics for treating acne vulgaris, including second-line and less historically used medications. We discuss the tetracyclines, including subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, macrolides (notably azithromycin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as treatment options for acne vulgaris.

### Making the case for early treatment of acne [^116LMfvF]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Early acne can be defined as the occurrence of acne at its onset, primarily in preteens, or as acne at its earliest severity (ie, mild to moderate). Although the majority of patients with acne are treated by dermatologists, most, particularly mild to moderate cases, could be successfully managed by primary care physicians. Therefore, it is important for physicians to understand the benefits of treating all types of acne, not just the most severe. Awareness of the emotional impact of acne, particularly in adolescence, as well as recognition of possible scarring are important considerations. To achieve optimal results, physicians should be familiar with classification and severity grading of acne. Also, in-depth knowledge of available acne medications will streamline and optimize treatment regimens. Recognizing, treating, and monitoring the progress of early acne may lead to quicker, better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life.

Treatment options and guidelines

International guidelines recommend either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) as first line treatments, but with differences regarding prescribing products individually or as combination products. The NICE guideline on acne, based on systematic review and network meta-analysis comparisons of acne treatments, acknowledged uncertainty in the evidence base and recommended the options in table 2 as first-line treatments.

Topical treatments

First-line treatments for mild or moderate acne are fixed combination topical preparations containing retinoids, benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics, as outlined in table 2. It is important that patients understand that these have a delayed onset of action (6–8 weeks) and are aware of how to avoid skin irritation when starting treatment (table 1).

Oral antibiotic treatments

The NICE guideline recommends limiting oral antibiotics to 3–6 months, while other guidelines suggest a maximum duration 3 months in order to avoid emergence of antibiotic resistance. First-line oral antibiotic recommendations are lymecycline or doxycycline. If these are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the NICE guideline recommends that trimethoprim or an oral macrolide may be considered. However, clinicians report barriers to discontinuing oral antibiotics once they have been started including patients' understandable concerns about acne relapse. Monotherapy with an oral or topical antibiotic should not be used, because there is good evidence that antimicrobial resistance is significantly reduced by coprescribing benzoyl peroxide. Consensus from clinical guidelines is that continuing topical treatments as maintenance therapy after discontinuing oral antibiotics is important in reducing the risk of relapse.

Hormonal treatments

Hormonal treatments are an alternative for women with acne. Except for co-cyprindiol, hormonal treatments (combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or spironolactone) have an advantage over oral antibiotics and isotretinoin in that they can be continued for longer courses.

Combined oral contraceptives

COCs remain an option for women ('off-label' use in acne). Although inferior to oral antibiotics at 3 months, COCs are equivalent to antibiotics at reducing acne at 6 months. There is no firm evidence to support the use of any one COC over another in terms of acne.

Co-cyprindiol

Co-cyprindiol 2000/35 (cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 µg) is licensed as a second-line treatment for women with severe acne, but is not recommended for long-term use due to safety concerns about rare, but cumulative dose-dependent, increased risk of meningioma.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^111sXWYh]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

Unlabelled

The first-line treatments for acne vulgaris are conventional topical and/or oral medications. However, many patients have contraindications, only partial response, significant adverse effects, or recurrence. Light-based treatments and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical precursors of porphyrins are off-label alternative treatments for acne vulgaris, with their own advantages and disadvantages. To date, there is no consensus on PDT methodology and parameters. An understanding of pathophysiology of acne, light-tissue interactions, and PDT mechanisms of action is helpful whenever PDT is considered as an alternative treatment. In general, blue light alone improves acne because of its antiinflammatory effects. PDT using 5-aminolevulenic acid (ALA) or ALA derivatives induces transient antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects. At high doses, red light PDT may induce inhibition or destruction of sebaceous glands, resulting in clinical improvement.

Learning Objectives

After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to compare different treatments of acne, recognize when photodynamic therapy may be a useful off-label treatment for acne vulgaris, and identify variables that may affect the efficacy of photodynamic therapy.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^115a8gUu]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is very common and can have significant negative impact on people. While sometimes a transient problem, acne may persist for many years and often leads to permanent scars or pigment changes. Guidelines unanimously advise topical treatments as first-line, although differ in recommending either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) alone or in combination. Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises counselling patients regarding avoidance of skin irritation when starting topical treatments and promoting adherence (treatments take 6–8 weeks to work). Oral antibiotics are currently overprescribed for acne but have a role when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment. Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are also effective and there is growing evidence for the use of spironolactone for women with persistent acne. Recent guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency regarding isotretinoin has implications for specialist prescribing and monitoring, and increasing public awareness of potential risks of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction. Although acne is associated with psychiatric disorder, the mental health effects of isotretinoin remain controversial.

### Light therapies for acne [^1153NjFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a very common skin problem that presents with blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed spots. It frequently results in physical scarring and may cause psychological distress. The use of oral and topical treatments can be limited in some people due to ineffectiveness, inconvenience, poor tolerability or side-effects. Some studies have suggested promising results for light therapies.

Objectives

To explore the effects of light treatment of different wavelengths for acne.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2015: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We searched ISI Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts International (from inception). We also searched five trials registers, and grey literature sources. We checked the reference lists of studies and reviews and consulted study authors and other experts in the field to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We updated these searches in July 2016 but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of light for treatment of acne vulgaris, regardless of language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 71 studies, randomising a total of 4211 participants. Most studies were small (median 31 participants) and included participants with mild to moderate acne of both sexes and with a mean age of 20 to 30 years. Light interventions differed greatly in wavelength, dose, active substances used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), and comparator interventions (most commonly no treatment, placebo, another light intervention, or various topical treatments). Numbers of light sessions varied from one to 112 (most commonly two to four). Frequency of application varied from twice daily to once monthly. Selection and performance bias were unclear in the majority of studies. Detection bias was unclear for participant-assessed outcomes and low for investigator-assessed outcomes in the majority of studies. Attrition and reporting bias were low in over half of the studies and unclear or high in the rest. Two thirds of studies were industry-sponsored; study authors either reported conflict of interest, or such information was not declared, so we judged the risk of bias as unclear. Comparisons of most interventions for our first primary outcome 'Participant's global assessment of improvement' were not possible due to the variation in the interventions and the way the studies' outcomes were measured. We did not combine the effect estimates but rated the quality of the evidence as very low for the comparison of light therapies, including PDT to placebo, no treatment, topical treatment or other comparators for this outcome. One study which included 266 participants with moderate to severe acne showed little or no difference in effectiveness for this outcome between 20% aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT (activated by blue light) versus vehicle plus blue light (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.04, low-quality evidence). A study (n = 180) of a comparison of ALA-PDT (activated by red light) concentrations showed 20% ALA was no more effective than 15% (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15) but better than 10% ALA (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.42) and 5% ALA (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 6 (95% CI 3 to 19) and 4 (95% CI 2 to 6) for the comparison of 20% ALA with 10% and 5% ALA, respectively. For our second primary outcome 'Investigator-assessed changes in lesion counts', we combined three RCTs, with 360 participants with moderate to severe acne and found methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) PDT (activated by red light) was no different to placebo cream plus red light with regard to change in inflamed lesions (ILs) (mean difference (MD) -2.85, 95% CI -7.51 to 1.81), percentage change in ILs (MD -10.09, 95% CI -20.25 to 0.06), change in non-inflamed lesions (NILs) (MD -2.01, 95% CI -7.07 to 3.05), or in percentage change in NILs (MD -8.09, 95% CI -21.51 to 5.32). We assessed the evidence as moderate quality for these outcomes meaning that there is little or no clinical difference between these two interventions for lesion counts. Studies comparing the effects of other interventions were inconsistent or had small samples and high risk of bias. We performed only narrative synthesis for the results of the remaining trials, due to great variation in many aspects of the studies, poor reporting, and failure to obtain necessary data. Several studies compared yellow light to placebo or no treatment, infrared light to no treatment, gold microparticle suspension to vehicle, and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide combined with pulsed dye laser to clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide alone. There were also several other studies comparing MAL-PDT to light-only treatment, to adapalene and in combination with long-pulsed dye laser to long-pulsed dye laser alone. None of these showed any clinically significant effects. Our third primary outcome was 'Investigator-assessed severe adverse effects'. Most studies reported adverse effects, but not adequately with scarring reported as absent, and blistering reported only in studies on intense pulsed light, infrared light and photodynamic therapies. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low, meaning we were uncertain of the adverse effects of the light therapies. Although our primary endpoint was long-term outcomes, less than half of the studies performed assessments later than eight weeks after final treatment. Only a few studies assessed outcomes at more than three months after final treatment, and longer-term assessments are mostly not covered in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

High-quality evidence on the use of light therapies for people with acne is lacking. There is low certainty of the usefulness of MAL-PDT (red light) or ALA-PDT (blue light) as standard therapies for people with moderate to severe acne. Carefully planned studies, using standardised outcome measures, comparing the effectiveness of common acne treatments with light therapies would be welcomed, together with adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^114iXepC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Various treatments for acne vulgaris exist, but little is known about their comparative effectiveness in relation to acne severity.

Objectives

To identify best treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, as determined by clinician‐assessed morphological features.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne, published up to May 2020. Outcomes included percentage change in total lesion count from baseline, treatment discontinuation for any reason, and discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool and bias adjustment models. Effects for treatments with ≥ 50 observations each compared with placebo are reported below.

Results

We included 179 RCTs with approximately 35 000 observations across 49 treatment classes. For mild‐to‐moderate acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) [mean difference 26.16%, 95% credible interval (CrI) 16.75–35.36%]; physical – chemical peels, e.g. salicylic or mandelic acid (39.70%, 95% CrI 12.54–66.78%) and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light) (35.36%, 95% CrI 17.75–53.08%). Oral pharmacological treatments (e.g. antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives) did not appear to be effective after bias adjustment. BPO and topical retinoids were less well tolerated than placebo. For moderate‐to‐severe acne, the most effective options for each treatment type were as follows: topical pharmacological – combined retinoid with lincosamide (clindamycin) (44.43%, 95% CrI 29.20–60.02%); oral pharmacological – isotretinoin of total cumulative dose ≥ 120 mg kg⁻¹ per single course (58.09%, 95% CrI 36.99–79.29%); physical – photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) (40.45%, 95% CrI 26.17–54.11%); combined – BPO with topical retinoid and oral tetracycline (43.53%, 95% CrI 29.49–57.70%). Topical retinoids and oral tetracyclines were less well tolerated than placebo. The quality of included RCTs was moderate to very low, with evidence of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence. Uncertainty in findings was high, in particular for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy. However, conclusions were robust to potential bias in the evidence.

Conclusions

Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy were most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy were most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels, photochemical therapy and photodynamic therapy for which evidence was more limited.

What is already known about this topic?
Acne vulgaris is the eighth most common disease globally.
Several topical, oral, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris exist.
Network meta‐analysis (NMA) synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and allows simultaneous inference for all treatments forming an evidence network.
Previous NMAs have assessed a limited range of treatments for acne vulgaris and have not evaluated effectiveness of treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

What does this study add?
For mild‐to‐moderate acne, topical treatment combinations, chemical peels, and photochemical therapy (combined blue/red light; blue light) are most effective.
For moderate‐to‐severe acne, topical treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical treatments, oral isotretinoin and photodynamic therapy (light therapy enhanced by a photosensitizing chemical) are most effective.
Based on these findings, along with further clinical and cost‐effectiveness considerations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations for mild‐to‐moderate acne and fixed topical treatment combinations, or oral tetracyclines combined with topical treatments, for moderate‐to‐severe acne.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acne [^116osPQM]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acne is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is the most common skin disorder in the United States. Therapy targets the four factors responsible for lesion formation: increased sebum production, hyperkeratinization, colonization by Propionibacterium acnes, and the resultant inflammatory reaction. Treatment goals include scar prevention, reduction of psychological morbidity, and resolution of lesions. Grading acne based on lesion type and severity can help guide treatment. Topical retinoids are effective in treating inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions by preventing comedones, reducing existing comedones, and targeting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide is an over-the-counter bactericidal agent that does not lead to bacterial resistance. Topical and oral antibiotics are effective as monotherapy, but are more effective when combined with topical retinoids. The addition of benzoyl peroxide to antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of bacterial resistance. Oral isotretinoin is approved for the treatment of severe recalcitrant acne and can be safely administered using the iPLEDGE program. After treatment goals are reached, maintenance therapy should be initiated. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of laser and light therapies. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered if treatment goals are not met.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^1162UVfh]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris commonly affects adults, adolescents, and preadolescents aged 9 years or older.

Objective

The objective of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne.

Methods

A work group conducted a systematic review and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

This guideline presents 18 evidence-based recommendations and 5 good practice statements. Strong recommendations are made for benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, and oral doxycycline. Oral isotretinoin is strongly recommended for acne that is severe, causing psychosocial burden or scarring, or failing standard oral or topical therapy. Conditional recommendations are made for topical clascoterone, salicylic acid, and azelaic acid, as well as for oral minocycline, sarecycline, combined oral contraceptive pills, and spironolactone. Combining topical therapies with multiple mechanisms of action, limiting systemic antibiotic use, combining systemic antibiotics with topical therapies, and adding intralesional corticosteroid injections for larger acne lesions are recommended as good practice statements.

Limitations

Analysis is based on the best available evidence at the time of the systematic review.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of acne vulgaris.

### Treatment of acne vulgaris [^112LPiES]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Management of acne vulgaris by nondermatologists is increasing. Current understanding of the different presentations of acne allows for individualized treatments and improved outcomes.

Objective

To review the best evidence available for individualized treatment of acne.

Data Sources

Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database to search for all English-language articles on acne treatment from 1966 to 2004.

Study Selection

Well-designed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other systematic reviews are the focus of this article.

Data Extraction

Acne literature is characterized by a lack of standardization with respect to outcome measures and methods used to grade disease severity.

Data Synthesis

Main outcome measures of 29 randomized double-blind trials that were evaluated included reductions in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total acne lesion counts. Topical retinoids reduce the number of comedones and inflammatory lesions in the range of 40% to 70%. These agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with comedones only. Other agents, including topical antimicrobials, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy (in women), and isotretinoin all yield high response rates. Patients with mild to moderate severity inflammatory acne with papules and pustules should be treated with topical antibiotics combined with retinoids. Oral antibiotics are first-line therapy in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne while oral isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodular acne, treatment failures, scarring, frequent relapses, or in cases of severe psychological distress. Long-term topical or oral antibiotic therapy should be avoided when feasible to minimize occurrence of bacterial resistance. Isotretinoin is a powerful teratogen mandating strict precautions for use among women of childbearing age.

Conclusions

Acne responses to treatment vary considerably. Frequently more than 1 treatment modality is used concomitantly. Best results are seen when treatments are individualized on the basis of clinical presentation.

### Topical treatments in acne vulgaris: guidance for the busy dermatologist [^1179QRFf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Acne is a very common skin disease; frequently seen in adolescents and often persisting or occurring into adulthood. Topical therapy is very effective in mild to moderate disease, and is used as maintenance therapy. Fixed combination products have been studied in moderately severe disease. Combinations of benzoyl peroxide and either clindamycin or adapalene appear very effective. When utilizing a topical retinoid alone or in combination, it is essential to incorporate an appropriate skin care regimen to minimize local irritation. In the absence of direct comparative clinical trials, this review provides timely guidance for clinicians on the use of these agents, and their benefits in special populations.

### Acne vulgaris: pathogenesis, treatment, and needs assessment [^114YopSY]. Dermatologic Clinics (2012). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition with substantial cutaneous and psychologic disease burden. Studies suggest that the emotional impact of acne is comparable to that experienced by patients with systemic diseases, like diabetes and epilepsy. In conjunction with the considerable personal burden experienced by patients with acne, acne vulgaris also accounts for substantial societal and health care burden. The pathogenesis and existing treatment strategies for acne are complex. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of acne vulgaris.

### A comparative review of the efficacy and tolerability of retinoid-containing combination regimens for the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11589BCn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Many physicians regularly prescribe combination therapy involving a retinoid for their acne patients. The most common retinoid-containing regimens include either oral antibiotics or topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotic products. A fair number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these combination therapies, but there is a lack of comparative studies examining different regimens head-to-head. Also, many of the noncomparative studies have very similar trial designs. A review of these studies was conducted in order to organize the available data side by side from the different regimens. Although not derived from comparative studies, this presentation of data is expected to provide dermatologists with valuable information from which they can easily make their own comparisons among similarly designed trials.

### Emerging topical antimicrobial options for mild-to-moderate acne: a review of the clinical evidence [^113q8ztD]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical antimicrobial agents are commonly used as first-line agents for the management of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Agents with antibacterial activity (eg, benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin), reduce counts of Propionibacterium acnes, while also decreasing the numbers of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions. In order to optimize efficacy, topical antibiotics are most commonly used in combination with benzoyl peroxide, an approach which also reduces the emergence of strains of P acnes that are less sensitive to antibiotics. Other topical antiacne options include retinoids (with or without an antimicrobial agent), sulfacetamide, sulfacetamide-sulfur, and azelaic acid. Certain formulations of benzoyl peroxide offer improved tolerability, while a new micronized form may enhance efficacy by optimizing follicular penetration. This wide array of options allows dermatologists to tailor topical treatments to the needs of individual patients.

### Cost-effectiveness of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111pW6v7]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This economic analysis allowed estimation of the relative cost‐effectiveness of a range of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne stratified by severity level. The results informed the NICE national guidance on the management of acne vulgaris. There remains a need for well‐conducted studies that examine the long‐term clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of the full range of acne treatments.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^11722LS1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early effective treatment for acne improves patient well-being and may prevent permanent scars or pigment changes. Initial management includes a range of topical treatments, with the option of adding oral antibiotics for patients with more severe acne. There are significant opportunities for reducing oral antibiotic prescribing in acne. These include: promoting effective use of topical treatments; avoiding prolonged courses of oral antibiotics; coprescribing topical treatments alongside oral antibiotics; continuing topical treatments as maintenance treatment and considering alternatives, such as the combined contraceptive pill and spironolactone in primary care. When acne is unresponsive to these measures, timely referral for consideration of isotretinoin should be initiated.

### Update in retinoid therapy of acne [^112Lzqd6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of acne, the most common skin disease, is complex and multifactorial. Clinical experience has demonstrated that parallel targeting of various pathogenetic factors, achieved either by mono- or combination therapy with appropriate drugs, represents the most effective approach to treating acne. Topical retinoids have been shown to expulse mature comedones, reduce microcomedone formation, and exert immunomodulatory effects. They have broad anti-acne activity without the risk of inducing bacterial resistance, which justifies their use as first-line treatment in most types of noninflammatory and inflammatory acne and makes them uniquely suitable as long-term medication to maintain remission after cessation of initial combination therapy. Systemic isotretinoin as a monotherapeutic agent strongly affects all four major pathogenetic factors and has been, in the hand of experienced dermatologists, a potent and safe agent for the treatment of severe and recalcitrant acne forms for more that 20 years. However, patient counseling, careful monitoring, and evaluation and management of adverse events are necessary. The use of isotretinoin has experienced a drawback now that its indication has been lowered from a first-line to a second-line medication.

Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory skin condition that presents management difficulties to cosmetic surgeons. Acute management and treatment focuses on early diagnosis as well as treatment with topical agents, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and nonablative chemical peel and laser applications. The treatment of postinflammatory scarring must be individualized to address potential macular dyschromia, cystic lesions, epithelial bridges, or deep pitted scars. A review of interventional options is presented to apply to the spectrum of acne scarring as well as a review of the literature to address objectively published reports on efficacy.

### Management of acne in pregnancy [^116TGu5N]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acne is one of the most common dermatological conditions to affect women of childbearing age, so it is important to consider the safety of long-term acne treatments on women who could become pregnant. In this review article, we clarify what management options are available to treat acne during pregnancy. Topical treatments, typically first-line for acne, such as azelaic acid, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, dapsone, and retinoids, were reviewed. Systemic treatments, such as zinc supplements, cephalexin, cefadroxil, amoxicillin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and corticosteroids, typically second-line for acne, were also reviewed. Alternative treatments such as light therapy and cosmetic procedures were also evaluated. Due to recommendation of sunscreen utilization during acne treatments, sunscreen usage during pregnancy was also assessed. Management of acne during unplanned pregnancy was discussed in further detail regarding safety and adverse effects. Through summarized tables and examples of studies demonstrating safety and efficacy of treatments, the following is a resource for providers and patients to utilize for management of acne during pregnancy.

### The role of isotretinoin in acne therapy: why not as first-line therapy? facts and controversies [^1121JoCW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Acne is one of the most prevalent diseases in dermatology: Millions of people worldwide experience this distressing condition. To determine the appropriate therapeutic strategy, there is a strong need for a standardized classification system of acne. The exact molecular mechanism of action of isotretinoin is not completely understood; however, oral isotretinoin targets simultaneously at all major mechanisms of acne pathogenesis. Various mass media reports about the risk of teratogenicity and depression from isotretinoin usage as well as the creation of intense prevention programs have created an obstacle to the use of the most active available drug against acne, presenting isotretinoin as a very dangerous regimen. According to recommendations of several international experts, which we share, oral isotretinoin may be prescribed not only to patients with severe disease but indications should be broadened to also include patients with less severe forms of acne, especially in cases with scarring, significant psychologic stress, or failure to respond to conventional therapy.

### Treatment considerations for inflammatory acne: clinical evidence for adapalene 0.1% in combination therapies [^115BX3jh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an exceptionally common, chronic, and recurring disease. It involves multiple etiological factors including follicular hyperkeratinization, increased sebum production, Propionibacterium acnes proliferation, and inflammation. Presently, oral isotretinoin is the only single agent that is effective against all 4 major pathophysiologic features. However, this drug is also responsible for several serious side effects, including teratogenicity. Therefore, it should be used in only the most severe cases and alternative treatment approaches for inflammatory acne, such as initial combination therapy, should be considered first. Combination therapy in inflammatory acne simultaneously targets multiple pathogenic factors. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of combination therapy with a topical retinoid and antimicrobials for mild to moderate inflammatory acne and topical retinoids with oral antibiotics (with or without the use of benzoyl peroxide) for moderate to severe cases of acne, followed by maintenance therapy with topical retinoids. This review evaluates the rationale and clinical evidence for the use of adapalene in combination therapy for inflammatory acne.

### Management of acne vulgaris: an evidence-based update [^114f59ic]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

This review summarizes clinically important findings from 3 systematic reviews, 1 updated guideline and a selection from the 62 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between February 2007 and January 2009 on the topic of acne vulgaris. Low glycaemic-load diets might reduce acne severity but this remains unproven. Written patient information leaflets have not been surpassed by other communication methods. New combination topical treatments have not shown convincing advantages over current combination products such as clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide. Topical dapsone is superior to placebo but has yet to be compared with standard topical treatments. Long-term topical tretinoin to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer in elderly men was associated with higher all-cause mortality, but there is currently no evidence of increased mortality for topical retinoid use when treating acne. All oral tetracyclines have similar efficacy, yet minocycline is the most costly. Oral isotretinoin monotherapy remains the gold-standard treatment for severe acne. Flutamide plus the oral contraceptive pill is beneficial for acne associated with polycystic ovary syndrome. Photodynamic therapy, phototherapy and laser therapy cannot be recommended universally for acne until minimal postinflammatory pigmentation and longer-term benefit can be shown, especially with current high costs. Development of non-antibiotic therapies is preferable to minimize the risk of community antibiotic resistance. Future trials should use active comparators at optimum doses and avoid noninferiority comparisons unless appropriately powered. Trials need to shift from using multiple, unvalidated outcome measures to including patient-reported and quality-of-life outcomes, and all trials should be registered on a public clinical-trials database.

### Recent advances in acne pathogenesis: implications for therapy [^114pLNGA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acne pathogenesis is a multifactorial process that occurs at the level of the pilosebaceous unit. While acne was previously perceived as an infectious disease, recent data have clarified it as an inflammatory process in which Propionibacterium acnes and innate immunity play critical roles in propagating abnormal hyperkeratinization and inflammation. Alterations in sebum composition, and increased sensitivity to androgens, also play roles in the inflammatory process. A stepwise approach to acne management utilizes topical agents for mild to moderate acne (topical retinoid as mainstay ± topical antibiotics) and escalation to oral agents for more resistant cases (oral antibiotics or hormonal agents in conjunction with a topical retinoid or oral isotretinoin alone for severe acne). Concerns over antibiotic resistance and the safety issues associated with isotretinoin have prompted further research into alternative medications and devices for the treatment of acne. Radiofrequency, laser, and light treatments have demonstrated modest improvement for inflammatory acne (with blue-light photodynamic therapy being the only US FDA-approved treatment). However, limitations in study design and patient follow-up render these modalities as adjuncts rather than standalone options. This review will update readers on the latest advancements in our understanding of acne pathogenesis and treatment, with emphasis on emerging treatment options that can help improve patient outcomes.

### Adolescent female acne: etiology and management [^112xsB7s]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris, a multifactorial condition often conferring significant psychosocial morbidity, affects an estimated 40 million people in the United States. The majority of these individuals are adolescents and young adults. The pathophysiology of the condition is still not fully known, but it is believed to be related in part to excess sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, microbial colonization by P acnes, and inflammation. Prior to initiating treatment in a female patient, a hyperandrogenic state must be considered and ruled out through history, physical exam, and laboratory evaluation if necessary. Treatment options are vast and include hormonal therapy among others. Hormonal therapies have long been noted to reduce acne lesions and offer a valuable adjuvant to standard therapy. Hormonal agents are thought to improve acne by blocking the androgen receptor and/or decreasing circulating androgens which leads to decreased sebum production. Hormonal treatment options include spironolactone, other antiandrogens, and oral contraceptives. The use of these agents to effectively treat acne has been demonstrated in several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Optimal results are often achieved with combination therapy with the goal of targeting multiple pathogenic pathways in acne development.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111kckqj]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations should reduce variation in practice, as a number of commonly used treatments showed evidence of low or no efficacy after adjusting for potential bias (e.g. some topical pharmacological monotherapies, oral antibiotic monotherapies in mild‐to‐moderate acne, hormonal contraceptives) and were thus not recommended as first‐line acne treatments. However, hormonal contraceptives were considered as options for people with acne vulgaris and PCOS, if their chosen first‐line treatment was not effective, based on available evidence specific to this population.

Further research was recommended for chemical peels, photochemical and photodynamic therapies (for which the evidence was promising but limited), for hormone‐modifying agents, e.g. metformin and spironolactone (for which no evidence was identified), and for oral isotretinoin in reduced dosage (< 0.5 mg kg⁻¹ per day) or reduced‐dose regime (e.g. weekly or biweekly), to explore whether it is an effective, safer and better‐tolerated alternative to standard‐dose oral isotretinoin (0.5–1 mg kg⁻¹ per day).

In conclusion, this NMA allowed evidence synthesis from a wide range of treatments for acne vulgaris stratified by severity level. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, chemical peels and photochemical therapy appeared to be most effective for mild‐to‐moderate acne. Topical pharmacological treatment combinations, oral antibiotics combined with topical pharmacological treatments, oral isotretinoin, and photodynamic therapy appeared to be most effective for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Further research is warranted for chemical peels and for photochemical and photodynamic therapies for which evidence was more limited and uncertain.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^111u9x2K]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A strength of our review and NMA was the inclusion of a wide range of acne treatments and, subsequently, a much larger number of RCTs (112 for mild‐to‐moderate and 67 for moderate‐to‐severe acne) than either of the two previously published NMAs. Furthermore, our NMA assessed treatments for moderate‐to‐severe acne. The NMA results informed national clinical guidance. Our methodology enabled evidence synthesis from direct and indirect treatment comparisons and allowed simultaneous inference on all treatments. Our NMA employed class models to gain precision on the effects of treatments within the same class and to connect networks disconnected at the treatment level, thus allowing consideration of a wider evidence base. We measured efficacy using the percentage change in total acne lesion count from baseline, as this is commonly reported across RCTs or can often be estimated using other available data, which allowed inclusion of a large evidence base in the respective analyses. Another validated efficacy measure, the Investigator Global Assessment scale, recommended by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the assessment of effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of acne vulgaris, was used by fewer studies in our dataset; therefore, had we selected this outcome to measure efficacy, we would have limited our evidence base.

Dietary interventions (e.g. milk‐free diet, low glycaemic load diet), which may have an effect on acne vulgaris and its response to treatment, were not included in this review but were assessed in another review conducted to inform the NICE guideline. Although we searched for treatments for acne vulgaris at any body site, the majority of the RCTs included in our review focused on facial acne. This is a limitation of the evidence base and not of the review per se. Another potential limitation of our review was its focus on evidence published in the English language, following NICE guidance. On the other hand, evidence suggests that use of language restrictions in systematic review‐based meta‐analyses in conventional medicine does not introduce systematic bias. Furthermore, as the purpose of our NMA was to inform national guidance in England, we focused on pharmacological treatments that are available in the UK. This resulted in the exclusion of a number of potentially effective drug treatments for acne from the NMA, as they were not licensed in the UK at the time of the analysis (e.g. topical dapsone, topical tetracyclines). Final searches for evidence were conducted in May 2020, and it is possible that new evidence (and new treatments) have emerged since.

### Harmonizing measurement of satisfaction with acne scar treatments: can we all sing the same tune? [^112JBMbb]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

We do research to understand what is happening now and how that can have future ramifications. In acne scar repair, reporting patient satisfaction in a standardized manner can achieve these goals. Dermatologic procedures for acne scars can be life-changing for the patient, but the extent of that depends on the patient satisfaction with results of the procedure. Until our research was completed, it was unknown how often patient satisfaction was reported in studies of these procedural interventions and how this was measured. In this concise article, we share our findings.

We had previously identified, in a systematic review, studies on patient-reported outcome measures regarding satisfaction with acne treatment in general. We adhered to the required standards for systematic search and quality assessment using a prespecified protocol and searched multiple databases from inception to June 2020 without language restriction. We found that beyond the studies on medical treatment of acne, there was a substantial number on treatment of acne scars. Of the 188 studies we identified reporting patient satisfaction with acne treatment, 97 (52%) were on procedural treatment of acne scars, even more than those on treating acne (91/48%). This shows that dermatological surgeons considered patient satisfaction a relevant and important outcome to measure. This increasing recognition was reflected in the number of studies reporting treatment satisfaction of acne interventions over time: 5 in 2001 to 2005, 20 in 2006 to 2010, 24 in 2011 to 2015, and 42 in 2016 to 2020.

Patients with acne scars can present with multiple acne scar morphologies — hypertrophic and atrophic (further differentiated into ice pick, saucer, rolling, and boxcar) — and potentially varying locations including the face and torso. Advances in dermatologic technology have provided a range of repair options for scar correction. This real-world spectrum is also reflected in our review, as we found the following procedures used in publications on acne scars: various laser and light devices (59), fillers (11), radiofrequency/focused ultrasound (10), microneedling (9), topicals/peels (7), subcision (7), and a combination of treatments (15). Laser treatments were mainly versions of CO 2, erbium, or Yttrium aluminium garnet lasers. An overview of all the studies can be found in our original systematic review.

### Acne vulgaris: treatment guidelines from the AAD… [^115TrYKP]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics.
- Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone.

First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin. First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin.

Inflammatory acne can be treated with topical dapsone 5% gel, especially in women. Azelaic acid can be used to manage dyspigmentation that occurs with inflammatory acne. For acne in children who have not reached adolescence, topical adapalene, tretinoin, and benzoyl peroxide are safe to use. In the short term, adding an oral corticosteroid when initiating the usual acne therapy in persons with severe inflammatory acne can be beneficial. Low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended for persons with adrenal hyperandrogenism.

### Patient information: acne treatment… [^114W1cDu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Acne is a chronic skin condition involving inflammation of the skin on the face, neck, chest, or back. Medications to Treat Acne Mild acne is treated with topical medications, some of which are available without a prescription. Topical treatments are often used in combination. Side effects may include skin dryness, redness, and irritation. Patients with acne should discuss treatment options with their primary care doctor or a dermatologist. Topical antimicrobials target certain types of skin bacteria. Examples include benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, erythromycin, and azelaic acid. Topical retinoids increase skin cell turnover and shedding and decrease sebum production and other causes of inflammation. Examples include adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene, and trifarotene. Other acne treatments include topical dapsone, sulfur, and salicylic acid.

Moderate and severe acne, along with mild acne that does not respond to the above treatments, can be treated with stronger medications, many of which are taken orally. Antibiotics target certain types of skin bacteria and are available in topical and oral forms. Hormonal treatments target hormone receptors and reduce sebum production. They are available in topical and oral forms. Oral retinoids are reserved for the most severe and treatment-resistant forms of acne. In general, oral medications have more side effects than topical treatments. Many acne treatments cannot be used while breastfeeding or pregnant, and some, such as isotretinoin, require blood tests to monitor for harmful side effects.

Basic skin care can also be helpful for acne management, including gentle skin cleansers, noncomedogenic skin care products, and avoidance of skin scrubbing and picking. Other Acne Treatments Select physical skin treatments can be used for all stages of acne, although there is less evidence for these compared with topical and oral medications. Treatments include chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and laser or light-based treatments. What to Expect After Treatment.

### Treatment options for the patient with acne vulgaris… [^115anYbx]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

In patients with mild to moderate acne or noninflammatory comedones, topical therapy is indicated. Tretinoin reduces the formation of comedones by reversing the abnormal keratinization process. Because topical tretinoin is irritating and photosensitive, therapy usually begins with the lowest-strength cream or gel, increasing the formulation strength until the desired result is achieved. Other topical agents include salicylic acid, adapalene, azelaic acid and isotretinoin, but not all of these preparations are currently available in the United States. Topical benzoyl peroxide targets. P. acnes and is available in gels, lotions, creams and soaps. Local irritation may be reduced by using the lower-strength preparations or by applying the product less frequently. Topical bacteriostatic antibiotics such as clindamycin, tetracycline and erythromycin are effective in acne vulgaris but may induce resistant strains of P. acnes.

Combination topical therapy is commonly used in the treatment of acne, because concurrent therapy with several agents has a synergistic antimicrobial effect. Benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics and tretinoin may be used concurrently. Several agents may be combined in one preparation, but an alternating schedule of application of individual agents may be less irritating. The choice of vehicle depends on the patient's skin type. Non-greasy gels and solutions tend to dry the skin and may be preferred by patients with oily skin. Creams and lotions may be more cosmetically acceptable. Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin and cotrimoxazole are used in patients with mild to moderate disease, those with affected areas that cannot be adequately covered with topical medications and those with a high potential for scarring or substantial pigmentary changes.

These medications act primarily by inhibiting bacterial growth, although some also have anti-inflammatory properties. Severe nodular acne is best treated with isotretinoin. Therapy usually continues for 20 weeks. About 15 percent of cases relapse after a single course, but most patients who relapse show enhanced results from a second course of treatment. Further courses of isotretinon are seldom necessary. Clinical improvement may continue for up to five months following a course of therapy, so retreatment should not be attempted within six months. Isotretinoin has several serious potential side effects, particularly spontaneous abortion and congenital malformations. Stringent methods of contraception are mandatory when this drug is used in women with childbearing potential.
