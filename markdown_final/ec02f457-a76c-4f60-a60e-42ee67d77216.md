## Question

fosfomycin for e coli uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use fosfomycin for Escherichia coli urinary tract infections, including indications, susceptibility, efficacy, safety, pharmacology, guidelines, and resistance stewardship considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the on-label indication and what is explicitly not covered. Then, I should verify real-world susceptibility patterns for E. coli, including ESBL and MDR phenotypes. Next, I will review comparative efficacy data versus standard agents in uncomplicated cystitis and consider evidence for off-label, step-down use in febrile or complicated infections. After that, I need to check safety, drug interactions, dosing in renal impairment, and PK/PD targets. Finally, I should synthesize guideline positions, weigh resistance risks, and outline a pragmatic, stewardship-aligned prescribing algorithm anchored to culture results and local antibiograms [^112HsPQX] [^11335mYn] [^1139v98s] [^113uoNCD] [^116o8CN8].

> Let me first confirm the labeled indication and scope so I don't drift into off-label territory without acknowledging it. Oral fosfomycin tromethamine is indicated only for acute uncomplicated cystitis in women due to susceptible E. coli or Enterococcus faecalis, and it is not indicated for pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess; if bacteriuria persists or recurs, an alternative agent should be selected, and repeated daily doses for a single episode are discouraged by the label [^112HsPQX] [^11335mYn] [^116HbXnC]. Wait, I should verify pregnancy use and recurrent UTI guidance too; single-dose fosfomycin is an accepted option in pregnancy for uncomplicated lower UTI and appears comparable in efficacy to multi-day oral beta-lactams with better adherence, and for recurrent UTIs in women, guidelines include fosfomycin among first-line choices based on the local antibiogram [^112cXzjt] [^112YwALJ] [^115fXgm6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empirical coverage; I need to check E. coli susceptibility to fosfomycin across general, ESBL, and MDR isolates. Broad surveillance consistently shows very high in vitro activity against community E. coli, often in the 97–98% susceptibility range, and this remains favorable even in many ESBL-producing isolates, with older systematic data showing approximately 97% susceptibility at MIC ≤ 64 mg/L for ESBL E. coli, though activity is less predictable for Klebsiella [^114m7WKZ] [^112LE9a2] [^113WhEj8]. But wait, what about resistance mechanisms and geography; plasmid-mediated fosA3 is increasingly reported and often travels with CTX-M ESBLs, with resistance rare in the US but rising in regions with heavy fosfomycin use, underscoring the need to anchor empirical choices to local antibiograms and to verify isolate susceptibility when possible [^1152XUde] [^112Jd72N] [^111HMGzT]. I should double-check FDA advice on diagnostic stewardship here; the label recommends obtaining urine culture and susceptibility testing before and after therapy, especially if symptoms persist or recur [^116HbXnC].

> Next, I should review head-to-head clinical efficacy for uncomplicated cystitis to calibrate expectations. In a pivotal randomized trial, 5 days of nitrofurantoin outperformed single-dose fosfomycin for clinical resolution and microbiological eradication at day 28, suggesting modest inferiority of fosfomycin versus nitrofurantoin in this setting, although adherence favors single-dose regimens and not all syntheses agree [^1139v98s]. Let me reconsider the broader evidence; a meta-analysis across randomized trials found no statistically significant difference between fosfomycin and comparators in overall clinical or microbiological outcomes, though heterogeneity limits precision, and some US real-world data associate fosfomycin with higher treatment failure, potentially reflecting selection bias and cost-driven underuse rather than intrinsic inferiority alone [^111ZFoxh] [^114Lh2iX].

> I will now examine the off-label, step-down role in febrile or complicated UTIs, making sure I separate clinical from microbiological cure. In women with E. coli febrile UTI who had initially received IV therapy and had susceptible isolates, oral fosfomycin 3 g once daily was noninferior to ciprofloxacin for early clinical cure but showed lower microbiological cure and more gastrointestinal adverse events, findings consistent across multiple analyses and trial reports from the same program [^113uoNCD] [^112PdYyx] [^114jxgu6] [^115YQtQ4]. Hold on, I should verify whether PK/PD might explain the microbiologic gap; modeling in bacteremic UTI suggests even intensive IV fosfomycin regimens struggle to meet resistance suppression targets, highlighting why step-down use should be limited to confirmed susceptible isolates with close follow-up [^114qfThA].

> Let me consider safety, tolerability, and dosing nuances because these shape patient selection. The dominant adverse effects are gastrointestinal and occur more frequently with fosfomycin than ciprofloxacin in febrile UTI step-down trials, and some patients discontinue therapy for AEs; the label further notes that repeating daily doses for a single cystitis episode increases adverse events without improving outcomes, reinforcing the single-dose approach for on-label use [^111maeWS] [^116HbXnC] [^1165FGVC]. I need to check key interactions and contraindications; metoclopramide reduces absorption and should be avoided, cimetidine is not an issue, and hypersensitivity is a contraindication per labeling [^116AD9zT] [^114byDq8] [^113uJXon]. I should confirm renal dosing; no adjustment is needed for eGFR 11–20 mL/min/1.73 m² or with continuous renal replacement therapy for the oral formulation, though clinical monitoring remains prudent [^113EK93w] [^115wn1Fb].

> Next, I should review PK/PD and exposure variability to understand who might underperform on single-dose therapy. After a standard 3 g oral dose, peak urinary concentrations approach 2000 mg/L with prolonged time above EUCAST breakpoints, but there is marked interindividual variability and high urine output can reduce exposure and time above MIC, raising the risk of subtherapeutic coverage in a subset of patients [^115JfJLz]. Let me verify the pharmacodynamic implications; while urinary levels are typically bactericidal against most E. coli with MIC ≤ 64 mg/L, achieving robust resistance suppression is challenging and likely contributes to lower microbiological cure in some contexts and to stewardship concerns with repeated dosing [^116AD9zT] [^114qfThA].

> I should confirm where guidelines position fosfomycin today so my recommendations align with consensus practice. IDSA-endorsed frameworks include fosfomycin as a first-line option for acute uncomplicated cystitis alongside nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX, contingent on local resistance patterns, and the 2025 EAU guideline lists fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, and nitrofurantoin as first-line choices for female cystitis; AUA/CUA/SUFU recommend fosfomycin for recurrent UTI based on local antibiograms [^112NTTp8] [^116o8CN8] [^115fXgm6]. Wait, I should verify the resistance backdrop; recent US outpatient data show higher nonsusceptibility to TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones than to nitrofurantoin, leaving fosfomycin as an important alternative when local patterns disfavour other agents [^112NTTp8].

> I need to ensure I address resistance dynamics and stewardship because overuse can accelerate plasmid-mediated resistance. The global spread of fosA3, often co-located with CTX-M ESBLs, and regional rises in fosfomycin resistance where use is heavy, argue for restrained, targeted prescribing anchored to culture data when feasible and strict avoidance of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria or nonspecific symptoms, which are frequent drivers of inappropriate UTI antibiotics [^112Jd72N] [^111HMGzT] [^111ag7A6]. Hold on, I should verify US prevalence; fosfomycin resistance remains uncommon in many US settings but vigilance is warranted as selective pressure increases [^114Dimvm].

> Putting this together, I should outline a pragmatic, verification-heavy approach for uncomplicated cystitis in women. For on-label use, prescribe a single 3 g oral sachet mixed with water, avoid concomitant metoclopramide, and counsel that symptoms should improve in 2–3 days; obtain pre-therapy culture when possible and ensure reassessment, switching therapy if bacteriuria or symptoms persist or recur, per labeling guidance and stewardship best practice [^115yWowN] [^116AD9zT] [^116HbXnC] [^112HsPQX]. Let me double-check special populations; in pregnancy with lower UTI, single-dose fosfomycin is an acceptable option and may improve adherence compared with multi-day beta-lactams, while in significant renal impairment on the oral product no standard dose adjustment is required, though clinical monitoring remains essential [^112cXzjt] [^112YwALJ] [^113EK93w].

> For febrile or otherwise complicated presentations, I need to be explicit so there is no confusion. Oral fosfomycin is not indicated for pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess, so I should avoid its empirical use in these syndromes; however, in women with E. coli febrile UTI who have received initial IV therapy and have confirmed fosfomycin susceptibility, once-daily 3 g oral fosfomycin can be considered as step-down with counseling about gastrointestinal adverse events and a plan for close clinical and microbiologic follow-up given lower microbiologic cure rates compared with ciprofloxacin in trials [^11335mYn] [^113uoNCD] [^112PdYyx]. Wait, I almost generalized that to all complicated UTIs, but I should clarify that evidence and PK/PD suggest caution, especially where resistance suppression is critical or susceptibility testing is unreliable, and IV fosfomycin regimens are a different clinical question entirely [^114qfThA].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and where I might pivot based on patient-specific factors. In regions with high nitrofurantoin susceptibility and low cost barriers, nitrofurantoin remains preferred for many women with uncomplicated cystitis, while fosfomycin is a valuable first-line alternative when adherence is paramount, when local resistance patterns disfavor other agents, or when ESBL-producing E. coli are prevalent; in all cases, culture-directed therapy, avoidance of unnecessary repeat dosing, and prompt switch if symptoms persist are essential to maximize outcomes and protect future activity [^1139v98s] [^112NTTp8] [^113WhEj8] [^116HbXnC].

---

Fosfomycin is a **first-line option** [^112NTTp8] for uncomplicated E. coli cystitis, with a **single 3 g oral dose** [^115yWowN] providing high urinary concentrations [^115JfJLz] and broad activity, including ESBL producers [^113WhEj8]. Clinical cure rates are 58–70% and microbiologic eradication 63–74%, slightly lower than nitrofurantoin but with better compliance [^1139v98s] [^111ZFoxh]. Resistance remains low [^114m7WKZ] but can emerge via plasmid-mediated fosA3 [^1152XUde]; use only for uncomplicated cystitis, **not pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs** [^112HsPQX] [^11335mYn]. Fosfomycin is safe in pregnancy [^112YwALJ] and renal impairment without dose adjustment [^113EK93w]; avoid metoclopramide [^116HbXnC] and monitor for diarrhea [^112cXzjt].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

- **Absorption and distribution**: Fosfomycin tromethamine is rapidly absorbed orally, achieving peak plasma levels within 2–2.5 hours. It distributes widely, including into urine, where it achieves high concentrations [^115JfJLz].

- **Elimination**: Fosfomycin is primarily excreted unchanged in urine, maintaining bactericidal concentrations for up to 48 hours following a single dose [^115JfJLz].

- **Mechanism of action**: Fosfomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by inactivating enolpyruvyl transferase, an enzyme essential for peptidoglycan synthesis, resulting in bactericidal activity [^116AD9zT].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by E. coli, including multidrug-resistant and ESBL-producing strains, responds well to **fosfomycin** [^113WhEj8]; clinical cure rates range from **58% to 70%**, with microbiological eradication rates of **63% to 74%** [^1139v98s]. Comparison with other antibiotics shows that clinical efficacy is slightly lower than **nitrofurantoin** but comparable to other first-line agents, and the **single-dose regimen** significantly improves patient adherence [^111ZFoxh] [^1139v98s].

---

## Resistance patterns

Current resistance rates among E. coli isolates remain low globally, typically below **5%**, though resistance can emerge, particularly with repeated or inappropriate use [^114m7WKZ] [^113jeXDD]. Mechanisms of resistance include **plasmid-mediated fosA3** genes, reduced permeability, and target site mutations, with plasmid-mediated resistance particularly concerning due to its potential for rapid dissemination [^1152XUde] [^112Jd72N].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Adverse effects**: Fosfomycin is generally well-tolerated. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain [^112cXzjt]. Serious adverse events are rare [^111ZFoxh].

- **Contraindications**: Fosfomycin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug [^114byDq8].

- **Special populations**: Fosfomycin is considered safe for use in pregnant women [^112cXzjt] [^112YwALJ] and patients with renal impairment, with no dose adjustment required [^113EK93w].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

IDSA guidelines recommend fosfomycin as a **first-line agent** for uncomplicated cystitis, particularly in areas with high resistance rates to other antibiotics [^112NTTp8]. Similarly, **EAU guidelines** recommend fosfomycin as a first-line therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis in women [^116o8CN8] [^115fXgm6].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Dosage and administration**: The recommended dosage for uncomplicated cystitis is a single 3 g oral dose, dissolved in water and taken with or without food [^115yWowN].

- **Patient counseling**: Patients should be informed that symptoms should improve within 2–3 days. If symptoms persist, they should contact their healthcare provider [^116HbXnC].

- **Drug interactions**: Metoclopramide may reduce fosfomycin's effectiveness by lowering serum and urinary concentrations. Cimetidine does not affect fosfomycin pharmacokinetics [^1165FGVC].

---

Fosfomycin is a highly effective, well-tolerated, and convenient single-dose oral antibiotic for uncomplicated E. coli UTIs, including multidrug-resistant and ESBL-producing strains. Its low resistance rates and favorable safety profile make it a **valuable first-line therapy**, supported by major clinical guidelines [^116o8CN8].

### Antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired urine bacterial isolates in French Amazonia [^114m7WKZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

Enterobacterales were resistant to amoxicillin in 70.9%, to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 25.2%, and to cefotaxime in 5.9% of cases. Interestingly, they were sensitive to fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin in 98% and 86% of cases, respectively. Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin seem to be a reasonable option for empirical treatment of uncomplicated UTIs since they are active against common causes of UTIs, mainly E. coli, whereas nonfermentative GNRs are naturally resistant. Overall, resistance to these two antibiotics is uncommon in Enterobacterales, and many multidrug-resistant organisms retain susceptibility.

Fluoroquinolones were active against 90% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates; they were reported as effective for clinical and microbiological cures in patients with uncomplicated UTIs. However, they should be spared in the first- and second-line UTI treatment because of their selection pressure and also because they should be saved for more severe infections.

The susceptibility trend of Enterobacterales showed a decreasing profile over time for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, and nitrofurantoin. In contrast, the susceptibility trends for gentamycin and ofloxacin were stable. This can be explained by the antibiotic pressure in the community.

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^1139v98s]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

This study, published by Huttner A and colleagues in 2018 in the journal JAMA, investigates the effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin in female patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). It is related to diseases such as acute cystitis and acute pyelonephritis. The study was a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 513 female patients.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Female patients with uncomplicated UTI.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Pregnancy and lactation, suspected upper UTI, antibiotic use or any symptoms consistent with UTI in the preceding 4 weeks, indwelling catheter, immunosuppression, and ongoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Nitrofurantoin group**: 255 patients received oral nitrofurantoin (100 mg PO TID for 5 days).
	- **Fosfomycin group**: 258 patients received a single 3 g oral dose of fosfomycin.

- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in clinical resolution at 28 days after therapy completion (70% vs 58%; ARD 12, 95% CI 4 to 21).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in microbiologic resolution (74% vs 63%; ARD 11, 95% CI 1 to 20).
	- Significant increase in clinical response at 14 days (75% vs 66%; ARR 9, 95% CI 1 to 17).

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^112HsPQX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fosfomycin tromethamine is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) in women due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. It is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess.

If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with fosfomycin tromethamine, other therapeutic agents should be selected. (See precautions and clinical studies sections.)

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^11335mYn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Fosfomycin tromethamine is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) in women, due to susceptible strains of *Escherichia coli* and *Enterococcus faecalis*. Fosfomycin tromethamine is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with fosfomycin tromethamine, other therapeutic agents should be selected. (See precautions and clinical studies sections.)

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^116HbXnC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Do not use more than one single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine to treat a single episode of acute cystitis. Repeated daily doses of fosfomycin tromethamine did not improve clinical success or microbiological eradication rates compared to single-dose therapy, but did increase the incidence of adverse events. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after the completion of therapy.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be informed that fosfomycin tromethamine can be taken with or without food and that their symptoms should improve in two to three days after taking it. If symptoms do not improve, the patient should contact their healthcare provider. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes, after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Metoclopramide**: When coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine, metoclopramide, a drug which increases gastrointestinal motility, lowers the serum concentration and urinary excretion of fosfomycin. Other drugs that increase gastrointestinal motility may produce similar effects.
	- **Cimetidine**: Cimetidine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin when coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine.

### Contemporary resistance trends and mechanisms for the old antibiotics colistin, temocillin, fosfomycin, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin [^113jeXDD]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in reviving older antimicrobial agents, particularly those with activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Because many such antimicrobials are not licensed in all countries, there is a paucity of international surveillance data, and none of these agents is part of any antimicrobial resistance surveillance at the EU level. Some of these agents are used in lower urinary tract infections, whereas most available supranational surveillance data pertain to severe infections such as bloodstream infections.

Among old antimicrobial agents, the most interesting compounds from a clinical perspective are the two intravenous agents, colistin and temocillin, the two oral agents, pivmecillinam and nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin, which is available for both intravenous and oral use. The most interesting target microorganisms are Enterobacteriaceae, although colistin also has good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species.

Recent European surveillance data point to approximately 5% resistance to colistin in general among Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas resistance in carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae may be up to 15% to 20% in some settings. Temocillin is stable against many extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and some carbapenemase producers, but low-level resistance is not uncommon in extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers, and high-level resistance is always seen with OXA-48 group carbapenemases. Fosfomycin resistance is rare in areas with limited use but is increasing.

### Fosfomycin trometamol versus comparator antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZFoxh]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety profile of fosfomycin versus comparator antibiotics in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis. Relevant databases were searched using methods recommended by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. We assessed the risk of bias and confounders. The study's primary endpoint was clinical or microbiological success, defined as complete (cure) and/or incomplete resolution of symptoms at the end of treatment (improvement) and/or microbiological eradication.

After screening 539 articles, 15 were included, which recruited a total of 2,295 adult female patients. Fourteen of these studies were used for microbiological eradication analysis. We used 11 of the 15 articles in a total of 1,976 patients for clinical resolution and 11 in a total of 1,816 patients for safety outcome analysis. No difference was found for clinical resolution in all comparators combined in 11 randomized controlled trials in a total of 1,976 patients (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.91–1.49, p = 0.13). No difference was found for microbiological eradication in 14 randomized controlled trials in a total of 2,052 patients (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.83–1.30, p = 0.09) or for safety outcome in 11 randomized controlled trials in a total of 1,816 patients (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.86–1.58, p = 0.33). Most adverse effects reported for fosfomycin were transient, and single-dose therapy seems to have resulted in better patient compliance.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^115yWowN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: The recommended dosage for women 18 years of age and older with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (acute cystitis) is one sachet of fosfomycin tromethamine. Fosfomycin tromethamine may be taken with or without food.

Fosfomycin tromethamine should not be taken in its dry form. Always mix fosfomycin tromethamine with water before ingesting (see preparation section).

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^116AD9zT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fosfomycin, the active component of fosfomycin tromethamine, demonstrates in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms linked with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. At therapeutic doses, fosfomycin is bactericidal in urine. Its bactericidal action stems from the inactivation of the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase, which irreversibly blocks the condensation of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine with p-enolpyruvate. This is one of the initial steps in bacterial cell wall synthesis. Moreover, fosfomycin reduces the adherence of bacteria to uroepithelial cells.

There is generally no cross-resistance between fosfomycin and other classes of antibacterial agents, such as beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. Fosfomycin has shown activity against most strains of certain microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the indications and usage section.

- **Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms**: Enterococcus faecalis.

- **Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms**: Escherichia coli.

The following in vitro data are available; however, their clinical significance is unknown. Fosfomycin exhibits in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64 mcg/mL or less against most (≥ 90%) strains of specific microorganisms. Nonetheless, the safety and effectiveness of fosfomycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

### High interindividual variability in urinary fosfomycin concentrations in healthy female volunteers [^115JfJLz]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is increasingly being prescribed for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of emerging drug resistance. Surprisingly, little is known about the urinary concentrations of fosfomycin and its interindividual variation after the standard single 3-g oral dose. We aimed to gain more insight into urinary fosfomycin pharmacokinetics to evaluate its effectiveness.

- **Methods**: Three grams of fosfomycin trometamol was administered to 40 healthy female volunteers with an estimated mean glomerular filtration rate of > 90 mL/min/1.73m². Urine samples were collected from every urination during 48 hours, and then twice daily for up to 7 days. Time, volume, and pH were recorded. Concentrations were quantified with UPLC-MS/MS. Effectiveness was evaluated based on urinary concentrations and the target MIC of E. coli, the most common uropathogen.

- **Results**: A high interindividual variability was found. Peak concentration was 1982.0 ± 1257.4 mg/L, urinary half-life 12.4 ± 5.7 hours, and excretion rate over 48 hours 29.9 ± 7.1 mg/h. Recovery was 44.5 ± 12.6% after 48 hours and 47.0 ± 10.4% after 7 days. Concentrations remained above the EUCAST breakpoint of 32 mg/L in 100% of the volunteers over the first 24 hours, 67.5% for 48 hours, and 30% for 72 hours. A high urinary output was associated with low urinary concentrations and consequently reduced time > MIC, AUC 0–7days/MIC, and C max/MIC values.

- **Conclusions**: Considerable interindividual variability observed in the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin signifies a risk for inadequate drug exposure in a significant number of patients.

### Comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose antibiotics for lower urinary tract infection in pregnancy [^112YwALJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy of fosfomycin trometamol, cefuroxime axetil, and amoxicillin clavulanate antibiotics, and to assess the difference in patient compliance, in the treatment of urinary tract infections during pregnancy, a study was conducted.

Between September 2007 and May 2008, 90 out of 324 pregnant women with complaints of lower urinary tract infection, who were followed at the outpatient clinic or referred to the emergency department of Vakif Gureba Education and Research Hospital, were enrolled in a prospective study. Patients were randomized into three equal groups for treatment with single-dose fosfomycin trometamol, or 5-day courses of amoxicillin clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil. After follow-up, study data were obtained for 28, 27, and 29 patients, respectively.

The treatment groups did not differ significantly in terms of demographics, clinical success rate, microbiological cure rate, or adverse effects. However, significantly higher drug compliance was observed in the fosfomycin trometamol group than in the other two groups (P < 0.05).

In conclusion, treatment with a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol was as effective for urinary tract infections (UTI) as the standard course of treatment with amoxicillin clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil. Fosfomycin trometamol may be a preferable treatment for UTI because of its simpler use and better rates of compliance.

### Emergence of plasmid-mediated fosfomycin-resistance genes among Escherichia coli isolates, France [^112Jd72N]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Although the prevalence of plasmid-mediated fosA3 genes in human clinical E. coli isolates has remained low in France since 2012, these genes are observed across numerous clones, sequence types, and molecular determinants and are always associated with ESBL CTX-M enzymes, suggesting multiple propagation events. Our results are consistent with FosA3-producing clinical strains previously isolated in Asia, which also co-express CTX-M enzymes. However, the CTX-M variant distribution between the strains in France and Asia differs, with CTX-M-15 having a high prevalence in our collection.

Medical records examination did not show a history of international travel in our patient population, suggesting that such a variety of fosfomycin-resistant E. coli lineages probably were not imported or transmitted. The broad use of oral fosfomycin has provided the opportunity to select for FosA producers. With the spread of CTX-M urinary tract infections in the community, the use of fosfomycin is likely to select for CTX-M–FosA co-producers and could lead to an increase in treatment failures with ESBL-producing organisms.

Conversely, treatment of ESBL producers with fosfomycin should only be undertaken after testing for susceptibility because these ESBL producers can be linked to the same genetic determinant. Moreover, the indiscriminate use of the oral formulation in the community is jeopardizing the usefulness of this antimicrobial agent. While the world is bracing for an epidemic of infectious diseases bearing plasmid-mediated colistin resistance, a vast and ubiquitous res…

### Fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli, Pennsylvania, USA [^1152XUde]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli is rare in the United States. An extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli clinical strain identified in Pennsylvania, USA, showed high-level fosfomycin resistance caused by the fosA3 gene. The IncFII plasmid carrying this gene had a structure similar to those found in China, where fosfomycin resistance is commonly described.

### Fosfomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing, Enterobacteriaceae infections: a systematic review [^113WhEj8]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Rising rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs among Enterobacteriaceae limit the choice of reliably active forms of these drugs. We evaluated the evidence on fosfomycin as a treatment option for infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs, including producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL).

We systematically reviewed studies evaluating the antimicrobial activity or clinical effectiveness of fosfomycin. Seventeen antimicrobial-susceptibility studies were found and included in our review, accounting for 5,057 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs (4,448 were producers of ESBL). Of the 17 studies, 11 reported that at least 90% of the isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Using a provisional minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility breakpoint of 64 mg/L or less, 1,604 (96.8%) of 1,657 Escherichia coli isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin. Similarly, 608 (81.3%) of 748 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin.

In two clinical studies, oral treatment with fosfomycin-trometamol was clinically effective against complicated or uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli, in a cumulative total of 75 (93.8%) of the 80 patients evaluated. Initial clinical data support the use of fosfomycin for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by these pathogens, although further research is needed.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^1165FGVC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Do not use more than one single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine to treat a single episode of acute cystitis. Repeated daily doses of fosfomycin tromethamine did not improve the clinical success or microbiological eradication rates compared to single-dose therapy but did increase the incidence of adverse events. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be informed that fosfomycin tromethamine can be taken with or without food. Their symptoms should improve in two to three days after taking fosfomycin tromethamine; if not improved, the patient should contact her health care provider. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Metoclopramide**: When coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine, metoclopramide, a drug which increases gastrointestinal motility, lowers the serum concentration and urinary excretion of fosfomycin. Other drugs that increase gastrointestinal motility may produce similar effects.
	- **Cimetidine**: Cimetidine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin when coadministered with fosfomycin tromethamine.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112NTTp8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common outpatient infections in the United States (US), with an estimated lifetime incidence of 50%‒60% in female adults. Approximately 80% of UTIs are classified as uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), which is one of the most common indications leading to antibiotic prescriptions in females. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin (NTF), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and fosfomycin as first-line treatments, while antibiotics such as β-lactams and fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative options. Despite guideline recommendations, prescribing practices not aligned with IDSA guidelines are common, with 86.1% of patients prescribed alternative antibiotic agents as first-line therapy. These inappropriate prescribing practices contribute to increased healthcare costs and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which leads to treatment failure, persistent uUTI symptoms, and adverse events.

Approximately 80% of uUTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), and the rising prevalence of AMR is a growing concern. A recent US study of urinary E. coli isolates from female outpatients aged 12 years and older found that 25.4%, 21.1%, and 3.8% were nonsusceptible to SXT, fluoroquinolones, and NTF, respectively. Additionally, 6.4% had extended-spectrum β-lactamase production. In clinical practice, challenges in identifying patients with uUTI at risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics can lead to inappropriate empiric prescribing.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^111maeWS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Sixty-seven of 94 (71.3%) patients reported one or more adverse events (AEs), with 35 of 48 patients (72.9%) assigned to fosfomycin and 32 of 46 (69.6%) assigned to ciprofloxacin (risk difference, 3.3%; 95% confidence interval: –15.0% to 21.6%). Probably-related AEs occurred in 25 of 48 (52.1%) patients assigned to fosfomycin and 20 of 46 (43.5%) assigned to ciprofloxacin (risk difference, 8.3%; 95% confidence interval: –11.6% to 28.1%).

- **Nature, relatedness, duration, and severity of AEs**: The most notable were gastrointestinal AEs, reported by 25 of 48 (52.1%) patients assigned to fosfomycin and 14 of 46 (30.4%) assigned to ciprofloxacin (risk difference, 20.8%; 95% confidence interval: 1.6% to 40.0%).

Seven patients discontinued the study medication prematurely as a consequence of AEs, including 3 of 48 (6.3%) assigned to fosfomycin and 4 of 46 (8.7%) assigned to ciprofloxacin (risk difference, –2.8%; 95% confidence interval: –15.1% to 9.5%).

- **Serious adverse events (SAEs)**: There were 8 SAEs reported, with 6 in patients assigned to fosfomycin and 2 in patients assigned to ciprofloxacin. Of these, 4 were considered probably related to the study medication, 3 after use of fosfomycin and 1 after use of ciprofloxacin.

	- Two patients assigned to fosfomycin redeveloped fever, which resolved following a switch to intravenous cefuroxime and amoxicillin, respectively.
	- Two patients assigned to fosfomycin died during follow-up; the deaths were considered consequences of underlying diseases, not related to (failure of) study medication.

Supplementary Table 3 provides a description of all SAEs.

### Fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli, Pennsylvania, USA [^114Dimvm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid derivative with antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative pathogens and some gram-positive pathogens. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and is bactericidal against most Escherichia coli strains, as well as many strains of other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. In the United States, only an oral formulation containing fosfomycin tromethamine is approved for clinical use.

Because of increasing resistance of E. coli strains to other commonly used agents, such as ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin has become one of the first-line agents recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. A recent study of E. coli strains collected at veterans' hospitals in the United States included ciprofloxacin-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing strains. These strains had 98%–99% susceptibility to fosfomycin. However, susceptibility data on fosfomycin are relatively limited overall because this agent is not routinely tested in most clinical microbiology laboratories.

Several fosfomycin resistance mechanisms have been described in E. coli, including reduced permeability, modification of the murA gene target, and modification of fosfomycin. In E. coli, the plasmid-mediated fosfomycin resistance gene fosA3, which encodes a glutathione S-transferase, was first identified in a fosfomycin-resistant E. coli strain in Japan. This enzyme modifies fosfomycin, thus inactivating the agent and conferring high-level fosfomycin resistance. The fosA3 gene has been reported from various regions.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^1123zsv2]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

We must reject the hypothesis of non-inferiority of initial symptomatic treatment, and we cannot generally recommend the ibuprofen-first approach. However, this treatment option can be discussed with women who have mild to moderate symptoms within a shared decision-making approach or as part of a strategy of delayed prescription. Future research is needed to identify patients for whom symptomatic treatment is sufficient, as it has the potential to considerably reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions for women with mild to moderate symptoms of urinary tract infection, particularly those with negative results on culture.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^112PdYyx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, oral step-down treatment with fosfomycin after initial IV antibiotic treatment in women with E. coli febrile urinary tract infections (fUTIs) was noninferior to ciprofloxacin in achieving clinical cure 6–10 days after the end of treatment. The risk difference for clinical cure was 9.6% in favor of fosfomycin, with a lower 95% confidence interval boundary of –8.8%, within the predefined 10% noninferiority margin. These results indicate that fosfomycin can be used for the step-down treatment of E. coli fUTIs in women, reducing the need for prolonged IV antibiotic regimens and hospitalizations for patients with E. coli resistant to other oral antibiotic options.

The clinical cure rate of 65.2% with ciprofloxacin was considerably lower than in previous studies, for which we provide the following explanations. First, we used a stringent definition for the primary endpoint to reflect the clinical goal of step-down treatment, that is, the reduction of initial urinary tract and systemic symptoms without additional systemic antibiotic therapy for UTIs. Previous studies used more pragmatic endpoints that mimic our secondary endpoint of "no additional antibiotic therapy for presumed UTI" at days 30–35, which was met in 84.1% in the ciprofloxacin arm. Second, the population in our trial was sicker, as evidenced by the high bacteremia rate of 51% compared to 8%–27% in previous trials.

The higher early clinical cure rate in the fosfomycin arm may be a consequence of the long half-life of fosfomycin in urine compared with ciprofloxacin, which could suppress the recurrence of symptoms effectively in the early stages of treatment.

### Risk factors for empiric treatment failure in US female outpatients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection: An observational study [^114Lh2iX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Across oral antibiotics prescribed, the incidence of treatment failure (TF) varied, with fosfomycin associated with the highest risk of TF compared to non-treatment failure (NTF). In a randomized controlled trial, treatment with fosfomycin similarly increased the likelihood of clinical TF by 2.35 times. Fosfomycin is infrequently used for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) in the US due to efficacy concerns and high cost. Accordingly, few patients were prescribed fosfomycin in the present study (< 5%), which may suggest a differential risk profile with respect to TF when other first-line agents are not considered.

Prescriptions of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) and β-lactams were also identified as risk factors for TF relative to NTF. The higher risk of TF associated with β-lactams is not unexpected, given its placement as a second-line agent due to concerns about adverse outcomes. The increased risk of TF associated with SXT may be driven by rising rates of non-susceptibility to SXT. Between 2011 and 2019, the prevalence of non-susceptibility to SXT among uropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the US was consistently ≥ 25%. SXT is not recommended by IDSA guidelines as a first-line therapy when community non-susceptibility rates are ≥ 20%. Thus, SXT therapy in this study may have been discordant with treatment guidelines. These findings suggest that the utility of some first-line therapies in the treatment of uUTI may be limited, and future research investigating the impact of community non-susceptibility rates on the risk of TF is warranted.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^117Lcysn]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Administering a single dose of 500 mg of levofloxacin one hour prior to the UDS examination and a single dose of 3 g fosfomycin as prophylactic antibiotics does not significantly alter the clinical outcomes. Although the odds ratio (OR 0.8 ± 0.4–1.95) suggested a lower likelihood of UTI with fosfomycin administration (n = 12; 9.52%) compared to levofloxacin administration (n = 14; 11.38%), this difference was not statistically significant. The study also indicated that the fosfomycin group (n = 7; 5.56%) experienced more symptomatic post-UDS UTI compared to the levofloxacin group (n = 6; 4.76%). However, when urine cultures were performed, the fosfomycin group had fewer positive bacterial cultures compared to the levofloxacin group, albeit the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.660).

These findings contradict data reported by the Clinical Pathology Department of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, which indicated that fosfomycin has better sensitivity against E. coli isolates compared to levofloxacin. A study conducted by Fajfr et al. also showed that oral fosfomycin provided better outcomes than levofloxacin. Other studies have also suggested that fosfomycin is a non-inferior option to other antibiotics in patients with UTI. The results from this study are consistent with the findings of Wang et al. who observed no difference in clinical outcomes between single-dose fosfomycin and other types of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^115YQtQ4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, the study was terminated before the planned sample size was reached. Yet, non-inferiority of fosfomycin for the primary endpoint was demonstrated, which supports the use of fosfomycin for this indication. Continuation of the trial until the planned sample size would have provided more precision for the secondary endpoints. Second, the study was performed in settings with low levels of antibiotic resistance, and practices in other countries may differ in the broadness of empirical antibiotic treatment, duration on IV treatment, and IV–oral switch. Nevertheless, eligibility was conditional on susceptibility to both fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin, so we consider our findings — non-inferiority of fosfomycin to ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment — valid in such settings for fosfomycin-susceptible isolates.

Third, for feasibility and safety reasons, a treatment duration of 10 days was used for all patients, even though 7 days of ciprofloxacin has been demonstrated to be sufficient for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis and gram-negative bacteremia. Lastly, implementation of fosfomycin use for step-down treatment requires reliable susceptibility testing. The MIC of E. coli to fosfomycin, as measured with automated panel tests, seems to correlate poorly with the clinical and microbiological efficacy of fosfomycin for the empirical treatment of cystitis. Future improvements in routine fosfomycin susceptibility testing could affect the targeted use of fosfomycin, although theoretically, it would lead to a higher efficacy.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^1166iW6x]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Several studies did not support the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis, with findings showing no significant difference in the occurrence of post-UDS UTI between patients who received prophylactic antibiotics and those who did not. On the other hand, 500 mg levofloxacin administered over three days decreased the occurrence rate compared to placebo from 28.6 to 12.7% according to the study by Rahardjo et al. This evidence highlights the clinical benefit of administering antibiotics prior to UDS in reducing the risk of UTI in our center. Therefore, in the present study, a placebo arm was not included, as it would have been ethically inappropriate to withhold prophylactic antibiotics given prior findings of significant benefit over placebo. Instead, this randomized controlled trial was designed to compare two active regimens — fosfomycin and levofloxacin — to determine which agent is more effective and potentially safer as a single-dose prophylactic option.

Other studies observed no discernible difference between taking 500 mg of levofloxacin once a day for three days versus giving it as a single dosage. However, a single dose is recommended due to being more cost-effective, simpler, and reducing the potential for antibiotic resistance. The administration of prophylactic antibiotic for UDS is recommended, as it is proven to reduce bacteriuria and decrease the risk of UTI. At the time of writing, E. coli remains the most common cause of UTI, while data from the Clinical Pathology Department of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital indicate that fosfomycin has better sensitivity.

### Safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical efficacy of a vaccine against extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli in women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1b trial [^116tyVn1]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Escherichia coli infections are increasing worldwide in both community and hospital settings. The E. coli O-antigen presents a promising target for vaccine development. This study aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a bioconjugate vaccine containing the O-antigens of four E. coli serotypes (ExPEC4V).

In this multicentre phase 1b, first-in-human, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy adult women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single injection of either the intramuscular ExPEC4V vaccine or a placebo. The primary outcome was the incidence of adverse events among vaccine and placebo recipients throughout the study. Secondary outcomes included immunogenicity, antibody functionality, and the incidence of UTIs caused by E. coli vaccine serotypes in each group.

Between January 20, 2014, and August 27, 2014, 93 women received the target-dose ExPEC4V and 95 received the placebo. The vaccine was well tolerated, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events occurring. Overall, 56 (60%) of the target-dose vaccine recipients and 47 (49%) of the placebo recipients experienced at least one adverse event possibly, probably, or certainly related to the injection. Vaccination induced significant IgG responses for all serotypes: at day 30 compared with baseline, O1A titres were 4.6 times higher, O2 titres were 9.4 times higher, O6A titres were 4.9 times higher, and O25B titres were 5.9 times higher, with an overall p-value of < 0.0001. Immune responses persisted at 270 days but were lower than those at 30 days.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^114rtB5J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In controlled, double-blind studies conducted in the United States, a single dose of Fosfomycin Tromethamine was compared to three other oral antibiotics for the treatment of acute cystitis. The study included patients exhibiting symptoms and signs of acute cystitis for less than four days. Participants showed no manifestations of upper tract infections, such as flank pain, chills, or fever. They had no history of recurrent urinary tract infections, although 20% of patients had experienced an acute cystitis episode within the previous year. Furthermore, participants did not have any known structural abnormalities, clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic dysfunction, or known or suspected CNS disorders, such as epilepsy, that could predispose them to seizures.

The studies reported the following outcomes:

- **Clinical success**: This refers to the resolution of symptoms in participants.
- **Microbiologic eradication rates**: These rates were obtained as part of the study findings.

### Other antimicrobials of interest in the era of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: Fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin and tigecycline [^112KHYgF]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

The progressive increase of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing enteric bacteria in recent years has called for a re-evaluation of antibiotic therapy for these infections. The activity and potential use of two old antimicrobials, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin, and the new compound tigecycline for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with special emphasis on E. coli, are reviewed. Fosfomycin continues to be active against the most common uropathogens; in a recent survey from Spain, among the 428 ESBL-producing isolates, the resistance rate of E. coli to fosfomycin was 0.3%, whereas the resistance rate of K. pneumoniae was 7.2%. Other recent surveys from other parts of the world confirm the activity of fosfomycin against ESBL-producing E. coli.

The rate of resistance to nitrofurantoin in recent surveys in the United States and Canada was 1.1% among 1,142 isolates of E. coli from outpatient urinary isolates. However, among 115 clinical isolates of E. coli ESBL producers, only 71.3% were sensitive to nitrofurantoin. Additionally, E. coli resistance to nitrofurantoin has been reported to be high in a recent survey in Latin American hospitals and in Italy.

Tigecycline is a glycylcycline that circumvents efflux and ribosomal protection, the two most frequent genetic mechanisms of tetracycline resistance. The recent activity of tigecycline against 285 non-clonally related isolates expressing well-characterized ESBLs from hospital settings and the community reveals susceptibility rates for tigecycline of 97.5%.

### Using fosfomycin to prevent infection following ureterorenoscopy in response to shortage of cephalosporins: A retrospective preliminary study [^116E4md1]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The findings of this study revealed that during the shortage of cefazolin and cefotiam, fosfomycin was effective against post-URS infections. Previous reports indicate that the incidence of post-URS infections ranges from 4–11.5%, with E. coli frequently detected in patients experiencing postoperative bacteriuria following urologic operations. The occurrence of infections caused by other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, is also a concern during these procedures.

In patients undergoing URS, a positive preoperative urine culture is a risk factor for postoperative sepsis. Therefore, administering prophylactic antimicrobial agents that are effective against bacteria detected in preoperative urine cultures is essential. According to the guidelines of the Japanese Urological Association, it is recommended to provide prophylaxis before URS by administering a single dose of first- or second-generation cephalosporins, β-lactamase inhibitor-containing penicillin, and aminoglycosides. In our hospital, a single dose of prophylactic antimicrobials is currently administered during URS. However, in this slightly dated study, prophylactic doses were also administered within 24 hours postoperatively.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^112LE9a2]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Our study confirmed the leading role of E. coli in urinary tract infection, as nearly 51.0% of urinary samples contained this pathogen. The other most frequent isolates are also Gram-negative rods, especially Klebsiella, Proteus, or Enterobacter, which together comprised 40.0% of all tested isolates. The results were in congruence with studies from other countries. E. coli isolates were highly susceptible to fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin (97.0% and 96.6%, respectively) and less susceptible to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75.8% and 67.8%), which is in line with other studies from Europe and Asia.

A similar pattern was found in K. pneumoniae, where 80.4% of isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin, although other tested antibiotics showed susceptibility in the range of 43.5% to 64.4%. In β-lactamase producing bacterial isolates (ESBL or AmpC), fosfomycin showed the lowest proportion of resistant isolates. However, it is necessary to comment that the comparison of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics is sometimes difficult due to the absence of EUCAST breakpoints for many of them. A good example is nitrofurantoin, which according to EUCAST guidelines, has a susceptibility range only for E. coli, but according to CLSI guidelines, has assessed breakpoints for all Enterobacteriaceae. The problematic assessment of susceptibility testing according to different guidelines is well-known. The good activity of fosfomycin against extended-spectrum β-lactamase positive Gram-negative bacteria in comparison with other first-line antibiotics has also been observed in other studies.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^115mGG3n]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

The trial profile for the FORECAST randomized, controlled trial has been outlined, where FORECAST stands for FOsfomycin Randomised controlled trial for E. coli Complicated urinary tract infections as Alternative Stepdown Treatment, and fUTI refers to febrile urinary tract infection.

At admission, the mean age of enrolled women was 59.4 years (standard deviation [SD], 20.2). The mean Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 7.3 (SD, 4.6), with 9 patients (9.3%) having a nonresuscitative policy and 50 (51.6%) presenting with E. coli bacteremia. It was observed that more patients assigned to fosfomycin had a history of diabetes mellitus, whereas more patients in the ciprofloxacin group had a history of nephrolithiasis.

For patients who declined participation (n = 80), the mean age was 60.3 years (SD, 22.2) and the mean CCI was 5.9 (SD, 5.5). Among them, 2 (of 58 with nonmissing data, 3.4%) had a nonresuscitative policy, and 30 (37.5%) had E. coli bacteremia. Empirical antimicrobial treatment was administered for a mean duration of 3.3 days (SD, 1.1), which included treatment with a second-generation cephalosporin (n = 35), a third-generation cephalosporin (n = 33), a second-generation cephalosporin with an aminoglycoside (n = 15), a carbapenem (n = 2), or another regimen (n = 12). This left a mean of 6.7 days (SD, 1.1) of oral study medication.

### Antimicrobials: A global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^112MjjLB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Renewed interest in 'old' antibiotics has also focused attention on fosfomycin. While traditionally administered parenterally as fosfomycin disodium, several countries have recently approved the oral administration of fosfomycin tromethamine for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Escherichia coli and E. faecalis. Its use as a single agent is usually restricted in critically ill patients; however, intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC).

The daily dose of intravenous fosfomycin disodium ranges from 12 to 16 grams on average, administered in two to four infusions. Renal impairment significantly decreases the excretion of fosfomycin. For intravenous administration, the doses should be reduced if the creatinine clearance is less than 50 ml/min.

The primary limitations of fosfomycin are the lack of established regimens for complicated infections and the unavailability of the intravenous formulation in many countries.

New antibiotics such as ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam have recently been approved by some national agencies for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. By adding beta-lactamase inhibitors (tazobactam or avibactam), these new agents exhibit strong activity against MDR Gram-negative pathogens. Unlike other beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, these new agents should be combined with metronidazole for complicated intra-abdominal infections due to limited activity against some Bacteroides species.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analyzed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli, Pennsylvania, USA [^116DtS8f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

A total of six E. coli isolates were collected from the patient during 2007–2010, including the isolates reported here and previously. All isolates were obtained from urine samples, except for YD472, which was cultured from the peritoneal catheter exit site. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with Xba I as the restriction enzyme showed that all isolates had identical banding patterns. Furthermore, five of the six isolates, including the first isolate from 2007, were resistant to fosfomycin and positive for fosA3, rmtB, and bla CTX-M-9-group by PCR. E. coli TOP10 transformants harboring fosA3-carrying plasmids were generated from each of these five isolates.

The plasmids were then extracted and digested with the restriction enzyme Eco RI. The resulting restriction profile was nearly identical across the plasmids except for pYHCC from YD472, which had a shift of a band from ≈8 kb to ≈11 kb, suggesting pXZ as the origin of pYHCC.

### Fosfomycin vs. quinolone-based antibiotic prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115r2Dx3]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Infection-related complications due to quinolone resistance have been on the rise following transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate (TRUSBP). This review aims to compare the efficacy of fosfomycin with quinolone-based antibiotic prophylaxis for TRUSBP.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted in line with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines. All studies comparing fosfomycin with non-fosfomycin antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUSBP were considered. The main outcomes were the number of urinary tract infections (UTIs) (overall, afebrile, febrile, and urosepsis) and fluoroquinolone resistance. Secondary outcomes included positive urine and blood cultures, and adverse effects of the drugs.

- **Results**: Five studies comparing fosfomycin and non-fosfomycin antimicrobials were included in the review. In total, 1,447 and 1,665 patients were included in the fosfomycin and non-fosfomycin cohorts, respectively. The systematic review reported significantly lower UTIs in the fosfomycin cohort with a risk ratio (M-H, Fixed, 95% CI) of 0.20 (0.13, 0.30), p < 0.00001. Urine cultures from patients given fosfomycin showed significantly lower resistance rates (M-H, Fixed, 95% CI) of 0.27 (0.15, 0.50), p < 0.0001. The adverse effect profile between the two cohorts was similar (M-H, Fixed, 95% CI) 1.13 (0.51, 2.50), p = 0.33. On GRADE Pro evaluation, the overall UTI, afebrile UTI, febrile UTI, and urosepsis were rated as moderate, low, very low, and moderate quality evidence, respectively. Positive blood and urine cultures were rated as moderate quality evidence.

### Identification of Escherichia coli genes associated with urinary tract infections [^115H9xjV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs). E. coli genes epidemiologically associated with UTIs are potentially valuable in developing strategies for treating and/or preventing such infections, as well as differentiating uropathogenic E. coli from nonuropathogenic E. coli. To identify E. coli genes associated with UTIs in humans, we combined microarray-based and PCR-based analyses to investigate different E. coli source groups derived from the feces of healthy humans and patients with cystitis, pyelonephritis, or urosepsis.

The cjrABC-senB gene cluster, sivH, sisA, sisB, eco274, and fbpB were identified to be associated with UTIs. Of these genes, cjrABC-senB, sisA, sisB, and fbpB are known to be involved in urovirulence in the mouse model of ascending UTI. Our results provide evidence to support their roles as urovirulence factors in human UTIs. In addition, the newly identified UTI-associated genes were mainly found in members of phylogenetic groups B2 and/or D.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^115yDk7c]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The evaluation of overall antibiotic susceptibility in relation to patient status revealed significantly lower resistance in bacterial isolates from ambulatory patients compared to those of hospitalized patients. With the exception of ICU isolates, using resistance of 10% as the limit for use as a first-line option for empirical therapy in non-life-threatening infections, only fosfomycin seems to have adequate coverage among agents suitable for oral therapy. In our study, there were no samples from the community (from GPs), which is why our samples exhibited higher resistance.

Fosfomycin trometamol was shown as a promising antibiotic for urinary tract infections in our country. However, some published studies have noted that the increasing use of fosfomycin worldwide has led to elevated levels of resistance in isolates. For example, a Spanish study detected an increase in fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli isolates from 0.0% in 2005 to 14.4% in 2011. A change in the guidelines for UTI therapy is required to prevent this side effect of widespread use of fosfomycin trometamol for UTIs. We see the main future benefit of an oral fosfomycin formulation in our fosfomycin-naive population in the treatment of specific groups of patients with non-life-threatening urinary tract infections, such as patients with long-term stents often colonized by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. These patients are frequently threatened by chronic urinary tract infections, and after successful intravenous antibiotic therapy during hospitalization, they should…

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of Gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^111EyzfF]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

We have confirmed in the Czech Republic the very high susceptibility to fosfomycin trometamol of urinary tract infection pathogens, particularly Gram-negative rods, including those producing β-lactamase. Our results will be used to rationalize the treatment of urinary tract infections with fosfomycin trometamol in our country.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^114Mzqr9]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

The purpose of a urodynamic study (UDS) examination is to detect anomalies in the lower urinary tract, requiring the insertion of a urinary catheter for this invasive treatment. Regardless of aseptic procedures before the examination, the risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI) remains. Escherichia coli is the most common etiologic pathogen causing post-UDS UTI. To mitigate this risk, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended to reduce the incidence of UTI following UDS.

- **Guidelines for prophylactic antibiotics**: The American Urology Association (AUA) advises administering a single-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) before urodynamic testing, with first- or second-generation cephalosporin as an alternative prophylaxis. Similarly, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines suggest that the choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors. Common options include fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins, with adjustments based on local bacterial resistance data.

- **Clinical practice in Indonesia**: In previous studies conducted in several hospitals in Indonesia, a single dose of 500 mg levofloxacin has been the preferred choice before performing UDS. A study by the Clinical Pathology Department of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital showed that fosfomycin has better sensitivity compared to levofloxacin against E. coli isolates. This finding is particularly relevant as levofloxacin has been the primary antibiotic used as prophylaxis prior to urodynamic studies in Indonesia, as supported by previous clinical trials.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^114jxgu6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Baseline variables at admission and randomization were collected using participant questionnaires and from the electronic patient file (Supplemental Material, Protocol S1). Patients were assigned (1:1) to an IV–oral switch to fosfomycin-trometamol every 24 hours as a powder for solution, equivalent to 3g fosfomycin, or ciprofloxacin 0.5g every 12 hours as capsules. Patients received an identical placebo for both active substances to ensure blinding (double-dummy). The duration of antimicrobial treatment was set at 10 days, which consisted of 2–5 days of empirical IV treatment and the remaining 5–8 days of oral study treatment.

Patients were asked to register the intake of study medication and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in a paper diary. A physical appointment was planned 6–10 days after the study treatment was finished to assess early endpoints and to collect urine; a telephone appointment at 30–35 days was set to assess late endpoints. At inclusion and during both follow-up meetings, structured questionnaires were obtained regarding urinary tract and systemic symptoms, antimicrobial use, health status, and healthcare consumption.

The primary endpoint was clinical cure at days 6–10 post-end of treatment (PET). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with a reduction of all initial local and systemic fusiform urinary tract infection (fUTI)-related symptoms, without the requirement of additional antibiotic therapy for UTI (except for antibiotic prophylaxis). In case of an indwelling catheter, local symptoms were not counted.

According to this definition, patients who did not meet the criteria were recorded accordingly.

### Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fosfomycin in non-critically ill patients with bacteremic urinary infection caused by multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli [^114qfThA]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

To describe the population pharmacokinetics of fosfomycin for patients with bacteremic urinary tract infection (BUTI), this study identified optimal regimens based on pharmacodynamic targets and assessed the adequacy of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) susceptibility breakpoints for Escherichia coli.

Data from 16 patients with BUTI caused by multidrug-resistant E. coli (FOREST clinical trial) who received intravenous fosfomycin (4 g every 6 hours) were analyzed. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed, and Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken using 4 g every 6 hours and 8 g every 8 hours. The probability of pharmacodynamic target attainment was assessed using pharmacodynamic targets for E. coli for static effect, 1-log drop in bacterial burden, and resistance suppression.

Sixty-four plasma samples were collected over a single dosing interval (day 2 or 3 after starting fosfomycin treatment). Fosfomycin concentrations were highly variable. Pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis showed mild improvement by increasing fosfomycin dosing (4 g every 6 hours vs. every 8 hours). These dosages achieved success in decreasing 1-log bacterial burden in 89% to 96% (EUCAST breakpoints) and 33% to 54% (CLSI breakpoints) of patients, but they were unable to meet bacterial resistance suppression targets.

Fosfomycin concentrations are highly variable, a fact partially explained by renal impairment. The present work supports the use of 4 g every 6 hours, though additional strategies may be required for resistance suppression targets.

### Rapid detection of fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli [^113eSHCy]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

The rapid fosfomycin/Escherichia coli NP test was developed to detect fosfomycin resistance in E. coli isolates. The test is based on glucose metabolization and the detection of bacterial growth in the presence of fosfomycin at 40 µg/ml. Bacterial growth is visually detectable by an orange-to-yellow color change of red phenol, a pH indicator. A total of 100 E. coli isolates, among which 22 were fosfomycin resistant, were used to evaluate the test performance. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 100% and 98.7%, respectively. This new test is user-friendly, sensitive, and specific, and its results are obtained in 1 hour and 30 minutes.

### Perioperative fosfomycin disodium prophylaxis against urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients: a randomized clinical trial [^115DNAUE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Each FOS group member received one 4 g dose of FOS disodium intravenously (IV) 3 hours before the following procedures: placement of the UC immediately before the RT surgery, removal of the UC, and removal of the DJS. The placebo group received saline solution 0.9% IV with the same schedule.

All RTRs received cephalothin (1 g, IV single dose) for prophylaxis before RT surgery; the UC was placed using a sterile technique, and the patients received a DJS. The type of ureteral reimplantation (extra or intravesical) was decided by the surgical team.

All participants received TMP/SMX prophylaxis at 160/800 mg (PO) daily when the estimated glomerular filtration rate, calculated according to the formula proposed by the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Epidemiology Collaboration, was ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m². It was defined as the date of DJS removal since Day 14 and UC removal since Day 2.

RTRs with high immunological risk (presence of preformed donor-specific antibodies, deceased donor, or retransplant) received induction with antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin®, Sanofi-Genzyme, Lyon, France) at a dose of 4.5 mg/kg divided into three daily doses given on consecutive days. Low-risk RTRs received induction with 20 mg basiliximab (Simulect®, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) on Days 0 and 4 after RT. Immunosuppression maintenance consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and prednisone. All RTRs were assessed at Weeks 1, 4, 6, and 7 after RT through questioning, physical examination, evaluation of FOS- or TMP/SMX-related adverse events, and a TMP/SMX tablet count.

### Effectiveness and tolerability of intravenous fosfomycin in treating complicated urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli: a prospective cohort study from the FOSFOMIC project [^116NbyAh]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

The FOSFOMIC study assessed the clinical and microbiological effectiveness and safety of intravenous fosfomycin in treating complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) caused by Escherichia coli, in comparison with other intravenous antimicrobials.

- **Methods**: A prospective, multinational matched cohorts study involving adults with community-acquired cUTIs and receiving targeted therapy with intravenous fosfomycin or other first-line drugs (beta-lactams or fluoroquinolones) was conducted from November 2019 to May 2023 in ten centers from Spain, Italy, and Türkiye. Matching criteria included type of infection acquisition, Charlson and Pitt scores. Endpoints were clinical and microbiological cure, mortality, recurrence, and adverse effects. Analyses used conditional logistic regression and desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR).

- **Results**: Overall, 155 matched pairs were included. Clinical and microbiological cure rates were 65.2% (101/155; 95% CI, 57.4–72.2) and 63.2% (98/155; 95% CI, 55.4–70.4) with fosfomycin and comparators, respectively (adjusted OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.68–1.73; p 0.73). Mortality rates were 1.9% (3/155; 95% CI, 0.7–5.5) and 5.8% (9/155; 95% CI, 3.1–10.7), respectively (p 0.11). Recurrence rates were 14.2% (22/155; 95% CI, 9.6–20.6) in the fosfomycin group vs. 10.3% (16/155; 95% CI, 6.1–16.1) (p 0.39). Severe adverse effects occurred in 1.9% (3/155; 95% CI, 0.7–5.5) of patients treated with fosfomycin vs. 0.6% (1/155; 95% CI, 0.0–3.3) in the control group (p 0.62). Non-severe adverse effects were more frequent with fosfomycin, affecting 23.3%.

### The susceptibility to fosfomycin of gram-negative bacteria isolates from urinary tract infection in the Czech Republic: data from a unicentric study [^111HMGzT]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin (phosphomycin) as a new antimicrobial substance was first introduced in 1969. It is characterized as an anti-cell wall bactericidal antibiotic with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It was used for many years as a highly effective antimicrobial drug, especially for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, with the advent of new antibiotics such as β-lactams or fluoroquinolones, it became somewhat obsolete.

In the past decade, there have been reports of a rapid increase in resistant pathogens, including extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers or multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens (defined as non-susceptible to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories). Due to the lack of an effective antimicrobial drug for these cases, some older antibiotics were tested to evaluate their efficacy against multi-resistant bacteria. One such antibiotic was fosfomycin, which, according to results of previously published studies, has shown very good in vitro activity against resistant bacteria such as ESBL-producers, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All this evidence has generated higher interest in the use of fosfomycin over the last five years.

Fosfomycin has not been available in the Czech Republic for a long time, but since October 2014, it has been available as the per-oral formulation, fosfomycin trometamol.

### Urinary tract infection caused by capnophilic Escherichia coli [^114X1myL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The antimicrobial drug susceptibility profile was determined by incubating Mueller-Hinton agar plates at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 6% CO₂ using the disk diffusion method, according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommendations. The isolate was susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were obtained for the following antimicrobial agents using the E-test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), performed on Mueller-Hinton agar plates incubated in a 6% CO₂ atmosphere: ampicillin (1.5 μg/mL), amoxicillin (3 μg/mL), cefotaxime (0.064 μg/mL), imipenem (0.094 μg/mL), piperacillin (2 μg/mL), and ciprofloxacin (0.008 μg/mL).

Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen among patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Two cases of UTIs due to carbon dioxide–dependent strains of E. coli have been reported. The mechanisms for the development of CO₂ dependence are unknown. CO₂ can play a role in the growth of E. coli as a substrate for carboxylation reactions. Other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (such as some strains of Klebsiella spp.) and other organisms (such as Staphylococcus aureus) can have similar requirements.

There is not one best way of performing urine cultures. Guidelines for the diagnosis of UTIs include the use of sheep blood agar and either MacConkey agar or a similar selective medium for routine urine culture. The plates should be incubated overnight for at least 16 hours.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, which may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. The use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments. Prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTIs may be inappropriate, contributing to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Treatment guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA), Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomatology, specifically urinary symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, or new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms, associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria caused by a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community, and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, highlighting the need for appropriate clinical symptoms to diagnose a UTI.

However, prior studies have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to clinical guidelines.

### Role of inoculum and mutant frequency on fosfomycin MIC discrepancies by agar dilution and broth microdilution methods in Enterobacteriaceae [^113npkZ3]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is re-evaluated as a treatment for multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections. However, MIC differences have been described among different susceptibility testing methods. The aim was to study the role of different inoculum sizes used in agar dilution with respect to broth microdilution, according to CLSI, in the fosfomycin MIC discrepancies.

- **Methods**: Fosfomycin MICs were determined using agar dilution (reference) and broth microdilution in 220 Escherichia coli (n = 81) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 139) clinical isolates. Fosfomycin mutant frequencies were determined in 21 E. coli (MIC = 1mg/L) and 21 K. pneumoniae (MIC = 16mg/L). The emergence of resistant subpopulations of five E. coli strains (MIC = 1mg/L) was monitored over time by microdilution assay using 0, 4, and 8 mg/L of fosfomycin, and eight different inocula (5×10⁵–3.91×10³ CFU/well, 1:2 dilutions).

- **Results**: For E. coli, 86.4% of categorical agreement (CA), 9.1% very major errors (VME), 3.3% major errors (ME), and 9.9% minor errors (mE) were found. For K. pneumoniae, CA was 51.1%, VME 15.7%, ME 28.4%, and mE 25.2%. Essential agreement (± 1-log2) was observed in 55.45%. By microdilution, 35.9% of the MICs showed discrepancies of ≥ 2 dilutions. The initial inoculum used was 5.63 times higher in the microdilution method, in line with CLSI methodology for both techniques. Fosfomycin mutant frequencies were 6.05×10⁻⁵ (4×MIC) to 5.59×10⁻⁷ (256×MIC) for E. coli, and 1.49×10⁻⁴ (4×MIC) to 1.58×10⁻⁵ (16×MIC) for K. pneumoniae. Resistant subpopulations arose mainly after 8 hours of incubation.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^112z2qrN]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

In a cohort of 126 patients who underwent urodynamic studies (UDS), urinary tract infections (UTIs) were diagnosed in 26 cases (20.9%): 14 (22.2%) from the levofloxacin group and 12 (19%) from the fosfomycin group. This indicates no significant difference in incidence rates between the two groups (p = 0.660). The absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the levofloxacin and fosfomycin groups was 3.2% (22.2% − 19%). The relative effect size, expressed as an odds ratio (OR), was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.4–1.95).

Of those with UTI, 17 were male: 10 from the levofloxacin group and 7 from the fosfomycin group. Symptomatic UTIs were observed in six (4.8%) patients in the levofloxacin group and in seven (5.6%) patients in the fosfomycin group, with a relative risk for symptomatic UTI of 1.17 (95% CI: 0.4–3.5) and an ARR of 0.8% (5.6% − 4.8%).

- **Harms and unintended effects**: Minimal in both groups. Three participants (4.76%) in the fosfomycin group reported mild nausea, which resolved without intervention. In the levofloxacin group, two participants (3.17%) reported mild nausea. No serious adverse events were observed during the study period.

- **Bacterial findings**: E. coli was the most frequently identified bacterium in urine cultures, followed by K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Additionally, 10 patients with UTI showed no bacterial growth in their urine culture/isolation.

No subgroup or adjusted analyses were performed as this was not pre-specified in the protocol. The comparison of UTI cases between the groups is described in Table 2.

### Increasing prevalence of pediatric community-acquired UTI by extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli: Cause for concern [^116AgWVZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). High credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance and emerging spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL) infections are a rising concern in public health. Despite the increasing prevalence of community-acquired (CA) ESBL-E. coli UTIs, there is little data on the antibiotic resistance profiles of this bacterial strain in the pediatric population. We review the antibiotic resistance profile and rising trend in pediatric ESBL-E. coli UTI presentation at our pediatric hospital.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study reviewed data drawn from the infectious disease database at our pediatric hospital for all patients whose urine culture grew ESBL-E. coli from 01/2015 to 01/2021. Demographic information and antimicrobial susceptibility test results for ESBL-E. coli isolates from CA-UTIs were collected. Annual changes in resistance to antimicrobial agents and average annual percent change in ESBL-E. coli UTI presentation over the study period are reported.

- **Results**: From 01/2015 to 01/2021, 6403 urine cultures at our hospital grew E. coli. Of these, 169 urine cultures from 135 children grew ESBL-E. coli. The study population was 57% male (77) with a mean age of 6.9 ± 6.2 years and was multiethnic. CA-UTI by ESBL-producing E. coli accounted for 2.62% of total E. coli UTIs within the study period and increased from 0.97% in 2015 to 3.54% in 2020 by an average of 0.51% each year.

- **Conclusions**: These findings demonstrate an increase in CA-ESBL E. coli UTIs in children. We observed most isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance. As CA-ESBL E. coli UTIs are associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased morbidity.

### Fosfomycin: an old — new antibiotic [^112WqdmY]. Clinical microbiology and infection (2012). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic discovered in Spain in 1969. It exhibits bactericidal activity against a wide range of bacteria, including gram-negative microorganisms and some gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococci. Initially, fosfomycin was administered parenterally and only to patients with severe infections. Today, it is often dispensed as fosfomycin-trometamol, an oral formulation recommended for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Fosfomycin-trometamol in a single dose is indicated for the treatment of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

### Fosfomycin vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^113uoNCD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

- **Background**: We aimed to determine the noninferiority of fosfomycin compared to ciprofloxacin as an oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections (fUTIs) in women.

- **Methods**: This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 15 Dutch hospitals. Adult women who were receiving 2–5 days of empirical intravenous antimicrobials for E. coli fUTI were assigned to step-down treatment with once-daily 3g fosfomycin or twice-daily 0.5g ciprofloxacin for 10 days of total antibiotic treatment. For the primary endpoint, clinical cure at days 6–10 post-end of treatment (PET), a noninferiority margin of 10% was chosen. The trial was registered on Trialregister.nl (NTR6449).

- **Results**: After enrollment of 97 patients between 2017 and 2020, the trial ended prematurely because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The primary endpoint was met in 36 of 48 patients (75.0%) assigned to fosfomycin and 30 of 46 patients (65.2%) assigned to ciprofloxacin (risk difference [RD], 9.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: –8.8% to 28.0%). In patients assigned to fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin, microbiological cure at days 6–10 PET occurred in 29 of 37 (78.4%) and 33 of 35 (94.3%; RD, –16.2%; 95% CI: –32.7 to –0.0%). Any gastrointestinal adverse event was reported in 25 of 48 (52.1%) and 14 of 46 (30.4%) patients (RD, 20.8%; 95% CI: 1.6% to 40.0%), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Fosfomycin is noninferior to ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for fUTI caused by E. coli in women. Fosfomycin use is associated with more gastrointestinal events.
