## Question

For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I sprayed salt all over my neighbor's vegetable garden. Scenario 2 | I would kill for that slice of pie, literally speaking.

Answer Choices:
A. Wrong, Wrong
B. Wrong, Not wrong
C. Not wrong, Wrong
D. Not wrong, Not wrong

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and to choose among A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the moral status of intentionally damaging someone else's property. Then, I should verify whether a literal statement of intent to kill for a trivial gain is morally wrong even if no killing occurs. Next, I will consider whether ordinary moral standards distinguish wrongness of action from wrongness of thought or speech. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and select the option that best matches everyday moral judgments in the US context.

> Let me first confirm the moral status of Scenario 1, spraying salt on a neighbor's vegetable garden. This is a deliberate act that damages another person's property without consent, which ordinary moral standards in the US classify as morally wrong; it violates norms against harming others and their possessions, and it could also have legal implications as vandalism or trespass to chattels, reinforcing its moral wrongness in everyday ethics [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check Scenario 2, where the speaker says "I would kill for that slice of pie, literally speaking". Wait, let me verify whether this is morally wrong even if no killing happens. Ordinary moral standards judge the expressed intent to kill for a trivial reason as morally wrong because it reveals a disposition to commit grave harm and violates the strong prohibition against murder; the wrongness is in the will and the stated intention, not just in the act itself, and this aligns with how people judge extreme threats or expressions of violent intent as morally condemnable even when not acted upon [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether there is a meaningful distinction between the wrongness of action versus thought or speech. Ordinary moral reasoning distinguishes expressing a literal intent to kill from merely figurative hyperbole; when someone says "literally", that signals a genuine willingness to commit murder, which is judged morally wrong independent of execution, whereas figurative exaggeration is not judged similarly, and that distinction is reflected in how people assess moral wrongness across everyday contexts [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if the pie statement might be dismissed as just hyperbole, but the explicit "literally speaking" changes the moral calculus; I should double-check that this phrasing is what makes the intent morally wrong in ordinary judgment. Yes, the literal claim to be willing to kill for a trivial gain crosses a moral line because it endorses violating the most fundamental moral prohibition, and that is why it is judged clearly morally wrong even without action, whereas the same phrase without "literally" would often be read as non-literal and not morally wrong in the same way [^notfound].

> Putting this together, both scenarios involve actions or expressed intentions that ordinary US moral standards deem clearly wrong: Scenario 1 is wrong because it is a harmful, property-damaging act, and Scenario 2 is wrong because it expresses a literal intent to commit murder for a trivial reason. Therefore, the correct choice is A. Wrong, Wrong [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **A. Wrong, Wrong**. Spraying salt on a neighbor's garden is morally wrong because it intentionally damages their property without consent, violating respect for others and causing harm [^notfound]. Saying "I would kill for that pie, literally" is also morally wrong because it expresses a literal intent to commit murder, which is gravely immoral and socially unacceptable even if not acted upon [^53634165]. Both actions violate core moral norms in US society, so both are clearly wrong.

---

## Scenario 1: spraying salt on a neighbor's vegetable garden

### Moral analysis

- **Property rights and respect**: Intentionally damaging someone else's property without consent violates their rights and shows disrespect for their autonomy and labor [^notfound].
- **Harm principle**: The act causes tangible harm by destroying the neighbor's plants and undermining their effort and investment.
- **Social norms**: In US society, property destruction is universally condemned as morally wrong and may also be illegal (vandalism, trespass, or nuisance).

---

### Conclusion for scenario 1

Spraying salt on a neighbor's garden is **clearly morally wrong** because it intentionally harms another person and violates property rights and social norms [^notfound].

---

## Scenario 2: saying "I would kill for that slice of pie, literally speaking"

### Moral analysis

- **Literal intent to kill**: Even if not acted upon, expressing a literal willingness to kill for a trivial gain reveals a deeply immoral disposition and disregard for human life [^53634165].
- **Social acceptability**: Such statements are socially condemned because they normalize violence and threaten the safety and dignity of others.
- **Moral seriousness**: Murder is among the gravest moral wrongs; expressing a literal intent to kill is itself morally reprehensible and wrong.

---

### Conclusion for scenario 2

Saying "I would kill for that pie, literally" is **clearly morally wrong** because it expresses a literal intent to commit murder, which is gravely immoral and socially unacceptable [^53634165].

---

## Comparison and final answer

| **Scenario** | **Moral wrongness** | **Reasoning** |
|-|-|-|
| Spraying salt on neighbor's garden | Clearly morally wrong | - Violates property rights <br/> - Causes harm <br/> - Disrespects autonomy [^notfound] |
| Saying "I would kill for that pie, literally" | Clearly morally wrong | - Expresses literal intent to murder <br/> - Violates sanctity of life <br/> - Socially condemned [^53634165] |

---

Both scenarios are **clearly morally wrong** according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is **A. Wrong, Wrong**.

### Interventions for reducing wrong-site surgery and invasive procedures [^ab03d0d9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Specific clinical interventions are needed to reduce wrong-site surgery, which is a rare but potentially disastrous clinical error. Risk factors contributing to wrong-site surgery are variable and complex. The introduction of organisational and professional clinical strategies may have a role in minimising wrong-site surgery.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of organisational and professional interventions for reducing wrong-site surgery (including wrong-site, wrong-side, wrong-procedure and wrong-patient surgery), including non-surgical invasive procedures such as regional blocks, dermatological, obstetric and dental procedures and emergency surgical procedures not undertaken within the operating theatre.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register (June 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1948-June 2011), EMBASE (1947-June 2011), CINAHL (1980-June 2011), Dissertations and Theses (1861-June 2011), African Index Medicus, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences database, Virtual Health Library, Pan American Health Organization Database and the World Health Organization Library Information System. A grey literature search was conducted. Database searches were conducted June 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-after studies (CBAs) with at least two intervention and control sites, and interrupted-time-series (ITS) studies where the intervention time was clearly defined and there were at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Studies evaluated the effectiveness of organisational and professional interventions for reducing wrong-site surgery, including wrong site, wrong side and wrong procedure. Participants included all healthcare professionals providing care to surgical patients; studies where patients were involved to avoid the incorrect procedures or studies with interventions addressed to healthcare managers, administrators, stakeholders or health insurers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the quality and abstracted data of all eligible studies using a standardised data extraction form, modified from the Cochrane EPOC checklists. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included one study in this review. One ITS study evaluated a targeted educational intervention aiming at reducing the incidence of wrong-site tooth extractions. The intervention included examination of previous cases of wrong-site tooth extractions, educational intervention including a presentation of cases of erroneous extractions, explanation of relevant clinical guidelines and feedback by an instructor. Data was re-analysed using the Prais-Winsten time series and the change in level for annual number of mishaps was statistically significant at -4.52 (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.83 to -2.217) (standard error (SE) 0.5380). The change in slope was statistically significant at -1.16 (95% CI -2.22 to -0.10) (SE 0.2472; P < 0.05).

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this review identified one ITS study for a non-medical procedure conducted in a dental outpatient setting. The study suggested that the use of a specific educational intervention, in the above-mentioned context, which targets junior dental staff using a training session that included cases of wrong-site surgery, presentation of clinical guidelines and feedback by the instructor, was associated with a reduction in the incidence of wrong-site tooth extractions. Given the nature of the intervention in a very specific population, application of these results to a broader population undergoing other forms of surgery or invasive procedures should be undertaken cautiously.

### Surgical checklists: a systematic review of impacts and implementation [^f941efdf]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Wrong-site surgery checklists

In January 2004, the Joint Commission launched the first version of the UP for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure, Wrong Person Surgery. Preoperative verifications of person, procedure and site are supposed to occur in the OR and (if applicable) when the procedure is scheduled, when the patient enters the healthcare facility, and anytime care is transferred between caregivers. Site marking should involve only the operative site and should be visible before the patient is draped. The 'time out' is to occur before incision and involve the entire OR team. The UP is not a checklistbut could be implemented using one or more checklists. Steps 1 and 3 specifically mention the potential use of a checklist.

Wrong-site surgery is rare; estimates for various procedures range from 1 in 13 000 procedures for wrong-site anaesthesia block to 1 in 4200 for wrong-side ureteral stents. A general systematic review estimated that the overall rate was 1–5 per 10 000 procedures. Given the rarity, demonstrating a statistical reduction would require an unfeasibly large study. A systematic review searched for literature and concluded there was 'no literature to substantiate the effectiveness of the current Joint Commission Universal Protocol in decreasing the rate of wrong site, wrong level surgery'.herefore, the preventive benefits of a checklist to prevent wrong-site surgery are generally assumed based on clinical expertise.

### Safety in hand surgery: eliminating wrong-site surgery [^70c054d1]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the definition of wrong-site surgery and what it may encompass. 2. State the causes of wrong-site hand surgery. 3. Give examples of initiatives used to prevent wrong-site surgery. 4. Describe a process to minimize the risk of performing wrong-site surgery.

Summary

Wrong-site surgery remains a problem in our ever-evolving culture of surgical safety, and hand surgeons are at particularly high risk. Broadly speaking, wrong-site surgery is a procedure performed at an incorrect anatomical site. In hand surgery, this includes errors in laterality, wrong digit(s), wrong procedure(s), or even a failure to complete all indicated procedures. This article examines the scope of this safety issue, the current challenges to preventing wrong-site surgery, and the authors' proposed solutions to eliminating wrong-site surgery and establishing a culture of safety in hand surgery.

### Avoiding wrong site surgery: a systematic review [^2c60beee]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To report the incidence and causes of wrong site surgery and determine what preoperative measures are effective in preventing wrong site surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

From 1995 to 2005, the Joint Commission (JC) sentinel event statistics database ranked wrong site surgery as the second most frequently reported event with 455 of 3548 sentinel events (12.8%). Although the event seems to be rare, the incidence of these complications has been difficult to measure and quantify. The implications for wrong site surgery go beyond the effects to the patient. Such an event has profound medical, legal, social, and emotional implications.

Methods

A systematic review of the English language literature was undertaken for articles published between 1990 and December 2008. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify the articles defining wrong site surgery and reporting wrong site events. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria and disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Results

The estimated rate of wrong site surgery varies widely ranging from 0.09 to 4.5 per 10,000 surgeries performed. There is no literature to substantiate the effectiveness of the current JC Universal Protocol in decreasing the rate of wrong site, wrong level surgery.

Conclusion

Wrong site surgery may be preventable. We suggest that the North American Spine Society and JC checklists are insufficient on their own to minimize this complication. Therefore, in addition to these protocols, we recommend intraoperative imaging after exposure and marking of a fixed anatomic structure. This imaging should be compared with routine preoperative studies to determine the correct site for spine surgery.

### Prevention of wrong-site Tooth extraction: clinical guidelines [^6fd725d1]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Wrong-site tooth extraction can be defined as the extraction of a tooth other than the one intended by the referring dentist. This adverse event continues to be one of the major reasons for filing malpractice claims against oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Most cases of wrong-site tooth extractions are preventable and can be minimized by the development of an educational program, an informative, unambiguous referral form, a pre-operative check list, and incorporation of the Universal Protocol for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure, Wrong Person Surgery into daily clinical practice.

### Watching right and wrong nucleotide insertion captures hidden polymerase fidelity checkpoints [^f4e8aaa9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Efficient and accurate DNA synthesis is enabled by DNA polymerase fidelity checkpoints that promote insertion of the right instead of wrong nucleotide. Erroneous X-family polymerase (pol) λ nucleotide insertion leads to genomic instability in double strand break and base-excision repair. Here, time-lapse crystallography captures intermediate catalytic states of pol λ undergoing right and wrong natural nucleotide insertion. The revealed nucleotide sensing mechanism responds to base pair geometry through active site deformation to regulate global polymerase-substrate complex alignment in support of distinct optimal (right) or suboptimal (wrong) reaction pathways. An induced fit during wrong but not right insertion, and associated metal, substrate, side chain and pyrophosphate reaction dynamics modulated nucleotide insertion. A third active site metal hastened right but not wrong insertion and was not essential for DNA synthesis. The previously hidden fidelity checkpoints uncovered reveal fundamental strategies of polymerase DNA repair synthesis in genomic instability.

### Achieving the national quality forum's "Never events": prevention of wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong patient operations [^2df20a17]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Review the evidence regarding methods to prevent wrong site operations and present a framework that healthcare organizations can use to evaluate whether they have reduced the probability of wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong patient operations.

Summary Background Data

Operations involving the wrong site, patient, and procedure continue despite national efforts by regulators and professional organizations. Little is known about effective policies to reduce these "never events", and healthcare professional's knowledge or appropriate use of these policies to mitigate events.

Methods

A literature review of the evidence was performed using PubMed and Google; key words used were wrong site surgery, wrong side surgery, wrong patient surgery, and wrong procedure surgery. The framework to evaluate safety includes assessing if a behaviorally specific policy or procedure exists, whether staff knows about the policy, and whether the policy is being used appropriately.

Results

Higher-level policies or programs have been implemented by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Veteran's Health Administration, Canadian Orthopaedic, and the North American Spine Society Associations to reduce wrong site surgery. No scientific evidence is available to guide hospitals in evaluating whether they have an effective policy, and whether staff know of the policy and appropriately use the policy to prevent "never events".

Conclusions

There is limited evidence of behavioral interventions to reduce wrong site, patient, and surgical procedures. We have outlined a framework of measures that healthcare organizations can use to start evaluating whether they have reduced adverse events in operations.

### Wrong site surgery-where are we and what is the next step? [^ccd05245]. Hand (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Wrong site surgery is estimated to occur 40 times per week in hospitals and clinics in USA. The universal protocol was implemented by the joint commission board of commissioners to address wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong person surgery.

Discussion

The universal protocol has three principal components: preoperative verification, marking of the operative site, and a time-out. Despite this organized approach to this problem, current data do not demonstrate any progress. In fact some data suggest that the problem may be getting worse. It is apparent that a process relying on surgeon and surgical team memory is doomed to ultimate failure. Recommendations are made for a more in depth checklist process based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization, reports in the literature of known areas of weakness in the current process, and personal experience in hopes of establishing a more bullet proof system to avoid wrong site procedure.

### Electronically mediated time-out initiative to reduce the incidence of wrong surgery: an interventional observational study [^ead15401]. Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

"Wrong surgery" is defined as wrong site, wrong operation, or wrong patient, with estimated incidence up to 1 per 5,000 cases. Responding to national attention on wrong surgery, our objective was to create a care redesign intervention to minimize the rate of wrong surgery.

Methods

The authors created an electronic system using existing intraoperative electronic documentation to present a time-out checklist on large in-room displays. Time-out was dynamically interposed as a forced-function documentation step between "patient-in-operating room" and "incision". Time to complete documentation was obtained from audit logs. The authors measured the postimplementation wrong surgery rate and used Bayesian methods to compare the pre- and postimplementation rates at our institution. Previous probabilities were selected using wrong surgery rate estimates from the observed performance reported in the literature to generate previous probabilities (4.24 wrong surgeries per 100,000 cases).

Results

No documentation times exceeded 5min; 97% of documentation tasks were completed within 2min. The authors performed 243,939 operations over 5 yr using the system, with zero wrong surgeries, compared with 253,838 operations over 6 yr with two wrong surgeries before implementation. Bayesian analysis suggests an 84% probability that the postimplementation wrong rate is lower than baseline. However, given the rarity of wrong surgery in our sample, there is substantial uncertainty. The total system-development cost was $34,000, roughly half the published cost of one weighted median settlement for wrong surgery.

Conclusion

Implementation of a forced-completion electronically mediated time-out process before incision is feasible, but it is unclear whether true performance improvements occur.

### Markov chain monte carlo methods for hierarchical clustering of dynamic causal models [^3dad20f9]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

In order to gain more insight into why these subjects were assigned to the wrong cluster, we plot the posterior means of the subject‐specific DCM parameters in Figure 17. This plot shows that the DCM parameters of two of the incorrectly assigned subjects were indeed consistent with the DCM parameters of the wrong group, while the parameter estimate for the third incorrectly assigned subject lies between the two groups. This indicates that the BOLD signals of these subjects simply lead to DCM parameter estimates that are consistent with the wrong cluster.

FIGURE 17

The labels correct and wrong in the legend refer to the correctness of cluster assignment shown in Figure 11 top left. Specifically, control wrong refers to subject 17 and patient wrong to subjects 27 and 34, who were assigned to the wrong clusters

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^2b2557ec]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Moral wrongness judgments.

Sample 2 moral wrongness judgments for cooperative function violations in different relationships: kernel density plot of wrongness judgments (0 = not at all morally wrong, 100 = very morally wrong) concerning characteristic function-weakening actions for each of four dyadic cooperative functions across 10 relationships. Dot represents the mean, with 95% confidence intervals. Height of the curve represents density (see Fig. 1 for explanation). This experiment was conducted once, with all data shown here. Note that actions which characteristically weaken the mating function (e.g. refusing to have sex with someone) were judged closer to "not at all wrong" than "very wrong" for all dyads apart from the romantic partner relationship. Otherwise, the relative lack of visually dramatic differences in the shape of the moral wrongness judgment distributions between relationships likely can be explained by the mild or "everyday" nature of the function-weakening actions employed in this study (see Fig. 4). Such actions were deliberately chosen to contrast with the more extreme, unusual, or bizarre actions often studied in moral psychology; thus, the ability of our model to predict even subtle variance in moral wrongness judgments between relationships for common, non-extreme actions (see analysis below) can be seen as a strength. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^8c774aa2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

With respect to aims (i) and (ii), we predicted that relational norms would robustly predict moral judgments about the wrongness of actions in relational context. The basis for this prediction is straightforward: the more a particular set of cooperative functions matters for a given relationship, the morally worse it should be judged to be to neglect or frustrate those same functions within that relationship. Because relationships vary in terms of the set of cooperative functions they are normatively expected to serve (and to what degree), a given action may be judged to be seriously wrong in the context of one relationship but entirely acceptable in the context of another.

We further predicted that our relational norms model would better explain the variance in moral wrongness judgments across relationship dyads than genetic relatedness, social closeness, and interdependence, which we believe offer incomplete predictive accounts of such judgments in relational context. To illustrate, imagine that Person A fails to behave in a deferential manner toward Person B. Insofar as the relationship is normatively expected to be governed by the hierarchy function (see Table 1), with Person A in the subordinate position, such behavior likely will be judged as morally wrong. By contrast, consider how genetic relatedness might explain the wrongness of this action. Some genetically close relationships, such as the parent-child relationship, may, indeed, normatively rely on the hierarchy function to coordinate behavior, and to the extent they do, the action might be judged to be wrong. However, other genetically close relationships, such as siblings of a similar age, are less likely to rely on the hierarchy function, while some genetically distant relationships, such as a typical boss-employee relationship, might be equally or even more likely to rely on the function. Thus, genetic relatedness ultimately may prove to be largely independent of the question of what makes certain actions liable to be judged morally wrong.

### Time-out: It's radiology's turn – incidence of wrong-patient or wrong-study errors [^78a08f99]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the utility of a two-person verification system (Rad Check) in successfully decreasing wrong-patient or wrong-study errors.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective study performed at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital, monthly radiology incident reports from January 2009 through December 2014 were reviewed for documentation of wrong-patient or wrong-study events. The date, imaging modality, nature of the event, and number of imaging studies for this time period by year were recorded and analyzed. These data were tracked before and after implementation of the two-person verification system in July 2012.

Results

Over 72 months, 45 reported wrong-patient or wrong-study events were confirmed. The data were analyzed before and after implementation of a two-person verification system implemented in July 2012, midway through the study period. Over the first 42 months, 36 wrong-patient or wrong-study occurrences were identified, corresponding to an average of one error every 35 days, with the number of days between events ranging from 3 to 150. After implementation of the verification process, nine events were documented over 30 months, corresponding to an average of one error every 101 days, with the maximum number of days between events exceeding 410.

Conclusion

Wrong-patient or wrong-study events can be significantly reduced by utilizing a brief two-person verification approach. More robust documentation of these events is warranted so that individual institutions can assess the incidence of these events within their own department and develop tailored plans to prevent these errors.

### Wrong-site nerve blocks: 10 yr experience in a large multihospital health-care system [^cd11b42f]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although wrong-site surgery has garnered extensive scrutiny, the incidence of wrong-site blocks remains unknown. Our study thus sought to quantify the incidence of wrong-site blocks and examine some of their associated risk factors in our multihospital health-care system.

Methods

Using quality-improvement and billing data, we quantified the total number of blocks and wrong-site blocks occurring between July 1, 2002 and June 30, 2012 within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System. The incidence of wrong-site block was determined by block type, hospital, and type of service involved in performing the block. The incidence of wrong-site block was compared with that of wrong-site surgery. Fisher's exact tests were performed to determine associations between the incidence of wrong-site block and any of the aforementioned variables. A root-cause analysis was performed to determine the source of wrong-site blocks after the implementation of a timeout policy.

Results

Of the 85 915 patients receiving blocks, 70 441 received only unilateral blocks, yielding an overall incidence of wrong-site block of 1.28 (95% confidence interval 0.43–2.13) per 10 000 patients receiving unilateral blocks. The incidence of wrong-site block was highest with femoral blocks, and differed from the incidence of wrong-site surgery. All occurrences of wrong-site block after the implementation of the timeout policy involved policy violations.

Conclusions

Our study provides the first incidence data on wrong-site block in a large patient population and can help hospitals to develop policies based on these data. It is yet to be determined whether active intervention can eliminate this adverse event.

### Intraventricular hemorrhage and survival, multimorbidity, and neurodevelopment… [^275eb9bb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Exposure IVH grades 1 to 4. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was survival without severe neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years' corrected age including severe delays. Secondary outcomes included gross and fine motor function, receptive and expressive communication, vision, hearing, and overall developmental progress. Outcomes were derived from clinician-entered data and analyzed using multiple logistic regression. with childhood outcomes involve relatively historical cohorts selected from specific neonatal centers or networks and many do not adequately account for the myriad of confounders that tend to accompany prematurity. 5–7 Neonatal studies tend to focus heavily on neurodevelopmental assessment scores, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development.

The primary outcome was survival without severe NDI at 2 years' corrected age including severe developmental delay; inability to understand words or signs; inability to use more than 5 words or signs; being unable to walk, sit, or use hands; blindness; or uncorrectable hearing impairment. 22, 25 Secondary outcomes included gross and fine motor function, receptive and expressive communication, overall developmental progression, visual impairment, and hearing impairment.
25. Cases and controls were described and compared. A causal inference approach was employed, guided by a directed acyclic graph specified a priori to identify key covariates for matching and adjustment. Lower survival without severe NDI was seen by increasing grade of IVH, bilateral compared with unilateral IVH, decreasing gestational age, and with increasing numbers of additional major morbidities.

Gross motor and expressive communication impairments were prevalent. Assessment of outcomes at 2 years has limitations; these are not long-term outcomes and are not necessarily fixed or predictive of later outcomes. 15, 43 Further follow-up of this cohort to school age is therefore vital.

### Incidence and root cause analysis of wrong-site pain management procedures: a multicenter study [^75c9a6c5]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Medical errors exact an inordinate toll on healthcare costs. One of the most publicized and analyzed type of medical error is wrong-site surgery. Yet, despite the burgeoning number of procedures performed, no literature exists on wrong-site pain management injections. The purpose of this study was to estimate the relative incidence and determine the causes of wrong-site pain management procedures.

Methods

Quality improvement records were examined during a 2-yr period from four civilian academic teaching hospitals, three military treatment facilities, and three private practices, for "sentinel" events involving wrong-site pain management procedures. A total of 13 cases (incidence 0.027%; 95% CI 0.01–0.05%) were identified from approximately 48,941 collective procedures of which 52.4% were deemed to be "at risk" for the occurrence. Root cause analyses were then conducted to determine the origin of each error.

Results

The 13 cases included five wrong-side transforaminal epidural steroid injections, six other wrong-side injections, and two wrong-level minimally invasive surgical procedures. In only one case was the "universal protocol" completely followed, and in nine procedures, multiple lapses occurred in protocol. Three patients had bilateral pathology, and in seven cases, the patient knew at the time that the wrong side was being injected. In no instance did any technical, legal, or professional consequences ensue from the error.

Conclusions

Wrong-site nerve blocks occur more frequently in pain management centers than has previously been acknowledged. Adaptation of the universal protocol to nerve blocks and strict adherence to widely accepted guidelines may prevent wrong-site interventional pain procedures.

### Wrongful birth and wrongful life lawsuits in obstetrics and gynecology [^fbe3183f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Developments in preconception and prenatal technologies have led to undeniable advances in how health-care providers screen and treat patients. Despite these advances, at any point errors can occur leading to misdiagnosis or a missed diagnosis. In some instances, the missed information can lead to the birth of a child with health issues where short of the error, the decision to avoid conception or terminate the pregnancy might have been made. When these lapses unfold, there exists the potential for a wrongful birth or wrongful life lawsuit to ensue. While these 2 actions are based on the same set of events, they are distinct legal claims with varying degrees of judicial permissibility. Global legal acceptability of wrongful birth and life lawsuits tends to resemble patterns in the United States. Analyzing prior wrongful birth and wrongful life claims can reveal common trends in events leading to these types of lawsuits, as well as an understanding of their potential outcomes. A familiarity with wrongful birth and wrongful life lawsuits demonstrates how these cases are unique from other forms of prenatal or birth injury tort lawsuits and can provide insights to common shortcomings in clinical practice. Applying these lessons to clinical practice highlights key approaches towards limiting the risk of certain errors leading to wrongful birth and wrongful life lawsuits, with the goal of health-care providers offering high quality health care.

### Reliable identification of protein-protein interactions by crosslinking mass spectrometry [^c17b532a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Entrapment database control calculation

As a second control, the error of matched PPIs was estimated based on known wrong matches to three entrapment databases of different sizes. For one, the same number (4350) of human proteins of similar size was added by sampling a human protein similar in Lysine and Arginine content for each E. coli protein. As a second entrapment database, the full S. cerevisiae proteome was added. Finally, both databases were combined for a third entrapment database.

PPIs were defined as false if one or more proteins in the PPI was a human or yeast protein. Additionally, the difference in entrapment and possible search space has to be taken into account, similar to the approach for the non-crosslinkable control, following Eq. (4):

As expected from doubling the original database size by adding an entrapment database of equal size, the search space normalisation approximates to 2 (1.998) for the human entrapment database. For the yeast proteome and human proteins and yeast proteome databases the Arginine and Lysine normalization factors are 1.19 and 1.16, respectively.

Wrong crosslinker control

As a third control we performed searches using a wrong mass crosslinker in addition to BS3 or DSSO, respectively. Both crosslinker masses were reduced by 28.031 Dalton. Note that for these searches, DSSO was treated as non-cleavable. Wrong mass matches were treated separately, i.e. the same PPI matched to correct and wrong crosslinker appeared twice in the results. The error was normalized by a factor of 2 (see above).

Wrong precursor mass control

Spectra passing a 1% heteromeric CSM-FDR were extracted. For these spectra, the precursor mass was downshifted by 28.031 and 42.047 Dalton (corresponding to the mass of two or three methylations). Correct and shifted spectra were searched together, every match to a known wrong spectrum counted as wrong. Here, the error was not corrected as we assume the unknown wrong matches in the correct mass spectra to be only at 1% based on the FDR employed before.

### Overconfidence as a cause of diagnostic error in medicine [^959f780f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The great majority of medical diagnoses are made using automatic, efficient cognitive processes, and these diagnoses are correct most of the time. This analytic review concerns the exceptions: the times when these cognitive processes fail and the final diagnosis is missed or wrong. We argue that physicians in general underappreciate the likelihood that their diagnoses are wrong and that this tendency to overconfidence is related to both intrinsic and systemically reinforced factors. We present a comprehensive review of the available literature and current thinking related to these issues. The review covers the incidence and impact of diagnostic error, data on physician overconfidence as a contributing cause of errors, strategies to improve the accuracy of diagnostic decision making, and recommendations for future research.

### JOURNAL CLUB: evaluation of near-miss wrong-patient events in radiology reports [^44b2166d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of reported near-miss wrong-patient events in radiology at two large academic hospitals and its relation to imaging modality, clinical setting, and time of occurrence.

Materials and Methods

An institutional imaging report database was searched for reports between January 1, 2009, and May 30, 2013, that contained the phrases "incorrect patient" or "wrong patient". These imaging reports were categorized into either mislabeled or misidentified patient or wrong dictation or report events. The mislabeling-misidentification events involved patients whose images were incorrectly placed in another patient's folder. In wrong dictation or report events, a patient's images were placed in the correct imaging folder, but another patient's images were used in error for dictation of the report. The time to detect each of these events was also evaluated.

Results

Overall, 67 eligible reports were identified among 1,717,713 examinations performed during the study period. The estimated event rate was 4 per 100,000 examinations (mislabeling-misidentification, 52%; wrong dictation, 48%). The monthly mean of mislabeling-misidentification events was 0.7 (SD, 0.9) and of wrong dictation events was 0.6 (SD, 0.7). The median time for mislabeling-misidentification reports to be identified was 22 hours and for wrong dictation reports was 0 hours. Portable chest radiography was the modality involved in 69% (24/35) of reported mislabeling-misidentification and 44% (14/32) of wrong dictation events (p = 0.08); 43% (15/35) of mislabeling-misidentification and 28% (9/32) of wrong dictation events occurred during off hours; 63% (22/35) of mislabeling-misidentification and 56% (18/32) of wrong dictation events occurred in the inpatient setting.

Conclusion

Despite use of the dual-identifier technique mandated by The Joint Commission, the number of near-miss mislabeled patient events for imaging tests and the delay in awareness of these events were substantial, especially for radiography.

### Avoiding adverse events in interventional radiology-a systematic review on the instruments [^f60d7fe0]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

According to The Joint Commission, team time-out is an effective tool to avoid serious reportable events, also known as never events. They are defined as serious and harmful, largely preventable clinical events. Important examples are interventions on the wrong site, wrong patient, or wrong procedure. The Universal Protocol for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure, Wrong Person Surgery from The Joint Commission was applied to the Quality Improvement Guidelines for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure, and Wrong Person Errors by the SIR. For the practical implementation of team time-out, they state that it must be done immediately before the invasive procedure and in the location where the procedure takes place. Aside from that, the entire team must be involved in the process.

What has yet to be addressed in studies so far? Communication standards and clinical case discussion were not evaluated in the studies. Aviation has a long and successful history of this facet of risk management and quality improvement. Aviation and medicine involve people working in highly complex systems so that this knowledge can be transferred to medicine. Pilots are open and committed to discussing any event to improve the system's safety. Their superiors support them without fear of punishment or retribution. Although senior operators are the decision-makers, they must encourage open communication. In aviation, it is common practice to focus all communication during critical portions of a procedure.

### How social relationships shape moral wrongness judgments [^0f7cf046]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Proceeding to the second main part of Stage 2, a set of naive/lay participants (Sample 2) was recruited, this time on Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). To power for the same confidence and margin of error as in Sample 1, but this time with a between-subjects design, it was determined that we would need ratings from 1,551 participants (see Supplement Section 2.2. for the full rationale). Based on the Sample 1 exclusion rate, we over-recruited by about 10% and thus aimed to recruit 1,706 participants; 1,822 ultimately filled out at least part of the survey (not all finished), each of whom was paid $1.00. Five hundred and two (502) participants were excluded based on pre-registered exclusion criteria, leaving us with a final sample of 1,320 participants. As in Stage 1, they were shown brief descriptions of their assigned relationship. They were told that they would be asked to rate the moral wrongness of various actions within the relationship. To orient them to the rating scale, we clarified that none of the actions they would see would be extreme (e.g. murder), but rather would all be actions that might plausibly occur within the course of day-to-day life.

RESULTS

Study Inclusion

The study selection process is illustrated in Figure 1. The described search identified a total of 258 records. After title and abstract screening, 78 studies were considered for full-text review, of which 60 were excluded. Reasons for exclusion were as follows: wrong study design (n = 30), – wrong intervention (n = 23), – wrong outcomes (n = 1), wrong language (n = 5), – and wrong patient population (n = 2). This left 18 studies for appraisal, extraction, and synthesis.–

Appendix I shows a list of the 60 excluded studies, with reasons for their exclusion. Studies excluded because of wrong study design were mostly narrative reviews, guideline recommendations, and case reports. Wrong setting was the reason for exclusion when studies were developed in a nonhospital or community setting. Studies that did not report data related to COVID-19 contagion in HCWs were also excluded.

Included Studies

Seventeen of the 18 included studies were systematic reviews. and 1 was a qualitative evidence synthesis. Appendix II provides details of the characteristics of the included studies. All but one study was published in 2020. Data extracted from reviews included thousands of participants from 35 different countries.

Ten of 17 systematic reviews evaluated the risk of contagion for respiratory viral infections. of which 6 included outcome data for COVID-19 infection.,

Four systematic reviews, evaluate other respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza, SARS, H1N1, and MERS.

### Getting surgery right [^37734a34]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to identify factors contributing to wrong-site surgery (wrong patient, procedure, side, or part).

Methods

We examined all reports from all hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers — in a state that requires reporting of wrong-site surgery — from the initiation of the reporting requirement in June 2004 through December 2006.

Results

Over 30 months, there were 427 reports of near misses (253) or surgical interventions started (174) involving the wrong patient (34), wrong procedure (39), wrong side (298), and/or wrong part (60); 83 patients had incorrect procedures done to completion. Procedures on the lower extremities were the most common (30%). Common contributions to errors resulting in the initiation of wrong-site surgery involved patient positioning (20) and anesthesia interventions (29) before any planned time-out process, not verifying consents (22) or site markings (16), and not doing a proper time-out process (17). Actions involving operating surgeons contributed to 92. Common sources of successful recovery to prevent wrong-site surgery were patients (57), circulating nurses (30), and verifying consents (43). Interestingly, 31 formal time-out processes were unsuccessful in preventing "wrong" surgery.

Conclusions

Wrong-site surgery continues to occur regularly, especially wrong-side surgery, even with formal site verification. Many errors occur before the time-out; some persist despite the verification protocol. Patients and nurses are the surgeons' best allies. Verification, starting with verification of the consent, needs to occur at multiple points before the incision.

### The incidence of diagnostic error in medicine [^902571db]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

In God we trust, all others bring data

The patient safety movement in the USA has entered its second decade. A wide range of important safety concerns have been studied, and to this point, including medication errors, hospital-acquired infections, wrong-site surgery and a host of other issues. Strangely lacking, however, is a concerted effort to find, understand and address diagnostic errors. One factor that may contribute to its relative neglect is that the true incidence of diagnostic error is not widely appreciated. Measuring the rate of error and, in particular, error-related harm, would provide the necessary motivation to begin addressing this large and silent problem. How likely is a diagnosis to be wrong, missed, or egregiously delayed? How often do diagnostic errors cause harm? In this report, we briefly summarise the methods that have been used to estimate the rate of diagnostic error, and comment on their relative merits and limitations. A more comprehensive presentation of studies using each of these methodologies has been presented elsewhere.

### Your evidence? Machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis and prediction [^f5aa47e2]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

5 ASSIGNING RESPONSIBILITY

Imagine that the medical diagnosis of a system based on machine learning turned out to be mistaken. Although reliable in the past, and having achieved excellent performance in independent validations, it presented a wrong result this time. Notably, this scenario is not just possible, it will happen inevitably, as no system can achieve 100% accuracy in the real world. The drugs that were prescribed by the physician on the basis of the diagnosis provided by the algorithm did not show the intended effect and the situation of the patient declined rapidly. He comes to see the doctor again and accuses her of mistreatment. To defend herself, the doctor would normally recapitulate the evidence that initially justified her conclusion. Other medical experts could review this excuse, compare it to their own experience and established guidelines, and see whether she negligently missed or misjudged something. Eventually, the degree of responsibility for the mistreatment that we attribute to the doctor depends on the nature of the evidence that she overlooked or misinterpreted. If she missed something obvious or drew conclusions that are clearly at odds with established medical knowledge we would classify her behavior as grossly negligent. If, however, literally no expert would have noticed the crucial point or if the case represents one of the inevitable outliers of the general rule, we would probably absolve her from guilt (Figure 1).

### The prevalence of wrong level surgery among spine surgeons [^e20fedf9]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

A questionnaire study.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of wrong level surgery among spine surgeons and their use of preventive measures to avoid its occurrence.

Summary Of Background Data

Wrong site surgery fails to improve the patient's symptoms and has medical, emotional, social, and legal implications. Organizations such as the North American Spine Society and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations have established guidelines to prevent wrong site surgery. Spine surgeons' compliance with these guidelines and the prevalence of wrong-level spine surgery have not been investigated previously.

Methods

All members of the American Academy of Neurologic Surgeons (n = 3505) were sent an anonymous, 30-question survey with a self-addressed stamped envelope.

Results

A total of 415 (12%) surgeons responded. Sixty-four surgeons (15%) reported that, at least once, they had prepared the incorrect spine level, but noticed the mistake before making the incision. Two hundred seven (50%) reported that they had done 1 or more wrong level surgeries during their career. From an estimated 1,300,000 spine procedures, 418 wrong level spine operations had been performed, with a prevalence of 1 in 3110 procedures. The majority of the incorrect level procedures were performed on the lumbar region (71%), followed by the cervical (21%), and the thoracic (8%) regions. One wrong level surgery led to permanent disability, and 73 cases resulted in legal action or monetary settlement to the patient (17%).

Conclusion

There is a high prevalence of wrong level surgery among spine surgeons; 1 of every 2 spine surgeons may perform a wrong level surgery during his or her career. Although all spine surgeons surveyed report using at least 1 preventive action, the following measures are highly recommended but inconsistently adopted: direct preoperative communication with the patient by the surgeon, marking of the intended site, and the use of intraoperative verification radiograph.

### Identifying a list of healthcare' never events' to effect system change: a systematic review and narrative synthesis [^af87aa93]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Background

Never events (NEs) are patient safety incidents that are preventable and so serious they should never happen. To reduce NEs, several frameworks have been introduced over the past two decades; however, NEs and their harms continue to occur. These frameworks have varying events, terminology and preventability, which hinders collaboration. This systematic review aims to identify the most serious and preventable events for targeted improvement efforts by answering the following questions: Which patient safety events are most frequently classified as never events? Which ones are most commonly described as entirely preventable?

Methods

For this narrative synthesis systematic review we searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central and CINAHL for articles published from 1 January 2001 to 27 October 2021. We included papers of any study design or article type (excluding press releases/announcements) that listed NEs or an existing NE framework.

Results

Our analyses included 367 reports identifying 125 unique NEs. Those most frequently reported were surgery on the wrong body part, wrong surgical procedure, unintentionally retained foreign objects and surgery on the wrong patient. Researchers classified 19.4% of NEs as 'wholly preventable'. Those most included in this category were surgery on the wrong body part or patient, wrong surgical procedure, improper administration of a potassium-containing solution and wrong-route administration of medication (excluding chemotherapy).

Conclusions

To improve collaboration and facilitate learning from errors, we need a single list that focuses on the most preventable and serious NEs. Our review shows that surgery on the wrong body part or patient, or the wrong surgical procedure best meet these criteria.

### Deprivations, futures and the wrongness of killing [^53634165]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

In my essay, Why abortion is immoral, I criticised discussions of the morality of abortion in which the crucial issue is whether fetuses are human beings or whether fetuses are persons. Both argument strategies are inadequate because they rely on indefensible assumptions. Why should being a human being or being a person make a moral difference? I argued that the correct account of the morality of abortion should be based upon a defensible account of why killing children and adults is wrong. I claimed that what makes killing us wrong is that our premature deaths deprive us of our futures of value, that is, the goods of life we would have experienced had we survived. This account of the wrongness of killing explains why killing is one of the worst of crimes and how killing greatly harms the victim. It coheres with the attitudes of those with cancer or HIV facing premature death. It explains why we believe it is wrong to kill infants (as personhood theories do not). It does not entail that it wrongs a human being to end her life if she is in persistent vegetative state or if her future must consist only of unbearable physical suffering and she wants to die (as sanctity of human life theories do not). This account of the wrongness of killing implies (with some defensible additional assumptions) that abortion is immoral because we were fetuses once and we know those fetuses had futures of value. Mark Brown claims that this potential future of value account is unsound because it implies that we have welfare rights to what we need to stay alive that most people would reject. I argue that Brown is incorrect in two ways: a welfare right to what we need to stay alive is not directly implied by my account and, in addition, most of us do believe that dependent human beings have substantial welfare rights to what they need to stay alive. Brown argues that depriving us of a future of value of which we have mental representations both is a better explanation of the wrongness of killing and does not imply that abortion is immoral. I reply that (a) if Brown's arguments against my view were sound, those arguments could be easily adapted to show that his view is unsound as well and (b) Brown's view is both ambiguous and unsound on any interpretation. The most popular class of pro-choice argument strategies appeals to the view that some or all fetuses lack either a mental state or function or a capacity for a mental state or function necessary for possession of the right to life. Desires, interests, sentience, various concepts, moral agency, and rationality have all been suggested as candidates for this crucial mental role. Brown's analysis is one member of this class of strategies. I believe that it is possible to show that none of these strategies is reasonable. However, there are so many of these strategies that the required argument demands something more like a book and less like a short essay. The argument of the following essay is a piece of this larger argument.

### Reply to: false conflict and false confirmation errors are crucial components of AI accuracy in medical decision making [^b7368f7f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We agree with most of the findings Rosenbacke and colleagues developed, but not with all of their points. We investigated the concordant as well as the discordant findings based on the numbers shown in Table 1, Subtable B–D. Based on these numbers, we investigated the findings of Rosenbacke and colleagues: "The best clinicians lose accuracy" — We verify this statement with Table 1, where we show that for the best performers overall 26 diagnoses were incorrect without AI support (this can be assessed by adding up all numbers in the "physician wrong"-column in Table 1C, but the number of incorrect diagnoses increased to 38 with AI support (this can be assessed by adding up all underlined numbers within Table 1C. "The most common and discussed error occurs when physicians tend to override a correct AI diagnosis in cases of true conflict error. Previous studies found that this arises from distrust in the AI's 'black box' logic" — This statement can be verified by comparing Table 1B and Table S1. In Table 1B, we show that 160 out of 359 true conflict cases ended up in an error with XAI support. Table S1 shows that 170 out of those 359 end up in an error with only AI support. Thus, 10 true conflict errors could be prevented by adding explanations to the black box model. "… AI, for the lowest performing clinicians, helped stamp out true conflict errors" — This statement can be disproved and underlines, why the correct cases are important to take into account alongside the errors: if we investigate all 359 true conflict cases, they divide into 160 true conflict errors and 199 correct true conflict cases. Thus, we end up with an error rate of 44.6% investigating only the true conflict cases. For the worst performing clinicians, the 104 true conflict cases divide into 52 true conflict errors and 52 correct true conflict cases, which lead to an error rate of 50% for the true conflict cases.

### Identifying a list of healthcare' never events' to effect system change: a systematic review and narrative synthesis [^3f0b0337]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review included 367 articles and reports published between 2001 and 2021 that discussed healthcare NEs. Most of the research came from the USA and the UK. These articles identified 125 unique NEs, the most common being surgery on the wrong body part, the wrong surgical procedure, URFOs and surgery on the wrong patient. Researchers usually classified NEs as 'largely preventable' (60.2%). The events most likely to be considered wholly preventable were surgery on the wrong patient, wrong surgical procedure, surgery on the wrong body part, maladministration of a potassium-containing solution and wrong-route administration of medication (excluding chemotherapy).

The use of the term NE is mired in confusion. Organisations that use it have differing purposes and standards, resulting in a variety of events (which include errors, complications and outcomes), terms and data capture practices. Our results quantify this inconsistency. NEs vary both across and within frameworks. Only the four most cited NEs were found in all four major frameworks, and no event was in all 12 frameworks. While the four most common NEs involved only medical errors, the remaining events comprised all three types of events. Additionally, 12 events have been removed from previous versions of frameworks, but some (eg, air embolism, hypoglycaemia) remain in current versions of other frameworks. The terminology of events found in multiple frameworks also varies. For example, wrong-site surgery can encompass any wrong surgery (body part, patient or procedure), or only the wrong part of the body, or only the wrong spinal level. Additional variation comes from the sources of NE data, which include hospital incident reporting systems, electronic health records, central reporting bodies such as government or patient safety agenciesor malpractice claims.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of preoperative image-guided localization in the breast [^ce6e8745]. ACR (2025). High credibility.

Breast localization procedure specifications — before localization, the radiologist should review all pertinent imaging examinations, clinical notes, and pathology reports to determine the extent of the target and method of localization, including imaging modality and approach, and review should determine whether biopsy markers, if deployed at the time of prior biopsy, are located in the appropriate position. In patients who have undergone neoadjuvant therapy, the original extent of disease and the visible residual disease are both important to consider, and localization may target a biopsy marker, biopsy site, and/or the spectrum of breast imaging abnormalities including mass, calcifications, asymmetry, architectural distortion, and enhancing findings. If there is known malignancy, it is necessary to understand the extent of malignancy and its location with respect to previously placed biopsy marker(s), and more than one guidance device may be used to bracket the extent of disease; the use of multiple localizing devices can decrease the number of procedures required to obtain clear lumpectomy margins and increase the rate of breast conservation versus mastectomy. Benefits, limitations, and risks of the procedure as well as alternative procedures should be discussed with the patient, informed consent should be obtained and documented, and adherence to the Joint Commission's Universal Protocol for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong Procedure, Wrong Person Surgery™ is required for procedures in nonoperating room settings, including bedside procedures.

To avoid a medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, strongly advise patients to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are LAMICTAL, as well as the correct formulation of LAMICTAL, each time they fill their prescription [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3.1, 3.2, 3.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. Refer the patient to the Medication Guide that provides depictions of the LAMICTAL tablets, tablets for oral suspension, and orally disintegrating tablets.

### Improving the accuracy of electronic prescribing in west bay health center in Qatar [^033cfbf0]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

Figure 1 shows the proportion of medication errors by type at baseline after PDSA cycles 1 and 2. The data suggests an improvement of wrong dose error from 11.8% to 10.6%, of wrong name from 6.9% to 6.2%, of wrong duration from 11.7% to 10.3%, and of non-formulary drug errors from 2.6% to 1.6%.

This means that the intervention reduced wrong dose errors by 10% from baseline, reduced wrong name errors by 7%, reduced wrong duration errors by 12%, and reduced non-formulary errors by 38.5%.

In a landmark trial evaluating the impact on serious medication errors, the implementation of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) resulted in a 55% (10.7 vs 4.86 per 1000 patient days) reduction in the rate of serious medication errors across all stages of the medication use process.(8) The differences between our results and literature shows that we will need to undertake further interventions and monitoring to reach such international standards.

### Robots are both anthropomorphized and dehumanized when harmed intentionally [^fb4e4455]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Manipulation check

Following ref.we conducted a two-way (Harm × Emotions) between-subjects ANOVA using perceived moral wrongness as the dependent variable as a manipulation check. The data for Experiment 2 violated the assumption of homogeneity as assessed by Levene's test (p = 0.017).

The results of the ANOVA's are summarized in Table 2. All reported p -values refer to the two-sided significance level. There was a significant effect of Harm on the perceived moral wrongness of the moral agent's actions in both experiments. In both experiments, participants in the harm condition rated the moral agent's actions as significantly more morally wrong (Experiment 1: M = 2.33, SD = 1.36, Experiment 2: M = 2.72, SD = 1.31) than those in the no harm condition (Experiment 1: M = 5.14, SD = 1.18, Experiment 2: M = 5.15, SD = 1.16). Neither experiment found statistically significant evidence for a main effect of Emotions on perceived moral wrongness. Finally, the interaction between Harm and Emotions on perceived moral wrongness failed to reach statistical significance in both experiments.

Table 2
Effects on perceived moral wrongness

To quantify evidence for the different models, we conducted a Bayesian ANOVA in JASP using the same variables and default settings for priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings. A summary of all Bayesian ANOVA's can be found in Table 6. The Bayesian analysis identified the model including only main effects as the best model; the evidence for this model over the null model was decisive in both experiments, BF 10 > 100. Furthermore, when comparing against the best model, we found no evidence in favor of the model that included the interaction effect in either experiment (Experiment 1: BF 10 = 0.081, Experiment 2: BF 10 = 0.053).

Although we did not find statistically significant evidence for the interaction, the means were in the expected direction in both experiments, which is why we decided to proceed with our main analysis.

### Simple lighting system to improve compliance of surgical timeout [^33dbb6d3]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical timeout is widely recognized as an important safety step but frequently overlooked. – Surgical mistakes in all specialties may include operating on the wrong patient, wrong organ, incorrect side, and wrong procedure. A high volume and high turnover increase the potential for errors.

In ophthalmology, there are many reports of mistakes at the time of cataract surgery in the use of the wrong implant power, wrong implant type (aspheric, toric, multifocal, or extended-depth of focus), and wrong axis of astigmatism. In laser vision correction, there are numerous reports of data entry errors including the wrong refractive error (sphere, cylinder, and/or axis), wrong optical zone and/or transition zone, and incorrect goal of distance vision vs undercorrection. In pediatric ophthalmic surgery, there are reports of operating on the wrong eye or wrong procedure secondary to confusion between the type of deviation (esotropia/exotropia) and/or surgical procedure (recession/resection).

Mistakes may result in serious irreversible complications for a patient and stress for the surgeon that may also include complaints to a local College of Physicians and Surgeons and/or legal action. The amount of hardship for all involved cannot be minimized. Anything that can be performed to decrease surgical complications should be embraced by surgeons in every specialty.

A simple physical reminder for the operating room may help ensure compliance of a surgical timeout. This can be in the form of a light source that is battery operated and can be changed from red to green to indicate that a surgical timeout has been completed. If followed, it may be almost impossible to forget this critical safety step. A single detachable light can be controlled by a remote control to change the color of the light. This is an inexpensive device that can be ordered online or purchased in hardware or other shops.

### An alternative point of view: getting by with less: what's wrong with perfection? [^45488bed]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Predictions about the future impact of technologic and process innovations inspire optimistic visions. Optimism and speculation require a counterweight. Because results often do not turn out as expected, anticipating failure is useful, and anticipating unintended consequences is visionary.

Measurements

A history of unfulfilled prognostications was explored with the intent of finding something essential to the complexities of medicine. Do missed predictions signal another side to innovation that also helps us uncover new information about our world?

Main Results

Serendipity is an important theme in medical innovation. There is no reason to think this will change. Things do not necessarily go as planned, but often the results are as important as the original prediction was supposed to be. It will not be clear where we end up until we get there.

Conclusions

Ideal goals are useful but speculative and subjective. There in fact might be several ideals and contingency is important. The detours and incidental stops on the way to an ideal are more fruitful than the goal itself.

### Association of display of patient photographs in the electronic health record with wrong-patient order entry errors [^b64d484a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. The design of the study was quasi-experimental; patients, practitioners, and orders were not randomized in terms of the display of patient photographs; practitioners could not be blinded to the study groups; and the 2 study groups had significant differences in terms of patient acuity. Despite these limitations, several factors support a causal interpretation of the association of patient photographs and lower rates of wrong-patient errors, including the larger reduction in wrong-patient errors once photographs of more patients were captured (ie, dose-response effect), the persistence of the association after adjustment for key covariates, and the consistent results of this study compared with previous researchin which the association of number of workspaces and rate of wrong-patient errors was studied. The current study was a single-center study, and results may be different at other institutions, particularly those using a different EHR system with a different way of displaying patient photographs. Both of these limitations can be addressed through a multicenter, block-randomized study.

In addition, this study used the RAR measure to capture WPOE errors, but this measure depends on self-intercepted near-miss wrong-patient errors and cannot serve as a criterion standard. Although this measure has a high positive predictive value, its sensitivity is unknown. Nevertheless, this measure is superior to what was used in previous researchof patient photographs (ie, voluntarily reported WPOE errors), and the use of near-miss errors in safety research is endorsed by major organizations that study or promote patient safety. Moreover, our study focused on only WPOE errors, but other types of wrong-patient errors, such as writing notes on the wrong patient or reviewing the wrong patient's data, may also be mitigated once patient photographs are used.

Finally, we did not incorporate time-dependent variables in our analyses. If patient photographs indeed impact practitioners' likelihood of wrong-patient errors, it is possible that this effect would be subject to a learning process (ie, the effect size might increase over time); on the other hand, many forms of electronic decision support have found to be subject to alert fatigue (ie, a reduction of effect size over time), including interventions that were used to reduce wrong-patient errors.

Patch test reliability and inhibitors — The strength of the reaction on the skin does not necessarily correlate with clinical relevance, and the frequency of false-negative results is not known but has been estimated to occur in up to 30% of patch-tested patients. Potential causes of false-negative reactions include too low a concentration of the allergen in the extract, wrong vehicle, or wrong salt/version; positive responses can be inhibited by UV sunlight (eg, tanning), TCS, TCl on the PT area, and systemic CS (ie, > 20 mg/day prednisone), as well as other immunosuppressives. Nonresponsiveness can also reflect prior ultraviolet light exposure, concomitant immunosuppressive therapies, or methodological testing errors such as insufficient occlusion, failure to perform delayed readings, and failure to perform a photo PT [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence].

### Assessment of incorrect surgical procedures within and outside the operating room: a follow-up study from US veterans health administration medical centers [^c2819228]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Health care continues to strive to improve patient safety. One of the most challenging issues is preventing wrong-site surgery, with 95 wrong-patient, wrong-site, or wrong-procedure sentinel events reported to The Joint Commission in 2017. This does not include events that may not have been reported to The Joint Commission. The National Quality Forum considers wrong-site, wrong-patient, and wrong-procedure incidents to be serious reportable events. Accordingly, the National Quality Forum expanded its definitions to be more inclusive, recognizing the need to continue to address this challenge.

Such events have been estimated to occur at a median (range) rate of 0.09 (0–3.9) events per 10 000 cases. However, these estimates vary, and such rates are difficult to measure precisely. Some rates are based on clinician incident reporting, while others came from closed claims data, both of which may be limited in accuracy. Furthermore, even with indications of the prevalence of wrong-site surgery, we still need more evidence on why these errors continue to occur and how to prevent them.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) has a national centralized database for reporting patient safety events. The VHA National Surgery Office (NSO) also has a centralized reporting system specifically for surgical patient safety errors. Both systems reconcile these data quarterly to increase the accuracy of wrong-site surgery measurement. The last published(2006–2009) VHA rate of in–operating room (in-OR) adverse events was 0.4 adverse events per 10 000 procedures. That study also included specialty specific rates and root causes of such errors. The current study contains data on incorrect surgery from the VHA up to 2017. This study is based on data from the largest integrated health care system in the United States with 2 complementary systems reporting for increased accuracy of capturing surgical adverse events. Therefore, this study provides one of the most comprehensive reports on wrong-site surgery, spanning a rate review of 17 years. It not only includes event rates but also provides in-depth information on why such events may still occur and recommendations on how to prevent similar future events.

### Disclosure of adverse events in pediatrics: policy statement [^d48f7c3b]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Best practices for disclosure — disclosure practices may vary by setting, error type, and patient population, but important aspects include an explanation of what happened, acknowledgement that something has gone wrong and of responsibility, expression of sincere regret and apology, and commitment to preventing recurrences; these should be conducted with the involvement of appropriate parties in each practice.

### The occurrence of wrong-site surgery self-reported by candidates for certification by the American board of orthopaedic surgery [^00ba5be0]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The concept of "Sign Your Site" was established in 1997 to prevent wrong-site surgery in the U.S., and this was expanded to the mandated Universal Protocol in 2008. However, the true incidence of wrong-site surgery in the U.S. is not known, nor do we know whether the incidence has changed. The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) requires that candidates for Board certification provide a list of their cases, including surgical complications, whether wrong-site surgery was performed, and whether they complied with the "Sign Your Site" practice. Each candidate attests to the accuracy of his or her notarized case list. The purpose of this study was to report the incidence and nature of wrong-site surgery self-reported by orthopaedic surgeon candidates for certification between 1999 and 2010 and to assess whether any change was associated with the timeline of implementation of the Universal Protocol.

Methods

The ABOS database was queried for the number of examinees, cases, and wrong-site surgery cases reported; a description of each wrong-site surgery case; whether the site was signed; and the surgeon's subspecialty.

Results

From 1999 through 2010, 9255 orthopaedic surgeons submitted 1,291,396 cases, and sixty-one of these surgeons reported performing seventy-six wrong-site surgical procedures. Spine surgeons were the most likely to report wrong-site surgery, most commonly single-level lumbar laminotomy. The rate of wrong-site surgical procedures before and after implementation of the Universal Protocol mandate was not significantly different. Eighteen of the twenty wrong-site surgical procedures performed since ABOS data collection for "Sign Your Site" began had been signed preoperatively.

Conclusions

Keeping patients safe remains an essential goal worthy of enormous effort. This study suggests that additional layers of precautions may yield diminishing returns and that attention should be focused on methods to prevent wrong-level spine surgery. Improving communication among the health-care team and shared responsibility may bring us closer to eliminating wrong-site surgery.

### Abortion: strong's counterexamples fail [^7cb8632d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

This paper shows that the counterexamples proposed by Strong in 2008 in the Journal of Medical Ethics to Marquis's argument against abortion fail. Strong's basic idea is that there are cases — for example, terminally ill patients — where killing an adult human being is prima facie seriously morally wrong even though that human being is not being deprived of a "valuable future". So Marquis would be wrong in thinking that what is essential about the wrongness of killing an adult human being is that they are being deprived of a valuable future. This paper shows that whichever way the concept of "valuable future" is interpreted, the proposed counterexamples fail: if it is interpreted as "future like ours", the proposed counterexamples have no bearing on Marquis's argument. If the concept is interpreted as referring to the patient's preferences, it must be either conceded that the patients in Strong's scenarios have some valuable future or admitted that killing them is not seriously morally wrong. Finally, if "valuable future" is interpreted as referring to objective standards, one ends up with implausible and unpalatable moral claims.

### The two tragedies argument [^b373c5d2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

Opposition to induced abortion rests on the belief that fetuses have a moral status comparable to beings like us, and that the loss of such a life is tragic. Antiabortion, or pro-life, theorists argue that (1) it is wrong to induce abortion and (2) it is wrong to allow others to perform induced abortion. However, evidence suggests that spontaneous abortion kills far more fetuses than induced abortion, and critics argue that most pro-life theorists neglect the threat of spontaneous abortion and ought to do more to prevent it. Friberg-Fernros contends such an obligation would be implausibly strong, arguing that induced abortions are far worse than spontaneous abortions because while both involve the tragedy of the death of the fetus, induced abortion involves a second tragedy-one person killing another. I argue this two tragedies argument fails to explain what is morally relevant about induced abortion.

Errors can include problems in practice, products, procedures, and systems." Medication error (ME) is "Any error in the medication process, whether or not there are adverse consequences." An adverse drug reaction is "An appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product." An adverse drug event (ADE) is "Any injury related to use of drug. Not all ADEs are caused by medical errors. Also, not all MEs lead to ADEs." A preventable ADE is "Injury associated with a ME." A near miss (potential ADE) is "The occurrence of an error that did not result in harm. Potential ADEs can be intercepted or nonintercepted." A drug-related hazardous condition is "Physiologic response to a drug with potential to cause injury; abnormal laboratory value before it results in ADE." Abbreviations are defined as "ADE = adverse drug event, ME = medication error."

### Inconsistency between overall and subgroup analyses [^9b703599]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Consider the following hypothetical example. Suppose the fourth grade students of two schools (1 and 2) in a school district took a state maths exam. The principals of these two schools wanted to know whether there was a difference in the performances between the two schools. They calculated the overall average score, the average score of girls and the average score of boys in each school. The result is presented as scenario B in table 1. After looking at the average scores of girls and boys, respectively, the principal of school 1 was very happy as they were both one point higher than those in school 2. However, after looking at the overall average score of these two schools, the principal was very confused as the overall average score of school 2 was higher than that of school 1. Is there anything wrong in calculating the overall average score? What is the reason for the inconsistency between the overall average scores and the average scores stratified by gender?

Table 1
Average scores of a maths exam in two schools

Before figuring out the reason for the inconsistency, let us take a look at scenario A in table 1. In this scenario, the overall average score, as well as the average scores of girls and boys in school 1 are all higher than those in school 2. A closer examination shows that the proportions of girls are different in scenarios A and B. In scenario A, 48% of students are girls in both schools. In scenario B, 40% and 60% of students are girls in the two schools, respectively. Is the difference in the proportions of girls sufficient to create this inconsistency? The answer is negative. In scenario C in table 1, although the proportions of girls are different in the two schools, the overall average scores and the average scores by gender are higher in school 1.

### Reply to: false conflict and false confirmation errors are crucial components of AI accuracy in medical decision making [^f5e9a0d3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, it is of critical importance to investigate the different errors when physicians make decisions with AI support especially with respect to the human expertise level. But besides the different error types, it is also important to take the correctly classified cases into account to get a complete picture of the situation. Further research is needed to investigate why those errors occur, whether certain subgroups of clinicians are at particular risk of committing certain error scenarios, and how this can be prevented. One potential approach is taking AI uncertainty into account by giving clinicians AI advice. Of special interest are furthermore cases, where AI and clinician are initially correct, but the clinician overwrites both, his original diagnosis and the XAI's advice (Table 1C; scenario iv), which need to be investigated carefully.

### Identification of common themes from never events data published by NHS england [^e43645dd]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Never events (NEs) are serious clinical incidents that cause potentially avoidable harm and impose a significant financial burden on healthcare systems. The purpose of this study was to identify common never events.

Methods

We analysed the NHS England NE data from 2012 to 2020 to identify common never events category and themes.

Results

We identified 51 common NE themes in 4 main categories out of a total of 3247 NE reported during this period. Wrong-site surgery was the most common category (n = 1307;40.25%) followed by retained foreign objects (n = 901;27.75%); wrong implant or prosthesis (n = 425;13.09%); and non-surgical/infrequent ones (n = 614; 18.9%). Wrong-side (laterality) and wrong tooth removal were the most common wrong-site NE accounting for 300 (22.95%) and 263 (20.12%) incidents, respectively. There were 197 (15%) wrong-site blocks, 125 (9.56%) wrong procedures, and 96 (7.3%) wrong skin lesions excised. Vaginal swabs were the most commonly retained items (276;30.63%) followed by surgical swabs (164;18.20%) and guidewires (152;16.87%). There were 67 (7.44%) incidents of retained parts of instruments and 48 (5.33%) retained instruments. Wrong intraocular lenses (165; 38.82%) were the most common wrong implants followed by wrong hip prostheses (n = 94; 22.11%) and wrong knees (n = 91; 21.41%). Non-surgical events accounted for 18.9% (n = 614) of the total incidents. Misplaced naso-or oro-gastric tubes (n = 178;29%) and wrong-route administration of medications were the most common events in this category (n = 111;18%), followed by unintentional connection of a patient requiring oxygen to an air flow-meter (n = 93; 15%).

Conclusion

This paper identifies common NE categories and themes. Awareness of these might help reduce their incidence.

### Albuterol sulfate [^fcdf3457]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Bronchospasm

For treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or prevention of symptoms associated with bronchospasm, the usual dosage for adults and children 4 years and older is two inhalations repeated every 4 to 6 hours. More frequent administration or a larger number of inhalations is not recommended. In some patients, one inhalation every 4 hours may be sufficient.

2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm

The usual dosage for adults and children 4 years of age or older is two inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before exercise.

2.3 Administration Information

Administer albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol by oral inhalation only. Shake well before each spray. To maintain proper use of this product and to prevent medication build-up and blockage, it is important to follow the cleaning directions carefully.

Priming

Prime the inhaler before using for the first time and in cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 2 weeks by releasing three sprays into the air, away from the face.

Cleaning

As with all HFA-containing albuterol inhalers, to maintain proper use of this product and to prevent medication build-up and blockage, it is important to clean the plastic mouthpiece regularly. The inhaler may cease to deliver medication if the plastic actuator mouthpiece is not properly cleaned and dried. To clean: Wash the plastic mouthpiece with warm running water for 30 seconds, shake off excess water, and air dry thoroughly at least once a week. If the patient has more than one albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol inhaler, the patient should wash each one separately to prevent attaching the wrong canister to the wrong plastic actuator. In this way, the patient can be sure to always know the correct number of remaining doses. Never attach a canister of medication from any other inhaler to the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol actuator and never attach the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol canister to an actuator from any other inhaler. If the mouthpiece becomes blocked, washing the mouthpiece will remove the blockage. If it is necessary to use the inhaler before it is completely dry, shake off excess water, replace canister, spray twice into the air away from face, and take the prescribed dose.

### Steps to misdiagnosis: dissecting an emergency visit [^464a2e17]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the common sense that we learn from our mistakes, an error is an unwelcome event when we deal with patients. Diagnostic error is common, costly, and the leading cause of malpractice litigation. Yet, errors occur occasionally in a lifetime of practice, and the consequences of these faults are significant for patients and physicians. If someone would have told me that I would miss a brain tumor in my first years of practice, in a patient presenting to my care with several cranial nerve signs, I would not have believed it. Here is how it happened.

### Error and discrepancy in radiology: inevitable or avoidable? [^f66d4103]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

So, in answer to the question posed in this paper's title, errors/discrepancies in radiology are both inevitable and avoidable. That is, errors will always happen, but some can be avoided, by careful attention to the reasoning processes we use, awareness of potential biases and system issues which can lead to mistakes, and use of any appropriate available strategies to minimise these negative influences. But if we imagine that any strategy can totally eliminate error in radiology, we are fooling both ourselves and the patients who take their guidance from us.

### Somatrogon-ghla (Ngenla) [^7f37d345]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Instructions for Use

NGENLA (en' JEN-lah)

(somatrogon-ghla)

24 mg

injection, for subcutaneous use

Read this Instructions for Use before you start using NGENLA and each time you get a new refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.

Important information about your NGENLA pen:

The NGENLA pen for injection is a single-patient-use, disposable (throw away) prefilled pen containing 24 mg of medicine. You can give more than 1 dose from the pen.
NGENLA can be given by a patient, caregiver or healthcare provider. Do not try to inject NGENLA yourself until you are shown the right way to give the injections and read and understand the Instructions for Use. If your healthcare provider decides that you or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of NGENLA at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject NGENLA. It is important that you read, understand, and follow these instructions so that you inject NGENLA the right way.
It is important to talk to your healthcare provider to be sure you understand your NGENLA dosing instructions. To help you remember when to inject NGENLA, you can mark your calendar ahead of time. Call your healthcare provider if you or your caregiver have any questions about the right way to inject NGENLA, or call the helpline on 1-800-645-1280.
Do not share your pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them.
Each turn (click) of the dose knob dials 0.2 mg of medicine. You can give from 0.2 mg to 12 mg in a single injection. If your dose is more than 12 mg, you will need to give more than 1 injection.
A new pen may contain slightly more than 24 mg of medicine, this is normal.
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This will decrease the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of medicine, and blocked needles leading to the wrong dose.
Do not shake your pen. Shaking can damage the medicine.
The pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the assistance of a person trained in the proper use of the product.

### Assessment of radiation protection awareness and knowledge about radiological examination doses among Italian radiographers [^05950a3f]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The questionnaire was administered over a period of 12 months to 780 participants equally distributed across four different main areas of Italy (i.e. North, Centre, South and Islands). Participants were asked to complete the survey within 30 min before the beginning of their course. The questionnaire was completed in the presence of an examiner and collected immediately after completion to avoid any bias. In order to prevent duplications, clear instructions were given to participants to not answer the questionnaire if they had already filled it out in previous courses or meetings. All questions of Sections 2 and 3 were in a multiple choice format with five to six options and only one correct answer. One point was given for each correct answer and zero points for each wrong or missing answer, respectively.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed by using software (SPSS version 17.0). Categorical variables are expressed as percentages, while all continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The participant scores were classified by (1) their geographic distribution, (2) their level of professional experience and (3) their different levels of knowledge of radiation-related risks that were compared by using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Post-hoc analysis was performed using pairwise Mann–Whitney tests with Bonferroni correction. Questionnaire reliability was assessed as internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha coefficient.

### Error and discrepancy in radiology: inevitable or avoidable? [^34b21e55]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Definition of error/discrepancy

It was recently estimated that one billion radiologic examinations are performed worldwide annually, most of which are interpreted by radiologists. Most professional bodies would agree that all imaging procedures should include an expert radiologist's opinion, given by means of a written report. This activity constitutes much of the daily work of practising radiologists. We don't always get it right.

Although not always appreciated by the public, or indeed by referring doctors, radiologists' reports should not be expected to be definitive or incontrovertible. They represent clinical consultations, resulting in opinions which are conclusions arrived at after weighing of evidence; "opinion" can be defined as "a view held about a particular subject or point; a judgement formed; a belief". Sometimes it is possible to be definitive in radiological diagnoses, but in most cases, radiological interpretation is heavily influenced by the clinical circumstances of the patient, relevant past history and previous imaging, and myriad other factors, including biases of which we may not be aware. Radiological studies do not come with inbuilt labels denoting the most significant abnormalities, and interpreting them is not a binary process (normal vs abnormal, cancer vs "all-clear").

In this context, defining what constitutes radiological error is not straightforward. The use of the term "error" implies that there is no potential for disagreement about what is "correct", and indicates that the reporting radiologist should have been able to make the correct diagnosis or report, but did not. In real life, there is frequently room for legitimate differences of opinion about diagnoses or for "failure" to identify an abnormality that can be seen in retrospect. Expert opinion often forms the basis for deciding whether an error has been made, but it should be noted that "experts" themselves may also be subject to question ("An expert is someone who is more than fifty miles from home, has no responsibility for implementing the advice he gives, and shows slides." - Ed Meese, US Attorney General 1985–88).

### How to write a systematic review of reasons [^5210e0a0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

As we argue elsewhere, we must reject McCullough et al 's measure of 'the adequacy of the ethical analysis and argument' (p. 67). Furthermore, while it might be possible to replace it with a suitable measure, a systematic review that answers an ethical question may mislead decision-makers when the literature reviewed is incomplete or inadequate. In these cases, the literature's answer to the review question places no burden of proof on those who disagree. Of course, when an empirical literature is inadequate, its answer will also be potentially misleading and uninteresting; the correct safeguard in both cases (inadequate empirical and reason-based literatures) is for the review to conclude only that further research is needed to answer the question. To date, however, the assessment of the quality of reasons and of argument-based literature is much less standardised than, for example, the assessment of the quality of clinical trials and the literature that reports their results. Bioethicists as well as clinical and policy decision-makers are less likely, we surmise, to understand the significance of limitations in reasoning than in study design. A McCullough model systematic review, insofar as it is a systematic review of (quality-weighted) conclusions, also has normative problems: it may mislead when there are mutually incompatible, but maximally informed and individually reasonable, answers to the ethical question, or when different weightings of the reasons (as may be appropriate in dissimilar contexts) support different answers.

### Medical errors [^c01131af]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Following the 2000 report of the Institute of Medicine, To Err Is Human, which documented that as many as 98,000 people in this country die of medical errors every year, medical, hospital, and governmental agencies began to consider changes in hospital systems. The report had found that errors were much more likely to result from systemic problems than from inept health care providers. Progress in reinventing hospital systems has been very slow, although some institutions have made great gains". Medical errors" may be of several types. Some lead to malpractice claims, many do not. Many people who have been severely injured by errors never file claims. Making a medical mistake is not necessarily "malpractice". There are six elements a patient must prove in order to win a malpractice case: a physician-patient relationship must exist, the care provider must owe the patient a duty of care, evidence (usually expert testimony) must be presented that there was a failure in some part of the duty of care, there must proof that the lack of care was the proximate cause of harm, and proof of evidence that harm occurred. The patient must also prove his or her assessment of damages. Solutions to the problem of patient injuries are suggested.

Cleaning Your PROAIR HFA Device:

It is very important to keep the plastic actuator clean so the medicine will not build-up and block the spray. See Figure G and Figure H.

Do not try to clean the metal canister or let it get wet. The inhaler may stop spraying if it is not cleaned correctly.
If you have more than 1 PROAIR HFA inhaler, wash each device at separate times to prevent putting the wrong canister together with the wrong plastic actuator. This way you can be sure you will always know the correct number of remaining doses of PROAIR HFA.
Wash the actuator at least 1 time each week as follows:

Figure I
Take the canister out of the actuator, and take the cap off the mouthpiece.
Hold the actuator under the faucet and run warm water through it for about 30 seconds. See Figure I.
Turn the actuator upside down and run warm water through the mouthpiece for about 30 seconds. See Figure J.
Shake off as much water from the actuator as you can. Look into the mouthpiece to make sure any medicine build-up has been completely washed away. If there is any build-up, repeat the washing instructions.
Let the actuator air-dry completely, such as overnight. See Figure K.
When the actuator is dry, put the canister in the actuator and make sure it fits firmly. Shake the inhaler well and spray it twice into the air away from your face. Put the cap back on the mouthpiece.

### Let us talk about mistakes [^5a579708]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of diagnostic errors and their frequencies

Kim et al. published an error classification scheme for radiological errors composed of 12 types, as shown in Table 1. A total of 656 cases with delayed diagnosis were analyzed by two radiologists, and error classification was achieved by consensus. The most common errors were under-reading (= missed findings), satisfaction with the search, faulty reasoning, and location (finding outside the area of interest).

Table 1
Classification scheme of radiological errors as derived from Kim et al.

Sum is greater than 100.0% since some errors occurred in combination. Individual errors were ordered according to their frequency

Brook et al. proposed a different classification scheme. These authors distinguished between the following errors: (a) latent errors which are inherent to the system or the result of technical faults; (b) active errors which are the result of human error; (c) external causes are those that are beyond the control of the radiologist, including power failures and quenching; (d) patient-related causes like the failure of the patient to adhere to instructions or to demonstrate a lack of understanding of the procedures involved. Examples of active errors include diagnostic errors and misinterpretation, as well as complications from procedures. These can involve more than one person or result from latent errors. Additionally, they put forth the "Swiss Cheese Model," which elucidates the manner in which latent errors may evolve into active errors (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
"Swiss Cheese Model" of errors (adapted from). The individual cheese slices represent different layers of error prevention. Holes within the layers symbolize "latent" errors, which are blocked by the other error prevention layers – as symbolized by the blue stick. If error prevention layers are unluckily positioned, a latent error can lead to an active failure (red stick)

### The nature of surgical error: a cautionary tale and a call to reason [^aba867e2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Errors and "patient safety" have taken on monumental importance for surgery. Like all things new, there is an initial over-reaction before a return to a balanced perspective. The current response to the global interest in error has been to seize on the latest reports that are focusing on the "systemic nature" of errors, which is also being referred to as "the new look". There has been an unintentional ignoring of the actual error, referred to as the coface error, that the surgeon commits. It is time to put the approach to errors into perspective and redefine errors within the context of the surgical community, which can result in a balance of the surgeon's position in regard to systemic and personal responsibility.

### The problem with how we view medical (and diagnostic) error in emergency medicine [^5b160496]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The name of the then Institute of Medicine's To Err Is Human report comes from Alexander Pope's poem, "An Essay on Criticism." Ironically, the same poem contains the phrase "A little learning is a dangerous thing." When it comes to the use of the term of error, health care has at best a superficial understanding of the word, its multiple meanings, and the consequences of making error the target of improvement efforts. If (emergency) medicine is to become safer, a fundamentally novel approach is overdue. We hope the ideas described here are a first step.

### Ethics of fetal reduction: a reply to my critics [^5af9ea8a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

In the article, Twin pregnancy, fetal reduction and the 'all or nothing problem', I argued that there is a moral problem in multifetal pregnancy reduction from a twin to a singleton pregnancy (2-to-1 MFPR). Drawing on Horton's original version of the 'all or nothing problem', I argued that there are two intuitively plausible claims in 2-to-1 MFPR: (1) aborting both fetuses is morally permissible, (2) aborting only one of the twin fetuses is morally wrong. Yet, with the assumption that one should select permissible choice over impermissible choice, the two claims lead to a counter-intuitive conclusion: the woman ought to abort both fetuses rather than only one. It would be odd to promote such a pro-death view. Begović et al discuss my article and offer insightful criticism, claiming, that there is no 'all or nothing problem' present in 2-to-1 MFPR. In this short reply, I respond to some of their criticism.

### Human large-scale cooperation as a product of competition between cultural groups [^4abc83d9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Measurement of cooperation rates

To assess the social scale of cooperative norms, we used 16 vignette scenarios (Supplementary Table 2) in which the main character is in a position to affect the well-being of the target character. In 12 of the scenarios, the main character could help or refuse to help the target in some way (for e.g. by sharing or refusing to share a water well). In the remaining 4 scenarios, the main character could harm or not harm the target in some way (for e.g. by stealing or not stealing their livestock). This allowed us to incorporate culturally relevant situations in which refraining from harming is the mode by which people cooperate. We systematically varied the scenarios so that the target, who was always unknown to the main character, was either from the same clan, from a different unspecified clan of the same ethnolinguistic group, or from a different unspecified neighboring ethnolinguistic group as the main character. In the case of the Turkana, we had additional conditions in which the target was from the same or different territorial section as the main character. The Rendille maintain an atypically friendly relationship with the Samburu and refrain from raiding them. So, for the Rendille, we had a fourth classification in which the target was identified as a Samburu. Each participant was assigned one condition (e.g. different clan) and responded to each of the 16 vignettes saying whether what the primary character did to the target was right or wrong. The frequency of endorsement of the cooperative action (helping, or not harming) gives the prevalence of cooperative norms across the social boundary specified by the vignette condition. Note that although we measure both cultural differentiation and the scale of cooperation by measuring normative beliefs and practices, they measure distinct things. Whereas cultural differentiation tracks whether people adhere to a certain cultural norm, the scale of cooperation specifies to whom norms regarding helping apply.
