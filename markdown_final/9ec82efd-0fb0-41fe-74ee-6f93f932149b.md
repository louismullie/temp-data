## Question

psuedofolliculitis barbae management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pseudofolliculitis barbae management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why certain interventions make sense. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of evidence and grade the strength of recommendations. Next, I will outline first-line behavioral strategies, followed by topical pharmacologic options, and then procedural therapies. After that, I need to consider special populations and equity issues, and finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight what to do if initial measures fail, making sure I cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions. Pseudofolliculitis barbae is driven by ingrown hairs from curly, coarse beard hair that curve back into the skin, triggering a foreign-body inflammatory response with papules, pustules, and sometimes scarring; genetic susceptibility, including keratin 75 variants, and traumatic hair removal practices contribute, and the condition disproportionately affects individuals with skin of color, which has implications for both diagnosis and treatment selection [^c7fa65fb] [^a4e74d5d] [^8a6bad1e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "cures". I should verify the evidence hierarchy. The strongest support comes from patient-centered behavioral modifications and laser hair reduction, with multiple studies and reviews supporting efficacy; topical therapies have supportive but lower-level evidence, and there are no large, high-quality head-to-head RCTs establishing a single best pharmacologic regimen, so I need to be cautious and transparent about the certainty of recommendations [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31] [^d85482d1].

> Next, I should review first-line behavioral strategies because they target the root cause. Shaving cessation is the most definitive approach; if shaving must continue, daily shaving with proper technique reduces hair length and sharp tips that penetrate the skin, and using electric clippers at a higher guard setting or specialized razors that avoid a close shave helps; I need to ensure I include the practical steps: cleanse, warm compress, shave with the grain, minimal passes, cool compress, and post-shave care, and I should confirm that plucking worsens ingrown hairs, which it does [^d85482d1] [^f19ca13e] [^c7fa65fb].

> Wait, let me verify the data on shaving frequency. A randomized study suggested no significant difference in papule or pustule counts between daily and less frequent shaving, but did show improved subjective symptoms with daily advanced shaving products; given the mechanistic rationale and broader clinical experience, I should still prioritize technique and daily shaving when shaving is necessary, while acknowledging the limited RCT signal and emphasizing individualized response [^748684cc].

> I will now examine topical pharmacologic options for symptomatic control and prevention. Keratolytics like glycolic acid and salicylic acid reduce follicular hyperkeratosis and help hairs exit the follicle; topical retinoids such as tretinoin or adapalene can normalize keratinization; low-potency topical corticosteroids calm inflammation; and for secondary infection or flares, topical antibiotics like clindamycin or erythromycin can be used, though I should confirm that evidence quality varies and that combination therapy with benzoyl peroxide may reduce resistance risk in bacterial flares [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31] [^59010e80].

> Let me consider procedural therapies for refractory disease or when patients desire long-term reduction. Laser hair removal is the most effective disease-modifying option; long-pulsed Nd:YAG is preferred for skin types IV–VI due to its deeper penetration and safer profile, with studies showing substantial reductions in papules and hairs after serial treatments; low-fluence protocols improve tolerability, and adjunctive topical eflornithine can accelerate hair reduction when combined with laser; I should double-check that results are durable but not necessarily permanent, and that multiple sessions are typically required [^e8991418] [^d5f39681] [^f9bd112c] [^c657513d].

> But wait, what if access or cost limits laser options? Chemical depilatories can be considered with caution; they reduce hair bulk and blunt tips but carry a risk of irritant dermatitis and dyspigmentation, so I need to ensure test spots and careful counseling are used, and I should note that comparative data suggest laser outperforms chemical peeling for papule reduction, though both can be safe when appropriately selected [^d85482d1] [^92503fa9].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and equity. PFB is common in Black men and can be complicated by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and keloidal scarring; workplace "clean-shaven" policies can force harmful shaving and create barriers to care, so clinicians should advocate for medical exemptions and document the diagnosis to support patients; in children and adolescents, management is similar but I should avoid systemic therapies and prioritize gentle behavioral and topical approaches [^8a6bad1e] [^f875d065] [^331055a5].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. Start with education and shaving modification; if inadequate, add topical therapy such as a keratolytic plus a low-potency corticosteroid for flares; if still refractory or if scarring and quality-of-life impact persist, offer laser hair removal with Nd:YAG and consider eflornithine to enhance speed of hair reduction; throughout, manage hyperpigmentation with nonirritating skincare and consider hydroquinone when appropriate, and reassess at each step for response and tolerability [^d85482d1] [^c7fa65fb] [^8a6bad1e].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if initial measures fail. Persistent or atypical cases warrant reconsideration of the diagnosis to exclude bacterial folliculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae, or other folliculitides; if inflammation is severe or scarring is progressing, escalate to procedural therapy earlier; and if workplace policy is the driver, provide documentation and coordinate with occupational health to secure shaving accommodations, recognizing that this can be as impactful as pharmacologic therapy for some patients [^3bc5ab67] [^f875d065].

> Finally, I should confirm key counseling points to prevent recurrence. Emphasize daily shaving with proper technique when shaving is unavoidable, avoid plucking or tweezing, use moisturizers and gentle cleansers to maintain barrier function, and set expectations that laser reduces but may not eliminate hair permanently, requiring maintenance; I need to ensure patients understand that combining behavioral change with targeted topicals yields the best outcomes and that we will tailor the plan to their skin type, hair pattern, and goals [^d85482d1] [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31].

Pseudofolliculitis barbae is best managed with a **multifaceted approach** that includes shaving modification, topical therapy, and, for refractory cases, laser hair removal [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31]. The most effective strategy is to **avoid close shaving** by using electric clippers at a higher guard, shaving daily with the grain, and using a single-blade razor with proper skin prep and aftercare [^d85482d1] [^f19ca13e]. Topical keratolytics (glycolic acid, salicylic acid) and low-potency corticosteroids reduce inflammation and ingrown hairs; topical antibiotics are reserved for secondary infection [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31]. For persistent or severe cases, long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser hair removal provides durable improvement and is safe for darker skin types [^e8991418] [^d5f39681]. Patient education on grooming and early intervention are essential to prevent scarring and hyperpigmentation [^8a6bad1e].

---

## Shaving modifications and grooming techniques

Shaving modifications are foundational to management and aim to **minimize trauma and ingrown hairs**:

- **Electric clippers**: Use at a higher guard setting (≥ 1.5 mm) to avoid close shaving and allow hairs to grow straight [^d85482d1].

- **Daily shaving**: Shave every 1–2 days with the grain using a single-blade razor; avoid stretching the skin and multiple passes [^d85482d1].

- **Skin preparation**: Apply warm compresses for 5 minutes, use a gentle cleanser, and let shaving cream sit for 2–3 minutes before shaving [^d85482d1].

- **Post-shave care**: Rinse with cool water, apply a cool compress, and use a non-alcoholic aftershave or moisturizer [^d85482d1].

- **Avoidance of plucking**: Do not pluck or tweeze hairs, as this increases ingrown hairs [^d85482d1].

---

## Topical pharmacologic therapies

Topical therapies target inflammation, infection, and keratinization and are **most effective when combined with shaving modifications**:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Keratolytics | - Glycolic acid <br/> - Salicylic acid | Reduce follicular hyperkeratosis and ingrown hairs | Effective in reducing papules and ingrown hairs [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31] |
| Corticosteroids | - Hydrocortisone <br/> - Triamcinolone | Anti-inflammatory; reduce redness and swelling | Useful for flares; limit use to avoid atrophy [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31] |
| Antibiotics | - Clindamycin <br/> - Erythromycin | Treat secondary bacterial infection | Use only if infection is present [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31] |
| Retinoids | - Tretinoin <br/> - Adapalene | Normalize keratinization; reduce ingrown hairs | Effective but may cause irritation [^c7fa65fb] [^91097e31] |

---

## Procedural therapies

For refractory cases or when scarring and hyperpigmentation are significant, **procedural options** are indicated:

- **Laser hair removal**: Long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser is safe and effective for darker skin types, providing durable hair reduction and symptom improvement [^e8991418] [^d5f39681].

- **Chemical peels**: Glycolic or salicylic acid peels can reduce hyperkeratosis and inflammation; less effective than laser but useful adjuncts [^92503fa9].

- **Electrolysis**: Option for small areas or when laser is unavailable, though slower and more labor-intensive [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and preventive measures

Education is critical to prevent recurrence and complications. Emphasize **early intervention** at the first sign of ingrown hairs, consistent use of moisturizers to maintain skin barrier function, and avoidance of irritants such as alcohol-based aftershaves and harsh cleansers. Reinforce adherence to shaving modifications and topical regimens to sustain improvement [^d85482d1].

---

## Special considerations

In patients with skin of color, prioritize **gentle therapies** to minimize dyspigmentation and scarring; Nd:YAG laser is preferred for hair removal. For severe scarring or keloidal lesions, consider intralesional corticosteroids or surgical options. Address psychosocial impacts and provide support, as PFB can significantly affect self-esteem and quality of life [^8a6bad1e] [^b1dd1226].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Shaving modifications (electric clippers, daily shaving with the grain, proper skin prep and aftercare) [^d85482d1].

- **Second-line**: Topical keratolytics and low-potency corticosteroids for inflammation and ingrown hairs [^c7fa65fb].

- **Third-line**: Laser hair removal (Nd:YAG) for refractory cases or significant scarring/hyperpigmentation [^e8991418].

- **Adjunctive**: Topical antibiotics for secondary infection; chemical peels for hyperkeratosis [^c7fa65fb] [^92503fa9].

---

Pseudofolliculitis barbae is best managed with a **stepwise approach** that combines shaving modifications, topical therapies, and procedural options for refractory cases, with patient education and adherence essential to prevent recurrence and complications.

### Review of treatments for pseudofolliculitis barbae [^c7fa65fb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by follicular and perifollicular papules and pustules primarily affecting the beard and neck area. PFB is a condition that predominantly affects patients with skin of colour. The objective of this paper is to review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and presentation of PFB, and assess the most recent evidence-based treatment options and recommendations for PFB. This is important to increase the quality of care given to target patient populations and to address the prominent disparity in healthcare management of patients with skin of colour. A literature review was conducted utilizing PubMed and Cochrane Library. The key term 'pseudofolliculitis barbae' was used. Search parameters were set to search from 1987 to the present. Results were further narrowed by limiting the literature review to published observational studies, case studies, case series, randomized control trials and case-control studies. Effective treatment for PFB requires a multifaceted approach that targets various aspects of the pathogenesis. Current treatments include preventive measures, antibiotics, corticosteroids, keratolytics, chemical depilatories and/or laser treatments. Topical therapies are currently the mainstay treatment. However, laser hair removal has become a potential long-term treatment option, and additional studies are warranted to understand its long-term efficacy and permanency.

### Shave frequency and regimen variation effects on the management of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^748684cc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is an inflammatory condition of the face with a clinical presentation of papules in the beard area with occasional pustules or hypertrophic scarring, all of which develop in response to shaving. Prevalent in African American men, a limited amount of data have been published on the shave outcomes as they relate to clinically measurable responses and patient satisfaction scoring. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a daily shaving regimen and advanced shaving products on exacerbation of lesions and symptoms in patients with PFB.

Methods

Ninety African American men were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups shaving 2 to 3 times per week with standard products (control group), shaving daily with standard products (daily standard group) or shaving daily with advanced products (daily advanced). The number of pustules, papules, ingrown hairs, and investigator's assessment of severity and subjective symptoms of itching and burning/stinging were assessed at baseline, week 6, and week 12. The response to treatment was also assessed by the investigator and the subject at weeks 6 and 12. Secondary measures including questionnaires regarding baseline shave practices were also correlated with outcomes variables.

Results

There were no significant differences noted between the 3 groups for papule (P=.32) or pustule (P=.46) count for the 12-week study. However, there was a significant mean papule reduction from baseline detected for both the control and daily advanced groups. In addition, compared to baseline, there was a significant reduction in ingrown hairs for the control group, and a directional reduction in ingrown hairs for the daily advanced group. There were significant group differences between the control group and both daily shaving groups, with the control group seeing significantly fewer ingrown hairs (P=.005 for control vs daily standard group and P=.04 for control vs daily advanced group). There were no significant group differences among the 3 groups for investigator-graded severity (P=.43) and response to treatment (P=.51). There was a significant perceived improvement in the response to treatment (P=.007) and itching (P=.002) for the daily advanced group vs the control group.

### The medical and surgical therapy of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^7a945316]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder seen mainly in individuals with curly hair. This condition is seen most frequently in black men who shave their beards but may also be seen in women of all races who wax or shave the axillary and pubic skin. The etiology of PFB is multifactorial, and heretofore a cure has been considered impossible for those desiring a clean-shaven face. The following article serves to discuss the current medical and surgical therapies available for this condition. Medical treatments for this condition include various combinations of topical antibiotics, corticosteroids, and retinoids. In the surgical arena, laser therapy has revolutionized the treatment of PFB and has enabled cure for the first time for those plagued by this disorder and for whom a beardless face is acceptable.

### Ethnic equity implications in the management of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^f875d065]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

One major issue facing the health care system in the United States is the disparity in health care management of diseases that affect minority patient populations. Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is very common in Black men. It presents as skin-colored to erythematous, follicular or perifollicular papules and pustules predominantly on the neck and chin. The most definitive treatment for PFB is cessation of close shaving. However, many Black men are forced to comply with "clean-shaven" policies in the workforce. For those who are able to obtain medical waivers, there is significant time and costs associated with this, especially if they must wait to receive this waiver from a dermatologist. If primary care providers are able to identify the disease and spread awareness of its legitimacy, it may be easier for patients to receive the necessary waivers and may encourage employers to reflect on the ethnic equity of this practice. Our professional support can help reduce stigma and lead to improvements in the physical and psychological health of this historically mistreated population.

### Defining pseudofolliculitis barbae in 2001: a review of the literature and current trends [^10b49cbc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a chronic inflammatory and potentially disfiguring condition most often seen in men and women of African American and Hispanic origin who have tightly curled hair and who shave or tweeze hairs frequently. The etiology is multifactorial. The shape of the hair follicle, hair cuticle, and the direction of hair growth each play a role in the inflammatory response once the hair is shaven or plucked and left to grow. This reaction often produces painful, pruritic, and sometimes hyperpigmented papules in the beard distribution. The result is an unappealing cosmetic appearance, often with emotionally distressing consequences for affected individuals. The diagnosis is made clinically. Currently, prevention and early intervention are the mainstays of therapy. Many treatment options are available; however, none has been completely curative. In this review, the history, incidence, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, dermatopathology, prevention, and treatment of PFB, including the most current surgical options, will be discussed. In addition, new data on patients with PFB from the Skin of Color Center will be presented.

### Pseudofolliculitis barbae: a review of current treatment options [^91097e31]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the disease process and wide variety of treatment options for psuedofolliculitis barbae (PFB), or razor bumps. PFB is caused by hair follicles penetrating the skin and causing an inflammatory response. PFB can occur to anyone who shaves, and is more likely in those with curly hair. PFB can cause significant hyperpigmentation and scarring, more noticeable in darker skin types. PFB can be treated with a variety of topical, systemic, or light/laser therapies. Minimal progress has been made in treating PFB in recent years, partially due to the success of well-established current treatments discussed in this review. The most effective treatments involve a multifaceted approach including behavioral changes in shaving habits as well as the use of topical therapies.

### Treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae using the long-pulse Nd: YAG laser on skin types V and VI [^e8991418]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a foreign body inflammatory condition that is caused by in-grown hairs of the face and body. An effective treatment to alleviate this condition without the risk of side effects has yet to be found.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the Lyra 1064-nm long-pulse ND:YAG laser in the treatment of PFB on skin types V and VI.

Methods

Twenty subjects (12 males and 8 females) were given two treatments approximately 3 to 4 weeks apart and were assessed by objective papule/pustule and hair counts at 1, 2, and 3 months after final treatment. Laser treatments with the Lyra Nd:YAG laser were applied onto 2x2-cm regions on the upper and lower mandible and neck regions. Contralateral controls were used to assess overall effectiveness. Subjective evaluations were also obtained from both subjects and investigators. Assessments of any abnormal side effects caused by laser treatment, including dyspigmentation and/or scarring, were also evaluated.

Results

A reduction in the quantity of papules/pustules and hairs when compared with baseline data was statistically significant for treatment of PFB in the mandibular and neck regions at the 1-, 2-, and 3-month follow-up evaluations. Subject evaluations ranged from satisfied to very satisfied. Side effects included transient hyperpigmentation, transient hypopigmentation, mild erythema, and itching.

Conclusions

The use of the 1064-nm long-pulse Nd:YAG laser for the treatment and management of PFB on skin types V and VI is both safe and effective, with positive results lasting for up for to 3 months after two treatments.

### Dermatologic conditions in skin of color: part II. disorders occurring predominately in skin of color [^f702b65e]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Several skin conditions are more common in persons with skin of color, including dermatosis papulosa nigra, pseudofolliculitis barbae, acne keloidalis nuchae, and keloids. Dermatosis papulosa nigra is a common benign condition characterized by skin lesions that do not require treatment, although several options are available for removal to address cosmetic concerns. Pseudofolliculitis barbae occurs as a result of hair removal. Altering shaving techniques helps prevent lesions from recurring. In acne keloidalis nuchae, keloidal lesions are found on the occipital scalp and posterior neck. Early treatment with steroids, antibiotics, and retinoids prevents progression. A key part of the management of keloids is prevention. First-line medical therapy includes intralesional steroid injections. The distinct structure of the hair follicle in blacks results in hair care practices that can lead to common scalp disorders. For example, chemical relaxers decrease the strength of hair and may cause breakage. Better patient education, with early diagnosis and treatment, often leads to better outcomes.

### Laser-assisted hair removal for darker skin types [^1d8e4079]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Before the advent of longer wavelengths, longer pulse durations and more efficient cooling devices, laser-assisted hair removal was best suited for phototypes I-III with dark terminal hairs. Now, laser-assisted hair removal can be performed safely and efficaciously on darker skin types. The long-pulsed diode and Nd:YAG-wavelength-based laser systems are best suited to safely and effectively treat patients with darker skin types. By using conservative fluences, longer pulse durations and multiple treatments, safe and effective laser-assisted hair removal is possible for darker skin types. Patients with darker skin who suffer from hirsutism, hypertrichosis, and pseudofolliculitis barbae can finally be treated safely and effectively.

### Low-fluence 1, 064-nm laser hair reduction for pseudofolliculitis barbae in skin types IV, V, and VI [^d5f39681]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of a 1,064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser using lower than traditional fluences (22-40 J/cm(2)) for treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).

Methods

Twenty-two patients with PFB refractory to conservative therapy received five weekly treatments over the anterior neck using a 1,064-nm Nd:YAG laser at 12 J/cm(2). Pulse duration was 20 ms with 10 mm spot size. Topical anesthesia was not used. Treatments were completed 15 minutes after patient arrival. Patients presented for 2- and 4-week follow-up. Ten evaluators used a Global Assessment Scale (GAS) to assess dyspigmentation, papule counts, and cobblestoning by comparing baseline to 4-week follow-up visit photographs. Hair and papule counts were performed on five patients and compared with the GAS. Investigators recorded adverse effects using a visual analog and side effects scale.

Results

Eleven patients demonstrated 83% improvement on the GAS (p<.01). There was a mean reduction of 59.5% in dyspigmentation (p<.03), 91.2% in papule count (p<.01), and 75.6% in cobblestoning (p<.02). Patients reported 1 out of 10 on both adverse effects scales.

Conclusion

Low-fluence 1,064-nm laser treatment achieved significant temporary reduction in PFB. Subjects noted minimal pain without topical anesthesia.

### Follicular and scarring disorders in skin of color: presentation and management [^b1dd1226]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Skin of color, also known as ethnic skin, is described as skin of individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic, Native-American, Middle Eastern, and Pacific Island backgrounds. Differences in hair morphology, hair grooming, cultural practices, and susceptibility to keloid scarring exist within these populations and have been implicated in hair, scalp, and skin disorders. Acne keloidalis (AK), central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS), pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), traction alopecia (TA), and keloids are the most prevalent follicular and scarring disorders in skin of color. They have been associated with disfigurement, permanent hair loss, emotional distress, and decreased quality of life. Hair grooming practices, such as the use of chemical relaxers, heat straightening, and tight braiding and weaving can cause scalp irritation and follicular damage and are linked to the pathogenesis of some of these conditions. Consequently, patient education and behavior modifications are integral to the prevention and management of these disorders. Scarring disorders are also of concern in ethnic populations. Keloid scarring is more prevalent in individuals of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent. The scarring alopecia CCCA is almost exclusively seen in patients of African descent. Therapeutic regimens such as intralesional corticosteroids, surgical excision, and laser therapy can be effective for these follicular and scarring disorders, but carry a risk of dyspigmentation and keloid scarring. Ethnic skin and hair may present unique challenges to the clinician, and knowledge of these differences is essential to providing quality care.

### Topical eflornithine hydrochloride improves the effectiveness of standard laser hair removal for treating pseudofolliculitis barbae: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^f9bd112c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) significantly impacts the military population, especially deployed personnel.

Objective

This study was designed to determine whether the addition of topical eflornithine to hair laser treatment would improve efficacy in treating PFB.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, paired (right and left neck) comparison study examining a combination of eflornithine and hair laser versus placebo and hair laser for the treatment of PFB. In all, 27 male patients with clinical PFB were treated with a long-pulsed neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser with an energy fluence of 25 to 30 J/cm(2), a pulse duration of 20 to 30 milliseconds, and a 10-mm spot size to the entire bearded neck region. The laser treatment was performed every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. Between laser treatments, patients applied eflornithine and placebo creams twice daily to opposite sides of the bearded neck region. The number of hairs and inflammatory papules were counted bilaterally at each visit.

Results

The eflornithine side had a statistically significant decrease in the number of hairs and inflammatory papules compared with the placebo side. At 16 weeks, the eflornithine side had a median hair reduction of 99.5% from baseline (range 48.5%-100.0%), whereas the placebo side had an 85.0% median hair reduction from baseline (range 50.5%-94.5%), P less than .001.

Limitations

Patients were not followed up beyond 16 weeks.

Conclusion

The addition of topical eflornithine to hair laser treatment decreased hairs and inflammatory papules faster when compared with hair laser therapy alone in the treatment of PFB.

### Ethnic skin: kids are not just little people [^331055a5]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are numerous skin conditions that occur commonly in children with ethnic skin, including vitiligo, progressive macular hypomelanosis, pityriasis alba, acne keloidalis nuchae, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and keloids. Though these conditions occur in both children and adults, children may have different patterns of clinical presentation and response to therapy. In caring for such patients, important treatment considerations include side effects of systemic medications and tolerability of invasive procedures. Quality of life is an important measure and should not be compromised by either the skin disease or its treatment.

### Treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae in skin types IV, V, and VI with a long-pulsed neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser [^9dc3f0c3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae affects a large number of individuals with coarse curly hair, and present treatment options are suboptimal.

Objective

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a long-pulsed neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae.

Methods

This was a two-phase observational study conducted at a military tertiary medical facility. The study group included 37 patients (skin types IV, V, and VI) referred from primary care physicians with a diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae refractory to conservative therapy. In phase I, one treatment with a Nd:YAG laser was performed on a tattooed area of the thigh with 3 light doses. Epidermal tolerance was evaluated, and hair counts were performed 3 months after treatment for each light dose. In phase II, the highest dose tolerated by the epidermis from phase I was applied to a small submental region of skin with an adjacent site as a control. Subsequently, papule counts were performed 90 days after treatment in the laser-irradiated and control areas.

Results

Phase I: When normalized for controls, there was 33%, 43%, and 40% hair reduction on the thigh for the 50, 80, and 100 J/cm(2) fluences, respectively, after 90 days. Overall, the highest doses tolerated by the epidermis were 50, 100, and 100 J/cm(2) for type VI, V, and IV skin, respectively. Phase II: Mean papule counts after 90 days were 6.95 and 1.0 for the control and treatment sites, respectively.

Conclusion

Nd:YAG laser treatment may represent a safe and effective option for reducing hair and subsequent papule formation in patients with pseudofolliculitis barbae.

### Pseudofolliculitis cutis: a vexing disorder of hair growth [^bae7efe0]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis cutis (PFC) is a troublesome and potentially disfiguring cutaneous disorder characterized by a chronic inflammatory response to ingrown hair. Despite a simple precipitating stimulus, ingrown hair, PFC has a relatively complex aetiology that can involve grooming practices, hair type, genetic predisposition and medication history. Curly hair and a single-nucleotide substitution in the gene encoding keratin 75 may act synergistically to increase the risk for developing this condition. PFC is most common in men of sub-Saharan African lineage, but can occur in men and women of many different ethnicities, particularly in body areas where hair is coarse, abundant and subject to traumatic removal. Treatment options for PFC can be divided into three main categories: modifying hair removal practices, managing symptoms with medication, and long-term hair removal with laser therapy. Laser hair removal is safe and effective in most skin types and has become increasingly popular among dermatologists in the treatment of PFC. However, it is imperative that the laser system and parameters are specifically matched to the patient's skin type.

### Common dermatologic conditions in skin of color [^8a6bad1e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Individuals with skin of color represent a diverse population of racial and ethnic backgrounds, including but not limited to Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian American or Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino, and Middle Eastern or North African. Dermatologic health disparities exist in part because of systemic racism and are exacerbated by inadequate physician training and a lack of high-quality research on skin diagnoses that disproportionately affect people with skin of color. These conditions, which include postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, keloids, dermatosis papulosa nigra, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and acne keloidalis nuchae, are usually diagnosed clinically and not associated with an underlying systemic disease. They can have significant impacts on mental health and quality of life and are often underdiagnosed or undertreated in skin of color. Hydroquinone 4% is considered the standard treatment for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Standard treatment for keloids includes combination intralesional therapy with triamcinolone and fluorouracil. If treatment is preferred for dermatosis papulosa nigra, options include scissor excision, cryotherapy, curettage, electrodesiccation, and laser therapies. Shaving cessation is the best initial treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae. Individuals with acne keloidalis nuchae should avoid frequent close shaves or short haircuts on the nuchal area of the scalp.

### Evaluation of efficacy and safety of chemical peeling and long-pulse Nd: YAG laser in treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^92503fa9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) presents as chronic inflammation of the beard area that affect males but also females may affect if have coarse hair. Its treatment can be challenging. Laser-assisted hair removal causes miniaturization of hair shafts which are the principal contributors to inflammation in PFB. Also chemical peeling is used in treatment of PFB. To assess and compare the efficacy and safety of long pulsed Nd:YAG laser vs chemical peeling in the treatment of PFB. Twenty male patients with PFB were divided randomly into two groups. Group A treated by long pulsed Nd: Yag laser and group B treated by chemical peeling, all were subjected to treatment until complete clearance or maximum five sessions. Clinical assessment of skin lesions was done at baseline, end of sessions, follow-up at 3 months after end of therapy by counting of papules. Subjective evaluations were also obtained from both subjects and investigators. Assessments of any abnormal side effects caused by laser treatment or by chemical peeling were also evaluated. A reduction in the quantity of papules/pustules when compared with baseline data was statistically significant more in laser group than peeling group for treatment of PFB in the mandibular and neck regions at the end of session and follow-up evaluations. Subject evaluations ranged from satisfied to very satisfied. Side effects of chemical peeling included transient hyperpigmentation, mild erythema, and burning and side effects of laser included pain. Both therapy are effective and safe in the treatment of PFB but laser therapy more effective than peeling therapy.

### Facial bacterial infections: folliculitis [^3bc5ab67]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Facial bacterial infections are most commonly caused by infections of the hair follicles. Wherever pilosebaceous units are found folliculitis can occur, with the most frequent bacterial culprit being Staphylococcus aureus. We review different origins of facial folliculitis, distinguishing bacterial forms from other infectious and non-infectious mimickers. We distinguish folliculitis from pseudofolliculitis and perifolliculitis. Clinical features, etiology, pathology, and management options are also discussed.

### Modified superlong pulse 810 nm diode laser in the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae in skin types V and VI [^11ebd1d4]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Laser hair removal is a well-established therapy for pseudofolliculitis barbae, but there have been few studies on the use of a very-long-pulse 810 nm diode laser for this condition.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of a modified 810 nm superlong-pulse diode laser (Palomar Medical, Burlington, MA, USA) in the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) in subjects with type V and VI skin.

Methods

Thirteen patients were treated three times at 2-week intervals on one side of their neck with varying fluences. They were evaluated for (1) reduction of shaving bumps and (2) pain tolerance on the treated versus the untreated side.

Results

There was a statistically significant improvement in shaving bumps. The treatment side showed a baseline PFB lesion count of 22.5 (+/- 20 SD), which decreased to a mean of 5 (+/- 5 SD) (p<.05). The control baseline mean count was 27.6 (+/- 22 SD) and at the end of the study was 15 (+/- 12 SD) (p = .13). Pain was rated at 2.5 of 10 for subjects treated both with and without anesthetic. The margin of safety was greater in type V compared with type VI skin.

Conclusion

A modified 810 nm superlong-pulse diode laser is both effective and well tolerated in the reduction of shaving bumps, especially in patients with type V skin.

### Topical retinoids for pigmented skin [^59010e80]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids are an important class of drugs for treating several dermatoses occurring more frequently in patients with pigmented skin, such as melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, pseudofolliculits barbae and keloids. They also play a role in managing acne, psoriasis, photoaging, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma and disorder of hyperkeratosis in this demographic as well. In general, topical retinoids are well tolerated in pigmented skins. There is little evidence to suggest that patients with darker skin are at increased risk of irritation. However, retinoid dermatitis can induce post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and attempts should be made to reduce its occurrence by modifying treatment regimens in patients with pigmented skins.

### The role of ingrown hairs in persistent kerion of children: a clinical study [^a8aaf7b3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tinea capitis, an infection of the hair, follicles, and surrounding skin caused by dermatophytes, occurs with notable frequency in children, including those who are not immunocompromised, with a particular prevalence among preschool‐aged children.Although the spectrum of pathogens varies significantly with geography and over time, tinea capitis continues to be a global public health issue, particularly in developing countries where sanitation and nutrition may be inadequate.Kerion, a severe inflammatory form of tinea capitis, can result in scarring alopecia and extensive tissue damage, in addition to common symptoms such as erythema, scaling, and abscess formation.

Persistent kerion exhibits more extensive involvement and increased severity in the infrequently reported cases of tinea capitis that are refractory to treatment, and managing cases resistant to systemic antifungal agents poses a significant challenge. In this process, ingrown hairs may play an important role. Ingrown hairs, also named pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), can act as foreign bodies to cause local inflammations.The erythema papulopustular lesions mainly involves the beard, neck, submental, and groin areas.In fact, ingrown hairs can occur in any area where traumatic hair removal has been performed, but reports of scalp involvement are rare, especially in infections.Clinical practice in our patients suggested that ingrown hairs might be a contributing factor to the prolonged duration and suboptimal outcomes in persistent cases of tinea capitis, particularly in kerion. Further research into the cause and progression of this condition could enhance prevention and treatment strategies for tinea capitis that is unresponsive to conventional therapies.

This prospective study evaluated persistent kerion cases among children with tinea capitis at our hospital, documenting six instances that showed limited improvement with standard antifungal therapy and were subsequently treated effectively with ingrown hair removal. The study also discussed the potential role of ingrown hairs in superficial fungal infections affecting the hair.

### Diode laser hair removal of the black patient [^0b9c26e0]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The 810-nm wavelength diode laser can safely and successfully treat all skin types, including dark pigmented skin.

Study Design/Methods

Eight Fitzpatrick level V-VI skin type patients, four of which presented with the diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae, were treated with the diode laser for hair removal using low-energy settings and long pulse duration.

Results

All eight patients had excellent results with unwanted hair greatly reduced, and pseudofolliculitis barbae resolved.

Conclusions

Diode lasers can be used on dark pigmented skin with positive outcomes. Complications such as hypopigmentation, or hyperpigmentation occurred, but all were transient and resolved within a few months.

### Laser and light-based aesthetics in men [^a7c3366a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Men represent an important evolving segment of the cosmetic market. With the growing acceptability of cosmetic procedures along with societal and workplace pressure to maintain youthfulness, men increasingly seek the advice of aesthetic practitioners. Despite this so-called "Menaissance," there is a paucity of published literature regarding laser and light treatments of male skin. Herein the differences in male cutaneous physiology are addressed, followed by a review of light-based treatment of conditions largely unique to male skin, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and rhinophyma. Next, the publications related to laser treatment of male skin specifically are examined. We conclude with a discussion of personal observations derived from clinical experience with laser and light-based treatments in men.

### Hypertrophic pseudofolliculitis in white renal transplant recipients [^99cf2810]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are susceptible to many cutaneous disorders, including drug-induced skin changes. Hypertrichosis, sebaceous hyperplasia and gingival hyperplasia are well-recognized effects of ciclosporin, one of the immunosuppressants commonly used in RTRs. Pseudofolliculitis barbae usually affects hair-bearing areas of skin in men with darkly pigmented skin who shave on a regular basis. We describe five cases of hyperplastic pseudofolliculitis occurring in white RTRs taking ciclosporin as part of their immunosuppressive regimen. All five had involvement of the chin, the classic site of pseudofolliculitis barbae, and two had additional psuedofolliculitis of the nose or occiput.

Within the field, we have a paper on how ABFM attempts to ensure equity in the board examination through differential item analyses review. Other articles report on the diversity of family physicians, the languages they use in their practices, family medicine department chairs, and deans of schools of medicine, as well as the diversity of the patients in family physician practices. Gender inequity is also important for family medicine. For care of diverse populations, there is a discussion of pseudofolliculitis barbae implications, race-specific blood pressure medications and control, location of family physicians and of social services by need, and a large study of laboratory testing by gender. Articles on various clinical topics are also included.

### Hair and scalp disorders in ethnic populations [^d25cc8ba]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Human hair has been classified into 3 major groups, as determined by ethnic origin. In these populations, significant structural and biochemical variations of the hair follicle and shaft are seen, as well as unique hair grooming practices. These structural variations of the hair are closely linked to the common disorders of the hair and scalp, such as acquired trichorrhexis nodosa, seborrheic dermatitis, traction alopecia, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, dissecting cellulitis, frontal fibrosing alopecia, and pseudofolliculitis barbae.

### Chemical peeling in ethnic / dark skin [^0b6b5fe9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Chemical peeling for skin of color arose in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and other ancient cultures in and around Africa. Our current fund of medical knowledge regarding chemical peeling is a result of centuries of experience and research. The list of agents for chemical peeling is extensive. In ethnic skin, our efforts are focused on superficial and medium-depth peeling agents and techniques. Indications for chemical peeling in darker skin include acne vulgaris, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, melasma, scarring, photodamage, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. Careful selection of patients for chemical peeling should involve not only identification of Fitzpatrick skin type, but also determining ethnicity. Different ethnicities may respond unpredictably to chemical peeling regardless of skin phenotype. Familiarity with the properties each peeling agent used is critical. New techniques discussed for chemical peeling include spot peeling for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and combination peels for acne and photodamage. Single- or combination-agent chemical peels are shown to be efficacious and safe. In conclusion, chemical peeling is a treatment of choice for numerous pigmentary and scarring disorders arising in dark skin tones. Familiarity with new peeling agents and techniques will lead to successful outcomes.

### Facial hair shaving behavior and skin problems of shaved areas of males [^a7cc3947]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Unwanted facial hair is a common problem and requires different grooming regimens or treatments. Shaving beard hair can cause undesirable skin effects, such as irritation, razor burn, razor nick, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. This study explores male behaviors related to shaving facial hair and the consequential effects on the shaved skin. A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional, analytical study was conducted on 340 healthy men. Most of the participants were manual shavers. Approximately one-third of the manual shavers prepared their skin for shaving, compared to 13% of the electric shavers. The most common shaving-related skin problems were irritation and dryness, razor burn, razor nicks, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. The shaving-related skin problems resulted from individual skin conditions and their shaving techniques. Appropriate skin preparation should be undertaken before shaving, and post-shaving care products should be used to avoid problems.

Patient’s perspective

The experience I had during the process of this disease was like a shock to me since I had never been through a situation like this. It all started with a small lesion located on the infraorbital right side, at first, I believed it was something normal or insignificant, not paying attention to it. As time passed by, that small lesion started to increase its size, not other symptoms were related, with all this I started to believe it was something else, like an abscess or a papule, yet not giving it a lot of importance since I reckon—at some point this will decrease—it did not. Against all my thoughts, the lesion kept growing, it was until then that I decided to look for medical attention.

I visited a general practitioner who prescribed antibiotics and tried to drain the lesion, it seemed to be the right management. Still, my surprise was great when the only thing it drained was blood, instead of a purulent material as I thought it would be. At that point, when the uncertainty and fear were greater, I decided to visit a specialist in dermatology.

Six months later, the size of the lesion was bigger at the point that it partially occluded my vision when I looked down. I attended to my first medical consultation in dermatology, the doctor performed my medical history and explained to me that a biopsy test procedure was necessary to analyse those cells located in the suspicious area in order to confirm or rule out the presumptive diagnosis that was lymphocytoma cutis.

Afterward, when the biopsy procedure was finished, I went through a rough moment because there was an incision on my face, something that suddenly appeared there, something new that had never been there before, aesthetically talking it was acceptable, however, it was not easy to accept the change in my face. Despite all the explanations doctor gave to me, lots of doubts were rising: will I have an ugly scar? Will my face look the same? Which is the diagnosis? Is my life endangered? Is all this my fault for being overexposed to the sun without any protection?

### An unusual ala12Thr polymorphism in the 1A α-helical segment of the companion layer-specific keratin K6hf: evidence for a risk factor in the etiology of the common hair disorder pseudofolliculitis barbae [^a4e74d5d]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a common hair disorder characterized by a pustular foreign body inflammatory reaction that is induced by ingrown hairs of the facial and submental (barbea) regions after regular shaving. It occurs predominantly in black males, while it is rather rare and usually far less severe in Caucasian males. Black individuals have a higher propensity of developing PFB due to their genetic predisposition for curly hair which inherently possesses a much higher risk of growing back into the skin than straight or wavy hair. The PFB process is, however, not gender dependent nor restricted to the face, but can occur in any skin region once regular shaving, plucking, or other traumatic means of hair removal are instituted. Through a family study and a large-scale investigation of randomly sampled PFB-affected and -unaffected individuals, this study demonstrates that an unusual single-nucleotide polymorphism, which gives rise to a disruptive Ala12Thr substitution in the 1A alpha-helical segment of the companion layer-specific keratin K6hf of the hair follicle, is partially responsible for the phenotypic expression and represents an additional genetic risk factor for PFB.

### Advances in laser hair removal in skin of color [^c657513d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Laser hair removal, previously contraindicated in patients with ethnically dark (phototypes IV-VI) or sun-tanned skin, is now recognized as a safe and effective method of permanent hair reduction in all patients. Longer wavelengths, conservative fluences, longer pulse durations and appropriate cooling methods are necessary to minimize untoward side effects and maximize efficacy. The longer wavelength Nd:YAG laser is considered safest in treating darker skin of color. An added benefit of laser epilation is that side effects of conventional hair removal such as pseudo-folliculitis barbae and post inflammatory dyspigmentation, more commonly seen in skin of color, may also respond favorably to the laser, thus increasing the potential for patient satisfaction.

### Direct comparison of EMLA versus lidocaine for pain control in Nd: YAG 1, 064 nm laser hair removal [^ae237f80]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Laser hair removal is an effective therapy for the treatment of hirsutism, hypertrichosis, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. Although side effects are uncommon, pain is described by most patients undergoing long-pulsed neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) 1,064 nm laser therapy.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of topical eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) versus topical lidocaine (LMX) in pain control for Nd:YAG 1,064 nm laser hair removal.

Methods

Sixty-four patients were enrolled in a double-blind randomized study over a 6-month period. Each patient had half of the treatment area covered with EMLA and the other half with LMX 30 minutes prior to treatment. Neither was applied under occlusion. Immediately following their treatment session, patients completed a visual analog pain scale.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in pain control between EMLA and LMX. However, female test subjects demonstrated lower pain scores than male test subjects.

Conclusions

Nd:YAG 1,064 nm laser hair removal is a painful procedure. Topical anesthetics have been proven to reduce pain for laser hair removal. There is no statistically significant difference between the two most commonly used topical anesthetics for pain control in laser hair removal. Therefore, cost and minimizing potential side effects should guide the physician in selecting the appropriate anesthetic.

### Eyebrow threading: a popular hair-removal procedure and its seldom-discussed complications [^c3e90ffe]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Removal of eyebrow and facial hair by 'threading' has gained popularity worldwide. Threading is an ancient Eastern method of removing unwanted facial and eyebrow hair by a technique whereby one end of a cotton thread is held in the mouth of the technician and the other end looped around individual hair shafts, which are then pulled out. This is repeated in quick, successive movements. In India, this is used extensively for shaping and removing eyebrow hair. Threading now enjoys immense popularity with women worldwide, irrespective of race or colour, and is an accepted method for removing eyebrow hair and shaping the eyebrows. However, this popular cosmetic procedure has some significant dermatological side-effects and is not familiar to many dermatologists. To our knowledge, this is the first report of verrucae occurring in threaded eyebrows. Other complications include erythema, folliculitis, pseudofolliculitis, hyperpigmentation, and depigmentation, including koebnerization of vitiligo. This report should alert dermatologists to the possible complications that may arise from this popular aesthetic epilatory procedure.

### EGFR inhibitor-associated acneiform folliculitis: assessment and management [^ed4d5855]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors is associated with cutaneous adverse events, including acneiform folliculitis, dry skin, and nail disorders. Acneiform folliculitis is a class effect of EGFR inhibitors that is thought to be a direct result of EGFR blockade in the hair follicle. The folliculitis is typically mild to moderate in severity and reversible without scarring upon treatment completion. Dose modification or treatment discontinuation is rarely necessary, except in severe cases. Standard acne treatments (e.g. benzoyl peroxide, oral or topical antibacterials, retinoic acid) may provide some benefit, based on anecdotal reports. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus, in some cases involving meticillin-resistant strains, which may require treatment with oral antibacterials. Further study is needed to determine how the presence and severity of acneiform folliculitis are related to clinical outcomes, and which patients taking EGFR inhibitors are more likely to develop this disorder.

### Safety and efficacy of single pass vs multipass emission with 755 alexandrite laser for all-skin-type hair removal: a pilot study [^636e1668]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Lasers are considered the most efficient methods for hair reduction. The goal of these devices is to provide long-term effects without adverse reactions. This is a randomized split-body controlled study on body hair removal and pseudofolliculitis (PFC) treatment, comparing the standard single pass (SP) emission with the multipass emission (Moveo handpiece) with 755 alexandrite laser. Patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I to VI underwent laser hair removal, by treating one side of the body using the standard SP and the other side with Moveo. Treated areas included face, arms, legs, trunk, axillae and groins. Each patient underwent a minimum of three to a maximum of eight treatments, every 6weeks, with a 6-month follow-up. Hair reduction, side effects, PFC severity score and patient satisfaction were recorded for all patients. Totally, 108 patients were enrolled, of whom 96 were female. The overall hair reduction rate (%± SD), independent of skin type, was estimated as 87±5.5 for standard SP and 78.5 ±7.6 for Moveo. No significant statistically differences were found between the two groups. Side effects included pain, which was higher after standard SP (4.2 ±0.8) than after Moveo treatment (1.5 ±0.5). A statistical significant difference between the two devices was found (P =.0002). PFC score improved in almost all the patients. Patients declared to be satisfied with both the treatments, reporting a preference for Moveo (84% vs 16%) (P =.01). Standard SP and Moveo 755 alexandrite laser seems to be safe and effective treatments for hair removal in all Fitzpatrick skin types and for PFC. Moveo has a higher security profile with fewer side effects.

You may have PFB if you frequently develop skin-colored or red bumps in areas of shaving. Over time, these bumps can become darker and turn into scars. The best treatment is to avoid shaving; however, this may not always be possible. Using a razor designed for sensitive skin can be helpful, as it prevents a close shave. Trimming with an electric razor set to a high setting is another alternative. Some people have success using over the counter chemical hair removers. These should be used with caution, as they can be very irritating and even lead to permanent discoloration of the skin. It may be beneficial to perform a test spot using a small amount of cream on a small area of skin to see how your skin reacts. Do not attempt to pluck hairs, as this increases the chances of the new hair regrowing into the skin. If you do wish to shave, it should be performed daily, and there are important steps to shave properly. Before shaving, wash your face with a gentle cleanser.

Then, apply a warm compress on the beard area for about 5 minutes. Next, apply a shaving cream and let it sit for a few minutes. When you begin shaving, shave with short strokes in the direction of the hair growth, avoid shaving over the same area multiple times, and do not stretch the skin while shaving. After you have finished shaving, rinse off your face and then apply a cool compress to the shaved areas followed by an aftershave. It is important to keep your blade in a cool, dry place and not to reuse the same blade more than 5 times. In some situations, hair removal with lasers may be appropriate and work by destroying the hair at its roots, preventing the hair from regrowing. These treatments should be discussed with and performed by a medical expert, such as a dermatologist, and can be costly if not covered by insurance. If you have performed these techniques and continue to experience PFB, please see a dermatologist.

There may be additional therapies, such as prescription creams and cleansers, that can provide symptom relief. A physician may also provide you with a medical letter should one be required to excuse you from shaving for work.

### Multifocal alopecia of the scalp, axillae, and body [^badf1af3]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Answers: 
A. Pseudopelade of Brocq – Incorrect. Pseudopelade of Brocq is a rare cicatricial alopecia presenting with discrete, asymmetric, and nonscaly patches of alopecia. No significant inflammation is seen on histopathology.
B. Frontal fibrosing alopecia – Incorrect. Frontal fibrosing alopecia, a variant of lichen planopilaris, is a form of cicatricial alopecia clinically characterized by band-like alopecia of the frontal scalp with associated eyebrow thinning.
C. Alopecia areata – Incorrect. Alopecia areata is a nonscarring alopecia with peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate on histopathology.
D. GLPLS – Correct. A variant of lichen planopilaris, GLPLS classically presents as a triad of multifocal cicatricial alopecia of the scalp, nonscarring alopecia of the axillae and/or groin and keratotic follicular papules of the trunk and extremities. Histologic findings can include a perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate with necrotic keratinocytes, perifollicular fibroplasia, and follicular dilatation with plugging.
E. DLE – Incorrect. DLE is a clinical and histologic mimicker of GLPLS. The presence of keratotic follicular papules and nonscarring alopecia on the trunk, lack of conchal bowl involvement, histopathologic findings, and negative antinuclear antibody all contributed to favoring a diagnosis of GLPLS over DLE in this case. While both GLPLS and DLE may show hyperkeratosis, follicular dilatation and plugging on histopathologic examination, basement membrane zone thickening and mucin deposition are features of DLE that were not seen in this case.

### Perceived aetiological factors of folliculitis keloidalis nuchae (acne keloidalis) and treatment options among Nigerian men [^a9425c1f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Folliculitis keloidalis nuchae (FKN) also known as acne keloidalis is the commonest form of scarring alopecia occurring in African males. It occurs mostly in individuals of African descent. Its prevalence ranges from 1·6% to 16·1%. FKN is multifactorial in origin: androgens, inflammation, trauma, ingrowing hairs and secondary infection have all been implicated in its aetiology. The reason for its occurrence in the occipital region is unclear although elevated androgens in the scalp have been suggested. The occurrence of huge keloidal-like scars in the affected area has earned the name 'Bumps' in this environment.

Objectives

To look at the community's perception of the aetiological factors for bumps and perceived management options available in our environment.

Methods

A community study was carried out among 1003 men residing in an urban community in Mokola, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge about aetiology, and prevalence of shaving bumps was obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire administered by trained interviewers. The chi-squared test was used to test the associations between presence of FKN and variables.

Results

The mean age of the respondents was 31·6 (SD = 8) years. When asked about the cause of shaving bumps, 420 (41·9%) felt it was due to infection from barber's instruments, followed by heredity (110, 11%), poor shaving technique (81, 8·1%), cuts from shaving (52, 5·2%) and inadequate after shaving care (39, 3·9%). The prevalence of shaving bumps was 2·7%. The most commonly reported symptom among those with shaving bumps was itching (71·1%). Other symptoms include pain (9·6%) and bleeding (1·2%). Most of the patients (70·8%) who had ever had shaving bumps practised self-medication. Medications applied included oral and topical antibiotics (20·3%), Neo-medrol (10·9%), engine oil (9·4%) and traditional leaves (9·4%).

Conclusions

About 50% of the responders believed FKN was an infective disorder. Although bleeding occurred while having a haircut, some individuals did not have their own personal shaving kits. Antibiotics, topical steroids, herbs and caustic substances were used for treatment. There is an urgent need to stimulate safer hair shaving practices and discourage the wrong treatment of FKN.

### The role of ingrown hairs in persistent kerion of children: a clinical study [^4bc6057f]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ingrown hairs, historically referred to as PFB or pseudofolliculitis of the beard, usually presents as straight, creeping, or U‐shaped ingrowing hairs beneath painful or itchy erythema papuloid skin.The development of ingrown hairs is associated with inflammation induced by the foreign body reaction in traumatic hair removal or the inflammation of hair follicles in cicatricial alopecia.The pathogenesis is multifactorial, encompassing the structural and property characteristics of hair follicles and hair, genetic susceptibility attributable to polymorphisms of Ala12Thr in KRT75 gene, and personal hygiene.As a result, the hair does not grow perpendicularly to the skin's surface as normal; instead, it grows beneath the skin or pierces through the epidermis, forming a “pseudofollicle structure” or “transfollicular penetration”.However, the role that acute inflammation or infections play in the development of ingrown hairs has not received corresponding attention.

The hair and nails with superficial fungal infections closely resemble the morphological abnormalities, including broken and rough hair shafts, as well as loosely attached and hypertrophic nails, in normally developing mice with mutations of Krt75, a member of the keratin family.Just as the role Krt75 plays in the pathogenesis of PFB, fungal infections may promote the formation of ingrown hairs through a similar mechanism, namely as rough and sharp ends close to the scalp and curly configurations of hairs.,These manifestations can be primarily evaluated using dermatoscopy: the former includes black spot signs, broken hairs, and cigarette‐shaped hair, while the latter includes comma, corkscrew, zigzag, and bent hairs.The nonspecific keratin structure destruction caused by keratinophilic fungi, explaining the hair morphological changes, has also been confirmed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy: disrupted and loosely packed ends in cigarette‐shaped hairs; bent hair shafts; asymmetrically disrupted cuticle layers; and the absence of the normal ratcheted appearance in corkscrew hairs.Taking into account the existence of these phenomena, ingrown hairs caused by keratin structural abnormalities may also exist in other types of tinea capitis rather than our definition of “persistent kerion,” with different degrees.

8.3 Management

Effective treatment requires strict avoidance of the causative agent and, if possible, finding alternatives. Emollients are key in maintaining skin barrier integrity and should be routinely used. If contact dermatitis does not respond to standard treatment, topical corticosteroids should be considered, but prolonged use should be avoided. Topical tacrolimus may be an effective alternative. Systemic corticosteroids should be reserved for short‐term use and avoided whenever possible.

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^564a1bf9]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the first step in the management of this patient’s condition? 
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin
D. Application of topical antibiotics
E. Referral to a dermatologist

Answers: 
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin – Correct. The first step in managing the patient's condition is to discontinue moxifloxacin. In cases of TEN, it is essential to discontinue the culprit drug immediately to prevent further progression of the condition. This step is crucial because continuation of the drug may exacerbate immune-mediated destruction of keratinocytes, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered, but they are not the initial step. The primary goal is to remove the trigger, which in this case is moxifloxacin, to stop the adverse reaction.
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin – Incorrect. Also, intravenous immunoglobulins and other immunomodulatory treatments may be considered, but the primary goal is to stop moxifloxacin.
D. Application of topical antibiotics – Incorrect. The application of topical antibiotics is not relevant to the systemic nature of the TEN and does not address the underlying cause.
E. Referral to a dermatologist – Incorrect. Referral to a dermatologist is important for complete treatment but should follow immediate discontinuation of the drug.

### Guidelines for the management of hidradenitis suppurativa: recommendations supported by the centre of evidence of the French society of dermatology [^5cd45a28]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

, Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a painful chronic inflammatory skin disease that impacts quality of life substantially. Its prevalence is estimated to be 0·7%. 1 Various pathophysiological hypotheses exist, but there is no therapeutic consensus, which complicates the management of patients with HS.

Therefore, the Centre of Evidence of the French Society of Dermatology initiated a standardized recommendation process for HS. A 13‐member working group (WG) was formed, comprising dermatologists (A.B. E.S. M.M.‐B. I.B.‐V. N.J. J.‐F.S.), a plastic surgeon (P.P.), an emergency physician (Y.Y.), an infectious diseases specialist (E.C.), a microbiologist (O.J.‐L.), a psychologist (K.C.), a general practitioner (S.S.) and a patient representative from an HS patient association. Members had no conflicts of interest and a strict methodology was followed. 2 Firstly, a systematic review of the literature was performed to compile references from study inception to September 2018. Assistance was provided by the French National Health Authority medical health librarian (supporting information available on request from the author). Eight physicians specializing in methodology then extracted data from each report (supporting information available on request from the author) and analysed the methodology and risk of bias using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation instrument for guidelines, the Assessing Methodological quality for Systematic Reviews tool for systematic reviews and the risk‐of‐bias tool for randomized controlled trials (Cochrane Collaboration). 3 Observational studies were retained if they included more than 20 patients. Senior experts were interviewed and their comments were incorporated into the manuscript. Finally, the draft recommendations were submitted to a multidisciplinary panel of 36 reviewers.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^bc9e3e52]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Resolution of penile PG has been reported with therapeutic colectomy in ulcerative colitis. Because the course of PG can be independent of the course of IBD and has even been reported years after proctocolectomy, bowel resection is not a primary therapy.

The prognosis is that of the associated disease. The control of the intestinal condition can resolve the skin problem and recurrences may occur at periods of exacerbation of IBD. In those patients who readily respond to treatment, the prognosis of the disease is good, but considerable scarring and disfigurement may eventually result.

Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans

Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans (PPV) is a benign and rare mucocutaneous dermatoses often associated with gastrointestinal disorders, especially with IBD. Some authors consider PPV in the spectrum of neutrophilic dermatoses, and others suggest that it is a form of PG.

There is a strong association of PPV with IBD, particularly with UC. Usually, the intestinal disease precedes the onset of oral lesions by months or years, but oral involvement in IBD could be previous or simultaneous to the gastrointestinal symptoms. The clinical course of oral lesions parallels the activity of IBD. There is general consensus that the bowel should be investigated in PPV, even if intestinal symptoms are absent at presentation [-].

Clinically, oral and cutaneous lesions are characteristic and distinctive (although any mucosal surface can be involved). Oral examination reveals multiple, non-painful, small yellowish pustules on an erythematous and edematous base; they rupture easily, producing an elongated superficial aspect, called ‘‘snail track’’ erosions. Cutaneous lesions are characterized by vesiculopustular, exudative, vegetating, annular plaques frequently affecting the scalp, axillae, and groins. Often, skin lesions of PD-PSV appear at the same time as or shortly after the oral disease [-].

### Quantifying the impact of uncertainty on threat management for biodiversity [^f097cc56]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Species’ response to management has high information value

The expected value of partial information (EVPXI) represents the improvement on the gain in persistence if only some components of uncertainty are resolved. We examined the impacts of resolving three components of uncertainty. Specifically, we examined the impact of resolving uncertainty about the effectiveness of threat management actions, the species response to management, and the species response if no management was implemented.

Removing uncertainty about the effectiveness of management actions to control a threat had very little EVPXI value (Fig. 6) because doing nothing always had zero effectiveness. Taking an action was always at least as good as doing nothing, so in the absence of other information, the best decision was always to manage (assuming the cost of management could be borne and that management was feasible). In other words, it is sufficient to know that managing is better than doing nothing—the knowledge about the exact management effectiveness had very low value. Importantly, this is not the same as suggesting that improving threat management has no value. The EVPXI measures the benefit of partially reducing uncertainty relative to a baseline of best management. Improvements in management effectiveness would improve the baseline, but reducing uncertainty about management effectiveness would not change the decision about whether or not to manage a threat. Our research does not address the future benefits of studies that could improve on the current best-practice management actions evaluated in our study. In addition, the low value of learning about the effectiveness of threat management actions is partly an artefact of our EVPI (and EVPXI) formulation, which considers only two actions: manage the threat or do nothing. If, instead of comparing managing relative to doing nothing, we compare managing either of two different threats, there may be greater value in knowing the relative effectiveness of each threat management strategy. The EVPI for any pair of threats can be computed—see the subsection ‘General case: two key threatening processes’ in the “Methods” section for the formulation.

### Treatment of pseudofolliculitis with a pulsed infrared laser (...) [^046e59a2]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Patients Ten consecutive patients with long-standing pseudofolliculitis barbae and skin phototypes I to IV. Interventions Treatment was performed using an 810-nm diode laser at fluences of 30 to 40 J/cm2. Three treatments were performed at 6- to 8-week intervals, and subjects underwent evaluation for improvement in the pseudofolliculitis and the degree of hair reduction. Conclusion Diode laser treatment is a safe and effective method for improving pseudofolliculitis barbae in patients with skin phototypes I to IV. Treatment modalities used for pseudofolliculitis barbae have been largely disappointing, and include topical tretinoin cream, corticosteroids, topical and oral antibiotics, surgical depilation, electrolysis, and tedious shaving regimens. 2, 7, 8 Pseudofolliculitis barbae will improve if the hairs are allowed to grow. When shaving is stopped, the ingrown hairs are released automatically by spring action within a 3- to 4-week period.

The only definitive cure for pseudofolliculitis barbae is permanent removal of the hair follicles. Surgical depilation carries a high morbidity. Electrolysis is a laborious procedure, and incomplete follicular destruction has resulted in keratin granulomas and pseudofolliculitis barbae. This study has demonstrated that treatment with the diode laser improves the acute and chronic changes of pseudofolliculitis barbae. All patients exhibited a decrease in the numbers of papules and pustules. Two of the patients who demonstrated more chronic changes, including long-standing hyperpigmentation and fibrotic papules, showed global improvement. Pseudofolliculitis is a common problem typically affecting men in the beard area and women in the axillary and inguinal regions. Traditional treatment options are limited and yield unsatisfactory results.

This report demonstrates that treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae with a pulsed diode laser results in dramatic clinical improvement in as few as 3 treatment sessions, with the induction of significant hair-growth delays. This is a practical therapeutic approach, enabling treatment of large body-surface areas quickly with minimal morbidity to the patient.

C.4 Infant feeding

R43 GPP Assess factors such as the woman’s EB subtype, social support structures, condition of wounds on breasts or hands, and pain management when supporting a woman in deciding how to feed her baby.

C.5 Support for breastfeeding and breast care

R44 ↑↑ 
Discuss breastfeeding and/or formula feeding options with the woman antenatally. Some women will have strong intention to breastfeed their newborn, while others may be concerned about possible nipple blistering. Breastfeeding among women with EB has been reported,,,,,,,,,although nipple blistering is common and may limit ongoing efforts.
Offer to assist with positioning of the baby and adequate latching on to the areola, which may reduce subsequent blistering. Well‐lubricated nipple shields may be useful,,,,and the support of a lactation consultant can be helpful.

C.6 Formula feeding and mixed feeding

R45 ↑↑ Plan support for women with pseudosyndactyly who may need assistance with the preparation of formula. If formula feeding or mixed feeding is chosen, management of infant formula should be included in the postnatal care plan.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis and management of classic lichen planopilaris [^62d55117]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lichen planopilaris is a primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia that commonly presents with hair loss at the vertex or parietal scalp. Patients may also have associated scalp itching, burning or tenderness. Due to scarring, hair loss is typically permanent. The main goals of treatment are reducing symptoms and preventing disease progression and further hair loss. Currently, the literature has limited evidence on treatments for this difficult condition, and most available evidence is from case reports and case series. Furthermore, the evidence shows a varied response to therapy, with frequent reports of poor response. This article reviews the diagnosis of this rare disease, summarize the currently available treatments, and provide insights and practices from alopecia experts.

### Interventions for bacterial folliculitis and boils (furuncles and carbuncles) [^d42be534]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial folliculitis and boils are globally prevalent bacterial infections involving inflammation of the hair follicle and the perifollicular tissue. Some folliculitis may resolve spontaneously, but others may progress to boils without treatment. Boils, also known as furuncles, involve adjacent tissue and may progress to cellulitis or lymphadenitis. A systematic review of the best evidence on the available treatments was needed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (such as topical antibiotics, topical antiseptic agents, systemic antibiotics, phototherapy, and incision and drainage) for people with bacterial folliculitis and boils.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2020: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched five trials registers up to June 2020. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further relevant trials.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic antibiotics; topical antibiotics; topical antiseptics, such as topical benzoyl peroxide; phototherapy; and surgical interventions in participants with bacterial folliculitis or boils. Eligible comparators were active intervention, placebo, or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'clinical cure' and 'severe adverse events leading to withdrawal of treatment'; secondary outcomes were 'quality of life', 'recurrence of folliculitis or boil following completion of treatment', and 'minor adverse events not leading to withdrawal of treatment'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs (1300 participants). The studies included more males (332) than females (221), although not all studies reported these data. Seventeen trials were conducted in hospitals, and one was conducted in clinics. The participants included both children and adults (0 to 99 years). The studies did not describe severity in detail; of the 232 participants with folliculitis, 36% were chronic. At least 61% of participants had furuncles or boils, of which at least 47% were incised. Duration of oral and topical treatments ranged from 3 days to 6 weeks, with duration of follow-up ranging from 3 days to 6 months. The study sites included Asia, Europe, and America. Only three trials reported funding, with two funded by industry. Ten studies were at high risk of 'performance bias', five at high risk of 'reporting bias', and three at high risk of 'detection bias'. We did not identify any RCTs comparing topical antibiotics against topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics against systemic antibiotics, or phototherapy against sham light. Eleven trials compared different oral antibiotics. We are uncertain as to whether cefadroxil compared to flucloxacillin (17/21 versus 18/20, risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.16; 41 participants; 1 study; 10 days of treatment) or azithromycin compared to cefaclor (8/15 versus 10/16, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; 31 participants; 2 studies; 7 days of treatment) differed in clinical cure (both very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in clinical cure rate between cefdinir and cefalexin after 17 to 24 days (25/32 versus 32/42, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.38; 74 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), and there probably is little to no difference in clinical cure rate between cefditoren pivoxil and cefaclor after 7 days (24/46 versus 21/47, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.78; 93 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). For risk of severe adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal, there may be little to no difference between cefdinir versus cefalexin after 17 to 24 days (1/191 versus 1/200, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.62; 391 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). There may be an increased risk with cefadroxil compared with flucloxacillin after 10 days (6/327 versus 2/324, RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.60 to 14.62; 651 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) and cefditoren pivoxil compared with cefaclor after 7 days (2/77 versus 0/73, RR 4.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 97.17; 150 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). However, for these three comparisons the 95% CI is very wide and includes the possibility of both increased and reduced risk of events. We are uncertain whether azithromycin affects the risk of severe adverse events leading to withdrawal of treatment compared to cefaclor (274 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence) as no events occurred in either group after seven days. For risk of minor adverse events, there is probably little to no difference between the following comparisons: cefadroxil versus flucloxacillin after 10 days (91/327 versus 116/324, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98; 651 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) or cefditoren pivoxil versus cefaclor after 7 days (8/77 versus 5/73, RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.52 to 4.42; 150 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of azithromycin versus cefaclor after seven days due to very low-certainty evidence (7/148 versus 4/126, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.17; 274 participants; 2 studies). The study comparing cefdinir versus cefalexin did not report data for total minor adverse events, but both groups experienced diarrhoea, nausea, and vaginal mycosis during 17 to 24 days of treatment. Additional adverse events reported in the other included studies were vomiting, rashes, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as stomach ache, with some events leading to study withdrawal. Three included studies assessed recurrence following completion of treatment, none of which evaluated our key comparisons, and no studies assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCTs regarding the efficacy and safety of topical antibiotics versus antiseptics, topical versus systemic antibiotics, or phototherapy versus sham light for treating bacterial folliculitis or boils. Comparative trials have not identified important differences in efficacy or safety outcomes between different oral antibiotics for treating bacterial folliculitis or boils. Most of the included studies assessed participants with skin and soft tissue infection which included many disease types, whilst others focused specifically on folliculitis or boils. Antibiotic sensitivity data for causative organisms were often not reported. Future trials should incorporate culture and sensitivity information and consider comparing topical antibiotic with antiseptic, and topical versus systemic antibiotics or phototherapy.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^dda30f64]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Pilonidal disease—nonoperative hair removal states that elimination of hair from the gluteal cleft and surrounding skin, by shaving or laser epilation, may be used for both acute and chronic pilonidal disease in the absence of abscess as a primary or adjunct treatment measure, with the stated Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Shaving or laser epilation can serve as an adjunct treatment in active disease, as the sole agent of therapy, or as a preventative tool in the setting of chronic disease to avoid recurrent flares and abscess formation. In acute pilonidal disease, limited lateral incision and drainage (I&D) or cyst excision combined with surgeon-performed shaving along the intergluteal fold and surrounding region promotes healing and prevents disease recurrence, and shaving should be repeated every 1 to 2 weeks until healing occurs and used in combination with hygiene enforcement.

Abstract

Medicine's clinical understanding of reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption (RIME) has evolved over time. It was previously described as Mycoplasma pneumoniae ‐induced rash and mucositis (MIRM), and before that as a variant of Stevens‐Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. Here, we summarize the current understanding of best practices for RIME diagnosis and management.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^4ba1a0ac]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Combination erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide—prescribing information indicates topical treatment of acne vulgaris with dosing applied twice daily, morning and evening, after the skin is thoroughly washed, rinsed with warm water, and gently patted dry. Contraindications include individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any components of formulation, and concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. Efficacy is noted as in 2 controlled clinical studies, the combination applied twice daily for 8 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle. Reported adverse effects/toxicities include pseudomembranous colitis, dryness, urticarial reaction, peeling, itching, burning sensation, erythema, inflammation of the face/eyes/nose, skin discoloration, oiliness, and tenderness of skin. Other issues state a cumulative irritant or drying effect; use with caution. Pregnancy category C, with nursing guidance that caution if used in nursing women and it is not known whether erythromycin or benzoyl peroxide is distributed into milk after topical application. Pediatric use states safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients <12 years of age.

### Neoplastic / paraneoplastic dermatitis, fasciitis, and panniculitis [^60e678b3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The skin changes outlined in this article can be important clues to an underlying malignancy. Paraneoplastic dermatoses are skin disorders associated with an underlying neoplasm and whose course parallels that of the neoplasm. Recognizing these skin presentations leads to early diagnosis and management of the underlying malignancy. Effective treatment of the associated neoplasm often leads to improvement of the cutaneous manifestations and should be the primary focus of each patient's management.
