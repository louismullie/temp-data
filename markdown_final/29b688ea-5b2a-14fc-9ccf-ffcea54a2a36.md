## Question

What are the most common causes of elevated WBC and monocyte counts in patients presenting with symptoms of dizziness and shakiness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common causes of elevated WBC and monocyte counts in patients presenting with dizziness and shakiness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of leukocytosis and monocytosis and how to distinguish reactive from clonal causes. Then, I should verify which entities most plausibly link both hematologic abnormalities with dizziness and shakiness. Next, I will prioritize the differential by prevalence and mechanism, and finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach and highlight red flags that warrant urgent hematology referral.

> Let me first confirm the hematologic definitions and thresholds, because I need to ensure we are speaking precisely. Leukocytosis is typically defined as a WBC count above the laboratory upper limit of normal, often around 11 × 10⁹/L, though age- and pregnancy-specific ranges matter, and monocytosis is generally defined as an absolute monocyte count ≥ 1.0 × 10⁹/L or a relative monocyte proportion ≥ 10% of WBCs, with newer classifications recognizing oligomonocytic CMML at 0.5–0.9 × 10⁹/L when other criteria are met [^114QKP5w] [^116uZG5D] [^116MZTkX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should distinguish reactive from clonal monocytosis. Reactive monocytosis is common and often reflects chronic infection, autoimmune inflammation, stress or recovery from marrow injury, whereas clonal monocytosis suggests a myeloid neoplasm such as CMML or other chronic myeloid disorders; persistent monocytosis for at least 3 months, cytopenias, dysplasia, or clonal mutations push toward CMML rather than a purely reactive process [^115jwtrh] [^116KHFLR] [^116uZG5D].

> Next, I should review which conditions plausibly produce both leukocytosis and monocytosis alongside dizziness and shakiness. Let me consider infections first. COVID-19 frequently shows leukocytosis with relative monocytosis and can present with dizziness and systemic symptoms; similarly, human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis can cause leukopenia early but later recovery with monocytosis and neurologic symptoms including dizziness, so timing and geography matter [^115eAFje] [^113PNcEB] [^116gPsfC].

> I will now examine inflammatory and autoimmune etiologies. Systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases can drive a reactive monocytosis and, when neuropsychiatric, may present with dizziness and tremor or shakiness; I should confirm this with inflammatory markers and targeted serologies if suspected, keeping in mind that monocytosis in SLE is a recognized reactive pattern [^116KHFLR] [^113D73zb].

> But wait, what if the monocytosis is clonal rather than reactive. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is the prototypical myeloid neoplasm defined by persistent monocytosis and frequently leukocytosis; patients may have constitutional symptoms and, less commonly, neurologic complaints, and dizziness could reflect anemia, cytokine-mediated symptoms, or even hyperviscosity in high tumor burden states, so I should keep CMML high on the list when monocytosis is sustained and unexplained [^116uZG5D] [^1149eADQ] [^114ABQWg].

> Let me consider medication effects, because I need to check for iatrogenic contributors. Colony-stimulating factors like sargramostim can cause extreme leukocytosis, and corticosteroids can acutely elevate WBC counts within 24–48 hours; if dizziness and shakiness coincide with recent steroid initiation, a steroid-induced leukocytosis with relative monocytosis is plausible, though I should confirm the timing and dose before attributing causality [^112HctEt] [^116bSyJr].

> I should double-check lifestyle and demographic factors. Tobacco smoking is a common cause of mild leukocytosis and can include monocytosis; cessation leads to measurable reductions in WBC over weeks to months, so a careful smoking history can prevent unnecessary workups in otherwise well patients with mild, stable counts [^116j9cgV].

> Now, prioritizing the differential, I need to ensure I align prevalence with the clinical context. In patients with dizziness and shakiness plus leukocytosis and monocytosis, the most common causes are reactive monocytosis from viral or bacterial infections such as COVID-19 or ehrlichiosis, autoimmune inflammatory states like SLE, medication-induced leukocytosis particularly from corticosteroids, and smoking-related leukocytosis; clonal causes such as CMML are less common but become more likely when monocytosis is persistent, accompanied by cytopenias, dysplasia, or clonal mutations [^115eAFje] [^113PNcEB] [^116KHFLR] [^116bSyJr] [^116j9cgV] [^116uZG5D].

> Let me outline a practical diagnostic approach, and I should confirm each step against guidelines. First, verify the CBC with differential and a peripheral smear to distinguish reactive from clonal morphology and to look for dysplasia or blasts; second, assess for infection with targeted testing guided by symptoms and exposure risks, including COVID-19 and tick-borne diseases; third, evaluate for autoimmune disease with ESR, CRP, ANA, and organ-specific serologies if indicated; fourth, review medications meticulously for steroids, growth factors, or other offenders; fifth, if monocytosis persists beyond 3 months or is accompanied by cytopenias or dysplasia, pursue bone marrow evaluation and molecular testing to evaluate for CMML or related myeloid neoplasms [^114QKP5w] [^111xbocB] [^116uZG5D] [^1149eADQ].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent hematology referral. Persistent absolute monocytosis ≥ 1.0 × 10⁹/L for at least 3 months, concurrent cytopenias, blasts on smear, dysplastic morphology, or B symptoms raise concern for CMML or other myeloid malignancy and should prompt hematology input and marrow studies; likewise, extreme leukocytosis, hyperviscosity symptoms, or neurologic deficits with abnormal counts warrant expedited evaluation [^116uZG5D] [^1149eADQ] [^114ABQWg].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis remains clinically grounded. In patients with dizziness and shakiness who have elevated WBC and monocyte counts, the most common explanations are reactive monocytosis from infection or autoimmunity, medication-induced leukocytosis particularly corticosteroids, and smoking-related leukocytosis, with CMML and other clonal myeloid neoplasms as important but less frequent considerations when monocytosis is persistent or accompanied by dysplasia or cytopenias; a structured evaluation anchored by smear review, infection and autoimmune screening, medication reconciliation, and selective marrow testing resolves most cases and prevents missed malignancy [^115eAFje] [^116KHFLR] [^116bSyJr] [^116j9cgV] [^116uZG5D].

The most common causes of elevated WBC and monocyte counts with dizziness and shakiness are **reactive monocytosis** from chronic infections (tuberculosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, HIV, COVID-19) [^116KHFLR] [^115eAFje], **autoimmune/inflammatory diseases** (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis) [^113D73zb], and **hematologic malignancies** (CMML, CML, AML) [^115jwtrh] [^115tW3UQ]. Dizziness and shakiness reflect systemic inflammation, cytokine release, or CNS involvement [^1121dN4i] [^113n6xUg]. Evaluate with CBC/differential, peripheral smear, infection screening, autoimmune serologies, and consider bone marrow if monocytosis persists or blasts are present [^114QKP5w] [^111xbocB].

---

## Infectious causes

Several **chronic infections** can cause leukocytosis and monocytosis, with systemic symptoms such as dizziness and shakiness:

- **Tuberculosis**: Chronic infection causing monocytosis and systemic symptoms, including dizziness and fatigue [^116KHFLR].

- **Subacute bacterial endocarditis**: Persistent infection leading to monocytosis and systemic symptoms, including dizziness and shakiness [^116KHFLR].

- **HIV infection**: Chronic viral infection causing monocytosis and systemic symptoms, including neurological manifestations [^notfound].

- **COVID-19**: Associated with leukocytosis and monocytosis, and neurological symptoms such as dizziness and fatigue [^115eAFje] [^1159rrHY].

---

## Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions

Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases can cause **reactive monocytosis** and systemic symptoms:

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Autoimmune disease causing monocytosis and neurological symptoms, including dizziness and tremors [^113D73zb] [^114iXAMi].

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Chronic inflammatory disease associated with monocytosis and systemic symptoms, including dizziness and fatigue [^113D73zb].

- **Sarcoidosis**: Granulomatous disease causing monocytosis and systemic symptoms, including neurological manifestations [^113D73zb].

---

## Hematologic malignancies

Certain **hematologic malignancies** present with leukocytosis, monocytosis, and systemic symptoms:

- **Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)**: Myeloid neoplasm characterized by persistent monocytosis and systemic symptoms, including fatigue, dizziness, and weight loss [^116uZG5D] [^1149eADQ].

- **Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)**: Myeloproliferative disorder causing leukocytosis and monocytosis, with systemic symptoms including fatigue and dizziness [^115tW3UQ].

- **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)**: Rapidly progressive malignancy causing leukocytosis and monocytosis, with systemic symptoms including dizziness, fatigue, and neurological manifestations [^notfound].

---

## Mechanisms linking elevated WBC and monocyte counts to dizziness and shakiness

The association between elevated WBC and monocyte counts and symptoms such as dizziness and shakiness can be explained by several **mechanisms**:

- **Cytokine release syndrome**: Elevated cytokine levels (e.g. IL-6, TNF-alpha) cause systemic inflammation, leading to dizziness, fatigue, and tremors [^1121dN4i].

- **Hyperviscosity syndrome**: Elevated leukocyte counts increase blood viscosity, impairing cerebral perfusion and causing dizziness and neurological symptoms [^114ABQWg].

- **Direct neurological involvement**: Certain infections and malignancies can directly affect the central nervous system, causing dizziness and neurological symptoms [^113n6xUg].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic diagnostic approach is essential to identify the **underlying cause**:

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Confirms leukocytosis and monocytosis and provides initial clues to etiology [^114QKP5w].

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Assesses cell morphology, identifies abnormal cells, and distinguishes reactive from clonal processes [^111xbocB].

- **Infection screening**: Tuberculosis testing, HIV testing, COVID-19 testing, and blood cultures to identify infectious etiologies [^notfound].

- **Autoimmune serologies**: ANA, rheumatoid factor, and other autoimmune markers to identify autoimmune diseases [^notfound].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if hematologic malignancy is suspected or if monocytosis persists without identifiable reactive cause [^115WGPTw].

---

## Conclusion

Elevated WBC and monocyte counts with dizziness and shakiness most commonly reflect **reactive monocytosis** from chronic infections, autoimmune/inflammatory disease, or hematologic malignancies such as CMML, CML, or AML. A structured evaluation — CBC with differential, smear, infection and autoimmune testing, and selective marrow studies — is essential to distinguish reactive from clonal causes and guide management.

Discussion and conclusion

The results of the EUROPE multicenter phase 2 trial confirm and strengthen reported data of earlier studies showing clinical efficacy of single agent ROM in a large subset of patients with LR-MDS. However, we could not validate the predictive value of baseline endogenous TPO levels and platelet transfusion history for consecutive platelet response. In fact, the study did not meet its primary endpoint (HI-P cohort A: 47%, cohort B: 31% (p = 0.295)). Therefore, both variables should not be used in clinical practice to select potential patients benefitting from this treatment.

The median duration of HI-P response of 340 days in the whole cohort is very encouraging and the safety profile in the EUROPE study was similar to previous studies investigating ROM in myeloid diseases with the most frequent treatment-related adverse events representing headache and dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia as well as gastrointestinal disturbances. We relied on a central morphology at inclusion and during monitoring of patients which we believe is important for the clinical use of ROM in these patients, to optimally monitor potential hematological side effects like leukocytosis and/or monocytosis seen in 13% of our patients. Although an earlier study had highlighted the potential risk of ROM in accelerating development of AML or an increase of peripheral/ bone marrow blasts in MDS patients, our study confirms recently reported long-term follow-up data from a randomized controlled trial that showed no increased rate of leukemic progression during ROM treatment.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Drowsiness, dizziness, amenorrhea, blurred vision, skin reactions and hypotension may occur.

Cholestatic jaundice has occurred. If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs, appropriate liver studies should be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality, stop treatment. There have been a few observations of fatty changes in the livers of patients who have died while receiving the drug. No causal relationship has been established.

Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have occurred. Warn patients to report the sudden appearance of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential counts indicate leukocyte depression, stop treatment and start antibiotic and other suitable therapy.

Neuromuscular (Extrapyramidal) Reactions

These symptoms are seen in a significant number of hospitalized mental patients. They may be characterized by motor restlessness, be of the dystonic type, or they may resemble parkinsonism.

Depending on the severity of symptoms, dosage should be reduced or discontinued. If therapy is reinstituted, it should be at a lower dosage. Should these symptoms occur in children or pregnant patients, the drug should be stopped and not reinstituted. In most cases barbiturates by suitable route of administration will suffice. (Or, injectable diphenhydramine may be useful.) In more severe cases, the administration of an anti-parkinsonism agent, except levodopa (see PDR), usually produces rapid reversal of symptoms. Suitable supportive measures such as maintaining a clear airway and adequate hydration should be employed.

Motor Restlessness:

Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided.

If these symptoms become too troublesome, they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti-parkinsonian agents, benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful.

Dystonia:

Class effect:

Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

### Plerixafor [^1135aS5u]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the randomized studies, 34% of patients with NHL or MM had mild to moderate injection site reactions at the site of subcutaneous administration of plerixafor. These included erythema, hematoma, hemorrhage, induration, inflammation, irritation, pain, paresthesia, pruritus, rash, swelling, and urticaria.

Mild to moderate allergic reactions were observed in less than 1% of patients within approximately 30 min after plerixafor administration, including one or more of the following: urticaria (n = 2), periorbital swelling (n = 2), dyspnea (n = 1) or hypoxia (n = 1). Symptoms generally responded to treatments (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, hydration or supplemental oxygen) or resolved spontaneously.

Vasovagal reactions, orthostatic hypotension, and/or syncope can occur following subcutaneous injections. In plerixafor oncology and healthy volunteer clinical studies, less than 1% of subjects experienced vasovagal reactions following subcutaneous administration of plerixafor doses ≤ 0.24 mg/kg. The majority of these events occurred within 1 hour of plerixafor administration. Because of the potential for these reactions, appropriate precautions should be taken.

Other adverse reactions in the randomized studies that occurred in < 5% of patients but were reported as related to plerixafor during HSC mobilization and apheresis included abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis, abdominal distention, dry mouth, erythema, stomach discomfort, malaise, hypoesthesia oral, constipation, dyspepsia, and musculoskeletal pain.

Hyperleukocytosis: In clinical trials, white blood cell counts of 100,000/mcL or greater were observed, on the day prior to or any day of apheresis, in 7% of patients receiving plerixafor and in 1% of patients receiving placebo. No complications or clinical symptoms of leukostasis were observed.

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with plerixafor. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Blood and Lymphatic System: Splenomegaly and splenic rupture

Immune System Disorders: Anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock

Psychiatric Disorders: Abnormal dreams and nightmares

### Risperidone (Perseris) [^111WigJZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Risperidone may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope, particularly at the time of initiating treatment, re-initiating treatment, or increasing the dose, probably reflecting its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties.

PERSERIS should be used with particular caution in (1) patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia, and (2) in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in all such patients, and a dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. Clinically significant hypotension has been observed with concomitant use of oral risperidone and antihypertensive medication.

5.8 Falls

Somnolence, postural hypotension, motor instability, and sensory instability have been reported with the use of antipsychotics, including PERSERIS, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. For patients, particularly the elderly, with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, assess the risk of falls when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including risperidone. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing history of a clinically significant low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of PERSERIS at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue PERSERIS in patients with absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3and follow their WBC until recovery.

### Plerixafor (Mozobil) [^114C7mnY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the randomized studies, 34% of patients with NHL or MM had mild to moderate injection site reactions at the site of subcutaneous administration of Mozobil. These included erythema, hematoma, hemorrhage, induration, inflammation, irritation, pain, paresthesia, pruritus, rash, swelling, and urticaria.

Mild to moderate allergic reactions were observed in less than 1% of patients within approximately 30 min after Mozobil administration, including one or more of the following: urticaria (n = 2), periorbital swelling (n = 2), dyspnea (n = 1) or hypoxia (n = 1). Symptoms generally responded to treatments (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, hydration or supplemental oxygen) or resolved spontaneously.

Vasovagal reactions, orthostatic hypotension, and/or syncope can occur following subcutaneous injections. In Mozobil oncology and healthy volunteer clinical studies, less than 1% of subjects experienced vasovagal reactions following subcutaneous administration of Mozobil doses ≤ 0.24 mg/kg. The majority of these events occurred within 1 hour of Mozobil administration. Because of the potential for these reactions, appropriate precautions should be taken.

Other adverse reactions in the randomized studies that occurred in < 5% of patients but were reported as related to Mozobil during HSC mobilization and apheresis included abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis, abdominal distention, dry mouth, erythema, stomach discomfort, malaise, hypoesthesia oral, constipation, dyspepsia, and musculoskeletal pain.

Hyperleukocytosis: In clinical trials, white blood cell counts of 100,000/mcL or greater were observed, on the day prior to or any day of apheresis, in 7% of patients receiving Mozobil and in 1% of patients receiving placebo. No complications or clinical symptoms of leukostasis were observed.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been reported from postmarketing experience with Mozobil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Exacerbation of mycosis fungoides leading to the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [^112fbyQH]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Differential blood count showed a leukocytosis (36,000/μL) with monocytosis (11.000/μL), a microcytic and hypochromic anemia, thrombopenia (88.000/μL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (793 U/L) and C-reactive protein (8.8 mg/dL). Repeated bone marrow biopsies and smears found a myelomonocytic infiltrate expressing CD33, lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase compatible with CMML.

Further workup, including abdominal and lymph node ultrasound scan, showed splenomegaly of 13.8 cm and palpable axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathies. We initiated an antibiotic treatment and high-dose oral corticosteroids (1 mg/kg). This finding led to a transient regression of erythematous lesions, relapsing on corticosteroid dose tapering to less than 0.5 mg/kg. Treatment with low-dose methotrexate (15 mg weekly) had to be stopped after 1 injection because of dyspnea, vertigo, and radiologic signs of pneumonitis.

Monocytosis persisted over more than 6 months, and repeat bone marrow biopsies found blast infiltrates of up to 20%. The diagnosis of CMML was made, and an association to the exacerbation of MF had to be assumed. Consequently, a treatment with hydroxicarbamide, 500 mg/d, was started. Owing to lack of response, the treatment was changed to azacitidine, 75 mg/m 2. The patient responded well to the treatment with improvement of skin manifestations and pruritus (Fig 3). However, pruriginous erythematous patches and plaques remained, and a parallel treatment with bexarotene, 300 mg/m 2, was initiated.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms

The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of diseases in which there is an increased proliferation of one or more subtypes of myeloid cells. Those associated with stroke are polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The Janus kinase JAK2 exon 14 V617F mutation is present in more than 95% of patients with PV and in approximately 50% of those with ET. Other mutually exclusive driver mutations are found in the genes MPL, CALR, and JAK2 exon 12. The incidence of MPN increases exponentially after the age of 60. MPN are chronic diseases with years of survival, estimated at 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET.

Thrombotic complications are frequent in MPN. A recent large study found that the 5-year risk of vascular disease ranged from 0.5 to 7.7% in patients with MPNs, with adjusted HRs which were 1.3–3.7-fold higher than in the general population Stroke can be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying MPN. In the National Inpatient Sample, a total of 552,422 hospitalizations involved patients with a diagnosis of ET, 20,650 of which were due to stroke (0.04%). Clinical hints suggesting MPN as the cause of stroke are multiple or recurrent territorial infarcts, often with large vessel occlusion. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the context of MPN are usually multiple and may be typical or atypical (isolated dysarthria, diplopia or unsteadiness, hearing loss, transient focal deficits with prominent headache, and very brief or sequential deficits). Erythromelalgia (a burning or painful sensation of the fingers, palms, and sometimes also of the toes and soles accompanied by a red-cyanotic skin discoloration of the affected areas) and splenomegaly are suggestive systemic findings. World Health Organization 2016 diagnostic laboratory criteria for PV require sustained (> 1 month) increased hemoglobin or hematocrit values (hemoglobin > 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women; hematocrit > 49% in men, > 48% in women) with subnormal erythropoietin levels and the absence of a secondary cause of erythrocytosis. ET sustained high platelet counts (> 450,000/µL) (> 1 month) in the absence of a secondary cause of thrombocytosis. The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in the majority of stroke patients. In half of the patients, there is an additional stroke risk factor, such as atherosclerosis, dissection, or atrial fibrillation. Female gender, atrial fibrillation, stroke, higher comorbidity score, and age 80 or more are independent predictors of mortality in stroke associated with ET.

Patient B

A 52-year-old Caucasian female was wheelchair dependent at initial diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection and HAM. She had recurrent HTLV-associated uveitis and a 40 pack-year smoking history. Six years after initial diagnosis, she enrolled in a clinical trial of infliximab, however, after two doses, developed a petechial rash and severe headache so was withdrawn from the trial. The headache and rash resolved over 2 months. She then developed Haemophilus influenzae pneumonia, treated with three courses of oral antibiotics over a month.

Five months after infliximab withdrawal, her mobility deteriorated and she could no longer transfer independently. MRI brain and cervical spine revealed cervical spondylosis but nil else of note. Eight months following infliximab withdrawal, an outpatient course of 3-day pulsed IV methylprednisolone led to a marked improvement — she could again transfer independently and straight leg raise bilaterally. The improvement was short-lived. After 1 month, she developed worsening headaches.

Ten months after infliximab cessation, she developed partial left sixth and third nerve palsies with anisocoria and blurred vision. In the upper limbs, there was bilateral intention tremor and left dysdiadochokinesis. In the lower limbs, she had longstanding spasticity, but now had only a flicker of movement. She was apyrexial, haemodynamically stable and oriented.

Repeat MRI showed several new scattered focal T2-weighted lesions mainly in the peripheral white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, most numerous in the frontal lobes. Compared to imaging 5 months previously, there was new diffuse signal change in the brainstem, particularly the dorsal pons and medulla oblongata, as well as the adjacent middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, and cervical cord (Fig. 1 a, b). The upper cervical cord was oedematous (Fig. 1 d). The imaging findings were not in keeping with demyelinating disease. LP revealed normal opening pressure and 20 monocytes/mm 3 CSF. Protein was slightly elevated at 0.67 g/L. Normal/negative investigation results are summarised in the supplementary online table. During this episode, HTLV-1 CSF proviral load was 120 per 100 CSF cells (120%), in contrast to 17.9% in PBMCs (Fig. 4 a). She remained cardiovascularly stable throughout admission and blood cultures were sterile. Haemophilus influenzae, present on sputum culture, was treated with oral co-amoxiclav.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^115jwtrh]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Monocytes are part of the myeloid lineage that expands with age and represent key players in inflammatory and immune reactions. Normal monocyte values range between 0.3 and 0.9 × 10 9 /L, constituting 2% to 8% of the total white blood cell (WBC) population in peripheral blood (PB). Abnormal production and accumulation of monocytes may occur in numerous conditions. Monocytosis may be explained by inflammatory conditions ("reactive monocytosis"), as present in acute stress, myocardial infarction, chronic infection, systemic inflammation, and autoimmune disorders. Besides secondary causes, PB monocytosis is the defining phenotypic hallmark of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a chronic myeloid neoplasm with both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features that occurs almost exclusively in older individuals. In addition, monocytosis may accompany other myeloid malignancies. Current World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for CMML define monocytosis as a persistent (≥ 3 months) increase in PB monocyte counts ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L in combination with a relative excess of monocytes comprising ≥ 10% of the WBC count that cannot be explained by secondary causes. Driver gene mutations are detected in the majority of patients with CMML and most frequently involve SRSF2, TET2, and ASXL1 genes, although none of these are CMML-specific. In current WHO criteria, clonal genetic lesions in the presence of unexplained, persistent monocytosis can support a diagnosis of CMML, even in the absence of typical myelodysplastic and/or myeloproliferative features.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^114QKP5w]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

At 15 years old, she developed eyelid edema 3 days after respiratory infection and edema of both lower limbs 1 month later. She did not seek medical advice until 9 months later when she developed gaze palsy, salivation, and loss of consciousness for 3 min. After regaining consciousness, she developed headache, dizziness, abnormal gait, and blurred vision and then was admitted by a local hospital. Neurological examinations revealed drunk gait, limited range of abduction of the right eye, and abnormal heel-to-shin test. Laboratory examinations showed leukopenia (3.1 × 10 9 /L), neutropenia (0.9 × 10 9 /L), proteinuria (3 +, 24- h urine protein 2.4 g), hypocomplementemia (C3 0.496 g/L, C4 0.035 g/L), and positive autoantibodies [ANA(+)H1:1000, anti-dsDNA and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies(+), ACL(+)]. Her IgM was slightly lower than normal (0.376 g/L), while her hemoglobin, platelets, lymphocyte subset counts, thyroid function, and electrolyte were normal. Chest CT showed a few small patchy opacities in the right lower lobe, indicating inflammation (Fig. 1a). Video EEG suggested background asymmetry with slow wave activity in the right occipital area. Head MRI showed multiple abnormal signals in the pons, cerebellum, and medulla, indicating inflammatory lesions (Fig. 1b, c). Head MRA and MRV were normal, and cerebral thrombosis was discarded. A lumbar puncture was performed during the acute phase, and the pressure was measured about 100 drops/min. The cerebrospinal fluid examination disclosed a mild CSF pleocytosis (39 cells/uL, 2.6% neutrophils, 97.4% monocytes) with normal glucose, protein, and chloride. Microbial PCR, cultures, and autoimmune panel results were all negative. But she did not perform a renal biopsy. She was diagnosed as SLE with involvement of hematological, renal, and neuropsychiatric systems. She received intravenous methylprednisolone 0.5 g for 3 days for 2 rounds followed by prednisone 60 mg QD and cyclophosphamide (CTX) 1 g every 3 weeks. Most lab data turned normal except her leukocytopenia and ANA status. The prednisone was tapered accordingly, and the CTX was switched to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) after 9 rounds of treatment. Unfortunately, at 16 years old, she developed pain and lameness of lower extremities, and her hip MRI indicated osteonecrosis of the bilateral femoral head, which was considered as side effects of long-term use of corticosteroids.

5.8 Falls

SAPHRIS may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

5.000000000000000e+00 9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including SAPHRIS. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of SAPHRIS at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue SAPHRIS in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3) and follow their WBC until recovery.

### Trazodone hydrochoride (trazodone hydrochloride) [^116f1YVJ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

Because priapism has been reported to occur in patients receiving trazodone HCl, patients with prolonged or inappropriate penile erection should immediately discontinue the drug and consult with the physician (see WARNINGS).

Antidepressants may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an automobile or machinery; the patient should be cautioned accordingly.

Trazodone HCl may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.

Trazodone HCl should be given shortly after a meal or light snack. Within any individual patient, total drug absorption may be up to 20% higher when the drug is taken with food rather than on an empty stomach. The risk of dizziness/lightheadedness may increase under fasting conditions.

Laboratory Tests

Occasional low white blood cell and neutrophil counts have been noted in patients receiving trazodone HCl. These were not considered clinically significant and did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug; however, the drug should be discontinued in any patient whose white blood cell count or absolute neutrophil count falls below normal levels. White blood cell and differential counts are recommended for patients who develop fever and sore throat (or other signs of infection) during therapy.

### Trifluoperazine [^115hCn6c]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia;
anti-parkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. If
clinically feasible, it is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be
discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute
treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different
antipsychotic agent, the syndrome may be masked.

It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an
early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that time the
syndrome may not develop.

Adverse effects with different phenothiazines vary in type,
frequency, and mechanism of occurrence, i.e., some are dose-related, while
others involve individual patient sensitivity. Some adverse effects may be more
likely to occur, or occur with greater intensity, in patients with special
medical problems, e.g., patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma
have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses of certain
phenothiazines.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with
antipsychotic drugs. (See WARNINGS .)

Not all of the following adverse reactions have been observed with every
phenothiazine derivative, but they have been reported with one or more and
should be borne in mind when drugs of this class are administered:
extrapyramidal symptoms (opisthotonos, oculogyric crisis, hyperreflexia,
dystonia, akathisia, dyskinesia, parkinsonism) some of which have lasted months
and even years – particularly in elderly patients with previous brain damage;
grand mal and petit mal convulsions, particularly in patients with EEG
abnormalities or history of such disorders; altered cerebrospinal fluid
proteins; cerebral edema; intensification and prolongation of the action of
central nervous system depressants (opiates, analgesics, antihistamines.
barbiturates, alcohol), atropine, heat, organophosphorus insecticides; autonomic
reactions (dryness of mouth, nasal congestion, headache, nausea, constipation.
obstipation, adynamic ileus, ejaculatory disorders/impotence, priapism, atonic
colon, urinary retention, miosis and mydriasis); reactivation of psychotic
processes, catatonic-like states; hypotension (sometimes fatal); cardiac arrest;

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics in outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19 in healthcare professionals in rio de janeiro, Brazil [^115eAFje]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study aimed to identify the symptoms associated with early stage SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infections in healthcare professionals (HCPs) using both clinical and laboratory data.

Methods

A total of 1297 patients, admitted between 18 March and 8 April 2020, were stratified according to their risk of developing COVID-19 using their responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate symptoms and risk conditions.

Results

Anosmia/hyposmia (p < 0.0001), fever (p < 0.0001), body pain (p < 0.0001) and chills (p = 0.001) were all independent predictors for COVID-19, with a 72% estimated probability for detecting COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Leucopenia, relative monocytosis, decreased eosinophil values, C reactive protein (CRP) and platelets were also shown to be significant independent predictors for COVID-19.

Conclusions

The significant clinical features for COVID-19 were identified as anosmia, fever, chills and body pain. Elevated CRP, leucocytes under 5400×10 9 /L and relative monocytosis (> 9%) were common among patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. These variables may help, in the absence of reverse transcriptase PCR tests, to identify possible COVID-19 infections during pandemic outbreaks.

Summary

From 19 March to 8 April 2020, 1297 patients attended the Polyclinic Piquet Carneiro for COVID-19 detection. HCP data were analysed, and significant clinical features were anosmia, fever, chills and body pain. Elevated CRP, leucopenia and monocytosis were common in COVID-19.

### Expert consensus on prevention and control of COVID-19 in the neurological intensive care unit (first edition) [^1159rrHY]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics and management

Clinical characteristics

The incubation period of COVID-19 is between 1 and 14 days, generally 3–7 days, and the most extended period was about 24 days.

Patients with COVID-19 often have a fever, dry cough and fatigue as the main symptoms. Some patients present with nasal congestion, runny nose, throat pain, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis. Neurological symptoms, such as headache, dizziness and muscle pain, have been observed. Their blood pressure may suddenly surge.

According to the severity of symptoms, clinical presentation can be divided into mild, common, severe and critical stages. Mild patients have light symptoms with normal pulmonary imaging. The common type has fever and respiratory symptoms with inflammatory changes on imaging. In severe cases, dyspnoea usually occurs within 1 week of onset, and in critical cases, it quickly progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, electrolyte disturbance and coagulation abnormalities, leading to multiorgan failure.

Laboratory examination

White blood cell counts are normal or decreased with lymphopenia in the early stages; most patients had elevated C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, but normal procalcitonin; some patients had increased liver enzymes, creatine and myoglobin. In severe cases, D-dimer is increased, with progressive lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be detected in specimens such as nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, blood and stool.

Imaging examination

Early chest CT may show multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, apparent on pulmonary bandaris. It can develop into ground-glass opacities and pattern of infiltration. In severe cases, lung consolidation may occur; however, pleural effusions are rare.

This is the case of a 42-year-old female who presented with transient dizziness. Her symptoms and signs progressed to include dysarthria, ataxia and cognitive decline over 2 years, such that she was unable to care for herself. She died 4 years after first presentation without a diagnosis. Investigations revealed a normochromic normocytic anaemia. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Serial computed tomography brain showed a wedge-shaped frontal infarct but no progressive changes. Examination at autopsy showed discoloration of the gray and white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Microscopy of leptomeningeal and parenchymal vessels showed they were filled with atypical B lymphocytes confined to the intravascular space with multiple infarcts in the brain, cerebellum and spinal cord. A diagnosis of intravascular B cell lymphoma was made and is discussed.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^114EUrzm]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

Abrupt headaches with focal neurologic deficits usually indicate medical emergencies that require advanced investigations and prompt treatment. The distinct syndrome of "headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis" (HaNDL) is infrequent and considered a benign, self-limited disorder. We illustrated a 29-year-old man with HaNDL atypically presenting as episodic altered consciousness rather than sensorimotor prodromes. The diagnosis was made carefully by exclusion of other likely entities. It is important for clinical physicians to differentiate HaNDL from other potentially fatal.

Computed tomography at the level of the pelvis and maximum intensity profile of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography demonstrates the primary Merkel cell carcinoma tumor of the right buttock (red circle), as well as in-transit metastases and lymphatic metastases (yellow arrow) before (a) and after (b) radiotherapy. A partial response was noted in the irradiated tumors, with progression of metastases elsewhere

Approximately 1–2 h after his first dose of RT, he developed nausea, vomiting, rigors and dizziness. He presented to another institution and was found to be febrile (temperature 39.1 °C) and tachycardic (heart rate 116 min −1). Leukocyte differential is presented in Fig. 2, and demonstrated a dramatic decrease in circulating lymphocytes (Fig. 2b). Blood cultures were obtained and demonstrated no evidence of infection. No signs of organ failure or tumor lysis were detected. He was admitted to another institution for observation and supportive care and discharged < 24 h after admission without a specific diagnosis to explain his condition.

Fig. 2

Shaded box represents normal range for each cell type

During the 1 week interval between RT treatments, he noted low grade fever, fatigue and a faint maculopapular rash on the trunk. Additional evaluations for infection were unremarkable. He received another dose of anti-PD1 therapy, and this precipitated a low grade fever within hours of infusion. On presentation for his second fraction of RT, it was noted that the in-transit metastases were smaller in size. Given the limited effective alternative treatments available for his MCC, he elected to proceed with the second fraction of RT. Prophylactic antiemetic (ondansetron) and antipyretic (acetaminophen) medications were administered 1 h prior to RT. After RT he was closely observed. One hour after RT he developed violent rigors. He became tachycardic, dyspneic, and hypotensive. CRS was suspected, and laboratory studies (cytokine levels) were requested (Fig. 3). He was admitted to our hospital for < 24 h of observation and supportive care. He was again found to have no evidence of infection, organ failure or tumor lysis.

### Elevation in white blood cell count after corticosteroid use in noninfected hospitalized patients [^116bSyJr]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In interpreting WBC counts, physicians should consider recent initiation of steroids and their dosage. While increases of as much as 4.84 × 10 9 cells may be seen 48 h after initiating large doses, larger increases, increases following a daily dose of 320 mg or less of hydrocortisone equivalent, and increases greater than 1 × 10 9 cells occurring within 24 h post‐steroid initiation should trigger concern for other causes of leukocytosis.

Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — clinical presentation and T-ALL features — Patients with ALL develop symptoms from infiltration of blasts in bone marrow, lymphoid system, and extramedullary sites including central nervous system (CNS) and testicles, with fatigue, constitutional symptoms, dyspnea, dizziness, infections, and easy bruising or bleeding; in children, extremity or joint pain may be the only presenting symptom. Compared to B-ALL, T-ALL generally presents at older ages, is more often male (3:1 male:female predominance), and more often has higher white blood cell (WBC) counts and extramedullary disease including lymphadenopathy, mediastinal mass, and CNS involvement. Mediastinal mass is present in > 50% of patients with T-ALL and can compress adjacent organs causing dyspnea/airway obstruction and venous obstruction/facial edema/thrombosis; pleural and cardiac effusions can also be seen.

Myeloproliferative disorders and the serum hyperviscosity syndrome can rapidly manifest with emergent presentations. Hyperviscosity occurs from pathologic elevations of either the cellular or acellular (protein) fractions of the circulating blood. Classic hyperviscosity syndrome presents with the triad of bleeding diathesis, visual disturbances and focal neurologic signs. Emergency medicine providers should be aware of these conditions and be prepared to rapidly initiate supportive and early definitive management, including plasma exchange and apharesis. Early consultation with a hematologist is essential to managing these complex patients.

### Differential leukocyte count is associated with clinical phenotype in Parkinson's disease [^116baW3G]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Elevated proinflammatory cytokines are associated with disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of study is to investigate whether components of peripheral blood leukocyte are associated with clinical symptoms in patients with de novo PD.

Methods

We analyzed data from 123 newly diagnosed de novo patients who had no focal and systemic inflammatory diseases. Associations between clinical symptoms and differential leukocyte count (DLC) or DLC associated peripheral inflammatory biomarkers were examined.

Results

Altered DLC and DLC associated peripheral inflammatory biomarkers were associated with PD related symptoms even though there was no sign of clinical inflammation. After controlling for covariables, olfaction and body mass index (BMI) were inversely associated with percentage of neutrophil, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and positively associated with percentage of lymphocyte, lymphocyte to monocyte ratio. Patients with tremor-dominant or mixed type had lower peripheral inflammatory indices than those with akinetic rigid type.

Conclusion

Components of peripheral blood leukocytes reflect some clinical symptoms of PD. Patients with normosmia, tremor-dominant or mixed type, and patients without low BMI have low peripheral inflammatory indices. Relative mild peripheral inflammation may play one of major roles in developing mild disease phenotype in these patients.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^1179YNWH]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We identify monocytosis in a substantial proportion of the general aging population. A higher prevalence of CH was found in those with monocytosis than in matched population-based control subjects, especially when the monocytosis was persistent over time. Although not necessarily reflecting a clonal monocyte population, in a fraction of subjects with monocytosis, CH might constitute very early clonal dominance in the development of malignant myelomonocytic disease. Clinical attention seems warranted for cases with spliceosome gene mutations or with multiple mutated genes. Longitudinal studies are needed to track the evolutionary trajectory of cases with monocytosis and age-related CH and decide on the added value of a clinical follow-up for these cases.

### A 14-year-old boy with fevers, cytopenias, and neurocognitive decline [^1177b4jA]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old boy presented to our institution with a 1-month history of neurocognitive decline and intermittent fevers. His history was significant for fevers, headaches, and a 10-lb weight loss. Previous examinations by multiple medical providers were significant only for bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Previous laboratory workup revealed leukopenia, neutropenia, and elevated inflammatory markers. Despite improvement in his laboratory values after his initial presentation, his fevers persisted, and he developed slowed and "jerky" movements, increased sleep, slurred speech, delusions, visual hallucinations, and deterioration in his school performance. A brain MRI performed at an outside hospital before admission at our institution was concerning for patchy, increased T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal intensity in multiple areas, including the basal ganglia. After transfer to our institution and admission to the pediatric hospital medicine team, the patient had an acute decompensation. Our subspecialists will discuss the initial evaluation, workup, differential diagnosis, definitive diagnosis, and subsequent management of this patient.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^111xbocB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Transient headache and neurological deficits with cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis syndrome: a comprehensive systematic review of 93 patients from 57 studies [^115ixHhU]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis, previously also termed pseudomigraine with temporary neurologic symptoms and lymphocytic pleocytosis, is a self-limiting syndrome characterized by moderate to severe headache associated with focal neurological deficits occurring in the context of lymphocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. As a consequence of its rarity, data regarding headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis is sparse. Therefore, we conducted this review to analyze data related to 93 patients of headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis, to characterize their demographics, clinical manifestations, investigations and treatment options.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of cases reported through PubMed and Google scholar database, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. Keywords used were 'Headache with Neurologic Deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis', 'Headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis syndrome'. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool.

Results

We analyzed a total of 93 cases of headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis with a mean age of 28.8 years at onset. Seventy patients (75.2%) were adults, while 23 (24.7%) belonged to the pediatric age group. Comparing these groups, mean age at onset was 32.5 years and 14.3 years, respectively. The average duration of follow-up was 11.08 months. Thirty percent of patients experienced relapsing episodes of headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis symptoms. The most common type of headache reported was unilateral severe throbbing episodic headache. Other associated symptoms included sensory deficit (60%) and motor deficits (54.8%). The least common symptoms were nystagmus and agraphia, which were reported in one patient each. Antiviral agents were a common treatment option in the acute phase (n = 23 patients [23.6%]), while Flunarizine was the most commonly used agent in the chronic setting (n = 3 patients [3.2%]). While most of the patients had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, 20 patients had magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, including (but not limited to) non-specific white matter lesions (eight patients) and meningeal enhancement (six patients). The most common electroencephalographic findings included diffuse and focal slowing. The mean cerebrospinal fluid opening-pressure was 240.5mmH 2 O. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was elevated in 59 (63.4%) patients, with a mean value of 114mg/dL. Two patients in our cohort were found to have cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands.

Conclusion

Headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis tends to affect young individuals with a slight male predominance. Unilateral severe throbbing episodic headache with associated hemi-paresthesia and hemiparesis were the most common symptoms based on our review. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid opening-pressure can be seen in headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis syndrome. Early recognition of the syndrome is paramount. Antivirals were found to be among the most widely used treatments in the acute setting. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is mostly normal. Diffuse and focal slowing were among the most common electroencephalographic findings. Cerebral flow abnormalities on perfusion scans are not uncommon in headache with neurologic deficits and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis. Prospective studies with a larger sample size are needed to validate our findings and guide the clinical care of these patients.

### Lower lymphocyte to monocyte ratio is a potential predictor of poor outcome in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [^112CRUFj]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient selection

Patients included in this retrospective cohort study were from the database of the Henan CVST Registry in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan, China). All patients diagnosed with CVST from November 2011 to January 2017 were identified. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) meeting the diagnostic criteria for CVST established by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association in 2011; (2) patients with direct or indirect signs of CVST in the MRI; (3) filling defect or obstruction of cerebral sinus in the magnetic resonance venography, digital subtraction angiography or operation searching; (4) clinical features such as isolated headache, vomiting, visual disturbances, focal neurological deficit, seizure and other typical symptoms and (5) an initial blood sample for laboratory testing 12 hours of admission. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with unrelated other serious brain lesions, serious lung disease or heart disease; (2) patients with undesirable follow-up, including refusal or loss to follow-up; (3) patients less than 18 years old and (4) patients without complete clinical data.

Data collection

Clinical data such as age, gender, onset to admission time, potential risk factors, clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging tests were collected. Laboratory samples were routinely collected after 12 hours of fasting on admission to the hospital. The inter-rater reliability for involvement of intracranial venous sinus between two investigators was assessed in some cases.

Evaluation of prognosis

We evaluated the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) to determine the patients' functional outcomes: mRS 0–2 as good outcomes, mRS 3–6 as poor outcomes and death was defined with mRS score of 6. Follow-up information was recorded by telephone interview. Telephone interviewers were not involved in the registry and were blinded to the baseline data. The overall survival (OS) time was defined as the date of admission to the date of death from any cause or to the last follow-up date.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V.19.0 software. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD or median which were analysed by independent Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented as numbers which were analysed using χ 2 test or Fisher's exact test. Survival curves were described by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The association between LMR and the poor survival outcome was explored by using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Two-tailed p values of < 0.05 were considered significant.

### Expert perspective: hematologic malignancies and vasculitis [^115WGPTw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Collectively, we consider VEXAS in patients with robust adult‐onset multisystem inflammation with or without vasculitis, especially, though not universally, if cytopenia or macrocytosis is present and the patient is male, with a broader differential diagnosis including myeloid neoplasia with inflammatory features. LVV appears to be an uncommon phenotype. Testing should ideally include whole‐gene UBA1 sequencing, not limited amplicon testing at M41, and is commercially available from companies such as the Genomic Testing Cooperative and Blueprint Genetics. This can currently be performed by rheumatology or hematology/oncology, but in the future, it is most likely to be incorporated into hematologic clinical NGS mutation panels for hematologic malignancy.

Hematology approach to diagnosis and management of suspected

Hematology consultation should be pursued in patients with vasculitis and cytopenia if counts are severe or trending down despite treatment (Figure 2) or associated with symptoms such as difficult‐to‐treat or chronic infections, presence of bleeding or bruising, worsening fatigue, and/or B symptoms. Persistent overproduction of cells such as lymphocytosis, erythrocytosis, or, as in this case, monocytosis should also lead to hematology consultation, especially when cytopenia coexists. Hematologists will consider a wide differential diagnosis that includes various hematologic malignancies and a multitude of alternative and potentially reversible diagnoses (Figure 2). For example, monocytosis is most commonly reactive to acute or chronic infection. If no reversible cause is identified or if cytopenia or cytoses persists despite their treatment, further tests are needed, including bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and various context‐dependent functional and molecular clonal analyses that may include flow cytometry, NGS, cytogenetics, T cell receptor clonality, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In our practices, these tests are typically ordered and interpreted by the hematologist or oncologist, given their expertise.

### Olanzapine (Zyprexa) [^113haUBe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Olanzapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) where the occurrence of syncope, or hypotension and/or bradycardia might put the patient at increased medical risk.

Caution is necessary in patients who receive treatment with other drugs having effects that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Concomitant administration of intramuscular olanzapine and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended due to the potential for excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression.

5.8 Falls

ZYPREXA may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

Class Effect — In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including ZYPREXA. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of ZYPREXA should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3) should discontinue ZYPREXA and have their WBC followed until recovery.

5.10 Dysphagia

Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Increasingand hyperleucocytosis

In this situation, it is necessary to find out whether leucocytosis is due to the appearance of numerous immature blasts in the peripheral blood or can be explained by an increase in monocytes and mature granulocytic cells. In the first case, very cautious cytoreduction is required, trying to avoid tumour lysis syndrome. Cell apheresis is possible but is insufficient when not paralleled by cytoreduction. Stabilization of the coagulation system may be necessary, too. If leucocytosis is due to monocytosis and neutrophilia, cytoreduction is also needed to avoid thromboembolic complications and inflammation. However, there is usually more time for cytoreduction, and the risk of tumour lysis syndrome is smaller. In that situation, the preferred treatment is hydroxyurea. Patience is needed while waiting for the cell counts to drop. Treatment must be reduced or even discontinued before normal leucocyte counts are reached. In a phase 3 study comparing hydroxyurea with oral etoposide, hydroxyurea was superior in terms of cytoreductive potency and usability. Low‐dose cytarabine can also be employed, either subcutaneously or intravenously, and may hasten the reduction of WBCs. Here again, the dosage should be reduced or treatment paused as early as possible in order to avoid long‐term cytopenia, particularly regarding platelets. Combinations with cladribine may be effective as well.

Development of organomegaly and constitutional symptoms

In this scenario, the focus is on quality of life. Constitutional symptoms, especially night sweats, fever, malaise, constipation and weight loss, are sooner or later accompanied by catabolism. Probatory treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor like ruxolitinibis reasonable because swift improvement of symptoms may occur. However, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia must be anticipated as potential side effects. Hydroxyurea and other low‐dose cytoreductive compounds are generally not effective. Constitutional symptoms are usually accompanied by haematopoietic insufficiency and sometimes by extramedullary haematopoiesis. Treatment with hydroxyurea, steroids and HMAs is justified, but the chance of long‐term response is low.

Clinical signs of inflammation

Patients who are symptomatic with certain types of inflammation, including non‐infectious lung disease, pleural and/or pericardial effusion, ascites, joint pain and others, can be treated with steroids. An attempt with ruxolitinib is justified, but in high‐risk CMML, HMAs may also lead to a quick response, either through suppression of the monocytic clone or through non‐directional immunosuppressive effects.

Case Presentations

Case 1

In 2016, a 51-year-old man suffered a traumatic knee injury. Right knee MRI showed symmetric sclerosis of the femur, consistent with asymptomatic ECD. Four years later, he experienced dysarthria and dizziness, followed by ataxia and fine motor dysfunction. An MRI scan in March 2020 showed subcortical T2 lesions in the right superior frontal gyrus, right peritrigonal region, left centrum semiovale, and left central region as well as cerebellar and subcortical contrast enhancement. MRI of the spinal cord showed no abnormalities. However, osteolytic lesions were found in the 10 th thoracic vertebra. CSF analysis was without any pathologic findings. A vertebral biopsy confirmed ECD diagnosis, revealing foamy CD68-positive macrophage accumulation (Figure 1) and wild-type BRAF. Oral administration of cobimetinib 60 mg/d for 21 days followed by a 7-day break was started in May 2020. Because of diarrhea, treatment was reduced to 40 mg cobimetinib per day. Neurologic symptoms stabilized with medication. In early 2021, the patient experienced blurred vision in the left eye and was diagnosed with a central retinal vein thrombosis of the left retinal vein and cystic macular edema of both eyes. Assuming the symptoms were treatment-related, cobimetinib was stopped. In the following months, there was progressive gait instability and new MRI lesions. This led to a second treatment course in July 2022, which was subsequently discontinued because of persistent diarrhea. Cobimetinib was resumed in July 2023 at 20 mg/d with 7 days off per month; neither symptom, MRI progression, nor side effects occurred as of November 2023 (Figure 1).

### Lower lymphocyte to monocyte ratio is a potential predictor of poor outcome in patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [^111Zr8Vq]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

There were 263 patients with confirmed CVST admitted during the study period. We excluded 20 patients because of incomplete clinical data, 10 patients because they were lost to follow-up and 5 patients because they were younger than 18 years old. A total of 228 CVST patients were enrolled into this study.

The duration of follow-up was 22 months (6–66 months) and 41 patients were defined as having poor outcomes. The baseline clinical data of two groups are shown in table 1. LMR (2.3 ± 1.2 vs 3.2 ± 1.8, p < 0.01) was significantly lower in the poor outcome group as illustrated in figure 1. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to gender (p = 0.505), onset to admission time (p > 0.1), malignancy (p = 0.143), infection (p = 0.854), epilepsy (p = 0.635), dyskinesia and sensory disturbance (p = 0.414), barylalia (p = 0.796), isolated headache (p = 0.147) and intracranial hypertension (p = 0.656). But older patients were identified more frequently in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group (41.9 ± 13.8 vs 33.8 ± 12.7, p = 0.001). In addition, intracerebral haemorrhage and coma were more common among patients with poor outcomes (p = 0.001 and p < 0.01). As for laboratory parameters, lymphocyte and d-dimer reached statistical significance (p < 0.01 and p = 0.001), but not monocyte (p = 0.788). Additionally, the thrombosis-affected sinuses were also regarded as risk factors. Straight sinus and deep venous were involved in the poor outcome group (p < 0.01 and p = 0.019).

### Clinical considerations and key issues in the management of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease: a seven case series [^1158jZnA]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Patient #5

A 53-year-old man of Libyan descent sought medical attention in November 2012 due to deterioration in his walking stability as well as slowing of his speech. Apparently, these symptoms slowly progressed over a period of approximately 18 months prior to this patient's presentation. Upon a detailed history, the patient disclosed suffering from polyuria and polydipsia for the last 7.5 years. A prior medical investigation aimed at identifying the cause of these symptoms was concluded as non diagnostic. His neurological examination revealed dysarthria, dysmetria, gait instability and a multidirectional gaze evoked nystagmus. Also, decreased left flank muscle tone and lower limb hyporeflexia were noted. A fundus examination was unremarkable. Aside from a mild normocytic anemia (hemoglobin: 12.4 mg/dL, MCV: 86.6 fL), other laboratory studies, including a lumbar puncture, were without significant findings. Laboratory studies aimed at identifying viral serologies and paraneoplastic antibodies were negative. The conjunction of this patient's cerebellar syndrome, polyuria and polydipsia raised a suspicion of a histiocytic disorder. A 99m Tc bone scintigraphy study was conducted and revealed bilateral, abnormally increased tracer uptake in the distal femurs and both proximal and distal tibiae (Figure 1 D). A brain MRI uncovered several abnormal findings, including a pontine lesion, mild cerebellar atrophy, absence of the posterior pituitary and a parietal parasagittal extra-axial lesion 23 mm in diameter, consistent with a meningioma. A whole body PET/CT scan was conducted and disclosed an increased tracer uptake in the pons, as well as the femurs and tibiae. The PET findings in the long bones correlated well with osteosclerosis as seen on CT and with the areas accentuated on the previous 99m Tc bone scintigraphy study. A biopsy from the tibial bone marrow was performed. Microscopic examination of the specimen revealed thickened, irregular bony trabeculae with numerous cement lines, insinuating increased cellular turnover. The marrow itself was found to be diffusely fibrotic with a small amount of residual fat tissue and numerous macrophages which carry a CD68(+), CD1a(-), S-100(-) immunohistochemical profile. Langerhans cells and hematopoietic cells were not observed. This picture was consistent with bone marrow involvement of ECD. Following diagnosis in April 2013, the patient was tested for the V600E BRAF mutation and was found to be negative. Steroids were introduced as a first line treatment and later combined with vinblastine (6 mg/m 2 /week) as a steroid sparing agent. This treatment was administered for five months and subsequently ceased due to progressive neurological deterioration. Second line treatment with the pegylated form of interferon-α (135 μg/week) was administered for two months yet failed to halt this patient's neurological deterioration. Ultimately, the patient initiated treatment with cladribine IV (0.14 mg/kg/day for five consecutive days, every four weeks). Following four cycles of treatment a mild degree of radiological improvement was noted on brain MRI. Nevertheless, no clinical improvement was noted, neurological or otherwise.

5.5 Central Nervous System Symptoms

Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been associated with immediate-release cysteamine. Neurological complications have also been described in some patients with cystinosis who have not been treated with cysteamine. Carefully evaluate and monitor patients who develop CNS symptoms. Interrupt medication or adjust the dose as necessary for patients with severe symptoms or with symptoms that persist or progress. Inform patients that PROCYSBI may impair their ability to perform tasks such as driving or operating machinery.

5.6 Leukopenia and/or Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels

Cysteamine has been associated with reversible leukopenia and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Monitor white blood cell counts and alkaline phosphatase levels. If tests values remain elevated, consider decreasing the dose or discontinuing the drug until values revert to normal.

5.7 Benign Intracranial Hypertension

Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri; PTC) and/or papilledema have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of PTC, including headache, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, diplopia, blurry vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye movement. If signs/symptoms persist, interrupt dosing or decrease the dose and refer the patient to an ophthalmologist. If the diagnosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue use of PROCYSBI.

### Leukocytosis and tobacco use: an observational study of asymptomatic leukocytosis [^116j9cgV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to characterize the white blood cell differential of tobacco smoking-induced leukocytosis and describe the longitudinal impact of smoking cessation on this peripheral blood abnormality.

Methods

Medical records of patients undergoing evaluation by hematologists for persistent leukocytosis were reviewed. Patients in whom leukocytosis was determined to be secondary to tobacco use after exclusion of other causes were identified. Demographic and laboratory data were collected at time of diagnosis. Patients were longitudinally followed and information regarding smoking cessation and follow-up white blood cell values were recorded.

Results

Forty patients were determined to have smoking-induced leukocytosis. The median age was 49.5 years (range: 28–75 years), 24 patients were female, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31.5 kg/m 2. The mean white blood cell count was 13.3 × 10 9 /L (range: 9.8–20.9 × 10 9 /L); 39 patients had absolute neutrophilia (98%), 21 had lymphocytosis (53%), 20 had monocytosis (50%), and 19 had basophilia (48%). During follow-up, 11 patients either quit (n = 9) or reduced (n = 2) tobacco use. Reduction in tobacco smoking led to a significant decrease in mean white blood cell count (13.2 × 10 9 /L vs 11.1 × 10 9 /L, P = 0.02). The median time to decrease in white blood cell count following reduction in tobacco use was 8 weeks (range: 2–49 weeks).

Conclusions

Tobacco-induced leukocytosis was characterized by a mild elevation in total white blood cell count and was most commonly associated with neutrophilia, lymphocytosis, monocytosis, and basophilia. Cessation of smoking led to improvement in leukocytosis. Tobacco history should be elicited from all patients presenting with leukocytosis to limit unnecessary diagnostic testing, and counseling regarding smoking cessation should be offered.

### Too many white cells-TAM, JMML, or something else? [^113t2AxK]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Leukocytosis is a common finding in pediatric patients, and the differential diagnosis can be broad, including benign reactive leukocytosis and malignant myeloproliferative disorders. Transient abnormal myelopoiesis is a myeloproliferative disorder that occurs in young infants with constitutional trisomy 21 and somatic GATA1 mutations. Most patients are observed, but outcomes span the spectrum from spontaneous resolution to life-threatening complications. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia is a highly aggressive myeloproliferative disorder associated with altered RAS-pathway signaling that occurs in infants and young children. Treatment typically involves hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but certain patients can be observed. Early recognition of these and other myeloproliferative disorders is important and requires a clinician to be aware of these diagnoses and have a clear understanding of their presentations. This paper discusses the presentation and evaluation of leukocytosis when myeloproliferative disorders are part of the differential and reviews different concepts regarding treatment strategies.

Reactive monocytosis is very common in practice and while viral infections and recovering bone marrow (from injury, drugs or chemotherapy) are frequent causes, sustained reactive monocytosis is more common in chronic infections such as subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, leishmaniasis and leprosy and in autoimmune/inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis and mixed connective tissue disorder. Reactive monocytosis can also be seen in the context of metastatic visceral neoplasms, either due to enhanced mobilization of monocytes from the bone marrow, or due to increased monopoiesis mediated by CCL2 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2).

Ehrlichioses clinical features (Box 4) — Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii, and Ehrlichia muris-like (EML) agent: Symptoms of E. chaffeensis typically include fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms, with rash present in approximately one third of patients and more common among children than adults; neurologic manifestations are reported for approximately 20% of patients, and increased severity has been associated with increased age (≥ 60 years) and immunosuppression. In E. chaffeensis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic transaminase levels are characteristic in the first week; E. chaffeensis has a predilection for mononuclear phagocytic cells and morulae might be observed in monocytes of the blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or bone marrow phagocytes. E. ewingii ehrlichiosis has similar clinical features but rash and gastrointestinal symptoms are less common, and E. ewingii has a predilection for granulocytes with morulae observed in granulocytes of the blood, CSF, or bone marrow. Signs and symptoms of EML agent ehrlichiosis are similar to those of E. ewingii ehrlichiosis, the target cell type is not known, and the case-fatality rate for E. chaffeensis is approximately 3% with no deaths from E. ewingii or EML agent ehrlichiosis reported.

Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue Prochlorperazine Suppositories, USP at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3) should discontinue Prochlorperazine Suppositories, USP and have their WBC followed until recovery.

The antiemetic action of prochlorperazine may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's Syndrome (see WARNINGS).

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^115CueiE]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Only a small proportion of older individuals with monocytosis developed a myeloid malignancy. It might be that a long latency period is required for a very early stage of clonal monocytosis to develop into malignant disease. In addition, supported by a higher level of inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other WBC counts, a major proportion of individuals in this study probably suffered from reactive monocytosis despite the presence of CH. Clearly, CH in the presence of monocytosis does not directly imply the presence of a clonal monocyte proliferation with malignant potential. This stresses the fact that mutational screening should not be used as an isolated screening tool to distinguish CMML, oligomonocytic CMML, and other potential CMML prestagesfrom a reactive monocytosis, especially when more liberal criteria (eg, concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 × 10 9 /L) to define a PB monocytosis are applied and other diagnostic criteria are not met. Indeed, this also questions whether all clonal genetic lesions in the presence of unexplained, persistent monocytosis may support a diagnosis of CMML, as it is currently used in the 2016 WHO criteria. For example, we previously described the clonal evolution of a CMML case which was remarkably stable and whose diagnosis could be questioned in hindsight. The combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations, in contrast, was associated with clonal expansion of monocytic cells, which confirms the specificity of this mutational spectrum for myelomonocytic disorders.

Case Report

On May 18, 2015, a 63-year-old man was hospitalized in Humboldt County, California, after 2 weeks of fatigue, memory impairment, and progressive confusion accompanied by right-sided occipital headache and right-sided allodynia involving his arm and head. He was confused and disoriented to date but could recognize family; engage in brief, logical conversations; and walk independently. His medical history included essential thrombocytosis, hypothyroidism, and a remote episode of shingles. Vital signs were normal; physical examination showed no focal abnormalities. His complete blood count showed a leukocyte count of 11.5 × 10 9 cells/L (reference range 3.4–10 × 10 9 cells/L), eosinophil count of 0.75 × 10 9 cells/L (reference range < 0.4 × 10 9 cells/L), and neutrophil count of 6.1 × 10 9 /L (reference range 1.8–6.8 × 10 9 cells/L). Chemistry and liver panel results were normal. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated no intracranial pathology. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a leukocyte count of 183 × 10 9 cells/L (60% lymphocytes, 27% monocytes, 9% eosinophils, 4% neutrophils); protein level of 155 mg/dL; and glucose level of 45 mg/dL (Figure 1). He was started on empiric vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir.

Over the next 3 days, the patient sustained precipitous cognitive and functional declines; incontinence, right-sided facial droop, dysarthria, diffuse hyperreflexia, and ataxia developed. Initial infectious disease diagnostics returned negative results (Table 1), so antimicrobial drugs were discontinued. CSF analysis on day 11 showed persistent pleocytosis and marked elevation of eosinophils to 34% (Figure 1). CSF cytologic and flow cytometric testing showed no malignant cells but did show reactive lymphocytes and many eosinophils, consistent with chronic inflammation.

### Progressive neurologic disorder: initial manifestation of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^113ZkE64]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Case report.

A 14-year-old Caucasian female presented with a 3-month history of headaches, progressive right-sided convergent squint, dysarthria, gait abnormality with progressive difficulty in climbing up the stairs and being able to stand, and hyperesthesia involving her left arm and leg. She had a long-standing history of pervasive refusal disorder for which she was receiving psychiatric support. Ophthalmology examination revealed a VI cranial nerve palsy and papilledema. She had normal tone, with decreased power in upper and lower limbs and absent reflexes, and no ankle clonus; there was no hepatosplenomegaly and no peripheral lymphadenopathy detected. Brain and spine MRI revealed leptomeningeal enhancement and generalized white matter lesions, in addition to mid–cervical cord contrast-enhancing lesions (figure, A–D). EMG demonstrated motor and sensory neuropathy; sural nerve biopsy showed axonal degeneration with mild inflammatory changes but no vasculitis. Hemoglobin was 14.7 g/dL (reference range [RR] 12–16 g/dL), platelet count 261 × 10 9 /L (RR 150–450 × 10 9 /L), white cell count 5.63 × 10 3 /L (RR 4.0–11.0 × 10 3 /L), alanine transaminase 17 U/L (RR 10–45 U/L), and fibrinogen 2.8 g/L (RR 1.7–4.0 g/L); ferritin was not tested. Oligoclonal bands were positive on CSF examination, suggesting a CNS inflammatory process; other extensive investigations excluded infective, rheumatologic, metabolic, and malignant causes. She was considered to have an unclassified neuroinflammatory disease and was treated empirically with IV immunoglobulin (1 g/kg) and corticosteroids (IV methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg over 3 days and oral prednisolone 2 mg/kg/d tapered over 8 weeks), with resolution of white matter lesions and improvement of the dysarthria, squint, papilledema, headaches, and hyperesthesia, although her mobility remained impaired despite intense physiotherapy. Thirteen months later, she developed a generalized seizure requiring admission to intensive care, with fever and pancytopenia (hemoglobin at 7.6 g/dL, platelet count 55 × 10 9 /L, and white cell count 3.5 × 10 3 /L). Blood PCR for Epstein-Barr virus was positive at 850,000 copies/mL. She was thought to have viral-induced secondary HLH on the background of a neuroinflammatory syndrome. She was treated with IV methylprednisolone at 30 mg/kg/d for 3 days, oral prednisolone 2 mg/kg/d tapered over 4 months, rituximab (375 mg/m 2 weekly for 4 weeks), and mycophenolate mofetil (1,200 mg/m 2 /d).

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^111qT6NT]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

We herein report on a 26‐year‐old Caucasian female who was referred to our outpatient clinic with a history of abnormal blood count, including thrombocytosis and monocytosis known for the last 7 years. No family history of hematological disorders was reported. Her past medical history was significant for a papillary thyroid carcinoma that was treated with surgery and radioiodine therapy, obtaining a complete remission; the patient is currently taking levothyroxine. Her physical exam was normal and no signs and/or symptoms of infection were noticed.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 450 × 10 9 /L, is a common finding in routine blood tests and a common cause of referral to hematologists for further investigation. Causes of thrombocytosis can be grouped into primary, secondary, and spurious (Table 1). To find out the etiology of the thrombocytosis, the clinical hematologist should take into consideration data from familial and medical history, physical examination, results of hematological exams, clonal genetic abnormalities and bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy for morphological features, flow cytometric data, and cytogenetic and molecular markers of clonality.

TABLE 1
Causes of thrombocytosis

During the visit, we performed additional blood tests. A complete blood count revealed the following values: Hemoglobin 150 g/L, hematocrit 42.8%, mean cell volume 88 fL, white blood cell count 10.23 × 10 9 /L, and platelet count 582 × 10 9 /L. Differential white blood cell count revealed a normal absolute neutrophil count and a slightly increased number of monocytes (1.2 × 10 9 /L). Morphological examination of peripheral blood smear confirmed the higher‐than‐normal platelet count with no significant platelet clumping and also showed several target cells, acanthocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies within red blood cells (Figure 1 A). C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results within the normal range. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were normal. Serum level of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was within the normal range. A chest X‐ray revealed no abnormalities attributable to pulmonary infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of infection and reported limited visualization of the spleen. The BCR‐ABL rearrangement was absent in peripheral blood. No mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes were found in DNA from peripheral blood granulocytes.

### Monocytosis and its association with clonal hematopoiesis in community-dwelling individuals [^114B4Htu]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

This population of community-dwelling individuals, as well as the results from this study, are considerably different from the cohort presented by Cargo and colleaguesthat evaluated patients presenting in hematology practice for the evaluation of monocytosis. In that study, individuals with clinically significant monocytosis but not (yet) meeting WHO criteria were found to have a mutational spectrum and clinical outcome indistinguishable from WHO-defined CMML. The median VAF in our study was 2.7%, compared with 39% in the study by Cargo and colleagues. Although various differences in sequencing technique and sensitivity may be noted between these studies, this is unlikely to explain the substantial differences in the mutational spectrum associated with monocytosis. Our cohort comprised unselected community-dwelling individuals for whom monocytosis was detected incidentally at study inclusion, without known associated health complaints. Indeed, there was a relatively low prevalence of accompanying cytopenias compared with diagnosed CMML patients. The clinical study by Cargo and colleagues probably included individuals with a more advanced stage and more suspect of overt clonal myeloid disease. Thus, the meaning of CH in the context of monocytosis presumably depends on the clinical burden of monocytosis and may very well be a continuum of (stepwise) clonal outgrowth and progression.

ASTCT consensus — laboratory parameters are not included in the definition or grading of CRS; although C-reactive protein (CRP) is widely available, it is not specific for CRS and changes in CRP can lag behind clinical changes by at least 12 hours, so grading favors clinical observation while continued measurement of cytokines, CRP, ferritin, and other parameters is encouraged for future study.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions [^116MZTkX]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Oligomonocytic CMML

Over the past few years, more and more cases of cytopenic patients exhibiting relative monocytosis (≥ 10%) and moderately increased absolute blood monocytes not reaching the required threshold to diagnose classical CMML (1.0x10 9 /L) have been described. These cases have recently been referred to as oligomonocytic CMML. According to the WHO classification most of these patients would be classified as having MDS (with monocytosis) or perhaps MPN/MDS-unclassifiable. However, most of these patients exhibit typical features of CMML, including a typical morphology of PB and BM cells, splenomegaly, and CMML-related molecular features (e.g. mutations in TET2 and SRSF2). - Some of these patients have prominent BM monocytosis without diagnostic PB monocytosis at diagnosis.

Whereas several of these cases remain stable without progression, the majority will develop 'overt' CMML or, eventually, secondary AML during follow-up. Therefore, oligomonocytic CMML may also be regarded as a potential pre-phase of classical CMML. Our faculty is of the opinion that the term oligomonocytic CMML should be used in clinical practice. Diagnostic pre-requisite criteria for oligomonocytic CMML are: (i) persistent (lasting at least 3 months) absolute peripheral monocytosis of 0.5–0.9×10 9 /L and relative blood monocytosis (≥ 10% of blood leukocytes); (ii) exclusion of BCR-ABL1 + leukemia, classical MPN and all other myeloid neoplasms that can explain monocytosis; and (iii) a blast cell count of 0–19% in PB and/or BM smears and exclusion of all histopathological, morphological, phenotypic, molecular and cytogenetic signs that count as proof of AML. Diagnostic dysplasia in one or more of the three major BM lineages (≥ 10%) must also be documented. If dysplasia is lacking or 'sub-diagnostic' (< 10%), the presence of cytogenetic or molecular lesions (mutations) typically found in CMML and/or the presence of CMML-related flow cytometry abnormalities, may also lead to the conclusion that the patient has oligomonocytic CMML provided that the other diagnostic criteria described above are fulfilled and all other myeloid neoplasms have been excluded. The proposed criteria for oligomonocytic CMML are listed in Table 3. Patients with oligomonocytic CMML should be managed and followed clinically in the same way as patients with classical CMML.

### Clinical management of CMML-state of the art [^1149eADQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemias (CMML) are myeloid neoplasms characterized by a sustained increase in monocyte counts in the peripheral blood, accompanied by dysplasia, abnormal proliferation, chromosomal anomalies and somatic mutations of haematopoietic cells. More than 95% of CMML patients harbour somatic mutations. CMML must be separated from other myeloid neoplasms and reactive monocytosis. The clinical presentation of CMML varies, but most frequently shows signs and symptoms of haematopoietic insufficiency or myeloproliferation. Robust instruments are available for assessing the prognosis of patients with CMML, such as the CMML‐specific prognostic scoring system molecular. Treatment options for patients with CMML are still inadequate and generally less effective than those for other myeloid neoplasms. The only curative approach is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This article explains essential aspects of CMML pathophysiology and provides an overview of diagnostic considerations, prognostic assessment and therapeutic options.

### A new approach to the diagnosis of acute dizziness in adult patients [^111YsUis]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common chief complaint in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes serious conditions, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, hypovolemic states, and acute toxic and metabolic disturbances. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients who suffer from benign self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. Misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic test costs high. The traditional approach does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes and is not consistent with best current evidence. This article presents a new approach to the diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients that highly leverages the history and the physical examination.

Prochlorperazine's antiemetic action may mask signs and symptoms of overdosage of other drugs and may obscure the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions such as intestinal obstruction, brain tumor and Reye's syndrome (see WARNINGS).

### Comparing malignant monocytosis across the updated WHO and ICC classifications of 2022 [^116uZG5D]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past half century, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) was defined as a myelodysplastic (MD)/myeloproliferative (MP) neoplasm with the hallmark characteristic of peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis ≥ 1 × 10 9 /L, in conjunction with MD and/or MP bone marrow (BM) features.

Because of constant technological advancement and a rapidly evolving knowledge base, preexisting conceptions are being challenged, making the continuous adaptation of disease definitions necessary. In this regard, the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and the International Consensus Classification (ICC) introduced major common changes to the diagnostic criteria of CMML. First, in the presence of additional CMML features, the cutoff for absolute monocytosis was lowered to ≥ 0.5 × 10 9 /L absolute monocyte count in both classifications, thereby incorporating cases formerly referred to as oligomonocytic (OM)-CMML into the diagnosis of CMML. Second, the CMML-0 subgroup was eliminated because of its limited clinical relevance. Finally, in the current classifications, the diagnostic focus is shifted onto recurrent molecular aberrations, thus replacing solely clinical criteria such as persisting monocytosis for ≥ 3 months in the absence of alternative diagnoses.

### Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, Missouri [^111eMPWW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Our failure to isolate E. chaffeensis from these cases is most likely related to the delay in inoculating the blood samples of patients with HME into cell culture. The interval between blood sampling and inoculation may play a critical role when attempts to obtain isolates of E. chaffeensis are made.

The spectrum of illness in our study ranged from mild to life-threatening disease that required hospitalization and intensive care; 41% of the patients in our study were hospitalized. Since we detected cases based on a clinical definition that included fever for > 3 days, we probably excluded the mildest cases of the disease in which a self-limited illness developed, which resolved spontaneously. In fact, asymptomatic seroconversion has been documented in soldiers who underwent field training and were exposed to ticks. However, whether the antigenic stimulation in those cases was actually triggered by E. chaffeensis or by some other antigenically related, less pathogenic bacterium, such as E. ewingii or the unnamed white-tailed deer Anaplasma species (both also associated with the lone star tick) is not known. The clinical syndrome of HME observed in this study is similar to that described in other series (,–) in that it can be a serious illness that requires hospitalization in a large number of cases, even though the prospective, clinic-based nature of the study allowed more mild cases to be identified earlier in the course of illness.

Comparison of the case-patient group and the control group revealed the important difficulty in clinical diagnosis: few clinical symptoms differed between case-patients and non–case-patients. Even the signs and symptoms that showed some differences are nonspecific and can occur in other clinical conditions. The relatively high frequency of neurologic and respiratory signs is noteworthy, showing the potential severity of this disease. Among the few patients that underwent lumbar puncture in this study, the CSF showed pleocytosis with lymphocytic predominance (data not shown). Age, white blood cell counts, and absolute neutrophil counts were statistically significantly different between the HME and non-HME patients; thrombocytopenia was nearly statistically different (p = 0.06), pointing out again the importance of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia as diagnostic clues during the acute phase of the disease. The differences in age of the patients confirm once again that HME tends to affect older people more frequently than younger people (E. chaffeensis infection also may cause a milder illness in the young).

### Clinical reasoning: progressive headache and diplopia in an 89-year-old man [^113RjZPp]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Myelopoiesis is temporally dynamic and is regulated by lifestyle to modify multiple sclerosis [^116vtkSY]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Lifestyle factors are contributing to an increase in MS. While many environmental factors can influence MS — including Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infections, smoking, sun exposure, and tobacco use — obesity, hyperlipidemia, and sleep disruption are among the most recognized. There appears to be a critical window during adolescence when high BMI strongly increases the likelihood of MS –. Similarly, shift work, insufficient or disrupted sleep raise the risk of MS –. The mechanistic pathways that link obesity and sleep disruption to MS are unclear. Our data propose myeloid cell generation as one biological process that connects lifestyle factors, including dyslipidemia and sleep disruption, to MS. The mechanisms by which hyperlipidemia or sleep disruption augment myelopoiesis is an area of active research and have not been tested in the setting of MS. Elevated levels of cholesterol can incorporate in the HSC cell membrane disrupting integrity and leading to increased responsiveness to hematopoietic growth factors including IL-3 and M-CSF. Sleep disruption also augments myelopoiesis through its modulation of growth factor signaling. Hypocretin limits the production of M-CSF in the BM by a population of pre-neutrophils. Therefore, when hypocretin levels are low, as occurs during sleep fragmentation, BM M-CSF abundance increases leading to HSC proliferation and monocytosis. These and alternative molecular mechanisms will need to be tested in MS and its murine models.

We cannot assume that the reversal or improvement of a negative stimulus will have opposing beneficial effects in patients. We therefore relied on an interventional study to improve diet and reduce plasma lipids in individuals with MS. Along with improvements in clinical motor function, people with MS who consumed a Mediterranean diet had lower blood leukocyte levels and hematopoietic activation. These changes might be due to reduced myeloid cells differentiation and lineage commitment. These observations demonstrate that lifestyle factors that improve MS associate with reduced myelopoiesis, monocytosis, neutrophilia, and systemic inflammation. This raises the possibility that lifestyle interventions, including improving diet and increasing and consolidating sleep, can restrain myelopoiesis and systemic leukocytosis to improve MS outcomes.

Our data begin to elucidate the temporal dynamics of myelopoiesis in MS and its preclinical models and offer cellular and molecular mechanisms connecting lifestyle to M-CSF regulated myeloid cell production, CNS inflammation, and MS. Lifestyle intervention should continue to be a focus of MS management and care and adopting peripheral inflammatory testing and monocyte enumeration, in association with disease stage, may provide new insights into a patient's disease progression. Altogether, our data begin to resolve the contribution of myelopoiesis to MS.

### A child with transient neurologic deficits and headache associated with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis [^1135Xc4m]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 10-year-old girl who had several episodes of severe headache, altered consciousness, and temporary neurologic signs and symptoms within a 2-month period. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased protein. Extensive microbiologic investigation and neuroimaging studies were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid findings were normalized within a 3-month period, and the patient has not had further episodes through 15 months of follow-up. This combination of symptoms represents a benign, monophasic illness without further progression. The etiology, however, remains unclear.

### Pathological inflammation in patients with COVID-19: a key role for monocytes and macrophages [^1121dN4i]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 200,000 deaths worldwide. Several studies have now established that the hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. Macrophages are a population of innate immune cells that sense and respond to microbial threats by producing inflammatory molecules that eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair. However, a dysregulated macrophage response can be damaging to the host, as is seen in the macrophage activation syndrome induced by severe infections, including in infections with the related virus SARS-CoV. Here we describe the potentially pathological roles of macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss ongoing and prospective therapeutic strategies to modulate macrophage activation in patients with COVID-19.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): focus on peripheral blood cell morphology [^116znzzg]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Numerous studies have shown peculiar morphological anomalies in COVID-19 patients' smears. We searched all the peer-reviewed scientific publications that explicitly reference the cytomorphological alterations on peripheral blood smears of patients with COVID-19. We extracted data from sixty-five publications (case reports, patient group studies, reviews, and erythrocyte morphology studies). The results show that frequent alterations concern the morphology of lymphocytes (large lymphocytes with weakly basophilic cytoplasm, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, large granular lymphocytes). Neutrophils display abnormal nuclei and cytoplasm in a distinctive cytomorphological picture. Besides a left shift in maturation, granulations can be increased (toxic type) or decreased with areas of basophilia. Nuclei are often hyposegmented (pseudo-Pelger-Huёt anomaly). Apoptotic or pycnotic cells are not uncommon. Monocytes typically have a large cytoplasm loaded with heterogeneous and coalescing vacuoles. Platelets show large and giant shapes. The presence of erythrocyte fragments and schistocytes is especially evident in the forms of COVID-19 that are associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. Such atypia of blood cells reflects the generalized activation in severe COVID-19, which has been demonstrated with immunophenotypic, molecular, genetic, and functional methods. Neutrophils, in particular, are involved in the pathophysiology of hyperinflammation with cytokine storm, which characterizes the most unfavorable evolution.

3 Monocytic and Myelomonocytic Leukemias

Mature and immature monocytes are usually part of the malignant clone in diverse myeloid neoplasms, including myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and myeloid leukemias. Chronic leukemias typically presenting with monocytosis include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) where only absolute monocytosis is found, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), where relative and absolute monocytosis are usually present (Table 3). Clonal monocytes in CMML and other chronic myeloid neoplasms are CD14+ cells. In myelomonocytic and monocytic AML, clonal monocytic cells may also be detected. A morphologic classification of monocytic cells and their progenitors detectable in myeloid leukemias, together with morphologic criteria, is shown in Table S5.

Patients with JMML usually present with splenomegaly, leukocytosis and monocytosis, and a hypercellular BM. Blast cells may be increased but are less than 20%. CMML is usually diagnosed in adults and defined by relative and absolute monocytosis. In most cases, leukocytosis and splenomegaly are detected. Depending on the blast count, CMML is split into CMML‐1 (BM blasts < 10% and PB blasts < 5%) and CMML‐2 (BM blasts 10%–19%, circulating blasts 5%–19%). In both JMML and CMML, the presence of AML and CML must be excluded by definition. However, both types of neoplasms can transform into overt (secondary) AML.

Based on the 2022‐updated WHO classification (5th Edition), many AML variants are defined by molecular and cytogenetic aberrations. However, two types of AML are defined by monocytic differentiation, namely acute myelomonocytic leukemia (myelomonocytic AML) and acute monocytic leukemia (monocytic AML). For myelomonocytic AML, the following criteria apply: (i) at least 20% of all cells are monocytes or monocyte precursors, (ii) ≥ 20% of cells are maturing granulocytic cells, and (iii) ≥ 3% of the blasts are positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO). Monocytic AML is defined by the following criteria: (i) ≥ 80% of cells are monocytes and/or monocyte precursors, (ii) < 20% of cells are maturing granulocytes, and iii) blasts and promonocytes (monocytic cells) must express at least two of the following markers: CD11c, CD14, CD36, or CD64 or show non‐specific esterase (NSE) positivity.
