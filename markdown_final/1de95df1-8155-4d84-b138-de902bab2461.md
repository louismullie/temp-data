## Question

work up for chronic vaping with vague chest pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic workup and management for a patient who chronically vapes and presents with vague chest pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and risk stratification, including a confidential, detailed vaping exposure and cardiac risk profile. Then, I should verify red flags on exam with vitals and bedside tests. Next, I will review initial labs and radiography to exclude life-threatening causes and gather data for EVALI, followed by triage decisions on disposition. After that, I need to consider escalated imaging pathways for pulmonary and cardiac etiologies, then solidify the diagnosis and differential. Finally, I will outline initial management, cessation counseling, and follow-up monitoring; let me ensure each step aligns with CDC EVALI guidance and the 2021 AHA/ACC Chest Pain Guideline before proceeding.

> Let me first confirm the history elements that will determine pretest probabilities. I need to ask nonjudgmentally and confidentially about e-cigarette or vaping exposures, distinguishing THC from nicotine, product sources (informal vs commercial), delivery system, frequency, depth of inhalation, and timing of symptom onset relative to use, because THC products from informal sources have been especially implicated; I should also clarify prior cigarette smoking and any device modifications; wait, I should verify whether recent use occurred within 90 days, as that affects EVALI consideration [^115X89PZ] [^115p13rH]. I should characterize the chest pain per the 2021 Chest Pain Guideline as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac, probing quality, exertional nature, pleuritic features, radiation, triggers, and associated dyspnea, cough, fever, GI or constitutional symptoms, while I calculate CAD pretest probability based on age, sex, symptoms, and risk factors like HTN, DM, lipids, tobacco, and family history; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — "atypical" descriptors should be avoided in favor of risk-aligned terminology [^1167Fmeu] [^114xXuB7] [^111o6SQd].

> Next, I should review vitals and perform a focused exam to identify red flags that change disposition. I need to check pulse oximetry carefully because room-air O2 saturation under 95% warrants strong consideration for admission in suspected EVALI; tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever also increase concern, and altitude may affect interpretation; wait, I should verify stability trends over time, not just one reading [^112eBsZf] [^116hHYeD]. I will examine the lungs for wheeze or crackles that can accompany EVALI, assess the chest wall for reproducible tenderness suggesting costochondritis, and perform a cardiovascular exam for murmurs, rubs, gallops, and signs of heart failure; I should also screen for DVT findings if PE is on the table, and I will obtain a 12-lead ECG in all chest pain patients to assess for ACS or myopericarditis patterns before I anchor on a pulmonary explanation [^1137PREg] [^113j7KKi] [^1167Fmeu].

> I will now examine the initial diagnostic testing that helps rule out immediately life-threatening conditions and supports or argues against EVALI. I should confirm baseline labs including CBC with differential for leukocytosis, ESR/CRP for systemic inflammation, BMP for renal function, high-sensitivity troponin if any cardiac concern, and D-dimer if PE probability warrants; during respiratory virus season, I need to test for influenza and other respiratory viruses because co-infection can coexist with EVALI; but wait, a normal inflammatory panel does not exclude EVALI, so I must integrate all data points [^1137PREg] [^116hHYeD]. I need to obtain a chest radiograph in any vaper with respiratory, GI, or constitutional symptoms and low O2 saturation; classic findings are bilateral infiltrates, yet a normal CXR does not rule out EVALI, so I should escalate to CT if clinical suspicion remains high or disease is severe or worsening [^111BXeQB] [^1137PREg].

> Now I need to determine acuity and the need for hospitalization. I should double-check if O2 saturation is below 95% on room air, if there is any respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, or comorbidity reducing pulmonary reserve; these are admission triggers; hold on, reliable follow-up and social supports matter if I consider outpatient care [^112eBsZf]. Outpatient management requires O2 saturation at or above 95%, no respiratory distress, reliable access to care, robust social support, clear return precautions, and follow-up within 24–48 hours, recognizing that some EVALI patients deteriorate rapidly within 48 hours; I need to ensure the patient understands strict return criteria before discharge [^116hHYeD].

> If initial tests are non-diagnostic or complications are suspected, I should escalate imaging thoughtfully. Chest CT is indicated when CXR is abnormal or discordant with clinical findings, when disease is severe or worsening, or when complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum are suspected; let me verify CT pattern expectations to avoid misclassification [^111BXeQB]. Typical EVALI CT shows bilateral ground-glass opacities often with subpleural sparing and may span a spectrum from organizing pneumonia to diffuse alveolar damage with crazy paving, consolidation, centrilobular nodules, and occasional effusions; recognizing this spectrum helps distinguish EVALI from other CT mimics, but I must still exclude infection and PE as appropriate [^112xSWzQ] [^115p13rH]. For possibly cardiac pain at intermediate risk, I should consider stress testing or coronary CTA; for low-intermediate risk stable chest pain, coronary CTA is reasonable; and if PE is suspected with high clinical probability, CTA-PE protocol is indicated; let me ensure the test selection matches the pretest probability and ECG interpretability [^1177vooc] [^117DnGBq] [^115vC1G4].

> Definitive diagnosis requires careful exclusion of alternatives, so I should proceed methodically. EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion anchored by recent vaping exposure within 90 days, imaging abnormalities, and no better explanation; I need to rule out influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and COVID-19 given clinical and imaging overlap; wait, if coinfection is present, EVALI can still coexist, so dual management may be needed [^112fxVnj] [^113ZUfmh] [^115p13rH]. I should also consider pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum related to device use, pulmonary embolism using validated rules, ACS in those with intermediate/high cardiac risk, myopericarditis with cardiac MRI if troponin-positive and coronary anatomy is nonobstructive, and musculoskeletal or GI sources such as costochondritis or GERD if pain is reproducible or reflux-associated; I should double-check that my workup does not prematurely close on a single diagnosis [^117DtUWw] [^112AZwRf] [^111g2gsb] [^1127gdJb] [^113j7KKi].

> Turning to initial management, I need to ensure infections are reasonably excluded before starting corticosteroids for suspected EVALI, since steroids can mask infection; if co-infection is plausible, I should initiate empiric antimicrobials and antivirals per season and local patterns while awaiting results; supportive care includes oxygen supplementation and bronchodilators for wheeze; let me reassess frequently for early deterioration in the first 24–48 hours [^116hHYeD]. If ACS is suggested, I should follow guideline-directed protocols; for myopericarditis, NSAIDs, colchicine, and monitoring are appropriate; universally, I must deliver vaping cessation counseling with evidence-based behavioral and pharmacologic supports, and arrange addiction medicine input if dependence is present; I should also update influenza and consider pneumococcal vaccination per guidance, especially in those with EVALI history [^112evvxW] [^115pMfmb] [^114miqfu].

> For follow-up and longitudinal monitoring, I should confirm timing and content before discharge. After inpatient EVALI care, follow-up within 1–2 weeks should include pulse oximetry and often repeat CXR, with additional testing at 1–2 months such as spirometry, DLCO, and imaging; wait, I should verify the need for home oxygen if hypoxemia persists and ensure pulmonary follow-up is established [^114miqfu]. For stable outpatients, I should arrange check-in within 24–48 hours and instruct immediate return if symptoms worsen; patients may relapse during steroid taper or on resuming vaping, so I need to reinforce cessation and monitor for adrenal suppression if high-dose steroids were used with endocrinology support as needed [^116hHYeD] [^114miqfu].

> Summarizing key points to ensure nothing is missed: EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires a high index of suspicion in vapers with respiratory, GI, or constitutional symptoms; pulse oximetry drives disposition, with O2 saturation below 95% favoring admission; imaging begins with CXR and escalates to CT when indicated; classic CT shows bilateral ground-glass opacities with subpleural sparing along an OP–DAD spectrum; a parallel cardiac evaluation should follow 2021 chest pain guidance given the vagueness of pain; management includes cautious corticosteroid use after excluding infection, empiric antimicrobials if co-infection is possible, strict vaping cessation, and close follow-up due to risk of rapid deterioration and long-term sequelae; let me double-check that return precautions and follow-up are explicit before concluding care [^112fxVnj] [^111BXeQB] [^112eBsZf] [^116hHYeD] [^112xSWzQ] [^115p13rH] [^111g2gsb] [^1177vooc] [^112evvxW] [^114miqfu].

For chronic vaping with vague chest pain, start with a **focused history and exam** to characterize pain, quantify vaping exposure, and assess cardiovascular risk [^1167Fmeu]. Obtain an **ECG and troponin**, plus CBC, CMP, CRP/ESR, and spirometry with DLCO; add D-dimer if PE is suspected [^114xXuB7] [^113G3N6G]. Obtain a **chest X-ray for all patients** [^111BXeQB], and use **chest CT** if symptoms persist or worsen to assess for EVALI, pneumothorax, or bullous disease [^112xSWzQ] [^117DtUWw]. Use echocardiography or stress testing if cardiac ischemia is suspected, and consider bronchoscopy with BAL if infection or alternative diagnoses remain unclear [^11336juV] [^111BXeQB]. Emphasize **vaping cessation**, arrange close follow-up, and escalate care for hypoxemia or respiratory distress [^112evvxW] [^114miqfu].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A **focused clinical history and physical examination** are essential to characterize chest pain, quantify vaping exposure, and identify cardiovascular and pulmonary risk factors [^115LJqAN].

- **Chest pain characterization**: Onset, duration, location, radiation, intensity, quality, aggravating and relieving factors, and associated symptoms (dyspnea, cough, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms) [^1167Fmeu] [^111g2gsb].

- **Vaping history**: Duration, frequency, type of devices, substances used (nicotine, THC, CBD, flavorings), source of products, and recent changes in vaping habits [^115swexB].

- **Cardiovascular risk assessment**: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, family history of coronary artery disease, and other traditional risk factors [^1167Fmeu].

- **Physical examination**: Vital signs, pulse oximetry, cardiovascular and respiratory examination, including assessment for signs of respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or abnormal lung sounds [^115X89PZ] [^115LJqAN].

---

## Initial diagnostic testing

Initial diagnostic testing should focus on **excluding life-threatening conditions** and identifying potential vaping-related lung injury [^112PoAtR].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To exclude acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or other cardiac abnormalities [^114xXuB7].

- **Cardiac biomarkers**: High-sensitivity troponin to exclude myocardial injury [^114EVwNi].

- **Basic laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and D-dimer if pulmonary embolism is suspected [^113G3N6G].

- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Spirometry with diffusion capacity (DLCO) to assess for obstructive or restrictive lung disease and impaired gas exchange [^114miqfu].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are critical in evaluating **vaping-related lung injury** and excluding other pulmonary conditions. Obtain a **chest radiograph (CXR)** as the initial study to evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates, pneumothorax, or other abnormalities [^111BXeQB], and use **chest computed tomography (CT)** if symptoms persist or worsen or if the CXR is abnormal [^1127FkCx]. CT findings in vaping-related lung injury (EVALI) include bilateral ground-glass opacities, organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, and occasionally pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum [^112xSWzQ].

---

## Advanced diagnostic testing

Advanced diagnostic testing may be necessary if initial evaluations are inconclusive or if specific conditions are suspected. Use transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate cardiac function, valvular disease, or pericardial effusion when cardiac involvement is suspected [^1141H6C8]. If myocardial ischemia is suspected, perform cardiac stress testing with exercise ECG or stress imaging (echocardiography, PET/SPECT, or cardiac MRI) [^11336juV]. Consider bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage when infection, eosinophilic pneumonia, or other alternative diagnoses are suspected [^111BXeQB].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for chronic vaping-associated chest pain includes:

- **Vaping-related lung injury (EVALI)**: Bilateral ground-glass opacities, organizing pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage [^112xSWzQ].

- **Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum**: Associated with vaping, particularly THC-containing products [^111BXeQB].

- **Bronchial hyperreactivity or asthma-like symptoms**: Common in chronic vapers [^116Amebj].

- **Cardiac ischemia or myocarditis**: Rare but possible, particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [^1127gdJb].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Common non-cardiac cause of chest pain [^1176TnuN].

---

## Management and follow-up

Management and follow-up focus on **vaping cessation** to prevent further lung injury and symptom recurrence, with supportive care such as oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids when indicated [^1137PREg]. Monitor symptoms, pulmonary function, and imaging findings at close follow-up, and provide education on vaping risks and the importance of cessation [^114miqfu].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Indications for specialist referral include persistent or worsening symptoms despite initial evaluation and management, abnormal imaging or pulmonary function tests suggesting significant lung injury, and suspected or confirmed cardiac involvement. Referral is also appropriate for complex cases requiring multidisciplinary management [^111BXeQB] [^1134Pcvn].

---

A **structured approach** to chronic vaping with vague chest pain includes a focused history and physical examination; initial diagnostic testing and imaging studies; advanced diagnostic testing; a clear differential diagnosis; and management with follow-up. This approach helps identify vaping-related lung injury and other potential causes, guiding appropriate management and specialist referral [^113ZUfmh] [^111o6SQd].

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers for managing patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury - United States, November 2019 [^114miqfu]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

Health care providers should emphasize the importance of annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months, including their patients who use e-cigarette or vaping products. It is not known whether patients with EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury) are at higher risk for severe complications of influenza or other respiratory infections. In addition, the administration of pneumococcal vaccine should be considered for patients with a history of EVALI according to guidelines.

- **Postdischarge follow-up**: Patients discharged from the hospital after inpatient treatment for EVALI should have a follow-up visit within 1–2 weeks. The follow-up evaluation should include pulse-oximetry and consideration of a repeat CXR. Additional follow-up testing 1–2 months after discharge might include spirometry, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, and CXR.

Long-term effects and the risk for recurrence of EVALI are not known. Although many patients' symptoms resolved, clinicians report that some patients have relapsed during corticosteroid tapers or with resumption of e-cigarette or vaping product use after hospitalization, underscoring the need for cessation and close follow-up. Some patients have had persistent hypoxemia requiring home oxygen at discharge and might require ongoing pulmonary follow-up. Patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids might require care from an endocrinologist to monitor adrenal function.

Health care providers should also advise patients with a history of EVALI to return for further evaluation and management as necessary.

### CT findings and patterns of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury: A multicenter cohort of 160 cases [^112xSWzQ]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Previous literature has suggested that imaging findings in patients with EVALI may result from a broad range of underlying pathologic mechanisms. The results presented in this paper confirm that most patients with EVALI have CT imaging findings along a spectrum ranging from OP to DAD, which can mimic causes of ALI due to various factors. These include diffuse or lower lobe predominant GGO with or without consolidation that may demonstrate areas of subpleural or lobular sparing. As such, vaping exposure should be included in the clinical history of all patients with CT findings of ALI without another known cause, particularly if they are young and otherwise healthy. Furthermore, some patients in this EVALI cohort demonstrated CT findings less commonly seen in other etiologies of ALI, including superimposed upper lobe predominant CNs and PBV sparing. When these findings are present along with the more typically seen manifestations of ALI, suspicion for EVALI should be elevated.

- **Take-home points**:
	- **Study question**: What are the frequencies of imaging findings and CT patterns in e-cigarette or vaping-induced lung injury (EVALI) and what is the relationship to vaping behavior?
	- **Results**: Our multicenter study shows that most patients with EVALI have CT imaging findings along a spectrum ranging from organizing pneumonia to diffuse alveolar damage, which can mimic causes of acute lung injury due to various reasons. These include diffuse or lower lobe predominant ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation that often demonstrate areas of subpleural…

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^111BXeQB]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Radiographic findings consistent with EVALI include pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) and opacities on chest computed tomography (CT) scan. A CXR should be obtained for all patients with a history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use who have respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly when accompanied by decreased O2 saturation (< 95%).

Chest CT might be useful when the CXR result does not correlate with clinical findings or to evaluate severe or worsening disease, complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, or other illnesses in the differential diagnosis, such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. In some cases, chest CT has demonstrated findings such as bilateral ground glass opacities despite a normal or nondiagnostic CXR. Among patients with abnormal CXR findings and a clinical picture consistent with EVALI, a chest CT scan might not be necessary for diagnosis. The decision to obtain a chest CT should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the clinical circumstances.

Consultation with several specialists might be necessary to optimize patient management. For patients being evaluated for possible EVALI, consideration should be given to consultation with a pulmonologist, who can help guide further evaluation, recommend empiric treatment, and review the indications for bronchoscopy. The decision to perform bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to rule out alternative diagnoses, such as pulmonary infection, should be made on a case-by-case basis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-small cell lung cancer, specifically in relation to initial evaluation, the ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining additional imaging for metastases in patients with known or suspected lung cancer with abnormal clinical evaluations and no suspicious extrathoracic abnormalities on chest CT. PET scans, where available, should be obtained to evaluate for metastases (except in the brain) in patients with a normal clinical evaluation and no suspicious extrathoracic abnormalities on chest CT who are eligible for curative-intent treatment.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: Diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost [^116Ensqc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Table 2 shows the distribution of patients based on the characteristics of the pain. The pain was non-anginal in 37% of cases (43% of women, 30% of men), atypical in 52% of cases, and typical in 11% of cases. No functional or anatomical tests were performed in patients with non-anginal pain, and no cardiovascular events occurred in one year of follow-up in this group.

	- In all 372 patients with typical chest pain, coronary angiography was performed, and revascularization was carried out in 82% of cases. In 1706 patients with atypical chest pain, the pre-test probability (PPT) was calculated, and functional or anatomical tests were performed for the detection of possible ischemia. The test was positive in 6% of patients with PPT 15% to 65% and in 20% of those with PPT 66% to 85%, amounting to 170 patients (10%).

	- These patients underwent coronary angiography. Sixteen patients with atypical chest pain and negative functional tests also underwent coronary angiography. In 14 patients, it was negative, and in two patients, non-obstructive coronary heart disease was identified.

	- Table 4 shows the main basal characteristics of the 1636 patients with negative functional or anatomical testing, stratified for at least one risky lifestyle factor. A total of 27% of patients had non-risky lifestyles, while 73% had one or more risky lifestyle factors. At the one-year follow-up, 1% (9 males, 6 females) of the patients had experienced a coronary event, including four sudden deaths, three non-fatal ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs), and eight non-fatal non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, particularly with respect to history and physical examination, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend not describing chest pain as atypical, as it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Instead, describe chest pain as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac, as these terms specifically relate to the potential underlying diagnosis.

### Costochondritis: Rapid evidence review [^113j7KKi]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to the evaluation for non-cardiac causes such as costochondritis, the AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend eliciting a history and performing a physical examination. This examination should focus on reproducing pain through direct palpation of the parasternal region and/or with provocation maneuvers like the crowing rooster or crossed-chest adduction for the diagnosis of costochondritis.

### Reporting of pneumothorax in association with vaping devices and electronic cigarettes [^117DtUWw]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In October 2019, a 34-year-old white male presented to his general practitioner with a 1-day history of back pain, shortness of breath, tightness in his chest, burning pain in his right chest, retrosternal pain, and dizziness. Symptoms began after minor exertion during the afternoon on the day before presentation.

His medical history revealed no specific health problems during adolescence. Apart from a few rib fractures on his right side sustained in a cycling accident 3 years ago, his medical record was otherwise unremarkable. There was no family history of lung disease. The patient, a trained nurse, worked in outpatient palliative care and devoted his free time to strength training and competitive sports. He had regular health checks, which all returned negative for infectious diseases, due to his occupation. He had no recent sports-related trauma to his chest.

Despite being an active and internationally successful athlete, he smoked 20 cigarettes per day from the age of 21 to 31. Three years ago, he quit smoking by switching to vaping nicotine and never smoked or vaped cannabis. He reported using a pattern of regular deep and slow inhalation with the vaping device throughout the day, similar to smoking a pack of cigarettes.

### Overview of pathologic findings of vaping in the context of an autopsy patient with chronic injury [^112qmotJ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Electronic cigarettes are handheld devices that heat an inner liquid containing chemicals to be aerosolized and inhaled, and they have become a popular alternative to conventional cigarettes. Their use, termed vaping, has been linked to severe injury, with 2,711 cases of associated lung injury and 60 deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the time of writing. Published case reports and series have emerged detailing clinical and imaging characteristics of vaping-induced lung injury. However, the pathologic characteristics of these induced injuries are still being established, particularly findings occurring over time.

The objective of this study is to illustrate the autopsy findings of an older patient who died of vaping-induced injury after prolonged symptomatology and to provide a review of the most recent literature regarding the basic science, epidemiology, clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, and pathology of vaping-induced lung injury.

Data sources include an autopsy case and peer-reviewed literature.

Vaping-induced lung injury has emerged as a public health issue, and this case represents a rare opportunity to evaluate this issue at autopsy. Most commonly, the injury has been attributed to tetrahydrocannabinol product use as opposed to nicotine. This case demonstrates that as today's young and relatively healthy "vapers" grow older and develop the comorbidities that come with advanced age, there is a serious risk of chronic lung damage from vaping that could result in death. Further observations and studies, particularly autopsy evidence, are necessary to understand the full impact of vaping on lung health.

### A case of vaping-associated pulmonary illness in South America: Highlighting the need for awareness and surveillance programs in the region [^115z3sXz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department after one week of worsening symptoms, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, subjective fever, chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a persistent tension-like headache in the fronto-orbital region. On admission, his vital signs were blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg, heart rate 95/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 38.3°C, and 94% saturation at room air. During physical examination, the patient appeared diaphoretic and in visible distress, with scattered wheezes in both pulmonary fields. The rest of the examination was normal. His past medical history included seasonal allergic rhinitis and a four-year use of e-cigarettes, including various products containing tetrahydrocannabinol compounds. The patient was hospitalized with a presumptive diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis and possible asthma exacerbation.

Laboratory results were unremarkable, as were the levels of C-reactive protein. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses showed changes consistent with a chronic allergic or inflammatory process. An empiric course of antibiotics, intravenous hydration, and analgesia were initiated, as well as respiratory therapy with bronchodilators. Reevaluation 48 hours after initial hospitalization revealed partial improvement. However, the patient continued to complain, albeit to a lesser extent, of chest tightness and shortness of breath, prompting further imaging. A CT scan of the chest revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities, raising the suspicion of a vaping-associated pulmonary illness.

### Imaging in vaping-associated lung injury: Beyond the haze [^1127FkCx]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

E-cigarette or vaping product-associated lung injury is a rampant public health issue, with a total of 2,807 reported hospitalized patients in the United States as of February 18, 2020. Limited data, non-specific symptoms, non-responsiveness to antibiotics, and the lack of a specific biomarker make it a diagnosis of exclusion. The overlap of clinical and imaging findings with other ongoing respiratory illnesses (MERS, SARS, and COVID-19) poses a challenge in accurate diagnosis. We compiled three cases of patients hospitalized with confirmed vaping-associated lung injury and analyzed their imaging patterns, which revealed bilateral consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and pleural effusions. We also reviewed the available literature on the pathophysiology and imaging findings of EVALI and other respiratory illnesses.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to the evaluation of stable chest pain (known nonobstructive CAD), the 2021 guidelines from ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR recommend considering obtaining FFR for the diagnosis of vessel-specific ischemia. This aids in guiding decision-making regarding the use of invasive coronary angiography in patients with known coronary stenosis ranging from 40–90% on coronary CTA.

### A rare case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia induced by vaping-associated lung injury: A case report [^116Kkuk8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

AEP is a rare and serious condition characterized by nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and fever, typically present for less than four weeks. The modified Philit criteria are currently used to diagnose AEP, which include having an acute respiratory illness for less than or equal to one month, pulmonary infiltrates seen in chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT), more than 25% eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and the absence of other known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia. These criteria were entirely observed in our patient, with BAL showing 84% eosinophils. Patients typically present with normal peripheral blood eosinophil levels; however, levels can rise afterwards. This was the case in our patient; at the initial presentation, the peripheral blood eosinophil level was 2.3%, and after four days, it rose to 14.5%.

Differential diagnoses for AEP include eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, pulmonary fungal and parasitic infections, and medication-induced conditions. As it is crucial to consider all these differential diagnoses, they were ruled out in our patient before confirming the diagnosis of AEP.

While the disease can be idiopathic, a well-known form of AEP occurs following exposure to new inhalants. This mostly affects first-time cigarette smokers, firefighters exposed to high concentrations of World Trade Center dust, military service personnel in the Middle East, and recently, vape users. Our patient denied encountering any such exposure.

### Initial evaluation of chest pain [^1154pDne]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain is among the most frequently evaluated presenting complaints in the emergency department (ED). Diagnostic etiologies range from benign to life-threatening conditions. Failure to diagnose life-threatening chest emergencies — specifically acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism — can lead to catastrophic medical and legal outcomes for both the patient and the physician.

### E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury in adolescents: A review of imaging features [^113thCYu]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

There has been a recent increase in the recognition of lung disease related to the use of electronic cigarettes, commonly referred to as "vaping". These patients present with acute respiratory illness following exposure to vaporized cannabis or nicotine products, sometimes requiring hospitalization and intensive care. This review describes the imaging findings of this disease entity in the pediatric population.

- **Objective**: To describe the radiologic findings of lung injury associated with electronic cigarette use (vaping) in the adolescent pediatric population.

- **Materials and Methods**: We identified all adolescents with acute respiratory illness and a history of electronic cigarette use who presented at our institution within a 3-month period (June 2019 through August 2019). We excluded adolescents with potential interstitial pulmonary disease. We reviewed the charts for symptomatology, laboratory data, and pathology data. In addition, we reviewed the chest radiographs and chest CTs of these adolescents.

- **Results**: The review group consisted of 12 teenage pediatric patients (10 boys and 2 girls; mean age 16.9 years, range 16.0–17.7 years) with acute respiratory illness found to have a temporal association with electronic cigarette use for cannabis products, nicotine, or both. Other etiologies for illness in these adolescents had been excluded by clinical and laboratory evaluation. All of the adolescents were admitted to the hospital for treatment. The clinical presentations included dyspnea, abdominal pain, and constitutional symptoms. Pulmonary function testing was performed on all patients.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^112eBsZf]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

When managing patients with suspected e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI), several factors should be considered to decide whether hospital admission is necessary. Among the 1,002 cases reported to the CDC as of October 8, 96% of patients were hospitalized. Patients should be admitted if they have decreased O2 saturation (< 95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities compromising pulmonary reserve. Factors such as altitude should be considered when interpreting measured O2 saturation.

Outpatient management of suspected EVALI might be appropriate on a case-by-case basis for patients who are clinically stable, have less severe injury, and can assure follow-up within 24–48 hours of initial evaluation. Candidates for outpatient management should have normal O2 saturation (≥ 95%), reliable access to care, and strong social support systems. Empiric use of antimicrobials, including antivirals, if indicated, should be considered. Some patients with initially mild symptoms experienced rapid worsening within 48 hours. In Illinois and Wisconsin, 72% of patients had an outpatient or emergency department visit before seeking additional care resulting in hospital admission. Health care providers should instruct all patients to seek medical care promptly if respiratory symptoms worsen.

### PE mimics: A structured approach for the emergency radiologist in the evaluation of chest pain [^1176TnuN]. Emergency radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common reason for presentation to the emergency department. In many cases, a CTPA or CT thoracic aorta is performed during the workup to assess for pulmonary embolism and aortic pathology, which are critical diagnoses that can be difficult to rule out clinically. However, the causes of chest pain are myriad. It is therefore crucial for the interpreting radiologist to be cognizant of other potential etiologies when interpreting these studies. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to highlight the causes of non-PE or aortic-related chest pain and provide radiologists with a structured approach to interpreting these studies, ensuring a comprehensive search strategy so that important pathologies are not missed.

### Usefulness of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography as an initial diagnostic approach in patients with acute chest pain [^11476RoR]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Recently, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has been proposed as an accurate diagnostic tool to evaluate for coronary artery disease. However, the role of MDCT as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation for acute chest pain is less well established.

- **Methods**: We prospectively enrolled patients presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department (ED) and risk stratified them based on the pretest probability for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS): (1) very low, (2) low, (3) intermediate, (4) high, and (5) very high or definite. After excluding very low and very high-risk patients, 268 patients were randomized to either immediate 64-slice cardiac MDCT or a conventional diagnostic strategy. The number of admissions, ED and hospital length of stay (LOS), and major adverse cardiac events over 30 days of follow-up were compared between the strategies based on the pretest probability for ACS.

- **Results**: The number of patients ultimately diagnosed with an ACS did not differ between the two strategies. Emergency department LOS and total admissions were not different between strategies. Patients in the MDCT-based strategy had a decreased hospital LOS (P = 0.049) and fewer admissions deemed unnecessary (P = 0.007). Reductions in unnecessary admissions were more prominent in intermediate-risk patients (P = 0.015). None of the patients discharged from the ED in the MDCT-based strategy experienced major adverse cardiac events at follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: Use of an MDCT-based strategy in the ED as part of the initial diagnostic approach for patients presenting with acute chest pain appears beneficial, particularly in terms of reducing unnecessary admissions without compromising patient safety.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care professionals evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury and for reducing the risk for rehospitalization and death following hospital discharge - United States, December 2019 [^115pMfmb]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

To develop this updated clinical guidance, the CDC reviewed new data on rehospitalization and death after hospital discharge and consulted with the Lung Injury Response Clinical Working Group regarding approaches to the clinical management of suspected EVALI patients. Previous EVALI guidance has focused on:

- **Diagnosis**: Including obtaining an accurate history and conducting a physical examination that includes vital signs, pulmonary auscultation, and pulse oximetry; laboratory testing to rule out infectious etiologies; radiographic imaging; and consulting a specialist.

- **Inpatient and outpatient management**: Including consideration of empiric administration of corticosteroids and antimicrobials, if indicated.

- **Follow-up after hospital admission**.

- **Considerations during the influenza season**.

This updated guidance highlights health care system best practices for EVALI patients that might improve care quality and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes, including rehospitalization and death. Best practices include carefully assessing clinical readiness for discharge, comprehensive discharge planning (e.g. follow-up with specialty care providers), and ensuring follow-up by a primary care or pulmonary specialist, optimally within 48 hours of hospital discharge.

### Testing of low-risk patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114EVwNi]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

The management of low-risk patients presenting to emergency departments is a common and challenging clinical problem, entailing 8 million emergency department visits annually. Although a majority of these patients do not have a life-threatening condition, the clinician must distinguish between those who require urgent treatment of a serious problem and those with more benign entities who do not require admission. Inadvertent discharge of patients with acute coronary syndrome from the emergency department is associated with increased mortality and liability, whereas inappropriate admission of patients without serious disease is neither indicated nor cost-effective.

Clinical judgment and basic clinical tools (history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram) remain primary in meeting this challenge and providing early identification of low-risk patients with chest pain. Additionally, established and newer diagnostic methods have extended clinicians' diagnostic capacity in this setting. Low-risk patients presenting with chest pain are increasingly managed in chest pain units where accelerated diagnostic protocols are performed. These protocols comprise serial electrocardiograms and cardiac injury markers to exclude acute coronary syndrome. Patients with negative findings usually complete the accelerated diagnostic protocol with a confirmatory test to exclude ischemia. This is typically an exercise treadmill test, or a cardiac imaging study if the exercise treadmill test is not applicable. Rest myocardial perfusion imaging has assumed an important role in this setting.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers for managing patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury - United States, November 2019 [^115swexB]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Health care providers should interview patients regarding their use of e-cigarette or vaping products in a confidential and nonjudgmental manner when evaluating those with respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, chest pain, shortness of breath), gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), or constitutional symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, weight loss). Confidentiality is crucial when assessing sensitive information, including all forms of substance use, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Empathetic, nonjudgmental, and private questioning should be employed to encourage truthful disclosure.

The most critical step in assessing EVALI is to ask patients about recent use of e-cigarette or vaping products. If use is confirmed, the types of substances involved (e.g. THC and nicotine) and their sources should be identified. Evidence at the time of writing suggests products containing THC, especially those obtained from informal sources like friends, family members, or in-person or online dealers, are implicated. Therefore, clinicians may need to gather additional information to support ongoing investigations.

- **Algorithm for management**: Patients with respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms and e-cigarette or vaping product use may follow the outlined algorithm. Abbreviations include CT (computed tomography) and EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury).

- **Assessment of recent history**: Evaluating the recent history of e-cigarette or vaping product use is essential.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: Diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost [^114CUsLc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with stable, atypical pain and an intermediate pre-test probability (PPT) present a challenge for clinicians. In these patients, there is a residual risk of about 1% for fatal and non‐fatal events, which can hardly be reduced even with the most sophisticated diagnostic tests.

These patients represent a high risk for physicians due to the significant medical-legal implications that may follow if an event occurs. Physicians have two choices:

- **Diagnostic procedures**: They can get involved in very expensive and often useless diagnostic procedures since these do not modify the patient's prognosis.
- **Risk factor modification**: They can try to modify the risk factors and, above all, the lifestyles of the patients, which results in a clear improvement in prognosis. Our study demonstrated that the events rate was 1.2% in patients with risky lifestyles and 0.2% in those with correct lifestyles.

Particularly, heavy smokers with negative diagnostic tests have a high incidence of events, many of which are fatal.

### Back pain as the initial presentation of subacute bacterial endocarditis in a patient with a complex medical history [^112uD1Xb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) poses a diagnostic challenge due to its diverse clinical presentations, especially among high-risk groups. Diagnosis relies on integrating clinical presentation, blood cultures, and imaging findings. Advanced imaging techniques enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly in complex cases. Treatment involves antimicrobial therapy and surgery in complicated cases, with early intervention crucial for optimal outcomes. Coordinated care by an Endocarditis Team ensures tailored treatment plans, prompt complication management, and long-term monitoring after discharge. The authors present a case of subacute IE presenting initially with back pain in a patient with a complex medical history, highlighting diagnostic and management approaches.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^1134Pcvn]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical evaluation is essential for patients with suspected EVALI, as it is considered a diagnosis of exclusion due to the absence of specific tests or markers. Health care providers should consider multiple etiologies, including the possibility of EVALI in combination with other infections. Alternative diagnoses should be evaluated based on clinical findings and the patient's medical history, such as cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic processes, environmental or occupational exposures, or causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

- **Patient history**: According to medical chart abstraction data submitted to the CDC, 95% of patients diagnosed with EVALI initially experienced respiratory symptoms like cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath, while 77% had gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In some patients, gastrointestinal symptoms preceded respiratory symptoms. Additionally, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, and weight loss in 85% of patients.

### Pleuritic chest pain: Sorting through the differential diagnosis [^113G3N6G]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pleuritic chest pain is characterized by sudden and intense sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the chest when inhaling and exhaling. Pulmonary embolism is the most common serious cause, found in 5% to 21% of patients who present to an emergency department with pleuritic chest pain. A validated clinical decision rule for pulmonary embolism should be employed to guide the use of additional tests such as d-dimer assays, ventilation-perfusion scans, or computed tomography angiography.

Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax are other serious causes that should be ruled out using history and physical examination, electrocardiography, troponin assays, and chest radiography before another diagnosis is made. Validated clinical decision rules are available to help exclude coronary artery disease.

Viruses are common causative agents of pleuritic chest pain. Coxsackieviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are likely pathogens. Treatment is guided by the underlying diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for pain management in those with virally triggered or nonspecific pleuritic chest pain. In patients with persistent symptoms, persons who smoke, and those older than 50 years with pneumonia, it is important to document radiographic resolution with repeat chest radiography six weeks after initial treatment.

### Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article [^115p13rH]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Electronic cigarettes, commonly referred to as vaping devices, are designed to aerosolize nicotine and a mixture of chemical components, promoted as safer alternatives to traditional tobacco smoking.

Cases have been identified where acute respiratory symptoms, detected through CT and histopathologic lung abnormalities, were present in patients with a history of vaping. This linkage has led to the recognition of e-cigarette or vaping product use–associated lung injury (EVALI).

EVALI typically affects younger individuals, with 79% of patients being younger than 35 years. The clinical presentation includes a combination of respiratory symptoms (such as cough, dyspnea, and chest pain), gastrointestinal issues, and constitutional symptoms. Discontinuation of vaping and steroid therapy often result in rapid clinical improvement and recovery.

The diagnosis of EVALI relies heavily on a recent history of vaping (within 90 days) in conjunction with acute respiratory symptoms and CT lung abnormalities, while also excluding other potential causes.

CT imaging reveals various patterns of lung involvement, most commonly seen as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and organizing pneumonia (OP). The CT findings in EVALI demonstrate multiple, bilateral, hazy ground-glass opacities (GGO) that are centrally distributed with subpleural sparing, visible along the chest wall and mediastinum surface. Consolidations may be present but typically to a lesser extent than GGO.

Occasionally, pleural effusion and interlobular septal thickening are noted, resulting in a crazy paving pattern. Centrilobular nodules frequently appear, usually showing a distribution in the upper lobes.

Confidentiality is essential when assessing sensitive information, including all forms of substance use, especially for young adults and adolescents. Empathetic, nonjudgmental, and private questioning of patients to encourage truthful disclosure should be employed. Repeat questioning might elicit additional information about exposures as trust is established.

The strongest evidence at the time of writing implicates products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), particularly those obtained from informal sources like friends, family members, or in-person or online dealers. Therefore, it is important to ascertain the following information:

- **Substance details**:
	- **Types of substances used**: THC or cannabis (specify if oil or dabs), nicotine, modified products, or the addition of substances (e.g. addition of vitamin E acetate)
- **Product source**
- **Product brand and name**
- **Duration and frequency of use**
- **Time of last use**
- **Product delivery system**
- **Method of use**: Aerosolization, dabbing, or dripping

- **Physical examination**: The physical exam should include assessment of vital signs and pulse oximetry; tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia have been commonly reported among cases.

- **Laboratory testing and imaging studies**: Laboratory testing should be guided by clinical findings to evaluate multiple etiologies, including the possibility of EVALI and concomitant infection. A chest radiograph (CXR) should be considered.

Consideration of outpatient management. Some patients with a recent history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use who are evaluated for respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms might be candidates for outpatient management. Hospital admission should be strongly considered for patients with concurrent illnesses such as influenza and suspected EVALI, especially if respiratory distress, comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve, or decreased oxygen saturation (< 95% while breathing room air) are present. Candidates for outpatient management should have normal oxygen saturation (≥ 95%), no respiratory distress, no comorbidities that might compromise pulmonary reserve, reliable access to care, strong social support systems, and should be able to ensure follow-up within 24–48 hours of initial evaluation and to seek medical care promptly if respiratory symptoms worsen; in some cases, patients who initially had mild symptoms experienced a rapid worsening of symptoms within 48 hours. Additional follow-up might be indicated based on clinical findings.

Influenza testing and empiric antimicrobial treatment. Influenza testing should be strongly considered, particularly during the influenza season. It might be difficult to differentiate EVALI, a diagnosis of exclusion, from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia on initial assessment, and EVALI might co-occur with respiratory infections. Treatment with empiric antimicrobials, including antivirals, should be considered in accordance with established guidelines and local microbiology and resistance patterns.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^113ZUfmh]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

As of October 8, 2019, 49 states, the District of Columbia, and one territorial health department have reported 1,299 cases of EVALI to the CDC, with 26 deaths reported from 21 states (median age of death = 49 years, range = 17–75 years). Among 1,043 patients with available data on age and sex, 70% were male, and the median age was 24 years (range = 13–75 years). Of these patients, 80% were aged < 35 years, and 15% were aged < 18 years.

Among 573 patients who reported information on substances used in e-cigarette, or vaping, products in the 90 days preceding symptom onset, 76% reported using THC-containing products, and 58% reported using nicotine-containing products. Additionally, 32% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products, and 13% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. No single compound or ingredient has emerged as the cause of these injuries at the time of writing, and there might be more than one cause. Available data suggest THC-containing products play a role in this outbreak, but the specific chemical or chemicals responsible for EVALI have not yet been identified, and nicotine-containing products have not been excluded as a possible cause.

Ongoing federal and state investigations have provided information about the clinical characteristics of cases, and a surveillance case definition for confirmed and probable cases has been developed. This case definition is not intended to guide clinical care. To inform the CDC's updated interim clinical guidance, on October 2, 2019, the CDC obtained individual expert perspectives on the evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected EVALI.

### Value and limitations of chest pain history in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes [^111g2gsb]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

The chest pain history, physical examination, determination of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, and the initial electrocardiogram compose the information immediately available to clinicians to help determine the probability of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with chest pain. However, conflicting data exist about the usefulness of the chest pain history and which components are most useful.

- **Objective**: To identify the elements of the chest pain history that may be most helpful to the clinician in identifying ACS in patients presenting with chest pain.

- **Evidence acquisition**: MEDLINE and Ovid were searched from 1970 to September 2005 using specific keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms. Reference lists of these articles and cardiology textbooks were also consulted.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Certain chest pain characteristics decrease the likelihood of ACS or AMI, namely, pain that is stabbing, pleuritic, positional, or reproducible by palpation (likelihood ratios [LRs] 0.2–0.3). Conversely, chest pain that radiates to one shoulder or both shoulders or arms, or is precipitated by exertion is associated with LRs (2.3–4.7) that increase the likelihood of ACS. The chest pain history itself has not proven to be a powerful enough predictive tool to obviate the need for at least some diagnostic testing. Combinations of elements of the chest pain history with other initially available information, such as a history of CAD, have identified certain groups that may be safe for discharge without further evaluation.

### Update: Characteristics of patients in a national outbreak of E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injuries - United States, October 2019 [^112Prp1h]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Among the 29 EVALI-associated deaths reported to the CDC as of October 15, 2019, 59% (17 individuals) were male. The median age was 45 years (range = 17–75 years) overall: 55 years (range = 17–71 years) among males, and 43 years (range = 27–75 years) among females. The age difference between males and females was not statistically significant (p = 0.5). Patients who died were older than those who survived (p < 0.01).

Among 19 EVALI patients who died and for whom data on substance use was available, 84% (16 individuals) reported the use of any THC-containing products, including 63% (12 individuals) who exclusively used THC-containing products. Use of any nicotine-containing products was reported by 37% (seven individuals), including 16% (three individuals) who exclusively used nicotine-containing products. Use of both THC- and nicotine-containing products was reported in four decedents.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^112evvxW]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

It is unknown if patients with a history of EVALI are at higher risk for severe complications of influenza or other respiratory viral infections if they are infected simultaneously or after recovering from lung injury. Health care providers should emphasize the importance of annual vaccination against influenza for all persons over 6 months of age, including patients with a history of EVALI. In addition, administration of the pneumococcal vaccine should be considered according to guidelines.

- **Addressing exposures**: Advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products should be an integral part of the care approach during an inpatient admission and should be re-emphasized during outpatient follow-up. Cessation of e-cigarette, or vaping, products might speed recovery from this injury; resuming use of these products has the potential to cause recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. Evidence-based tobacco product cessation strategies include behavioral counseling and FDA-approved cessation medications. For patients who have an addiction to THC-containing or nicotine-containing products, cognitive-behavioral therapy, contingency management, motivational enhancement therapy, and multidimensional family therapy have been shown to help, and consultation with addiction medicine services should be considered.

- **Special considerations for groups at high risk**: Patients with certain characteristics or comorbidities, including older age, history of cardiac or lung disease, or pregnancy, might be at higher risk for more severe outcomes.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^115PLUvA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before or soon after discharge.

### Non-traumatic thoracic emergencies: Acute chest pain: Diagnostic strategies [^116P7Rkx]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain may represent the initial and/or accompanying symptom in a variety of disease processes that may occur in the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, or musculoskeletal system. Although clinical history, risk factors, and physical examination are important factors in establishing the etiology of symptoms in patients presenting with acute chest pain, imaging modalities are frequently utilized. Noncardiac causes of acute chest pain are reviewed in this paper with special reference to the most recently published literature and emphasis on acute aortic diseases. Imaging modalities with indication of appropriateness, optimal technique, and practical keys for interpretation are discussed.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers for managing patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury - United States, November 2019 [^112fxVnj]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

The CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and public health and clinical stakeholders are investigating a nationwide outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI). The CDC has published recommendations for health care providers regarding EVALI. Recently, researchers from Utah and New York proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithms for EVALI.

EVALI remains a diagnosis of exclusion because, at present, no specific test or marker exists for its diagnosis; evaluation should be guided by clinical judgment. Patients with EVALI can experience symptoms similar to those of influenza or other respiratory infections, such as fever, cough, headache, myalgias, or fatigue. This similarity might make it difficult to differentiate EVALI from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia on initial assessment. Furthermore, EVALI might co-occur with respiratory infections.

This report summarizes recommendations for health care providers managing patients with suspected or known EVALI, especially when respiratory infections like influenza are more prevalent. Recommendations include:

- **Asking patients**: Inquire about the use of e-cigarette or vaping products if patients present with respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms.
- **Evaluating patients**: Utilize pulse oximetry and obtain chest imaging for those suspected to have EVALI, as clinically indicated.
- **Considering outpatient management**: Evaluate clinically stable EVALI patients for outpatient management if they meet certain criteria.
- **Testing for influenza**: Consider influenza testing, particularly in relevant cases.

### Update: Interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury - United States, October 2019 [^1137PREg]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

The CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local health departments, and public health and clinical partners are investigating a multistate outbreak of lung injury associated with the use of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), or vaping, products. In late August, the CDC released recommendations for health care providers regarding e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) based on limited data from the first reported cases. This report summarizes national surveillance data describing clinical features of more recently reported cases and interim recommendations based on these data for U.S. health care providers caring for patients with suspected or known EVALI.

- **Interim guidance**: It provides information for initial clinical evaluation; suggested criteria for hospital admission and treatment; patient follow-up; special considerations for groups at high risk; and clinical and public health recommendations.

Health care providers evaluating patients suspected to have EVALI should ask about the use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products in a nonjudgmental and thorough manner. Patients suspected to have EVALI should have a chest radiograph (CXR), and hospital admission is recommended for patients who have decreased blood oxygen (O₂) saturation (< 95%) on room air or who are in respiratory distress. Health care providers should consider the empiric use of a combination of antibiotics, antivirals, or steroids based upon clinical context. Evidence-based tobacco product cessation strategies, including behavioral counseling, are recommended to help patients.

### Is the initial diagnostic impression of "noncardiac chest pain" adequate to exclude cardiac disease [^1163qxFy]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an initial diagnostic impression of noncardiac chest pain, we determined the 30-day incidence of adverse cardiac events and characteristics associated with those events.

- **Methods**: The multicenter, prospectively collected Internet Tracking Registry for Acute Coronary Syndromes (i*tr ACS) registry of patients with chest pain enrolled from June 1, 1999, to August 1, 2001, was reviewed. We included patients if the physician's initial diagnostic impression was noncardiac chest pain after the medical history, physical examination, and initial 12-lead ECG. ED records, inpatient records, and follow-up results were reviewed for evidence of an adverse cardiac event defined as ST-segment or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization, or cardiac death within 30 days.

- **Results**: Of 17,737 patients enrolled in i*tr ACS, 2,992 had an initial emergency physician impression of noncardiac chest pain. Of these, 85 (2.8%) patients had definite evidence for an adverse cardiac event. The adverse cardiac event group was older (61.2 versus 47.9 years), more likely to be men (58.6% versus 38.7%), and had a higher Acute Cardiac Ischemia-Time Insensitive Predictive Instrument score (26.1 versus 15.6). Factors associated with adverse cardiac events included hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, history of coronary artery disease, and history of congestive heart failure.

- **Conclusion**: When the initial impression is noncardiac chest pain, high-risk features such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors should be considered to avoid overlooking potential cardiac disease.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: Diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost [^1169vxHB]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

In cases of atypical chest pain, the same stress test was booked through the CUP, with a median waiting time for testing of 20 days. If the exercise ECG was negative or not feasible due to the lack of an evaluable ECG or the patient's inability to perform the test, an imaging test — such as scintigraphy, echocardiography stress test, or coronary CTA — was also proposed. CTA was performed using a 64‐slice or greater multidetector CT scanner. The stress test was considered positive according to the American Heart Association guidelines.

Patients with a pre‐test likelihood of 15% to 85% were stratified for the presence of lifestyle‐related risk factors, such as smoking; low intake of fruits, vegetables, and legumes; and physical inactivity. These factors were assessed at the time of enrollment based on their answers to a specific questionnaire (defined as 0‐5‐30; 0 = zero cigarettes, 5 = five portions of fruits, vegetables, and legumes, 30 = at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day). All patients underwent healthy lifestyle counseling. After 12 months (with a tolerance of ± 2 weeks), a final visit was performed. Additionally, the presence of major risk factors necessitating pharmacological treatment, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, as well as a family history of ischemic heart disease, was noted.

### A gut feeling: Abdominal symptoms as an initial presentation of EVALI [^114FTwcB]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Electronic cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a disease process that has become prevalent in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that there have been almost 2700 cases of this condition in the United States as of January 14, 2020, with more than 50% of these patients aged 24 years or younger.

We present a 13-year-old boy with a history of functional abdominal pain who exhibited episodes of nausea, emesis, periodic fevers, and severe episodic abdominal pain following a 12-month history of significant electronic cigarette use. On admission, he had severe abdominal pain and appeared anxious. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen was unremarkable, but a computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated both multifocal ground-glass and crazy-paving pulmonary opacities bilaterally, with scattered septal thickening and dependent bibasilar opacities associated with volume loss. Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated, and cell counts were remarkable for leukocytosis and neutrophilia. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with EVALI and treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, resulting in improvement.

This case exemplifies EVALI in an adolescent where the presenting symptoms are largely gastrointestinal. It is important to include EVALI in the differential diagnosis of patients who exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, have markers of increased systemic inflammation, and have a history of vaping or fall within the typical age range of electronic cigarette users.

### High-risk chief complaints I: Chest pain-the big three (an update) [^112PoAtR]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

Nontraumatic chest pain is a frequent concern of emergency department patients, with causes that range from benign to immediately life-threatening. Identifying patients who require immediate or urgent intervention remains challenging and is a high-risk area for emergency medicine physicians, where incorrect or delayed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article focuses on the three most prevalent diagnoses associated with adverse outcomes in patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain: acute coronary syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Important aspects of clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatment, and disposition, as well as other less common causes of lethal chest pain, are also discussed.

### Guidance on the clinical management of electronic cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury [^116Amebj]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

In the summer of 2019, clusters of adolescents and young adults in the United States began reporting to emergency departments with acute respiratory distress related to the use of e-cigarettes (electronic cigarettes) or vaping. The number of patients with e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury continued to rise throughout the summer, peaking in September 2019. Through the efforts of state and federal public health agencies, officials were able to define the condition, identify its relationship to tetrahydrocannabinol-containing products, and stem the rise in new cases.

This report presents a comprehensive review of the clinical characteristics and features of patients with e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury. It provides guidelines for patient care and management to inform clinicians who may encounter these patients in their clinical practice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically with respect to the evaluation for non-ischemic cardiac causes such as valvular heart disease, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), with 3D imaging if available. This is suggested for determining the severity and cause of valvular heart disease in patients presenting with acute chest pain and suspected or known valvular heart disease if the diagnostic quality of TTE is inadequate.
