## Question

dextranovir insulin resistance galaxy study

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "dextranovir" refers to, whether there is a related "Galaxy" study concerning insulin resistance, how protease inhibitors relate to insulin resistance, and which high-quality data in the packet address metabolic outcomes in HIV cohorts on antiretroviral therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "dextranovir" maps to a known antiretroviral, likely darunavir, and whether a "Galaxy" trial exists in the provided references. Then, I should verify mechanistic and clinical evidence linking HIV protease inhibitors to insulin resistance. Next, I will examine the largest, most relevant clinical dataset in the packet for metabolic outcomes (the tesamorelin/Egrifta trial). Finally, I should synthesize clinical implications and monitoring/management options supported by the references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. I cannot find a drug or study labeled "dextranovir" or a "galaxy study" in the provided materials, which makes me think the query may be a misremembered reference to darunavir (a protease inhibitor) and an unrelated study nickname. However, I should not jump to conclusions until I verify the PI–insulin resistance link with the packet's mechanistic and clinical sources, and then identify the most robust HIV metabolic dataset available here, which appears to be the Egrifta (tesamorelin) program rather than a PI trial per se [^115sPE1k] [^11415rUj] [^112D1pjS].

> Next, I will examine mechanistic links between HIV protease inhibitors and insulin resistance to establish plausibility. HIV PIs acutely inhibit GLUT4, directly impairing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and provoking peripheral insulin resistance; they also blunt glucose-stimulated insulin release, indicating concurrent beta-cell dysfunction, which together destabilize glucose homeostasis during PI exposure [^11415rUj]. Clinically, in PI-treated cohorts, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance are common, often coexisting with dyslipidemia and lipodystrophy, consistent with a systemic metabolic disturbance rather than an isolated glycemic signal [^115sPE1k] [^1167F6dT].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical burden and vascular implications, because mechanism alone isn't enough. In PI-era cohorts, new-onset diabetes is reported in a minority, but impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance occur in a considerable proportion of patients on PIs; moreover, in HIV adults on long-term therapy, greater insulin resistance independently predicts endothelial dysfunction, linking IR to cardiovascular risk phenotypes in this population [^115sPE1k] [^112hzbRG]. Complementing this, insulin resistance associates with more proatherogenic lipoprotein subfraction distributions, reinforcing the atherometabolic risk profile relevant to HIV populations facing PI-related metabolic stress [^116RUaum].

> Wait, let me verify the largest clinical metabolic dataset in the packet, even though it is not a PI trial, because it anchors prevalence estimates in a contemporary HIV cohort with lipodystrophy. In the randomized, placebo-controlled Egrifta (tesamorelin) study of 412 HIV-infected adults with excess abdominal fat, approximately one-third of participants had impaired glucose tolerance at baseline and 5–7% had diet-controlled diabetes, underscoring the high background prevalence of dysglycemia in treated HIV with lipodystrophy; this contextualizes how PI-related IR may manifest in practice, although the intervention here targets GH pathways, not PI exposure per se [^112D1pjS].

> Hmm, wait a minute — my initial reflex was to wonder if "Galaxy" might be a nickname attached to the Egrifta program, but I should correct that assumption. The Egrifta material identifies the pivotal trial as "Study 1" (NCT00123253) and does not use a "GALAXY" label, so linking "Galaxy" to tesamorelin here would be inaccurate; thus, the most I can conclude is that "Galaxy" is not represented in the provided references, and the best-fitting dataset for metabolic context remains the Egrifta trial summary provided [^112D1pjS].

> I need to ensure practical clinical implications are clearly supported. For patients with HIV — particularly those with lipodystrophy or on PI-based regimens — screening and mitigation of insulin resistance are reasonable, starting with lifestyle measures, as suggested in the HIV IR overview; when pharmacotherapy is indicated, metformin improves hepatic insulin sensitivity and peripheral glucose disposal without increasing insulin secretion, and thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone) enhance peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity, though long-term macrovascular benefit is unproven; pathophysiologic frameworks support early, mechanism-targeted combinations to address hepatic and muscle insulin resistance without provoking hypoglycemia [^115sPE1k] [^113Tb2M8] [^115uFV44] [^112gn3HB].

> But wait, what if the user truly meant darunavir-specific metabolic data? I should state clearly that within this packet there are no darunavir- or "GALAXY"-branded trials to cite; the mechanistic PI effects and the clinical IR/IGT prevalence and vascular links are supported by the included PI-era and HIV cohort data, while the Egrifta dataset offers contemporary prevalence context in HIV with lipodystrophy, not causally tied to any one PI agent in these materials [^11415rUj] [^115sPE1k] [^112hzbRG] [^112D1pjS].

> In summary, I should conclude that there is no "dextranovir insulin resistance galaxy study" in the provided references; the most plausible interpretation is a misremembered query about darunavir and insulin resistance, for which the packet supports the broader assertion that HIV protease inhibitors can induce insulin resistance via GLUT4 blockade and beta-cell dysfunction, with downstream dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction, while the Egrifta trial quantifies a high baseline prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance in treated HIV with lipodystrophy; clinically, vigilance for insulin resistance and targeted use of insulin sensitizers like metformin and pioglitazone are aligned with pathophysiologic management strategies in appropriate patients [^11415rUj] [^115sPE1k] [^112hzbRG] [^112D1pjS] [^113Tb2M8] [^115uFV44] [^112gn3HB].

I can't find a drug named "dextranovir" or a "Galaxy" study** on insulin resistance. Please confirm:

- **The exact drug name** (did you mean darunavir or another agent)?
- **The full study title or a link/identifier** (e.g. NCT number)?
- **The specific outcomes you're interested in** (e.g. HOMA-IR, clamp insulin sensitivity, HbA1c)? [^114uPTjh]

If you meant an **HIV protease inhibitor**, PIs can acutely impair **insulin action** [^11415rUj] and **beta-cell function**. HIV/HAART cohorts also show insulin resistance [^115sPE1k] and related metabolic changes [^112hzbRG]. If you meant an **insulin-sensitizer**, **metformin** [^113Tb2M8] and **pioglitazone** [^1153bMvi] improve **insulin sensitivity** and glycemia with FDA-backed data. Please clarify so I can provide the **precise evidence** you need.

Pioglitazone

Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. It enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower A1C values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with pioglitazone compared to placebo.

### Glumetza [^113Tb2M8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Metformin is a biguanide that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- **Absorption**: Following a single oral dose of 1,000 mg (2x500 mg tablets) GLUMETZA following a meal, the time to reach maximum plasma metformin concentration (Tmax) is achieved at approximately 7–8 hours. In both single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects, once daily 1,000 mg (2x500 mg tablets) dosing provides equivalent systemic exposure, as measured by area under the curve (AUC), and up to 35% higher Cmax of metformin relative to the immediate-release given as 500 mg twice daily. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24–48 hours and are generally < 1 mcg/mL.

	- **Dose response**: Single oral doses of GLUMETZA from 500 mg to 2,500 mg resulted in less than proportional increase in both AUC and Cmax.

	- **Effect of food**: Low-fat and high-fat meals increased the systemic exposure (as measured by AUC) from GLUMETZA tablets by about 38% and 73%, respectively, relative to fasting. Both meals prolonged metformin Tmax by approximately 3 hours but Cmax was not affected.

### Disorders of glucose metabolism in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^115sPE1k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

New-onset diabetes mellitus, which is clinically similar to type 2 diabetes, affects a small proportion (1%-6%) of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treated with HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs). However, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance develop in a considerable proportion of these patients during PI treatment. Dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and loss of peripheral fat frequently coexist with insulin resistance, but it is unclear whether all these conditions arise from a common pathogenic mechanism.

Recent data suggest that insulin resistance may also be associated with HIV infection in patients not receiving PI therapy. The long-term consequences of insulin resistance in this population remain unknown. The effect of switching to other antiretroviral therapies has not been fully determined. Treatment for established diabetes mellitus should generally adhere to existing guidelines. Currently, no clinically useful screening test can determine the existence and degree of insulin resistance in individual patients.

It is reasonable to recommend general measures to increase insulin sensitivity in all patients infected with HIV, such as weight reduction for obese individuals and regular aerobic exercise.

### Insulin resistance predicts endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected persons on long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy [^112hzbRG]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk among persons with HIV is likely multifactorial; thus, testing a variety of available noninvasive vascular ultrasound and other surrogate tests may yield differing results. To address this issue, we assessed multiple metabolic and clinical predictors of endothelial function and carotid intima-media thickness in HIV-infected subjects and compared results with HIV-negative controls.

This study was a prospective, cross-sectional study of 50 HIV-infected, healthy adults on stable highly active antiretroviral therapy matched to 50 HIV-negative controls by age, sex, race, and body mass index. Flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery, carotid intima-media thickness, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (HIV-infected subjects), as well as fasting insulin, lipids, and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Results were compared between HIV-infected and control groups.

Of the subjects, fifty percent were African-American, with 34% women. Among those HIV-infected, the mean CD4 cell count was 547 cells per microliter; 90% had HIV RNA less than 50 copies/ml. There were no significant differences between HIV-infected and control subjects regarding brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation or carotid intima-media thickness. In multivariate analyses of the HIV cohort, independent predictors of endothelial dysfunction (lower flow-mediated vasodilation) were increasing insulin resistance, greater alcohol consumption, and higher baseline brachial artery diameter (P < 0.05); predictors of increased carotid intima-media thickness were hypertension and higher initial measures.

### HIV protease inhibitors acutely impair glucose-stimulated insulin release [^11415rUj]. Diabetes (2003). Low credibility.

HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) acutely and reversibly inhibit the insulin-responsive glucose transporter Glut 4, leading to peripheral insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Minimal modeling analysis of glucose tolerance tests on PI-treated patients has revealed an impaired insulin secretory response, suggesting additional pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. To determine whether beta-cell function is acutely affected by PIs, we assayed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in rodent islets and the insulinoma cell line MIN6. Insulin release from MIN6 cells and rodent islets was significantly inhibited by the PI indinavir with IC(50) values of 1.1 and 2.1 µmol/l, respectively. The uptake of 2-deoxyglucose in MIN6 cells was similarly inhibited (IC(50) of 2.0 µmol/l), whereas glucokinase activity was unaffected at drug levels as high as 1 mmol/l. Glucose utilization was also impaired at comparable drug levels. Insulin secretogogues acting downstream of glucose transport mostly reversed the indinavir-mediated inhibition of insulin release in MIN6 cells. Intravenous infusion of indinavir during hyperglycemic clamps on rats significantly suppressed the first-phase insulin response. These data suggest that therapeutic levels of PIs are sufficient to impair glucose sensing by beta-cells. Thus, together with peripheral insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction likely contributes to altered glucose homeostasis associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy.

### A novel type of extreme insulin resistance: Nonhypoglycemic insulin autoimmune syndrome [^112pgFJQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Extreme insulin resistance is caused by genetic defects intersecting with the insulin action pathway or by insulin receptor antibodies. Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) is not considered one of the causes of extreme insulin resistance.

- **Objective**: This work aimed to expand the knowledge of extreme insulin resistance and to propose the diagnostic criteria and management strategy of a novel type of extreme insulin resistance.

- **Methods**: A patient with IAS never experienced hypoglycemia but had persistent hyperglycemia and extreme insulin resistance with treatment using 200 U of intravenous insulin per day. Immunoreactive insulin (IRI), free insulin, and total insulin were measured. The ratio of free insulin to total insulin (insulin-free ratio, IFR) was calculated.

- **Results**: Extreme insulin resistance has not been reported to be caused by IAS. At admission, IRI and free insulin were undetectable in our patient; total insulin was more than 20,160 pmol/L, and the IFR was lower than 0.03% (control, 90.9%). After adding 500 U porcine insulin to the precipitate containing insulin antibodies, the IRI was still undetectable. Since the patient started glucocorticoid therapy, the free insulin has gradually increased to 11.16 pmol/L, the total insulin has decreased to 5,040 pmol/L, and the IFR has increased to 18.26%. Intravenous insulin was stopped, with good glycemic control.

- **Conclusion**: High-affinity insulin autoantibodies with a large capacity can induce a novel type of extreme insulin resistance characterized by extremely high total insulin and very low free insulin.

### Egrifta SV [^112D1pjS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

This study (NCT 00123253) randomized 412 HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy and excess abdominal fat to receive either a 2 mg dose of Egrifta (1 mg/vial formulation) (N = 273) or a placebo (N = 137). At baseline, for the two groups combined, the mean age was 48 years. Eighty-six percent were male, 75% were white, 14% were Black/African American, and 8% were Hispanic. The mean weight was 90 kg, the mean BMI was 29 kg/m², the mean waist circumference was 104 cm, the mean hip circumference was 100 cm, the mean VAT was 176 cm², and the mean CD4 cell count was 606 cells/mm³. Additionally, 69% had an undetectable viral load (< 50 copies/mL). Regarding glucose tolerance, 33.7% randomized to Egrifta and 36.6% randomized to placebo had impaired glucose tolerance. Meanwhile, 5.6% randomized to Egrifta and 6.7% randomized to placebo had diet-controlled diabetes mellitus. The twenty-six week completion rate in Study 1 was 80%.

### Pathophysiologic approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^112gn3HB]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The preceding review of pathophysiology has important therapeutic implications: 1) effective treatment will require multiple drugs in combination to correct the multiple pathophysiological defects, 2) treatment should be based upon established pathogenic abnormalities and not simply on HbA 1c reduction, and 3) therapy must be started early in the natural history of T2DM to prevent progressive β-cell failure.

- **Therapeutic options**: Figure 1 displays therapeutic options as they relate to key pathophysiological derangements in T2DM. In the liver, both metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) act as potent insulin sensitizers and inhibit the increased rate of hepatic glucose production (HGP). In muscles, TZDs are potent insulin sensitizers, whereas metformin is, at best, a weak insulin sensitizer. Since TZDs operate through the insulin signaling pathway, and metformin works through the AMP kinase pathway, a combination of TZD and metformin therapy provides a completely additive effect to reduce HbA 1c. Furthermore, hypoglycemia is not encountered because these drugs are insulin sensitizers and do not augment insulin secretion. In adipocytes, TZDs are not only excellent insulin sensitizers but also potent inhibitors of lipolysis. They also mobilize fat out of muscle, liver, and β-cells, thereby ameliorating lipotoxicity.

### World congress on insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease: Part 1 [^117Gj1BD]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Gerald Reaven (Stanford, CA) opened the meeting with a discussion of the implications of insulin resistance and the interrelationships between hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In his studies, insulin resistance is estimated from the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) during the infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucose. In a study of 490 nondiabetic individuals, there was more than sixfold variability in insulin sensitivity with this measure. SSPG correlates with obesity, whether measured as BMI or waist circumference, but Reaven pointed out that there is an "enormous degree" of interindividual difference at any level of BMI or waist circumference, with obesity accounting for only approximately one-quarter of the variation in insulin sensitivity.

Fitness, measured by the maximal oxygen consumption during exercise, was responsible for another quarter of the variation in his studies, with the remainder presumably caused by genetic factors. Hypertension is characteristically associated with glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and roughly a 50% reduction in insulin sensitivity, unaffected by antihypertensive treatment. Reaven reviewed a study of both treated and untreated hypertensive individuals, showing that 34% and 39%, respectively, had intermediate insulin sensitivity and that 52% and 47% had low insulin sensitivity, with the minority being insulin sensitive. A positive family history of hypertension is also associated with insulin resistance, with elevated fasting insulin levels associated with the development of essential hypertension.

### The 6th annual world congress on the insulin resistance syndrome [^115sjK7C]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Dan Porte (Seattle, WA) discussed the central control of body weight. In a study carried out more than three decades ago, researchers examined groups of rats after periods of overfeeding and underfeeding. This resulted in greater or lesser weight gain compared to ad libitum-fed animals. The overfed rats lost weight, and the lean rats gained weight to a degree directly proportional to basal insulin levels, with all groups eventually reaching the same weight. This suggests that body weight is regulated by insulin levels. Intracerebroventricular insulin infusion lowered weight in baboons, with subsequent regain, while animals not expressing insulin receptors in the brain developed obesity, supporting this hypothesis.

Leptin acts in a similar fashion, suggesting a complementary set of signals providing extended time scale controls of body weight. The two signals, leptin and insulin, act by increasing proopiomelanocortin and decreasing agouti-related peptide (AgRP)/neuropeptide Y (NPY) neuronal activity. Endothelial cell insulin and leptin receptors in localized areas of the blood-brain barrier allow these peptides to be taken up to regulate caloric balance.

A separate gut peptide-based system acts on day-to-day and meal-to-meal control of caloric balance, with receptors on the vagus for cholecystokinin, bombesin, neuromedin B, GLP-1, peptide YY (PYY), amylin, glucagon, apolipoprotein A-IV, enterostatin, and somatostatin — all of which reduce food intake. Ghrelin, in contrast, increases food intake.

### Drug insight: Insulin-sensitizing drugs in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome — a reappraisal [^112kC13Q]. Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

The recognition that insulin resistance has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) revolutionized our understanding of this complex disorder. PCOS causes major metabolic and reproductive morbidities, including a substantially increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. Insulin-sensitizing drugs (ISDs) ameliorate reproductive abnormalities, restore ovulation and regular menses, increase pregnancy rates, and reduce androgenic symptoms in affected women with PCOS. Accordingly, ISDs, specifically metformin, have been widely adopted as therapy for this condition.

A recent large, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that assessed live-birth rates rather than surrogate endpoints suggested that metformin alone is inferior to clomiphene citrate in treating infertility associated with PCOS. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the use of metformin during pregnancy to prevent spontaneous abortions or gestational diabetes mellitus in women with PCOS. Renewed safety concerns about thiazolidinediones have followed recent studies that reported increased cardiovascular morbidity with these agents. These concerns might preclude thiazolidinedione use in otherwise healthy women with PCOS. Finally, although ISDs improve insulin action and cardiovascular disease risk, there is no evidence that they provide long-term health benefits in PCOS. This article discusses the role of ISDs in PCOS in light of these new data.

### Insulin resistance during puberty and future fat accumulation [^115tdDDs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is a known sequela of obesity; however, the relationship of insulin resistance to future weight gain remains unclear. In several studies, insulin resistance has been associated with weight stabilization. For the most part, this relationship has been found in adults who are overweight. To evaluate the relationship of insulin resistance to future fat accumulation in pubertal children, a three-year prospective study was carried out. Insulin sensitivity (Si) was determined by Bergman's minimal model in 111 healthy children, aged 9.7–14.5 years. All children were Tanner stage II or III pubertal development at baseline. Body composition was assessed by body mass index, skinfold thickness, hydrodensitometry, and bioelectric impedance analysis at baseline and annually thereafter for an additional three years.

A repeated-measures analysis showed that the change in percentage body fat estimated from skinfold thickness (%BF(SF)) over time changed with increasing Si (P < 0.0001). Si was divided into tertiles for each gender, with the lowest tertile representing the most insulin-resistant children. For girls, those in the lowest tertile maintained their %BF(SF) over three years, whereas those in the middle and upper tertile had an increase in their %BF(SF). For boys, those in the lowest tertile showed a decrease in their %BF(SF), whereas boys in the middle and upper tertile maintained their %BF(SF). These results suggest that during puberty, children who are more insulin-resistant have decreased subcutaneous fat gain.

### Insulin resistance, age and depression's impact on cognition in middle-aged adults from the PREVENT cohort [^1148vjXM]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to explore the inter-relationships between cognitive functioning, depression, and insulin resistance in cognitively healthy middle-aged adults. Using structural equation modelling, we found that lower insulin resistance values predicted higher executive function performance while controlling for the effects of age, education, and sex. We also found that higher insulin resistance values predicted increased self-reported depressive scores.

- **Age-related effects**: When we re-estimated our models across different age groups (here, those aged 40–49 years and 50–60 years), we found that the significant relationship between insulin resistance and executive function was apparent for the older age group but not for the younger age group. This suggests that higher insulin resistance in older middle-aged adults associates with aspects of cognition, including executive function.

- **Depressive symptoms**: Our results revealed that higher levels of insulin resistance were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms in both age groups. Moreover, higher levels of depressive symptoms were linked to lower scores of visuospatial navigation skills (or spatial memory) in the older group but not in the younger group of middle-aged adults.

Concerning the negative association between insulin resistance and executive function, our results corroborate a growing body of literature, suggesting that those with higher levels of insulin resistance have greater executive dysfunction.

### Impact of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function over time on glycemic outcomes in the glycemia reduction approaches in diabetes: A comparative effectiveness study (GRADE): Differential treatment effects of dual therapy [^114uPTjh]. Diabetes Care (2024). Low credibility.

To compare the effects of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function over time on HbA1c and durability of glycemic control in response to dual therapy, GRADE participants were randomized to glimepiride (n = 1,254), liraglutide (n = 1,262), or sitagliptin (n = 1,268) added to baseline metformin and followed for mean ± SD 5.0 ± 1.3 years. HbA1c was assessed quarterly, and oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted at baseline, 1, 3, and 5 years. We related time-varying insulin sensitivity (HOMA 2 of insulin sensitivity [HOMA2-%S]) and early (0–30 min) and total (0–120 min) C-peptide (CP) responses to changes in HbA1c and glycemic failure (primary outcome HbA1c ≥ 7% [53 mmol/mol] and secondary outcome HbA1c > 7.5% [58 mmol/mol]) and examined differential treatment responses.

Higher HOMA2-%S was associated with greater initial HbA1c lowering (3 months) but not subsequent HbA1c rise. Greater CP responses were associated with a greater initial treatment response and slower subsequent HbA1c rise. Higher HOMA2-%S and CP responses were each associated with lower risk of primary and secondary outcomes. These associations differed by treatment.

- **Impact in the sitagliptin group**: HOMA2-%S and CP responses had greater impact on initial HbA1c reduction (test of heterogeneity, P = 0.009 HOMA2-%S, P = 0.018 early CP, P = 0.001 total CP) and risk of primary outcome (P = 0.005 HOMA2-%S, P = 0.11 early CP, P = 0.025 total CP) but lesser impact on HbA1c rise (P = 0.175 HOMA2-%S, P = 0.006 early CP, P < 0.001 total CP) in comparisons with the glimepiride and liraglutide groups.

### Measurement of insulin resistance in chronic kidney disease [^113ZuF6v]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011).

Insulin resistance is a known complication of end-stage renal disease that also appears to be present in earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and an important potential therapeutic target in this population. The measurement of insulin resistance is reviewed in the context of known pathophysiologic abnormalities in CKD.

- **Recent findings**: Insulin resistance in CKD is due to a high prevalence of known risk factors (e.g. obesity) and unique metabolic abnormalities. The site of insulin resistance in CKD is localized to skeletal muscle. Estimates based on fasting insulin concentration may not adequately capture insulin resistance in CKD because they largely reflect hepatic defects and because CKD impairs insulin catabolism. A variety of dynamic tests are available to directly measure insulin-mediated glucose uptake.

- **Summary**: Insulin resistance may be an important therapeutic target in CKD. Complementary methods are available to assess insulin resistance, and each method has unique advantages, disadvantages, and levels of complexity. These characteristics, and the likelihood that CKD alters the performance of some insulin resistance measurements, must be considered when designing and interpreting clinical studies.

### Insulin: In search of a syndrome [^114so5yp]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The insulin resistance syndrome has been defined as the clustering of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance in subjects with high fasting plasma insulin concentrations. These concentrations are usually taken as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance in whole-body glucose disposal. Although hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are reciprocally related to one another, the association is not very strong.

In the data-pooling project of the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR), clamp-derived insulin sensitivity (as the M value) and fasting plasma insulin concentrations were available in 1,308 non-diabetic subjects with a wide range of ages and body mass indexes. In this cohort, hyperinsulinemia (as the upper quartile of fasting plasma insulin distribution in the non-obese segment of the population) and insulin resistance (as the bottom quartile of M value in the same subgroup) were each present in approximately 40% of the whole population. However, they identified only partially overlapping (60%) subsets of individuals.

When the subjects with insulin resistance but without hyperinsulinemia (n = 198) were compared with those with hyperinsulinemia but without insulin resistance (n = 267), significant differences emerged in their respective clinical phenotypes. Subjects with 'pure' insulin resistance had a more central fat distribution and presented evidence of excessive lipolysis and endogenous glucose production. In contrast, subjects with 'pure' hyperinsulinemia had suppressed lipolysis, endogenous glucose production, and insulin clearance.

### Insulin resistance plays a significant role in liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C and in the response to antiviral therapy [^112Qm3uP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

This study aims to assess whether insulin resistance is associated with liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and to explore any differences in insulin resistance between Asian and indigenous Caucasian populations. Additionally, it examines whether insulin resistance is linked to a sustained virological response to antiviral therapy.

The analysis determined insulin resistance in 59 consecutive patients with HCV (30 Caucasians and 29 Asians) prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The relationship between insulin resistance and biochemical, virological, and histological data, along with response to antiviral therapy, was assessed.

In multivariable analyses, insulin resistance as measured by the HOMA-IR model showed a positive correlation with the stage of fibrosis; higher degrees of insulin resistance were observed in patients with greater degrees of fibrosis (p < 0.001). This relationship persisted even after excluding cirrhotic patients and adjusting for other factors associated with fibrosis in univariable analyses. Notably, insulin resistance was significantly higher in Asians compared to Caucasians (p = 0.004). Approximately 55.6% of patients completing a course of antiviral treatment achieved a sustained virological response. Multivariable logistic regression identified HCV genotype 3, lower fasting glucose levels, and lower aspartate transaminase (AST) levels as factors associated with higher odds of a sustained virological response.

### Temporal relationship between inflammation and insulin resistance and their joint effect on hyperglycemia: The Bogalusa Heart Study [^111vumZS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Low credibility.

Inflammation and insulin resistance are two well-known mechanisms linking obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular disease. Multiple inflammation markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), are correlated with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in the majority of previous studies. An important question raised by these observations is whether adiposity-induced inflammatory reaction precedes insulin resistance or vice versa, or whether this relationship is bidirectional, especially in the evolution of T2DM.

Use of cross-sectional study designs limits the inference regarding the temporal relationship between hsCRP and insulin resistance. Several longitudinal studies have attempted to demonstrate the temporal relationship between inflammation, insulin resistance, and T2DM. Multiple inflammatory markers, including hsCRP, interleukin-6, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, have been shown to independently predict incident T2DM.

The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study showed that elevated hsCRP was associated with future insulin resistance after accounting for adiposity and oxidative stress markers. At the time of writing, only one longitudinal study has examined the bidirectional relationship between inflammation and insulin resistance, showing that baseline levels of hsCRP and interleukin-6 were positively associated with subsequent increases in fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and beta-cell function. In the reverse analysis, baseline HOMA-IR was not associated with changes in inflammation biomarkers.

### The 6th annual World Congress on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome [^113ffEGU]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)α and PPARγ have lipid- and glucose-lowering effects, respectively. PPARα causes fatty acid oxidation, while PPARγ affects adipogenesis and lipogenesis, increasing tissue glucose uptake. Pioglitazone appears to activate both nuclear receptors, whereas rosiglitazone is more specific for PPARγ. When a ligand binds to PPARγ, a dimer with the retinoid X receptor and retinoic acid is formed, binding to a PPAR response element to cause gene transcription, altering the transcription of a wide range of proteins.

- **Lesson 1**: Grant noted the recognition that the glitazones modulate the expression of dozens of genes in many cell types, leading to inevitable unintended side effects. The system operates over time with diurnal variation, adding complexity.

- **Lesson 2**: Insulin resistance is described as a complex phenotype regulated by transcriptional activation and circadian variation in PPAR expression. Short-term insulin resistance may be physiological and potentially beneficial, whereas long-term insulin resistance is pathological and harmful. Grant emphasized the incomplete understanding of the insulin resistance phenotype and its management, highlighting that chronopharmacology is an issue that is not fully understood.

The clinical case for managing insulin resistance and risk clustering has been demonstrated in many studies. In A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT), the use of rosiglitazone reduced the risk of monotherapy failure to a level one-third lower than with metformin and two-thirds lower than with glyburide.

### Viewpoints on the way to a consensus session: Where does insulin resistance start? The liver [^113WAmqW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In support of the supremacy of the role of the liver in the onset of insulin resistance and insulin resistance syndrome, we state the following:

1. NAFLD is the hepatic equivalent of the metabolic syndrome.

2. Even though there are no longitudinal data showing that the development of NAFLD is primary and precedes the onset of whole-body insulin resistance, it is plausible, based on animal studies, that the development of peripheral insulin resistance and a proinflammatory state is secondary to hepatic fat infiltration and hepatic insulin resistance.

3. Models in which hepatic dysfunction is known to be the primary disturbance provide strong support that insulin resistance in peripheral tissues develops secondary to liver disease; this is manifested in humans in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.

A final consideration is that insulin resistance is often defined based on measurements of glucose metabolism, but insulin also regulates the anabolism and storage of fat, protein synthesis, and nonmetabolic processes such as cell growth and differentiation. In the insulin resistance syndrome, it is important to emphasize that not all insulin-dependent processes and tissues are equally resistant to insulin. Metabolic pathways at the liver site are a good example of this behavior. Accili and coworkers proposed that when insulin signaling in hepatocytes is impaired, the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) may play a pivotal role in sustaining this mixed state of resistance versus sensitivity to insulin.

### c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity in subcutaneous adipose tissue but not nuclear factor-kappaB activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is an independent determinant of insulin resistance in healthy individuals [^111casfd]. Diabetes (2009). High credibility.

In accordance with two other studies, we also found a relationship between increased NF-κB activity in PBMCs and insulin resistance. In contrast to these studies, which used a calculated HOMA as a proxy for insulin resistance, we examined insulin resistance directly using the standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Moreover, we showed that the relationship between NF-κB activity in PBMCs and insulin resistance is independent of the degree of obesity and explained 16% of variance in insulin resistance after adjustment for age, sex, percent body fat, and WHR. Although previous studies have shown that NF-κB activation in skeletal muscle is related to insulin resistance in obese humans, this was not seen in our study in nondiabetic healthy individuals. Our data are consistent with rodent studies in which overexpression of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in skeletal muscle had no effect on insulin resistance as measured by glucose clamp. In our study, we also found no relationship between activation of NF-κB in adipose tissue and any of the anthropometric or metabolic parameters. Animal models of type 2 diabetes have demonstrated an association between insulin resistance and elevated levels of the activator of NF-κB, IKKβ, at the gene level, in perigonadal but not in mesenteric adipose tissue. Gene levels of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) have also been associated with central adiposity in obese elderly women. Both of these studies, however, examined only gene expression as opposed to activity.

### Can we learn from viruses how to prevent type 1 diabetes? The role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the development of novel combination therapies [^116TUnQQ]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

In follow-up studies, we were able to define the underlying mechanisms for the above-described synergism and therefore proceeded to test additional parameters that were clinically relevant. Animals that remained diabetic are shown with squares, the animals that reverted to normoglycemia are shown with diamonds, and those transiently reverted are shown with triangles. These data were correlated with age (x-axis) and blood glucose (y-axis) of the animal at the onset of hyperglycemia and the start of intervention.

- **Combination therapy**:

	- The upper panels show the NOD mice that underwent combination therapy, whereas the bottom panels portray the animals treated with the monotherapy anti-CD3. One striking observation was that regardless of the age of diabetes onset, mice with chronically high blood glucose values were essentially refractory to the combination therapy. There was an improved response to the combination therapy when mice had a lower blood glucose value, perhaps when animals were at an earlier stage of disease progression. We would argue that this observation parallels well with data from Chatenoud and coworkers in the human anti-CD3 trial.

- **Response in non-insulin-treated NOD mice**:

	- If one considers blood glucose values in non–insulin-treated NOD mice as a correlate of remaining β-cell activity, individuals with high C-peptide values respond much better to anti-CD3 treatment than those with lower C-peptide values. It appears that reversion of recent-onset type 1 diabetes is not possible once β-cell mass has declined beyond a certain point.

### Free fatty acids-the link between obesity and insulin resistance [^116MccZv]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective: To present evidence that free fatty acids (FFA) are an important link between obesity and insulin resistance.

Methods: The role of FFA in peripheral insulin resistance, hepatic insulin resistance, insulin secretion, and type 2 diabetes is discussed.

Results: Obesity is invariably associated with insulin resistance. In most obese subjects, plasma FFA levels are increased. Physiologic increases in plasma FFA levels cause insulin resistance in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects by producing several metabolic defects: (1) FFA inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at the level of glucose transport or phosphorylation (or both); (2) FFA inhibit insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis; and (3) FFA inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation (this last-mentioned defect probably does not contribute to insulin resistance). FFA probably also cause hepatic insulin resistance, which results in increased rates of endogenous glucose production in relationship to the prevailing degree of hyperinsulinemia. Lastly, FFA support between 30 and 50% of basal insulin secretion and potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in short-term and long-term settings. The stimulatory action of FFA on β-cells enables obese individuals who do not have a genetic predisposition to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus to compensate for their FFA-potentiated insulin resistance with an increase in FFA-mediated insulin secretion. In contrast, subjects who are genetically predisposed to develop type 2 diabetes may be unable to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin to compensate for their FFA-induced insulin resistance.

### Phosphoproteomics reveals rewiring of the insulin signaling network and multi-nodal defects in insulin resistance [^112DyLnR]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The failure of metabolic tissues to appropriately respond to insulin ("insulin resistance") is an early marker in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Protein phosphorylation is central to the adipocyte insulin response, but how adipocyte signaling networks are dysregulated upon insulin resistance is unknown. Here, we employ phosphoproteomics to delineate insulin signal transduction in adipocyte cells and adipose tissue. Across a range of insults causing insulin resistance, we observe a marked rewiring of the insulin signaling network. This includes both attenuated insulin-responsive phosphorylation and the emergence of phosphorylation uniquely insulin-regulated in insulin resistance.

Identifying dysregulated phosphosites common to multiple insults reveals subnetworks containing non-canonical regulators of insulin action, such as MARK2/3, and causal drivers of insulin resistance. The presence of several bona fide GSK3 substrates among these phosphosites led us to establish a pipeline for identifying context-specific kinase substrates, revealing widespread dysregulation of GSK3 signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 partially reverses insulin resistance in cells and tissue explants. These data highlight that insulin resistance is a multi-nodal signaling defect that includes dysregulated MARK2/3 and GSK3 activity.

### Endothelial extracellular signal-regulated kinase/thromboxane A2/prostanoid receptor pathway aggravates endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome [^113nxqUf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Preparation of lentivirus expressing targeting human: Homo sapien MAPK1 (gene ID 5594) mRNA (NM_002745) coding sequence and 3′‐noncoding sequences were used for the selection of shRNA. An in-house computer program identified a highly specific sequence (5′‐gaccagctgaaccacatt‐3′) that recognizes all of the variants of MAPK1 (NM_002745 and NM_138957) with at least a 4-nucleotide mismatch to nontarget sequences. The methods for preparing a human U6-driven shRNA-expressing entry vector, lentivirus plasmid, and production of lentivirus were previously described. The nontargeting control shRNA lentivirus was also prepared in the same fashion.

### Very low-calorie diet mimics the early beneficial effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in type 2 diabetic patients [^114aaFKz]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Differences in the methods used to assess β-cell function, characteristics of the patient population, and differences in operative procedures among surgeons make it difficult to compare studies with sometimes seemingly conflicting outcomes. For example, using the hyperglycemic clamp, it was found that 4 weeks after RYGB, there was an increase in insulin sensitivity, but the DI remained unchanged. An explanation for this finding, in comparison with our study, is that metabolic testing was carried out when subjects were consuming an 800-calorie liquid diet prior to surgery. It is also unclear whether diabetes medications, including metformin and thiazolidinediones, were held prior to testing. Similar to our results, Lin et al. showed that DI improved 23-fold (from 23 to 403) 1 month after RYGB. Nannipieri et al. also showed that β-cell glucose sensitivity improved (but did not normalize) 45 days after RYGB in patients with T2DM. Interestingly, insulin sensitivity, but not β-cell glucose sensitivity, improved in proportion to weight loss. Certainly, the duration of diabetes also influences β-cell function.

Lim et al. studied patients with T2DM and restricted caloric intake to 600 kcal/day for 8 weeks and demonstrated not just improvement but normalization of both β-cell function and hepatic insulin sensitivity. The duration of diabetes, however, was less than 4 years, which limits comparison with our study cohort with a longer duration of diabetes. In the absence of a gold standard for assessing β-cell function and the inclusion of a diverse population, comparison of different studies is challenging.

### Actos [^115uFV44]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical studies demonstrate that Actos improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Actos enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by Actos results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, Actos had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Lipid abnormalities**: Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with Actos. Overall, patients treated with Actos had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with Actos [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg Actos dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with Actos than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with Actos compared to placebo.

In the two other monotherapy studies (16 weeks and 24 weeks) and in combination therapy studies with sulfonylurea, the findings were consistent with these observations.

### Virus-induced interferon-γ causes insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and derails glycemic control in obesity [^114uFGzQ]. Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines of a T helper-1-signature are known to promote insulin resistance (IR) in obesity, but the physiological role of this mechanism is unclear. It is also unknown whether and how viral infection induces loss of glycemic control in subjects at risk for developing diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). We have found in mice and humans that viral infection caused short-term systemic IR. Virally-induced interferon-γ (IFN-γ) directly targeted skeletal muscle to downregulate the insulin receptor but did not cause loss of glycemic control because of a compensatory increase of insulin production. Hyperinsulinemia enhanced antiviral immunity through direct stimulation of CD8+ effector T cell function. In pre-diabetic mice with hepatic IR caused by diet-induced obesity, infection resulted in loss of glycemic control. Thus, upon pathogen encounter, the immune system transiently reduces insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle to induce hyperinsulinemia and promote antiviral immunity, which derails to glucose intolerance in pre-diabetic obese subjects.

### Viral infection "interferes" with glucose tolerance [^115x6c5f]. Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

In this issue of Immunity, Šestan et al. (2018) demonstrate that viral-induced inflammation results in insulin resistance within skeletal muscle. This is followed by compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which enhances the antiviral effector response of CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, this process contributes to persistent glucose intolerance and facilitates the progression of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic animals.

### Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: You can't have one without the other [^112Gfcsv]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

In this study of nondiabetic individuals, we identified a highly significant correlation between insulin resistance and insulin response (r = 0.76), indicating that the relationship between these two variables is a close one. It should be recognized that the plasma insulin response to an oral glucose challenge will vary as a function of the interplay between several biological systems. These include, at a minimum, the degree of insulin resistance, insulin secretory function, plasma glucose concentration, and the rate of insulin removal from plasma.

The relationship between insulin resistance and insulin response is further compounded by the inherent error in making either measurement. We have previously shown that SSPG concentration, when measured twice in the same individual, varied by 10–30% in approximately 25% of those studied, and the plasma insulin concentration 2 hours following a 75-g oral glucose load varied by more than 20% in two-thirds of the individuals studied when repeat measurements were made 2 days apart.

Given these considerations, it is hardly surprising that the relationship between insulin resistance and insulin response is not perfect. Indeed, what is surprising is how strong the relationship seems to be (r = 0.76) and how rare (5%) it is to find insulin-resistant individuals (SSPG quartile 4) who have an insulin response below the median for this population or insulin-sensitive (SSPG quartile 1) individuals who have an insulin response above the median (8%).

### Insulin resistance alters islet morphology in nondiabetic humans [^112MvDrx]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate changes in islet morphology, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of sections of pancreas removed during surgery. Compared with insulin-sensitive individuals, insulin-resistant subjects exhibited an increased percentage of insulin area (insulin-sensitive 0.58 ± 0.17% vs. insulin-resistant 1.10 ± 0.23%, P = 0.05), percentage of glucagon area (insulin-sensitive 0.04 ± 0.01% vs. insulin-resistant 0.23 ± 0.06%, P < 0.01), and percentage of somatostatin area (insulin-sensitive 0.01 ± 0.00% vs. insulin-resistant 0.03 ± 0.01%, P = 0.01). Overall, these differences resulted in an increased mean islet size in insulin-resistant subjects compared with the insulin-sensitive ones (mean islet size: insulin-sensitive 2,456 ± 332 µm² vs. insulin-resistant 5,156 ± 944 µm², P < 0.001). Further, we observed a strong inverse correlation between islet size and glucose uptake in the entire cohort (r = −0.74, P < 0.01), which suggests that changes in islet morphology are influenced by insulin sensitivity.

### Inhibition of upper small intestinal mTOR lowers plasma glucose levels by inhibiting glucose production [^111ZPreU]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

We discovered, via chemical (i.e. rapamycin) and molecular loss/gain-of-function approaches, that upper small intestinal-targeted mTOR inhibition is necessary and sufficient to lower glucose production and restore glucose homeostasis in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance or type 2 diabetic rodents in vivo. In addition to the pathological effect of mTOR activation in causing hepatic and muscle insulin resistance in rodents and humans, and the fact that acute oral delivery of rapamycin inhibits mTOR and improves insulin sensitivity in the muscle of humans, these results strengthen the notion of targeting the mTOR-dependent pathway in the upper small intestine to achieve metabolic benefits in metabolic syndromes.

The glucose-lowering effect of upper small intestinal-targeted acute rapamycin was confirmed to be preabsorptive. Although acute (~60 min) rapamycin application reverses insulin resistance, chronic rapamycin application instead induces insulin resistance. Such a chronic outcome of rapamycin has been referred to as pseudo-diabetic conditions. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the divergent effect of rapamycin remain elusive, and the duration of mTOR inhibition incurred by rapamycin may be of critical importance.

The acute effect of rapamycin relies largely on the formation of mTORC1, while the chronic effect is mediated by both mTORC1 and mTORC2. The described glucose-lowering effect of rapamycin is achieved when rapamycin was delivered to the upper small intestine for only 50 minutes.

### Waist circumference and insulin resistance: A cross-sectional study of Japanese men [^112N3ta6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Visceral obesity is positively related to insulin resistance. The nature of the relationship between waist circumference and insulin resistance had not been known in Japanese populations. This study examined the relationship between waist circumference and insulin resistance and evaluated the optimal cutoff point for waist circumference in relation to insulin resistance in middle-aged Japanese men.

- **Methods**: Study subjects included 4,800 Japanese men aged 39 to 60 years. Insulin resistance was evaluated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The relationship of waist circumference with HOMA-IR was assessed using adjusted means of HOMA-IR and odds ratios of elevated HOMA-IR, defined as the highest quintile (≥ 2.00). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis using the Youden index and the area under the curve (AUC) was employed to determine optimal cutoffs of waist circumference in relation to HOMA-IR.

- **Results**: Adjusted geometric means of HOMA-IR and prevalence odds of elevated HOMA-IR were progressively higher with increasing levels of waist circumference. In the ROC curve analysis, the highest value of the Youden index was obtained for a cutoff point of 85 cm in waist circumference across different values of HOMA-IR. Multiple logistic regression analysis also indicated that the AUC was consistently the largest for a waist circumference of 85 cm.

- **Conclusion**: Waist circumference is linearly related to insulin resistance, and an 85 cm waist circumference is an optimal cutoff for predicting insulin resistance in middle-aged Japanese men.

### World congress on insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease: part 4 [^117PmjNe]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Insulin resistance and the brain**: Randy Seeley (Cincinnati, OH) discussed the central effects of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1. In addition to its peripheral production in the L cells of the distal gut in response to the presence of nutrients in the proximal intestine, acting on the β-cell as well as other tissues, there is a central GLP-1 system. This central system has production in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and receptors in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and amygdala, which are involved in the control of food intake. Peripheral GLP-1 is generally thought of as a hormone, increasing glucose-induced β-cell insulin secretion and lowering glucose levels in diabetes.

	- Perhaps, Seeley speculated, GLP-1 does not act systemically as a hormone. It is rapidly degraded in plasma by dipeptidyl peptidase 4, with a circulating half-life of no more than 1–2 minutes, and significant hepatic clearance so that ≤ 15% of secreted GLP-1 reaches the peripheral circulation. This is considerably less than glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), which exhibits a much greater dynamic range. Comparisons of animal models not expressing either the GLP-1 or the GIP receptor suggested to Seeley that only the latter acts systemically. Rather, he suggested, the predominant GLP-1 effect is in the portal vein, which expresses GLP-1 receptors. Very low intraportal doses of a GLP-1 antagonist, which fail to have effect when given systemically, increase glucose levels.

	- Central GLP-1 antagonist administration increases blood glucose levels after parenteral glucose, suggesting a role of the central GLP-1 system in glucose homeostasis.

### Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: You can't have one without the other [^111KBYQe]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Although the degree of insulin resistance strongly contributes to insulin response, many factors affect the variance in insulin response as discussed above. One such factor is obesity, which increases insulin response by enhancing insulin secretion and decreasing insulin clearance, especially in insulin-resistant individuals. This phenomenon is evident in the study, where individuals with higher insulin response tend to be more obese than others, even within the same SSPG quartile, as shown in Table 3. This finding is most apparent in the top insulin-resistant quartile (SSPG quartile 4). Conversely, even in this scenario, insulin resistance is higher in individuals with higher insulin response. Therefore, it remains difficult to separate insulin response from insulin sensitivity.

Due to this collinearity, defining the putative effects of insulin resistance versus compensatory hyperinsulinemia on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors is challenging, as illustrated by the data in Table 3. In the most insulin-sensitive quartile (SSPG quartile 1), when comparing CVD risk factors in individuals from the lowest insulin response quartile to those from the next highest insulin response quartile, the two groups differ only in the degree of insulin resistance. Similarly, in the most insulin-resistant quartile (SSPG quartile 4), SSPG concentrations are higher in those with the greatest insulin response (quartile 4) compared to those in insulin response quartile 3. Notably, those with the higher insulin response also exhibit lower HDL cholesterol concentrations.

### Effects of metformin, metformin plus rosiglitazone, and metformin plus lifestyle on insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in today [^116TiVhG]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Studies of youth with type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between HbA1c and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity. In the TODAY study, at screening and randomization, insulin secretion indices declined with increasing HbA1c quartiles. This inverse relationship between HbA1c and β-cell function may either reflect the impact of deficient insulin secretion on the outcome of glycemic control or could be viewed as a glucotoxic phenomenon impairing β-cell function. In the study, the group that failed to maintain glycemic control already had significantly impaired oral disposition index (oDI) at randomization compared with the group that did not fail, and did not show beneficial effects of treatment. This observation, combined with our findings that both HbA1c and oDI are predictors of glycemic failure, suggests that treatment before significant β-cell impairment and deterioration in glycemic control occur may be prudent in achieving better therapeutic success in youth with type 2 diabetes.

Since it was not feasible to institute clamp experiments across the many participating clinics in TODAY, we used surrogate estimates of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function derived from the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). These surrogate estimates correlate strongly with clamp-measured parameters in youth. A potential limitation of TODAY is that in 3.6% of the tests, the value for the insulinogenic index was ≤ 0. This is in complete agreement with previous adult trials of type 2 diabetes and is reported in individuals with normal and impaired glucose tolerance.

### Beta-cell dysfunction and low insulin clearance in insulin-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with lipodystrophy [^1167F6dT]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

To obtain a better understanding of the physiological aspects of glucose homeostasis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with lipodystrophy, we evaluated separately beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity after an oral glucose load.

- **Design**: Beta-cell function was investigated during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (75 g, 180 min) in 16 lipodystrophic HIV-infected patients and in 15 age- and weight-matched nonlipodystrophic HIV-infected patients. All participants were sedentary Caucasian males on highly active antiretroviral therapy with no history of diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance. Prehepatic insulin secretion rates were estimated by deconvolution of C-peptide concentrations, and a composite measure of insulin sensitivity was derived from the OGTT.

- **Results**: Beta-cell secretory capacity (i.e. the rate of change in insulin secretion per unit change in glucose concentration) was similar in lipodystrophic and nonlipodystrophic patients (6.2 ± 1.0 mU kg(-1) min(-1) mg(-1) dL vs. 5.4 ± 0.4, P > 0.4), but insulin sensitivity was reduced by 61% in lipodystrophic patients (P < 0.004). The disposition index (insulin capacity multiplied with insulin sensitivity) and insulin clearance rate were reduced in lipodystrophic patients (-55%, P < 0.003 and -31%, P < 0.004). Insulin clearance rate correlated strongly with insulin sensitivity (r = 0.82, P < 0.001). More lipodystrophic than nonlipodystrophic patients exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus (63% vs. 20%, P < 0.05).

### Attenuation of insulin-evoked responses in brain networks controlling appetite and reward in insulin resistance: The cerebral basis for impaired control of food intake in metabolic syndrome [^112y6oph]. Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

The rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is a global challenge. A possible mechanism linking insulin resistance and weight gain would be the attenuation of insulin-evoked responses in brain areas relevant to eating in systemic insulin resistance. We measured brain glucose metabolism using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in seven insulin-sensitive (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] = 1.3) and seven insulin-resistant (HOMA-IR = 6.3) men during suppression of endogenous insulin by somatostatin, with and without an insulin infusion that elevated insulin to 24.6 ± 5.2 and 23.2 ± 5.8 mU/l (P = 0.76). These concentrations were similar to fasting levels of the resistant subjects and approximately threefold above those of the insulin-sensitive subjects.

Insulin-evoked change in global cerebral metabolic rate for glucose was reduced in insulin resistance (+7% vs. +17.4%, P = 0.033). Insulin was associated with increased metabolism in the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex and with decreased metabolism in the right amygdala/hippocampus and cerebellar vermis (P < 0.001) relative to the global brain. Insulin's effect was less in the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex in the insulin-resistant subjects (mean ± SD for right ventral striatum 3.2 ± 3.9 vs. 7.7 ± 1.7, P = 0.017).

We conclude that brain insulin resistance exists in peripheral insulin resistance, especially in regions subserving appetite and reward. Diminishing the link between control of food intake and energy balance may contribute to the development of obesity in insulin resistance.

### The combination of insulin and metformin in treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [^113KDKtb]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

To assess whether, in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), metformin in conjunction with insulin can safely cause a decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to 7% or less, and whether this combination therapy may result in weight loss and a lower insulin dose compared to insulin treatment alone, was the primary objective.

- **Methods**: Forty patients with NIDDM being treated with insulin on their first visit to the Diabetes Center were identified by retrospective review of medical records over a 1-year period. These patients were classified into two groups: insulin only (group 1) or insulin + metformin (group 2) at the most recent visit. Group 2 was further subdivided into those with a body mass index (BMI) of ≤ 30 kg/m² (group 2A) or > 30 kg/m² (group 2B). Blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin dose, and weights were analyzed from their initial and most recent visits.

- **Results**: HbA1c decreased from 10 ± 2.7% to 7 ± 1.1% (P < 0.01) in group 1 and from 9.8 ± 2.1% to 7.2 ± 1.4% (P < 0.01) in group 2. The magnitude of decrease in HbA1c was not different between the groups. Total insulin dose increased from 40 (33 to 50) U/day to 58 (41 to 67) U/day (P < 0.05) in group 1 and from 63 (42 to 118) U/day to 67 (50 to 96) U/day in group 2, which was not significantly different. The median increase in insulin dose was 8 U in group 1, whereas the median decrease was 3 U in group 2 (P < 0.05). Similar decreases were noted in group 2A. The decrease in insulin dose was inversely related to the initial insulin dose per kilogram of body weight.

### New therapeutic approaches to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [^111J9c5K]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

To review the new treatment strategies for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), various measures aimed at either increasing insulin secretion or decreasing insulin resistance are outlined. Additionally, the management of obesity in patients with diabetes is discussed.

Two new sulfonylureas under investigation include repaglinide, which has a rapid onset of action, quick reversal, and potential usefulness as a preprandial treatment of NIDDM, and glimepiride, the most potent sulfonylurea on a weight basis, with efficacy similar to glyburide. Metformin, an orally administered biguanide hypoglycemic agent, decreases blood glucose levels by 50 to 100 mg/dL and consistently improves triglyceride levels. Another agent for NIDDM therapy is acarbose, an α-glucosidase inhibitor. This agent avidly binds to intestinal disaccharidases and limits the postprandial increase in blood glucose. Troglitazone, part of the thiazolidinedione class of insulin sensitizers, enhances insulin action and lowers blood glucose and blood pressure levels. In overweight patients with diabetes, fenfluramine has been the most effective centrally acting weight reduction agent.

Management of patients with NIDDM has become more complicated due to the increased variety of therapeutic options available. For each patient, nonpharmacologic treatment as well as lipid-lowering, blood pressure-lowering, and glucose-lowering agents must be considered.

### Can glycemic targets be achieved — in particular with two daily injections of a mix of intermediate- and short-acting insulin [^112Ayuh4]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Data demonstrate the feasibility of using twice-daily insulin injections, in combination with selected orally administered agents, to achieve glycemic targets in patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: Recent studies of various therapeutic strategies in patients with type 2 diabetes are reviewed. The rationale for and recommended approaches to using combination treatment to achieve glycemic goals are discussed.

- **Results**: The combination of insulin and insulin sensitizers is an effective option for achieving glycemic goals (hemoglobin A1c ≤ 6.5%). Although thiazolidinediones are better sensitizers than metformin, they are associated with significant weight gain. In contrast, metformin, an effective insulin sensitizer, causes less weight gain. The sequence in which these two sensitizers are added to insulin therapy is important; if metformin is added before a thiazolidinedione, weight gain may be avoided.

- **Conclusion**: Glycemic targets can be achieved with the use of twice-daily mixtures of intermediate- and short-acting insulin in a high percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes.

### When should an insulin sensitizing agent be used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111zj88q]? Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. The attendant hyperinsulinaemia is also thought to contribute to the mechanism of anovulation in PCOS. Both metabolic and reproductive abnormalities are amplified by obesity, and the treatment of first choice for overweight or obese women with PCOS is the modification of diet and lifestyle. Nevertheless, changes in diet and exercise are, for many subjects, not easy to sustain, and there seems an obvious place for insulin sensitizing agents in the management of both reproductive and metabolic disturbances.

Of the available agents affecting insulin sensitivity, metformin has been the most widely used. Despite an enormous literature reporting beneficial effects on reproductive, cutaneous, and metabolic manifestations of PCOS, its efficacy is unproven apart from in those subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes. Metformin, at least, has an assured safety record, whereas both efficacy and safety of other insulin sensitizing agents in women of reproductive age, such as thiazolidinediones and glucagon-like peptide analogues, remain to be established.

### C-reactive protein, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in a population with a high burden of subclinical infection: Insights from the Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease in Alaska Natives (GOCADAN) study [^112LPZz8]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The GOCADAN study provides a unique setting for exploring relationships between inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. In this population, obesity is not pervasive, diabetes rates are low, and the rates of insulin resistance and other metabolic syndrome components vary, while chronic inflammation is prevalent. Although C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in univariate comparisons were higher in those with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, pathogen burden was not. After adjusting for confounders, no consistent relationships were observed between the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), CRP, or subclinical pathogen burden.

Low-grade chronic inflammation has been shown in vitro to promote insulin resistance. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated relationships between CRP and measures of insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. However, longitudinal studies have varied, with CRP predictive of diabetes in some studies but not others. In studies such as the Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS), Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) study, Augsburg study, and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the odds of diabetes with increasing CRP became nonsignificant after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) or other covariates. This suggests that elevations in inflammatory markers seen in insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes are not causative but rather a consequence of these abnormalities. Some argue that the inclusion of BMI in the models represents an over-adjustment, proposing that inflammation precedes obesity; however, until a causal relationship has been established, this remains speculative.

### Viral infection of engrafted human islets leads to diabetes [^117BHNLh]. Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells of pancreatic islets. Genetic and environmental factors both contribute to T1D development. Viral infection with enteroviruses is a suspected trigger for T1D, but a causal role remains unproven and controversial. Studies in animals are problematic because of species-specific differences in host cell susceptibility and immune responses to candidate viral pathogens such as coxsackievirus B (CVB).

In order to resolve the controversial role of viruses in human T1D, we developed a viral infection model in immunodeficient mice bearing human islet grafts. Hyperglycemia was induced in mice by specific ablation of native β-cells. Human islets, which are naturally susceptible to CVB infection, were transplanted to restore normoglycemia. Transplanted mice were infected with CVB4 and monitored for hyperglycemia. Forty-seven percent of CVB4-infected mice developed hyperglycemia.

Human islet grafts from infected mice contained viral RNA, expressed viral protein, and had reduced insulin levels compared with grafts from uninfected mice. Human-specific gene expression profiles in grafts from infected mice revealed the induction of multiple interferon-stimulated genes. Thus, human islets can become severely dysfunctional with diminished insulin production after CVB infection of β-cells, resulting in diabetes.

### The 6th annual world congress on the insulin resistance syndrome [^1176DE4A]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Gerald Reaven (Stanford, CA) reviewed aspects of the relationship between obesity and insulin sensitivity. Using the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) after infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucose as a measure of insulin resistance, there is a sixfold variation from the most insulin-sensitive to the most insulin-resistant decile in the apparently healthy nondiabetic population. He mentioned a study of approximately 300 people in whom the correlation coefficient of BMI versus SSPG was 0.46, which he interpreted as indicative of "enormous variability at any level of BMI". Obesity is associated with a sedentary lifestyle, and he then mentioned another study with a somewhat stronger correlation of 0.63 between clamp insulin sensitivity and VO2 max during exercise.

In Pima and Caucasian subjects, obesity showed a negative relationship with insulin action up to 28% body fat, with further degrees of obesity not significantly changing insulin sensitivity. In both groups, VO2 max was linearly related to insulin action, independently of the degree of obesity, with the two factors together accounting for approximately half the variation in insulin sensitivity. Reaven suggested that the other half must be genetic. Family studies of Pima Indians, for example, show a strong inherited component. Similar effects have been reported in a number of ethnic groups, with a very high degree of insulin resistance among Asian Indians. It is the insulin resistance that appears to convey abnormalities rather than obesity per se, with comparison of nonobese hyperinsulinemic individuals.

### Relationships between circulating metabolic intermediates and insulin action in overweight to obese, inactive men and women [^112HEjbt]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In addition to evaluating relationships between circulating metabolites and measures of insulin action, we also explored sex differences in these relationships. We observed that for men, insulin sensitivity was most related to the factor containing large neutral amino acids and another containing glutamine and glutamate. For women, concentrations of these two sets of metabolites were much less strongly related to insulin sensitivity, but waist circumference and a factor containing glycine and serine were most related. Additionally, the inverse relationship between concentrations of fatty acids and the appropriate pancreatic response (DI) was more robust for women than for men. These sex differences are intriguing in light of emerging evidence supporting sex differences in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Before adolescence, girls are more insulin resistant than boys, but during adolescence, a shift occurs such that in adulthood, women are more insulin sensitive than men. Several studies have shown that both male rats and men are more susceptible than female rats and women to fatty acid-induced insulin resistance, but less focus has been placed on examining sex differences in the relationships between amino acids and insulin resistance.

It is notable that most of the work examining branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in the context of obesity and insulin resistance has been performed predominantly in men. Furthermore, prior investigations have shown that men are more likely to develop insulin resistance as a consequence of low birth weight.

### Erectile dysfunction: Does insulin resistance play a part [^113xfuPs]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review MEDLINE literature for correlations between insulin resistance and erectile dysfunction (ED).

- **Design**: MEDLINE literature review spanning from 1966 to the present.

- **Setting**: Conducted at an academic medical center.

- **Patients**: None.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Main outcome measures**: None.

- **Results**: Erectile dysfunction affects more than half of men over the age of 40. Fortunately, most men with ED can be successfully treated with phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE-5) inhibitors, which up-regulate the vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide (NO). Insulin resistance affects 25% of U.S. adults and increases to a 60% occurrence in individuals who are overweight. Endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with insulin resistance states, can cause disturbances in the subcellular signaling pathways required for NO production. Because endothelial production of NO and insulin sensitivity are positively related in healthy humans, the relationships among insulin resistance, NO, and ED are the target of this review of MEDLINE literature.

- **Conclusions**: Insulin resistance states are characterized by defective vascular NO production and impaired insulin-induced vasodilation, both of which are likely to cause ED. Diagnosing and treating insulin resistance should be part of the initial management plan for ED. Future studies concerning the cause-and-effect relationship of insulin resistance and ED should be implemented.

### BMI, RQ, diabetes, and sex affect the relationships between amino acids and clamp measures of insulin action in humans [^114KHrEA]. Diabetes (2014).

Prevalence rates for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease have been increasing globally and are responsible for an increased burden of patient suffering and social costs. Insulin resistance is integral in the pathogenesis of these disorders and involves defects in glucose production by the liver and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and utilization by peripheral tissues. While obesity is associated with insulin resistance, general adiposity explains only a minor portion of variability in insulin resistance among nondiabetic individuals. Numerous studies have found that insulin resistance and diabetes are associated with fat accumulation in the visceral compartment, skeletal muscle, and liver tissue.

Recent research suggests that amino acids may also be important in the development of insulin resistance, as alterations in circulating levels of several amino acids, including branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AAA), are associated with obesity and insulin resistance, and identified as the best early predictors for the future development of diabetes. Moreover, baseline levels of BCAA, AAA, and related metabolites are prognostic for improvement in insulin sensitivity in response to a dietary/behavioral intervention and are tightly correlated with improvement in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity after bariatric surgery.

While these studies have focused primarily on BCAA and AAA, other amino acids may also be relevant in the development of insulin resistance and T2DM.

### Why insulin sensitizers but not secretagogues should be retained when initiating insulin in type 2 diabetes [^1126thGv]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

The stringent targets set for HbA(1c) levels in type 2 diabetes are currently achieved by fewer than half the patients in the United States. Failure to manage hyperglycemia in the early stages of the disease results in a progressive loss of beta-cell function, which ultimately necessitates the initiation of insulin therapy. At this point, choices have to be made on whether to continue oral anti-diabetic drug therapy and, if so, with which agent(s).

Historically, sulfonylureas have been the mainstay of oral anti-diabetic drug therapy; however, their long-term efficacy in patients with depleted beta-cell capacity is doubtful. Other classes of oral anti-diabetic drugs, notably the insulin sensitizers, may prove more reliable. These agents (metformin and thiazolidinediones) appear to provide various benefits over and above sustained glycemic control, which may variably include reduced loss of beta-cell function as well as improvements to cardiovascular risk factors, morbidity, and mortality. Metformin also limits weight gain associated with insulin therapy.

This manuscript presents the case that when insulin therapy is initiated, it should be tailored to individual needs through combination with one or more insulin sensitizers rather than a secretagogue.

### Insulin, insulin-like growth factors, insulin resistance, and neoplasia [^113SggU8]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

An accumulating body of epidemiologic and laboratory evidence suggests that insulin and insulin-like growth factors influence both the risk and the prognosis of cancer. In this brief review, topics covered in the lecture on research directions in this field are highlighted, including the view that metformin deserves investigation as a potential adjunct in the treatment or prevention of cancer in persons with hyperinsulinemia.

### Dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/δ agonist GFT505 improves hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in abdominally obese subjects [^116jz416]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The present randomized study, using the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method, clearly demonstrates that GFT505 is a new insulin-sensitizer that improves both peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant abdominally obese subjects. In accordance with a hepatic insulin-sensitizing action, GFT505 improved the levels of liver enzymes (γGT and ALT). GFT505 also improved plasma lipid parameters, significantly decreasing both TG and LDL cholesterol levels. Finally, the safety profile of GFT505 was good, with no reported serious adverse events.

In clinical practice, TZDs remain the most efficacious insulin-sensitizing drugs that improve both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. In parallel, TZDs reduce liver fat in patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Metformin is a biguanide that acts by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, leading to reduced hepatic mitochondrial ATP production and gluconeogenesis rates. In contrast to TZDs, several studies indicate that metformin fails to improve peripheral insulin sensitivity and to reduce liver fat content.

Compared with placebo, GFT505 simultaneously improved the glucose infusion rate (GIR) by 21% during the second insulin infusion period and the suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) by 43% during the first insulin infusion period of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The extent of the GIR increase on GFT505 treatment seems to be in a range similar to that observed in two placebo-controlled studies with pioglitazone, one in prediabetic subjects with coronary heart disease (+12.5%).

### Long term cardiovascular effects of oral antidiabetic agents in non-diabetic patients with insulin resistance: double blind, prospective, randomised study [^112XxqT5]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term cardiovascular effects of oral antidiabetic agents in non-diabetic patients with insulin resistance.

- **Patients**: 181 African American subjects with insulin resistance and normal glucose tolerance were randomized to receive glipizide 5 mg/day (n = 25), metformin 500 mg/day (n = 59), or placebo (n = 97) for 24 months. Insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, lipid profile, left ventricular mass (echocardiography), aortic distensibility (echocardiography, blood pressure), and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV, carotid to femoral artery, Doppler) were measured at baseline and at 12 and 24 months after randomization.

- **Results**: A significant increase in PWV was observed in both the glipizide (mean (SEM) change at 24 months 2.8 (2.7) m/s, p = 0.012) and metformin (2.2 (0.7) m/s, p = 0.01) groups during the follow-up period, whereas PWV remained unchanged in the placebo group. The increase in PWV in the treatment groups was significant compared with placebo (analysis of variance p < 0.05). Other cardiovascular or metabolic variables did not change significantly compared with placebo during follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: The observed increase in PWV is consistent with a decrease in the elastic properties of the aorta. The use of oral antidiabetic agents for the prevention of cardiovascular complications in non-diabetic African Americans with insulin resistance needs to be critically evaluated.

### Lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution is proatherogenic in women with type 1 diabetes and insulin resistance [^116RUaum]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

To further investigate these differences and to test the hypothesis that insulin resistance affects lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution, we plotted the differences between the highest and lowest tertiles of insulin resistance as measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp protocol within each sex and type 1 diabetes strata.

- **Lipoprotein distribution in men with type 1 diabetes**: For men with type 1 diabetes, those with the most insulin resistance, compared to those with the least insulin resistance, exhibited a shift to increased cholesterol in denser LDL and HDL.

- **Lipoprotein distribution in male control subjects**: For male control subjects, those with the most insulin resistance had more VLDL cholesterol as well as a shift to increased cholesterol in denser LDL and HDL.

- **Lipoprotein distribution in women with type 1 diabetes**: For women with type 1 diabetes, those with the most insulin resistance had more cholesterol distributed in VLDL and less distributed in HDL.

In contrast, for female control subjects, there were no differences in lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution between subjects with the most and least insulin resistance.
