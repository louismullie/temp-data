## Question

Symptoms of Ehlers Danlos

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental definition and current classification of EDS. Then, I should delineate the universal hallmarks and verify if they truly span all subtypes. Next, I will map symptoms by organ system, being careful to distinguish common from subtype-specific features and to weigh the credibility of sources. After that, I will identify symptom clusters and red flags that warrant urgent evaluation. Finally, I will consider diagnostic tools, comorbidities such as dysautonomia and mast cell activation, and management principles, making sure to self-check controversial areas like POTS/MCAS testing and GI care pathways throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders defined by collagen-related abnormalities leading to joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility across multiple organ systems, with 13 recognized subtypes and hypermobile EDS (hEDS) the most prevalent though without a known molecular basis; reported prevalence varies by subtype and region, and hEDS appears relatively common in Europe at roughly 12.5 per 100,000, though estimates are likely conservative given underdiagnosis; wait, I almost said there were 14 types — let me verify — some sources discuss 14 types historically, but the widely accepted framework recognizes 13 with known molecular causes for all but hEDS, so I will adhere to 13 while noting occasional discrepant counts in the literature, and I should emphasize that vascular EDS (vEDS) carries the highest risk due to arterial and hollow organ fragility, whereas classical EDS (cEDS) has prominent skin features and atrophic scarring [^113dCzsV] [^116ZJfj3] [^113xMwSD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universality; I should confirm the core hallmarks. Across EDS, the canonical triad includes generalized joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and generalized tissue fragility with easy bruising, though the degree and distribution vary by subtype; I need to ensure I do not overstate universality in subtypes with subtle phenotypes, but the dermatologic synthesis and primers consistently underscore this triad as foundational to clinical recognition and differential diagnosis [^113dCzsV] [^1123gGQg].

> Next, I will examine musculoskeletal and neuromuscular manifestations. Patients commonly have symptomatic joint hypermobility with recurrent subluxations or dislocations, chronic musculoskeletal pain, proprioceptive impairment, and risk of early osteoarthritis; wait, I should verify neuropathic contributions — evidence demonstrates small fiber neuropathy and autonomic involvement in a substantial fraction of hEDS, and neuromuscular studies report mild-to-moderate weakness, myalgias, and mixed neurogenic-myopathic patterns on EMG in multiple EDS types, supporting a composite pain phenotype that includes nociceptive, neuropathic, and central components with significant functional impact [^113SLtb3] [^114JZDce] [^114nRy94] [^112Ew8sr].

> I will now review integumentary and hemostatic features. Characteristic skin findings include hyperextensibility, softness, delayed wound healing, and atrophic scarring, with subtype signatures such as venous visibility and acrogeria in vEDS and molluscoid pseudotumors or subcutaneous spheroids in classical forms; bleeding symptoms are frequent and heterogeneous — easy bruising is common, and cohort data show elevated bleeding assessment scores with clinically relevant events such as muscle hematomas and life-threatening menorrhagia in a minority — so I should confirm counseling on injury avoidance and specialized wound care given the propensity for tissue frailty and adhesion trauma [^1123gGQg] [^113n1zyt] [^112jcEPo].

> Let me consider cardiovascular and autonomic involvement carefully. While severe arterial complications define vEDS, occasional arterial events may occur in classical EDS, underscoring the need for clinical vigilance; I should double-check the dysautonomia link — prospective data in hEDS show frequent orthostatic intolerance and POTS, with increased resting and orthostatic heart rates, supporting evaluation when symptomatic; I need to ensure I frame aortic root dilation and valvular disease as less typical outside vEDS but possible in select cases, guiding individualized cardiology assessment based on phenotype and family history [^113YTQYQ] [^111FZF1P] [^114JZDce].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal manifestations and their intersection with autonomic and immune dysregulation. Disorders of gut-brain interaction are very common in hEDS/HSD, with overlapping esophageal, gastroduodenal, bowel, and anorectal symptoms; wait, I should verify best-practice guidance — the AGA 2025 expert reviews recommend a positive symptom-based diagnostic strategy and standard DGBI/motility pathways for most patients, with targeted testing for POTS and mast cell activation syndrome only when clinical features suggest these comorbidities, and early consideration of celiac testing; management should focus on predominant symptoms, reserve MCAS testing for appropriate phenotypes, and incorporate dietitian-led nutrition strategies to avoid excessive dietary restriction [^1162LRzY] [^111bs4T6] [^111F7ziK] [^1166FkDC] [^116P9WeC] [^114erPQH] [^116ftyQC].

> I will now examine gynecologic and obstetric symptoms. Women with EDS frequently report heavy menses, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic floor dysfunction, with higher rates of subfertility and adverse obstetric outcomes in some subtypes, particularly vEDS; I should confirm that pelvic floor and defecatory dysfunction overlap with lower GI complaints, so a tailored evaluation including anorectal manometry or balloon expulsion testing is reasonable when symptoms of incomplete evacuation or rectal hyposensitivity are prominent [^116s2NSJ] [^115LdQRq].

> Let me think about neurologic, cognitive, and fatigue domains. Autonomic dysfunction manifests as orthostatic intolerance and POTS in a subset of hEDS, and patients frequently describe mental fatigue and "brain fog"; I should verify that cluster analyses and Delphi work highlight pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance as key patient-prioritized domains, reinforcing the need for integrated pain management and sleep optimization within multidisciplinary care [^114JZDce] [^113D1dgb] [^114inx1i].

> I should review psychosocial impact and quality of life before moving to red flags. Chronic pain is common, severe, and functionally impairing, with correlations to hypermobility and dislocations; patients with hEDS/HSD often report low satisfaction with healthcare and illness uncertainty, so I need to ensure the plan emphasizes validation, education, and coordinated care to mitigate diagnostic delay and fragmented management [^112Ew8sr] [^111ZuZDf] [^113dCzsV].

> Next, I will summarize empiric comorbid symptom clusters. Data-driven analyses suggest at least three subgroups: pain-dominant, high global symptom burden, and mental fatigue–dominant; hold on, I should emphasize that these profiles are overlapping rather than mutually exclusive, and that they support personalized care pathways tailored to the predominant burden in each patient [^113D1dgb].

> Now, I need to specify diagnostic red flags that should trigger urgent evaluation. Sudden severe pain in the chest, abdomen, or extremity may herald arterial or hollow-organ events, particularly in vEDS but rarely in classical EDS as well; spontaneous or escalating bleeding, new neurological deficits, or rapidly progressive cardiopulmonary symptoms warrant immediate assessment, with triage toward vascular imaging and specialty input as indicated [^113YTQYQ] [^111FZF1P] [^113n1zyt].

> Let me first confirm baseline diagnostic tools and when to extend testing. Screening for generalized joint hypermobility with the Beighton score and a validated five-part questionnaire is recommended in primary care and specialty settings; I initially recalled a fixed Beighton threshold of 4/9, but wait, I should be cautious — contemporary criteria integrate age-appropriate thresholds and broader clinical features under the 2017 framework, so clinicians should screen with Beighton and confirm hEDS using the 2017 criteria when positive; targeted testing for POTS with postural vitals and autonomic referral is advised only when orthostatic symptoms persist despite initial measures, and MCAS testing is reserved for episodic multisystem features suggesting mast cell disease, while small fiber neuropathy assessment via skin biopsy may be considered in neuropathic pain or dysautonomia phenotypes [^113xCqDk] [^113SLtb3] [^111P2Hbu] [^111F7ziK] [^1166FkDC] [^114JZDce].

> Next, I should review core management principles and verify subspecialty guidance. Early multidisciplinary care is recommended, anchored by physical and occupational therapy and cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce injury risk, improve function, and address pain and kinesiophobia; GI symptoms should be managed per DGBI/motility best practices with symptom-focused pharmacotherapy and dietitian-guided nutrition, while dysautonomia or MCAS-targeted therapies are appropriate only when clinically supported; skin and wound care require tension-minimizing techniques and low-adherence dressings, with prevention strategies such as avoiding high-impact activities and using protective equipment; I need to ensure I note the importance of patient education, orthotics, and community supports to sustain self-management [^114bNyif] [^1162LRzY] [^116n3wTw] [^112jcEPo] [^112iRnvV] [^114erPQH].

> Finally, let me synthesize clinically. EDS manifests as a multisystem connective tissue disorder with variable expressivity, anchored by hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility, but the true burden often arises from chronic pain, fatigue, dysautonomia, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and bleeding diathesis; hypermobile EDS is the most prevalent and remains a clinical diagnosis without a defined gene, emphasizing careful phenotyping and comorbidity assessment, whereas vascular EDS carries the greatest risk and necessitates vigilant surveillance and rapid response to acute symptoms; comprehensive, personalized, and multidisciplinary care is essential across the lifespan to optimize function, reduce complications, and address psychosocial needs [^113dCzsV] [^114bNyif] [^113YTQYQ].

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) presents with a **triad of joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility** [^113dCzsV]. Symptoms vary by subtype [^113dCzsV]: hypermobile EDS features chronic joint pain, frequent dislocations, and fatigue; classical EDS shows atrophic scarring and easy bruising; vascular EDS carries life-threatening risks such as arterial or organ rupture [^113YTQYQ] [^113dCzsV]. Common systemic symptoms include chronic pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues [^113dCzsV], autonomic dysfunction (e.g. POTS) [^111F7ziK], and bleeding tendencies [^113n1zyt]. Management is **multidisciplinary** [^114bNyif], focusing on symptom control, injury prevention, and regular monitoring for complications.

---

## Musculoskeletal symptoms

- **Joint hypermobility**: Generalized joint laxity, often assessed using the Beighton score [^113xCqDk].
- **Joint instability**: Frequent subluxations and dislocations, particularly in hypermobile EDS [^115gKGDQ].
- **Chronic musculoskeletal pain**: Persistent pain, often severe and debilitating [^112Ew8sr].
- **Early-onset osteoarthritis**: Degenerative joint changes occurring earlier than typical [^113dCzsV].
- **Muscle weakness and hypotonia**: Reduced muscle strength and tone, contributing to instability [^114nRy94].

---

## Dermatological symptoms

- **Skin hyperextensibility**: Stretchy, elastic skin that returns to normal when released [^1123gGQg].
- **Skin fragility**: Thin, delicate skin prone to tearing and bruising [^1123gGQg].
- **Atrophic scarring**: Thin, widened scars, particularly in classical EDS [^1173KNmt].
- **Easy bruising**: Frequent bruising with minimal trauma [^113n1zyt].
- **Delayed wound healing**: Prolonged healing times and increased risk of wound complications [^112jcEPo].

---

## Cardiovascular symptoms

In EDS, cardiovascular involvement includes **arterial fragility** with increased risk of arterial rupture, aneurysms, and dissections, particularly in vascular EDS [^113tWVpM]. Mitral valve prolapse is a common cardiac manifestation, and aortic root dilation may occur [^113dCzsV], potentially leading to aortic regurgitation [^113pTrDS]. Autonomic involvement may present as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) with orthostatic intolerance and tachycardia [^111F7ziK].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

Gastrointestinal symptoms range from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with frequent reflux to **functional gastrointestinal disorders**, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastroparesis [^111bs4T6]. Connective tissue weakness predisposes to hernias and organ prolapse [^113dCzsV]. Chronic constipation and diarrhea are common [^116ftyQC].

---

## Neurological symptoms

Neurological symptoms include **chronic headaches and migraines**, which are frequent and often severe; small fiber neuropathy may cause pain, tingling, and numbness [^114JZDce]. Autonomic dysfunction is common, including dysautonomia and orthostatic intolerance [^111F7ziK]. Cognitive impairment — often described as "brain fog" — is also reported [^113D1dgb].

---

## Psychological symptoms

Psychological symptoms often include **anxiety and depression** [^115gKGDQ], frequently related to chronic pain and disability [^115gzXCs]. Persistent fatigue significantly impacts quality of life [^114inx1i], and sleep disturbances — such as insomnia and poor sleep quality — are also frequently reported [^114inx1i] [^112Ew8sr].

---

## Other systemic symptoms

Other systemic symptoms include **bleeding tendencies**, such as easy bruising, menorrhagia, and bleeding after minor procedures [^113n1zyt]. Some patients report immune system dysfunction with increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmune conditions. Respiratory complications may occur, including spontaneous pneumothorax and diaphragmatic rupture [^113dCzsV].

---

## Subtype-specific symptoms

| **EDS subtype** | **Key symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Hypermobile (hEDS) | Joint hypermobility, chronic pain, fatigue, autonomic dysfunction |

---

## Impact on daily life

EDS **significantly affects daily life**, causing chronic pain, fatigue, and functional impairment. Patients often face difficulties with employment, social interactions, and mental health, leading to reduced quality of life [^112kBqa4] [^112Ew8sr].

---

## Management strategies

Management of EDS is **multidisciplinary**, focusing on symptom control, injury prevention, and routine monitoring for complications. Key strategies include:

- **Physical therapy**: Tailored exercises to improve joint stability and strength [^112iRnvV].
- **Pain management**: Medications, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral therapy [^116emBGi] [^114bNyif].
- **Cardiovascular monitoring**: Regular imaging and blood pressure control.
- **Gastrointestinal management**: Dietary modifications and medications [^1162LRzY].
- **Psychological support**: Counseling and support groups [^114bNyif].

---

EDS is characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility, with symptoms varying by subtype [^1157Cs3K]. Management requires a **multidisciplinary approach** to address the wide range of symptoms and complications [^114bNyif].

### Characterization of bleeding symptoms in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113n1zyt]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Low credibility.

Easy bruising is included as a major or minor criterion for the classification of multiple types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Despite a longstanding recognition of the association between EDS and bleeding, we still lack a definitive understanding of the frequency, severity, and types of bleeding complications in patients with EDS.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate hemorrhagic symptoms using the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis bleeding assessment tool (ISTH-BAT) in a cohort of patients with defined types of EDS.

- **Methods**: We utilized the ISTH-BAT to characterize hemorrhagic symptoms and their severity in a cohort of 52 patients with classical, classical-like, hypermobile, or vascular EDS and a matched group of 52 healthy control subjects.

- **Results**: The mean ISTH-BAT score was 0.1 for healthy subjects and 9.1 for patients with EDS (p < .0001). An abnormal ISTH-BAT score was observed in 32 of 52 (62%) patients with EDS and 0 of 52 healthy controls (p < .0001). The most frequent bleeding symptoms were bruising, muscle hematomas, menorrhagia, epistaxis, bleeding from the oral cavity, and bleeding after tooth extraction. Menorrhagia that was life-threatening or required surgery was reported in 7 of 52 (14%) patients with EDS.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with multiple types of EDS exhibit a wide range of bleeding symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening episodes.

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113dCzsV]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:

- **Definition**: EDS is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensible skin, hypermobile joints, and tissue fragility.

- **Pathophysiology**: EDS results from defects in collagen synthesis or structure, leading to weakened connective tissues. Mutations in genes such as COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, and COL1A2 are implicated in different subtypes, affecting the primary structure and later processing of type I, III, and V collagens.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of EDS is believed to be underestimated, ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 400,000, depending on the subtype.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for EDS include a family history of the disorder, as it may be inherited in some cases depending on the subtype. It may also be associated with other genetic disorders or rheumatological diseases.

- **Disease course**: The syndrome is classified into several subtypes based on clinical presentation and genetic mutations, with the most common being the hypermobile, classical, and vascular types. Common features include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, and Marfanoid habitus. The vascular type is particularly severe, with risks of arterial rupture, organ rupture, and early mortality. Other complications can include chronic pain, joint dislocations, and early-onset osteoarthritis. Associated systemic findings include anxiety disorders, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1162LRzY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, more specifically in relation to gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend aligning the management of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders who do not exhibit symptoms consistent with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or mast cell activation syndrome, with existing approaches to the management of disorders of gut-brain interaction and gastrointestinal motility disorders in the general population.

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Include integrated multidisciplinary care involving multiple specialties as appropriate (cardiology, rheumatology, dietitian, psychology).

### Skin fragility and wound management in Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: A report by the International Consortium on Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders Skin Working Group [^112jcEPo]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and generalized tissue fragility. In all types of EDS, skin wound healing is impaired to a variable degree. Additional support through wound management plans may help to improve these outcomes; however, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the clinical management of skin fragility and wounds in EDS. This paper aims to review evidence and provide recommendations for the management of skin wounds in EDS types.

Preventative measures to avoid skin injury are strongly recommended, including avoidance of high-impact sports and use of appropriate protection such as shin guards. Bruising is common, and some types of EDS are associated with hematoma formation, with management including compression bandages and consideration of pharmacological therapy. Skin fragility and tears should be managed with a focus on the protection of remaining tissue, avoidance of wound tension, and the use of low-adherence dressings to avoid further injury.

This paper provides clear recommendations to address skin management for this group of patients. It highlights the lack of good-quality published data to support treatment decisions.

### A machine learning approach to stratify patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorders according to disorders of gut brain interaction, comorbidities and quality of life [^116ftyQC]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) refer to a collection of 13 inherited non-inflammatory connective tissue disorders characterized by skin hyper-extensibility, tissue fragility, and joint hypermobility. The underlying cause may be attributed to mutations in genes encoding collagen or extracellular matrix proteins, which result in abnormalities in collagen structure and function. Currently, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) is the only EDS subtype where both the genetic basis and pathophysiology remain unknown. hEDS is a multisystemic disorder associated with multiple comorbidities, including disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), fibromyalgia, and functional somatic syndromes. Individuals who have been previously diagnosed with some, but not all, of the 2017 criteria for hEDS are currently labeled as having hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD).

Several studies have shown that hEDS/HSD patients have a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms than the general population or patients presenting to general gastroenterology clinics without hEDS/HSD. Disorders of gut-brain interaction are particularly prevalent in hEDS/HSD, with 98% of 603 individuals found to have one DGBI, and 84% of hEDS/HSD individuals found to have two or more overlapping DGBIs; most commonly affecting the bowel, gastroduodenal, esophageal, and anorectal regions. The overlap between differing DGBIs is not uncommon, with a 36% overlap of two or more DGBIs demonstrated in general population studies.

### Pilot study of an online-delivered mindfulness meditation in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS): Effect on quality-of-life and participant lived experience [^116emBGi]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2023). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are connective tissue disorders with multi-systemic symptoms. The management of chronic pain and other symptoms of EDS is a challenge for patients and clinicians. Mindfulness-based approaches for chronic pain have been shown to produce improvements in pain symptoms. Therefore, mindfulness meditation could be an acceptable and readily accessible therapy for pain in EDS. This study evaluated the effect of daily practice of mindfulness meditation on the pain experience and quality-of-life in individuals with EDS.

A pre-post design enabled the assessment of changes in quality-of-life using the SF-36 after practicing internet-delivered mindfulness meditation for two weeks. Thematic analysis of interviews (n = 10) documented the lived experience of meditation practice for pain symptoms. One hundred fifty-seven participants were recruited from UK EDS charities mailing lists, and seventy-six completed the two-week intervention.

There was a statistically significant improvement in the SF-36 mental component summary score of medium effect size, and the change was clinically important. Thematic analysis revealed three key themes of lived experience: increased body awareness, reduction in pain intensity, and barriers to practicing meditation.

This study provides novel evidence regarding the effect and experience of meditation for symptoms in people with EDS. The outcomes warrant further research with appropriate control groups to determine efficacy. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective for chronic pain relief. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) presents specific challenges and opportunities for the application of these interventions.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1166FkDC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly in the context of evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for mast cell disorders, including mast cell activation syndrome. This is advised for patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and disorders of gut-brain interaction who exhibit episodic symptoms suggesting a generalized mast cell disorder involving two or more physiological systems. These tests should not be used for the routine evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in all patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders unless there is clinical or laboratory evidence of a primary or secondary mast cell disorder.

### Use of cluster analysis to delineate symptom profiles in an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient population [^113D1dgb]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2019). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a set of rare heritable disorders of connective tissue, characterized by defects in the structure and synthesis of extracellular matrix elements that lead to a myriad of problems including joint hypermobility and skin abnormalities. Because EDS affects multiple organ systems, defining clear boundaries and recognizing overlapping clinical features shared by disease phenotypes is challenging.

The objective of this study was to seek evidence of phenotypic subgroups of patients with distinctive symptom profiles and describe these resulting subgroups.

Data were extracted from a repository assembled between 2001 and 2013 by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to form distinct subgroups of patients with respect to the domains of pain, physical and mental fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and nighttime sleep. Domains were selected based on literature review, clinician expertise, and guidance from patient advisors.

One hundred seventy-five patients met all inclusion criteria. Three subgroups were identified:

- **Pain dominant subgroup**: This group consisted of 39 patients with the highest mean pain values but the lowest mean values of other symptoms.
- **High symptom burden subgroup**: Comprising 71 patients, this subgroup had high mean values across all domains.
- **Mental fatigue subgroup**: Consisting of 65 patients, this group exhibited a high mean value for mental fatigue and daytime sleepiness, but a lower mean value for pain.

The subgroups aligned with clinical observation of the heterogeneous nature of EDS, exhibiting overlapping features across different phenotypes.

### Patient perspectives on employment participation in the "hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome" [^112kBqa4]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome" (EDS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder influencing multiple aspects of daily life. Most studies have focused on describing the physical symptoms and level of disability, but little knowledge exists about the psychosocial effects of the pathology. Participation in employment significantly influences the quality of life for patients with chronic pathologies. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the lived experiences in employment participation of patients diagnosed with "hypermobile EDS".

- **Methods**: An inductive thematic analysis using semi-structured interviews was conducted. Nine patients, selected through a purposive sampling strategy, were included. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

- **Results**: Data analysis resulted in three main themes: (1) elements assisting participation in employment, (2) limitations in employment participation, and (3) unemployment due to "hypermobile EDS". On the one hand, the results show that related health complaints can severely impede employment participation. On the other hand, patients report several aspects of work that positively affect their well-being.

- **Conclusion**: There are specific reasons for a person with "hypermobile EDS" to participate in employment. These reasons differ for each individual and may even vary over time.

- **Implications for rehabilitation**: "Hypermobile EDS" greatly impacts activities and participation in daily life. "Living with limitations" is a central theme in the lives of "hypermobile EDS" patients.

### Neuromuscular involvement in various types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^114nRy94]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Muscle involvement is plausible based on recently discovered interactions between muscle cells and extracellular matrix molecules; however, muscle symptoms are only sporadically reported. We designed a cross-sectional study to determine whether neuromuscular features are part of EDS.

- **Methods**: Standardized questionnaires, physical examinations, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, muscle ultrasound, and muscle biopsy were performed in 40 EDS patients with the vascular, classic, tenascin-X (TNX)-deficient type EDS, and hypermobility type of EDS caused by TNXB haploinsufficiency.

- **Results**: Muscle weakness, myalgia, and easy fatigability were reported by the majority of patients. Mild-to-moderate muscle weakness (85%) and reduction of vibration sense (60%) were common. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated axonal polyneuropathy in five patients (13%). Needle electromyography showed myopathic features in nine patients (26%) and a mixed neurogenic-myopathic pattern in most (60%). Muscle ultrasound indicated increased echo-intensity (48%) and atrophy (50%). Mild myopathic features were seen on muscle biopsy in five patients (28%). Overall, patients with the hypermobility type EDS caused by TNXB haploinsufficiency were least affected.

- **Interpretation**: Mild-to-moderate neuromuscular involvement is common in various types of EDS, with a remarkable relation between residual…

### Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorders [^115gKGDQ]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders are the most common symptomatic joint hypermobility conditions seen in clinical practice. The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes replaced previous terms for symptomatic joint hypermobility with hypermobile EDS and introduced the term hypermobility spectrum disorders for patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for hypermobile EDS. Both conditions are diagnosed by applying the 2017 diagnostic criteria, which also exclude other less common conditions presenting with joint hypermobility, such as other forms of EDS and heritable connective tissue disorders.

Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern; however, it does not have a known genetic mutation to aid in diagnosis. Clinical features of hypermobile EDS include joint hypermobility, skin findings, and joint pains or redislocations. Hypermobile EDS and, less commonly, hypermobility spectrum disorders may also be associated with several extra-articular symptoms, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction.

The central goals of therapy are managing symptoms, preventing joint injury, and educating patients about their condition. Based on limited evidence, patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders may benefit from physical and occupational therapy, psychological support, and self-management. Primary care physicians play a key role not only in initial recognition and diagnosis, but also in patient education and management.

### Dermatologic manifestations and diagnostic assessments of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: A clinical review [^1123gGQg]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) comprise a group of connective tissue disorders that manifest with skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, joint hypermobility, and fragility of skin, soft tissues, and some organs. A correct assessment of cutaneous features, along with the use of adjunct technologies, can improve diagnostic accuracy.

- **Objectives**: To systematically review the cutaneous features and adjunct investigations of EDS.

- **Methods**: A search of PubMed and Web of Science for EDS-related cutaneous features and additional investigations was undertaken from the publication of the 2017 International Classification of EDS until January 15, 2022.

- **Results**: One hundred and forty studies involved 839 patients with EDS. The female-to-male ratio was 1.36:1 (P < .001). A high prevalence of skin hyperextensibility, bruising, and soft skin was noted. Most patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome showed venous visibility, skin fragility, and acrogeria. Classical EDS showed subcutaneous spheroids and molluscoid pseudotumours. In patients that underwent skin biopsies, only 30.3% and 71.4% showed features suggestive of EDS using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively.

- **Limitations**: Retrospective study and small case numbers for some EDS subtypes.

- **Conclusions**: An accurate clinical diagnosis increases the chances of a molecular diagnosis, particularly for rarer EDS subtypes, while decreasing the need for genetic testing where there is a low clinical suspicion for a monogenic EDS subtype.

### Practical management strategies for benign hypermobility syndromes [^112iRnvV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic hypermobility syndrome, such as hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD), commonly present to rheumatologists with joint pain and functional disability. Providers often have difficulty with diagnosis due to a lack of knowledge on the range of associated manifestations and the available therapeutic modalities. This review will discuss recent updates on diagnostic measures and treatment options for rheumatologists to help patients navigate hEDS/HSD.

- **Recent findings**: This article describes newer diagnostic measures and assessment of hEDS/HSD manifestations. Evidence supporting physical therapy and occupational therapy is provided, as well as recent updates on assistive devices, compressive garments, orthoses, and surgical interventions. Given patient heterogeneity, specific guidance about the amount and type of therapies required to produce a beneficial effect is lacking. Treatment should be individualized, and many of the studies focus on regional joint complaints rather than a whole-body approach.

- **Summary**: Physical therapy and occupational therapy remain the cornerstone of treatment.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^111F7ziK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically in the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This involves postural vital signs and a referral for autonomic testing in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and refractory gastrointestinal symptoms who report orthostatic intolerance. This should be done after excluding medication side effects and attempting appropriate lifestyle or behavioral modifications. It is advised not to obtain this testing in all patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders who report gastrointestinal symptoms alone.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^111bs4T6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and more specifically, the evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a diagnostic evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with disorders of gut-brain interaction in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and comorbid postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and/or mast cell activation syndrome. A similar approach to the evaluation of disorders of gut-brain interaction as used in the general population should be followed, including the use of a positive symptom-based diagnostic strategy and limited noninvasive testing.

### Pain in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is common, severe, and associated with functional impairment [^112Ew8sr]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Musculoskeletal pain is mentioned in the diagnostic criteria and described as early in onset, chronic, and debilitating. However, systematic research on pain in EDS is scarce.

- **Objectives**: We investigated the prevalence and impact of pain and associated features in a large group of EDS patients.

- **Methods**: We performed a study among members of the Dutch EDS patient organization (n = 273) and included the McGill Pain Questionnaire to investigate various aspects of pain, the Sickness Impact Profile to study functional impairment, the Symptom Checklist subscale sleep to evaluate sleep disturbances, and the Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue to determine fatigue severity.

- **Results**: The results of this study show that: 1) chronic pain in EDS is highly prevalent and associated with regular use of analgesics; 2) pain is more prevalent and more severe in the hypermobility type than in the classic type; 3) pain severity is correlated with hypermobility, dislocations, and previous surgery; 4) pain is correlated with low nocturnal sleep quality; and 5) pain contributes to functional impairment in daily life, independent of the level of fatigue.

- **Conclusion**: From this large cohort of EDS patients, we conclude that pain is common and severe in EDS. Pain is related to hypermobility, dislocations, and previous surgery and associated with moderate to severe impairment in daily life.

### Dilated aortic root and severe aortic regurgitation causing dilated cardiomyopathy in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113pTrDS]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of heritable disorders characterized by vast clinical heterogeneity, ranging from the classic constellation of symptoms such as skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and skin fragility, to the exceedingly critical consequences of arterial rupture and visceral perforation.

We describe the case of a 65-year-old male with a history of classic EDS who reported dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, fatigue, and palpitations. He was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35%, aortic root dilation, and severe aortic valve regurgitation. The authors intend to draw attention to the rare cardiac manifestations of this condition and the therapeutic challenges involved in managing such patients.

### Atypical COL3A1 variants (glutamic acid to lysine) cause vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with a consistent phenotype of tissue fragility and skin hyperextensibility [^113tWVpM]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of rare inherited connective tissue disorders. Vascular EDS (vEDS) is caused by pathogenic variants in COL3A1, most frequently glycine substitutions. We describe the phenotype of the largest series of vEDS patients with glutamic acid to lysine substitutions (Glu > Lys) in COL3A1, which were all previously considered variants of unknown significance.

Clinical and molecular data for seven families with three different Glu > Lys substitutions in COL3A1 were analyzed. These Glu > Lys variants were reclassified from variants of unknown significance to either pathogenic or likely pathogenic in accordance with American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. All individuals with these atypical variants exhibited skin hyperextensibility as seen in individuals with classical EDS and classical-like EDS and evidence of tissue fragility as seen in individuals with vEDS.

The clinical data demonstrate the overlap between the different EDS subtypes and underline the importance of next-generation sequencing gene panel analysis. The three different Glu > Lys variants point toward a new variant type in COL3A1 causative of vEDS, which has consistent clinical features. This is important knowledge for COL3A1 variant interpretation. Further follow-up data are required to establish the severity of tissue fragility complications compared with patients with other recognized molecular causes of vEDS.

### Skin biopsy reveals generalized small fibre neuropathy in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^114JZDce]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are hereditary disorders of connective tissue characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. The most common subtype is the hypermobile type. In addition to symptoms of small fibre neuropathy (SFN) due to damage to the small peripheral nerve fibres, with degeneration of the distal nerve endings, autonomic disorders such as postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) are frequently reported features in patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS). At the time of writing, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still not completely understood.

The study aimed to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of small fibre neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes.

Methods: We prospectively investigated 31 patients with hEDS compared to 31 healthy controls by using skin biopsy, quantitative sensory testing, tilt-table testing, the painDetect, Small Fibre Neuropathy Screening List, and the COMPASS-31 (Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31) questionnaire.

Results: Nineteen (61%) patients with hEDS were diagnosed with SFN, and 10 (32%) fulfilled the criteria for PoTS. Patients with hEDS had significantly higher heart rates than controls. According to quantitative sensory testing, these patients had generalized thermal and tactile hypesthesia. Skin biopsy revealed significantly reduced intraepithelial nerve fibre density proximally (thigh) and distally (lower leg) in patients compared to controls. This was consistent with various complaints of pain and sensory issues associated with the condition.

### What are the most important symptoms to assess in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome? A questionnaire study based on the Delphi technique [^114inx1i]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

This study aims to determine from questionnaires submitted to patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobile type (hEDS) what symptoms they perceive as having the most impact on their well-being and, according to them, what symptoms should be assessed.

- **Materials and methods**: Three rounds of online questionnaires were conducted following the Delphi method. The first round allowed us to obtain the most important symptoms to assess according to the patients. The second and third rounds aimed at ranking the categories according to their order of importance. Establishment of a consensus was evaluated using Kendall's coefficient of concordance.

- **Results**: A total of 118 responses were analyzed for the first round and 87 for the second and third rounds. Ten categories were extracted from the first round. Ranking of the 10 categories in the second round did not reach consensus (W = 0.33, p < 0.001) nor did the four most important categories in the third round (W = 0.43, p < 0.001). However, three categories stand out from the ranking: "pain", "fatigue and sleep disorders", and "musculoskeletal disorders".

- **Conclusions**: These categories seem to be the most important to assess in patients with hEDS, despite the lack of consensus on this ranking. Pain, fatigue and sleep disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders should be given high consideration in the assessment of patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The high phenotypic variability in hypermobile EDS requires individualized assessment for each patient and a multidisciplinary approach.

### Self-reported demographics of 154 hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients [^115gzXCs]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Demographic data for patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) has not been well established. hEDS patients often present with a constellation of symptoms; it is important to update clinical criteria for diagnosis and provide a framework for common co-morbidities. The primary objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of co-morbidities in hEDS patients to allow clinicians to better identify patients and their most common symptoms. The goal is to use this information to augment diagnostic and clinical demographic data to more accurately represent hEDS patients.

This retrospective chart review utilized patient intake forms from 154 patients diagnosed with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a clinic. Patient intake forms included responses to questions about the presence of various previous conditions. Our study revealed numerous co-morbidities with increased prevalence that differed from the diagnostic criteria, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, mast cell activation syndrome, anxiety, depression, temporomandibular joint syndrome, headaches, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. These findings will help inform clinicians of prevalent co-morbidities among hEDS patients and encourage further evaluation for screening and diagnosis. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients presented with a wide range of co-morbidities not listed on clinical criteria. Future studies are warranted across diverse and larger patient populations and beyond self-reported data.

### Clinical and genetic aspects of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic type [^1173KNmt]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, fragile and soft skin, delayed wound healing with formation of atrophic scars, easy bruising, and generalized joint hypermobility. It comprises Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II, but it is now apparent that these form a continuum of clinical findings and differ only in phenotypic severity.

It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the α1 and the α2-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes.

In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed.

### Comprehensive assessment of nutrition and dietary influences in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-a cross-sectional study [^111mqsVS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are common in patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorder (hEDS/HSD). Food is a known trigger for DGBI symptoms, which often leads to dietary alterations and, increasingly, nutrition support. We aimed to explore dietary behaviors and influencing factors in patients with hEDS/HSD.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional study, patients with hEDS/HSD were recruited from Ehlers-Danlos Support UK (nontertiary) and tertiary neurogastroenterology clinics to complete questionnaires characterizing the following: dietary behaviors, nutrition support, DGBI (Rome IV), gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, depression, avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), mast cell activation syndrome, postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), and quality of life. We used stepwise logistic regression to ascertain which factors were associated with dietary behaviors and nutrition support.

- **Results**: Of 680 participants (95% female, median age 39 years), 62.1% altered their diet in the last year, and 62.3% regularly skipped meals. Altered diet was associated with reflux symptoms (P < 0.001), functional dyspepsia (P = 0.008), reported mast cell activation syndrome (P < 0.001), and a positive screen for ARFID, specifically fear of eating and low interest (P < 0.001). Approximately 31.7% of those who altered their diet required nutrition support. The strongest predictor of requiring nutrition support was a positive screen for ARFID, specifically fear of eating (OR: 4.97, 95% CI: 2.09–11.8, P < 0.001).

### A narrative review of the literature on illness uncertainty in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Implications for research and clinical practice [^1168dmbE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Unique facets of causes of illness uncertainty in hEDS

While hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is similar to chronic pain disorders in the frequent experience of widespread pain and diagnostic uncertainty, a nuanced review of the literature suggests different lived disease-related experiences drive this uncertainty. This is due to confusion secondary to the diagnosis of hEDS versus joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS), subtyping of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), potential misdiagnoses, and misattributions of symptoms by healthcare professionals, rather than being given a "diagnosis of exclusion" as seen in broader chronic pain populations. Moreover, due to the proposed pathophysiology underlying hEDS, individuals experience overlapping symptoms and altered interoceptive cues, such as tachycardia, tingling, lightheadedness, and nausea, due to hEDS itself and frequently encountered comorbidities like mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). These symptoms inherently promote uncertainty and confusion, and the pathophysiology of these conditions is largely unknown and criteria-based on subjective reports.

- **Diagnostic uncertainty: Cut-off confusion, hEDS versus JHS versus HSD, and misdiagnosis and misattribution of symptoms**: A diagnosis of hEDS is made via clinical criteria that include the Beighton Scale and a series of objective features and subjective complaints. Despite efforts made to ensure standardization of diagnosis, both clinical judgment and evolving diagnostic cutoffs preclude the provision of a consistent, clear diagnosis.

### Understanding the issues of hypermobility spectrum disorders and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in primary care: A qualitative integrative review [^117LJk4G]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) are characterized by joint laxity, pain, and fatigue, leading to multi-system complications and significant burden. Primary care plays a crucial role in supporting HSD/hEDS patients, and understanding the challenges in this setting is essential.

This integrative review aims to analyze the issues present in primary care for clinicians and HSD/hEDS patients. Embase, Medline, Health Management Information Consortium, Social Policy & Practice, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched in October 2024, and qualitative or mixed-method studies were included. Thematic analysis and critical appraisal were performed on eight studies.

Three themes were identified as common issues for patients and clinicians: (1) structural barriers, (2) societal barriers, and (3) consultation barriers to care. Uncoordinated services, inadequate training, and stigma were common sub-themes, and these barriers existed at multiple levels. Few published studies explored the direct experiences of patients and clinicians in primary care, and the data varied in quality.

Future qualitative studies could explore primary care physicians' knowledge and attitudes towards HSD/hEDS in this setting to inform the organization of appropriate services and education strategies. This could contribute to knowledge and bias reduction, improving patient outcomes in practice.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A systematic review [^116qrZRT]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review was designed and carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement for reporting systematic reviews.

- **Search strategy**: The aim of this study was to collect all available data on vascular complications in the nonvascular EDS subtypes described in the updated EDS classification. We queried the PubMed and Web of Science databases, considering different notations for the EDS subtypes (e.g. classic versus classical). For classical EDS (COL5A1/2), keywords such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic*, COL5A1, COL5A2, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II were used. Search strings constructed for classical EDS (COL5A1/2) included: ("Ehlers-Danlos syndrome"[Title/Abstract] AND (classic*[Title/Abstract] OR COL5A1[Title/Abstract] OR COL5A2[Title/Abstract])) OR "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I"[Title/Abstract] OR "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II"[Title/Abstract]. To exclude nonrelevant references, queries were restricted to "title" and "abstract" in PubMed and "topic" in Web of Science. The Leiden Open Variation Database was also queried for additional references. All references published from inception until 31 May 2017 were eligible for inclusion in this review.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^115GGuSq]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

The Ehlers‐Danlos syndromes (EDS), a group of uncommon connective tissue disorders, paradoxically, are an increasingly common referral to genetics specialists. Of the 13 types of EDS, the most common is hypermobile EDS (hEDS), which lacks a known genetic etiology and for which diagnosis is achieved via a robust set of clinical criteria. While previous investigations have characterized many clinical aspects of EDS as a syndrome and patients' lived experiences, a gap in the literature exists regarding clinicians' experience caring for these individuals.

This study sought to understand the effects of hEDS patient referrals from genetic counselors' perspectives. To capture these novel views and values, we conducted semi‐structured interviews with 15 participants who were members of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) and had experience working with the hEDS patient population. Interview questions explored the frequency of hEDS referrals in their clinic, investigated their roles and responsibilities as genetic counselors when working with this population, analyzed their workflow for this indication, assessed the impacts on their professional satisfaction, and explored potential options for improving workflow and care for the hEDS patient population.

Reflexive thematic analysis yielded four themes:

- **Increase in referrals**: Referrals for hEDS have generally increased over time, and many institutions have implemented new policies to control this influx.
- **Roles and responsibilities**: Genetic counselors' primary roles include education and addressing psychosocial matters for this population.

### A narrative review of the literature on illness uncertainty in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Implications for research and clinical practice [^117B6u1v]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Themes were determined using the data charting method outlined by Arksey and O'Malley, wherein data is synthesized and interpreted by sorting material according to key issues and themes. They encourage a narrative review utilizing a descriptive-analytical approach, characterized by applying a common analytic framework to all works reviewed to allow for the collection of standardized information in each study.

To this end, data was collected from each reviewed manuscript on the broad domains of (1) sources or causes of illness uncertainty (IU) and (2) adverse impacts of IU. As pervasive themes within these broader domains became apparent, they were categorized further within these domains, and findings within said themes were summarized across studies. Based on these findings, the relevance for clinical intervention and further research are discussed.

### Two patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII with unexpected hoarseness [^114BWTWf]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) encompasses a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. It is a rare condition, and inheritance is either autosomal dominant or recessive. Previously grouped into 11 different subtypes, with increasing knowledge of the underlying molecular defects, it was reclassified in 1997 into six major groups, with type VIII excluded from this classification. Type VIII EDS is a very rare subtype characterized by severe, early-onset periodontitis, skin fragility, and abnormal scarring. Voice abnormalities have occasionally been described in other forms of the condition and may be due to defects in the collagen of the vocal ligament. We report two cases of patients with EDS type VIII and hoarseness.

### Clinical and molecular features of 66 patients with musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in(mcEDS-) [^116PcatZ]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility. Musculocontractural EDS (mcEDS) is a rare type of EDS caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants either in the gene for carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14 (CHST14)/dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST1) (CHST14, mcEDS-CHST14) (MIM#601776) or in the gene for dermatan sulfate epimerase (DSE) (DSE, mcEDS-DSE) (MIM#615539). D4ST1 and DSE are critical enzymes for the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (DS), which is covalently attached to a specific serine residue of the core protein to form glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains for proteoglycan in the Golgi apparatus.

DSE catalyzes the epimerization of the C-5 position of glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues in a chondroitin precursor backbone, resulting in the formation of the dermatan backbone. Subsequently, D4ST1 transfers a sulfate group from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate to the C-4 hydroxy group of N-acetylgalactosamine adjacent to iduronic acid (IdoA) in the dermatan backbone, resulting in the formation of mature DS.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically concerning indications for screening, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend inquiring about joint hypermobility in patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction. They suggest considering the use of the Beighton score as a screening tool. If the screen is positive, the 2017 diagnostic criteria should be used to diagnose hypermobile EDS.

### Patients with Ehlers Danlos syndrome and CRPS: a possible association [^1164fuJC]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

Rare patients are left with chronic pain, vasodysregulation, and other symptoms that define complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) after limb traumas. The predisposing factors are unknown. Genetic factors undoubtedly contribute, but have not yet been identified. We report four CRPS patients also diagnosed with the classical or hypermobility forms of Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS), inherited disorders of connective tissue. These patients had been diagnosed using standard diagnostic criteria for CRPS and for EDS. All had sustained joint injury; in three, this had been surgically treated. The association of these two diagnoses leads us to hypothesize that EDS might contribute to the development of CRPS in one or more of the following ways: via stretch injury to nerves traversing hypermobile joints, increased fragility of nerve connective tissue, or nerve trauma from more frequent surgery. We review the clinical presentation of the different Ehlers Danlos syndromes and provide clinical criteria that can be used to screen CRPS patients for EDS for clinical or research purposes.

### Two case presentations of profound labial edema as a presenting symptom of hypermobility-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^1178J5BQ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hypermobility-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), an often-missed diagnosis with the potential for serious sequelae, may have a variety of uncommon presentations, some of which may be gynecologic.

- **Aim**: The aim of this case report is to present two cases of profound labial edema associated with intercourse as a presenting symptom of hypermobility-type EDS.

- **Methods**: A 25-year-old female presented with severe labia minora swelling and bladder pressure associated with intercourse, in addition to persistent genital arousal. History revealed easy bruising, joint pain, and family history of aneurysm. A 22-year-old female presented with intermittent profound labial swelling for 6 years, associated with sensitivity and pain with intercourse. The patient has a history of joint pain and easy bruising, as well as a sister with joint hypermobility and unexplained lymphedema. The presenting symptom of profound labial edema led to the diagnosis of hypermobility-type EDS.

- **Results**: Patients with hypermobility syndrome exhibit an increased ratio of type III collagen to type I collagen, causing tissue laxity and venous insufficiency. Abnormal collagen may lead to gynecologic manifestations, including unexplained profound labial edema, pelvic organ prolapse in the absence of risk factors, and possibly persistent genital arousal.

- **Conclusions**: This case report highlights the need for further research to determine the incidence of labial edema in hypermobility-type EDS and to further elucidate a potential correlation between profound labial edema and collagen disorders.

### Bi-allelic AEBP1 mutations in two patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^111dcyYa]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a clinically and molecularly diverse group of heritable connective tissue disorders caused by defects in a wide range of genes. Recently, bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in the adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1 (AEBP1) gene were reported in three families with an autosomal recessive EDS-like condition characterized by thin and hyperextensible skin, poor wound healing with prominent atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility, and osteoporosis.

Using whole exome sequencing, we identified novel bi-allelic AEBP1 variants in two unrelated adult patients previously diagnosed with an undefined EDS type, which shows important clinical resemblance to several other EDS subtypes. Our patients present with similar cutaneous and musculoskeletal features as the previously reported patients. They also show unreported clinical features, including pectus deformity, premature aged appearance, sparse and frizzled hair, fatigue, and pain. AEBP1 is ubiquitously expressed and encodes the secreted aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP), which can bind fibrillar collagens and assist in collagen polymerization.

Transmission electron microscopy studies on the patients' skin biopsies show ultrastructural alterations in collagen fibril diameter and appearance, underscoring an important role for ACLP in collagen fibril organization. This report further expands the clinical, molecular, and ultrastructural spectrum associated with AEBP1 defects and highlights the complex and variable phenotype associated with this new EDS variant.

### Proceedings of the 31st European paediatric rheumatology congress: Part 2 [^113d7dxf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder that affects collagen metabolism, leading to skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility. Patients can also have complications involving the cardiovascular system, such as aneurysms and mitral valve prolapse; the gastrointestinal system, including hernias and gastrointestinal diverticulosis; and ocular defects. Proper history and examination are crucial for early recognition of the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, as these patients may present with only delayed wound healing and abnormal scarring.

### Obstetric and gynecologic challenges in women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^116s2NSJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine how often women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome experience obstetric and gynecologic issues, both compared with the general population and within the three most common subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Methods involved an anonymous, prospective, online questionnaire in English posted to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation website.

Results showed that of the 1,769 respondents who completed the survey, 1,225 reported a typed diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Further stratification to the three most common types and reproductive-aged women (n = 775) allowed conclusions to be made about differences in rates of obstetric complications and gynecologic dysfunction compared with the general population and between types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Rates of obstetric outcomes for women who reported at least one pregnancy included term pregnancy in 69.7%, preterm birth in 25.2%, spontaneous abortion in 57.2%, and ectopic pregnancy in 5.1%. Infertility was reported by 44.1% of survey respondents. Normal menstrual cycles were reported by only 32.8%, with intermenstrual bleeding occurring in 18.6%. Heavy menstrual bleeding was reported by 32.9% of survey participants. Gynecologic pain reported included dysmenorrhea by 92.5% and dyspareunia by 77.0%.

The conclusion indicates a much greater prevalence of obstetric and gynecologic issues reported by women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome than in the general population. Rates differed significantly among the three most common types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, with the vascular type showing the highest rates of adverse outcomes.

### Healthcare experiences among adults with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorder in the United States [^111ZuZDf]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

This cross-sectional mixed-method study examined healthcare experiences among individuals in the US with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), which are genetic connective tissue disorders. We hypothesized that many individuals with these conditions would report low satisfaction with healthcare and low health-related quality of life. Furthermore, we anticipated that lower healthcare satisfaction would be related to lower health-related quality of life and self-efficacy for symptom management.

Adults living in the US with hEDS or HSD (N = 2125) participated in an online survey assessing satisfaction with healthcare, health-related quality of life, and symptom management self-efficacy. Qualitative data were also gathered on desired changes to improve healthcare.

Participants reported low satisfaction with healthcare as well as lower health-related quality of life and symptom management self-efficacy than norm groups. Lower satisfaction with healthcare was associated with lower health-related quality of life and lower symptom management self-efficacy (p < .001). The most common desired change to improve healthcare was more knowledge about hEDS and HSD among healthcare professionals.

U.S. adults with joint hypermobility report negative healthcare experiences and poor health-related quality of life. Future research should explore ways to improve the healthcare experiences and quality of care for individuals with hEDS and HSD.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^111AH2qg]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

One participant reflected that even if there is not a known etiology for their patient's condition, they still find a way to "give them a place to feel heard" (participant 14). Others described the importance of providing a space for their patients to tell their stories by listening to and validating their experiences. One participant stated that patients often "feel like they're kind of ignored by the general medical system" (participant 11), so another way to provide support to these patients is through validation.

I want to tell you that I believe you. I see you, and I know this is real. I think that is really key in all of the genetic counseling sessions people just want validation that their pain is real and that it affects all these parts of their life.

Given their extensive medical history and genetic counseling's role in emphasizing psychosocial support, appointments for this patient population tend to be long. Many genetic counselors reported that they have to block off extra time in their schedule for these appointments. To keep their day on track, several participants emphasized the importance of redirecting the conversation while remaining empathic to their patients' stories. One participant detailed her time‐saving approach since "there are so many records that it is hard to try to prioritize them" (participant 14), so she would ask the patient the specific information from their medical records they would like her to review. Another participant discussed that she "feels confident in saying, 'I'm going to interrupt you because I hear what you are saying.

### Severe conjunctivochalasis in association with classic type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^116gQxfg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility, and generalized tissue fragility. The classification includes six subtypes based on clinical, biochemical, and molecular characteristics. However, examples of unclassified variants and 'overlap phenotypes' are becoming more common. Kyphoscoliosis type (formerly type VI) and vascular type (formerly type IV) are associated with ophthalmic disease, though less commonly with the latter. Known ophthalmic complications include ocular fragility with increased vulnerability to trauma, high myopia, retinal detachment, and keratoconus. Additionally, epicanthic folds, microcornea, blue sclera, ectopia lentis, and angioid streaks have also been associated, though less commonly.

Conjunctivochalasis can cause a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from dry eye to disturbance of tear outflow and exposure problems at the severe stage. It is frequently seen in the older age group as an elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva lying along the lateral or central lower lid margin. It is often considered to be a senile degeneration with no reported systemic associations. Studies of the clinical and histopathological characteristics of conjunctivochalasis have suggested the aetiology to lie in a variety of local effects, such as persistent trauma related to blinking, ultraviolet radiation, or tear stasis. Possible systemic causes were not described.

We present a case of severe conjunctivochalasis in a middle-aged patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically concerning gastrointestinal symptom management, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering special diets. These include a gastroparesis diet (small particle diet) and various elimination diets — such as low fermentable carbohydrates, gluten-free, dairy-free, and low-histamine diets — to improve gastrointestinal symptoms. Dietary interventions should be delivered with appropriate nutritional counseling or guidance to avoid the pitfalls of restrictive eating.

### A narrative review of the literature on illness uncertainty in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Implications for research and clinical practice [^117QVnHv]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

While no genes have been identified as causing hEDS, the impact of the disorder is lifelong. Initial presentation of symptoms typically occurs in childhood to early adolescence. On average, one study indicated that patients wait 22 years between the initial presentation of symptoms and receiving an appropriate diagnosis. Therefore, education in the management of the condition must be rendered to both pediatric and adult providers, and consideration of the lifespan implications of the disorder is crucial.

Early efforts to promote patient education are also important. Although hEDS is vastly more prevalent than other, more rare and medically grave EDS subtypes, anecdotally, patients report engagement with online resources and other media outlets that warn of potential dire and life-threatening symptoms. The fact that the diagnosis of hEDS is primarily made based on physical exam and self-report of symptoms (e.g. joint hypermobility, subluxation, pain) may be unsatisfying to families who feel the need for a more comprehensive diagnostic work-up to identify or rule out other, more concerning EDS subtypes.

In fact, in a review of qualitative studies assessing diagnostic delays in adults with hEDS, a lack of confirmatory tests was cited as a key perceived barrier by patients to receiving an appropriate diagnosis. Additional cited diagnostic barriers included the range of symptoms experienced and provider attitudes (i.e. attributing symptoms to mental illness), suggesting that while hEDS is generally considered a less severe form of EDS, patients may not be easily reassured.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^113y23Lo]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

Previous research has highlighted the challenges that patients with EDS encounter when seeking diagnosis and treatment, often resulting in negative experiences with healthcare providers and the healthcare system. Such experiences have led to clinician-associated traumatization and poorer health outcomes for patients with this condition (Halverson et al.). Patients with EDS who do come to the clinic despite these encounters expect genetic counselors to provide them with education about their condition, address their psychosocial needs, and create positive experiences for them (Ahimaz et al.).

However, the genetic counselors in our study reported that many patients have a misconception that a genetic test can offer them an official diagnosis of hEDS, or that genetics specialists are responsible for managing their symptoms. These misconceptions result in unmet physical and psychosocial needs for the patient (Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al.). These misunderstandings often lead to a large amount of time being spent by genetic counselors to correct these misconceptions and address patients' inflated expectations.

Additionally, our participants highlighted their need to use their psychosocial skills more frequently with this patient population compared to others. Ultimately, due to the complexity of this condition, patients with hEDS require more time and effort from genetic counselors to provide the care they deserve. As a result, many participants reported feelings of burnout and discouragement because they believed that they had failed to address the needs of these patients fully.

### Implications of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a patient with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome [^116pemEv]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders characterized by defective collagen production. Patients with EDS have lax and fragile connective tissue in their joints, skin, blood vessels, and hollow organs, leading to complications such as joint hypermobility, aneurysms, organ prolapse, and musculoskeletal chronic pain. Given that patients with vaginal agenesis, which occurs with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, often require vaginal dilation as part of their treatment, tissue elasticity and fragility are essential considerations. This case report aims to describe the intersection of MRKH and EDS and their impact on vaginal dilation.

- **Case**: A 16-year-old girl with joint hypermobility and type III EDS presented with primary amenorrhea and a karyotype of 46 XX. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an absent uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. Physical examination showed Tanner V breasts and Tanner IV pubic hair, and an external genital examination revealed a blind-ending, 1-cm vaginal dimple. The patient was diagnosed with MRKH. Following her diagnosis, she received vaginal dilation instruction and returned for follow-up two months later, having quickly progressed to the largest vaginal dilator without symptoms of bleeding, pain, or dysuria. In that timeframe, her vaginal dimple had increased from 1 cm to 7–8 cm in depth, a rate much faster than is typically seen. Because of this rapid progress, a urogenital examination was performed, with no evidence of urethral abnormality, perforation, or vaginal complications.

### Arterial complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a case series [^111FZF1P]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders with several recognized types. Patients with a type of EDS have connective tissue abnormalities resulting in varying degrees of joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility, and generalized tissue friability. Classical EDS (cEDS) typically occurs as a result of dominant pathogenic variants in COL5A1 or COL5A2. The cardinal features of cEDS are hyperextensible skin, atrophic scarring, and joint hypermobility. Arterial complications are more characteristically a feature of vascular EDS, although individual cases of arterial events in cEDS have been reported.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 154 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cEDS from the UK was analyzed.

- **Results**: Seven patients (4.5%) with a diagnosis of cEDS (four pathogenic, one likely pathogenic, and two variants of uncertain significance in COL5A1) who had experienced arterial complications were identified. Arterial complications mostly involved medium-sized vessels and included two abdominal aortic aneurysms. No unique clinical features were identified in this group of patients.

- **Conclusion**: There is a possible increased risk of arterial complications in patients with cEDS, although not well-defined. Clinicians need to be aware of this possibility when presented with a patient with an arterial complication and features of cEDS. Long-term management in families with cEDS and a vascular complication should be individually tailored to the patient's history and their family's history of vascular events.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^1123WDwE]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). High credibility.

Much of the existing medical literature on EDS focuses on characterizing and differentiating the 13 enumerated types. To a lesser extent, the psychosocial impacts of the patient's experience living with EDS have also been documented (Bennett et al.). In particular, some studies have explored the burden of chronic pain that patients with complex disorders endure (Edwards et al.). At the time of writing, however, no studies have explored how caring for the EDS patient population affects the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors. As part of the first author's research project for a degree in genetic counseling, a thorough literature review was conducted using the PubMed database.

The purpose of this research was to address these identified gaps in the literature through the following aims:

- **Investigate genetic counselors' perceived responsibilities**: Investigate genetic counselors' own perceived responsibilities for the clinical care of these patients.
- **Analyze factors influencing involvement in patient management**: Analyze factors that influence their involvement in patient management in preparation for, during, and following genetic counseling appointments.
- **Assess professional satisfaction**: Assess how genetic counselors' experiences with cases of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes affect their professional satisfaction in the workplace.

To that end, we conducted qualitative interviews with genetic counselors to assess their experience with the EDS patient population, with a particular emphasis on hEDS. This study contributes to understanding the hEDS patient population from a genetic counselor's perspective — an aspect which has not yet been explored despite hEDS being a common indication for referral.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: A review of the literature [^115swbLE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Distinguishing between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobile type) and "normal spectrum hypermobility" presents a clinical challenge. There is a spectrum of generalized joint hypermobility in children, and the phenomenon is almost certainly polygenic in origin, influenced by environmental factors such as participation in sports and flexibility training. Younger children are naturally more flexible, but this typically resolves with age in normal children. Clinicians face a challenge in distinguishing young children with significant hypermobility who are unlikely to improve from those within the normal spectrum of hypermobility who are expected to improve over time. Clinical follow-up over several years is currently the only definitive way to address this question for an individual child.

The **criteria for a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobile type)** are illustrated in Table 2 but are non-specific. For a diagnosis to be made, an individual needs to meet one of the major criteria, such as a Beighton score of ≥ 4/9 or "skin involvement (hyperextensibility and/or smooth, velvety skin)". Beighton et al. describe testing skin hyperextensibility at a neutral site, such as the volar aspect of the forearm, where the skin is pulled up until resistance is felt. However, they do not describe a reproducible measurement that can be taken during this test, nor what might be considered normal or abnormal. Minor criteria, which are "of lesser diagnostic specificity", include joint dislocation, chronic joint/limb pain, and a positive family history. The presence of one or more minor criteria is "suggestive" of the diagnosis.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^111LG4nk]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

In addition to education, participants reported specific strategies and skills they used with EDS patients. Common techniques included contracting (establishing the patient's understanding and goals for the appointment), setting expectations, and redirecting the conversations with their patients. Most participants expressed that they use their psychosocial skills more with this patient population. To ensure the patient's expectations and needs are met, many participants stated they prioritize contracting with every patient they see for hEDS.

"I do a good amount of contracting at the beginning of sessions to just say, 'This is who I am, this is what I can do, this is what we typically see, I'm going to assess your risk for one of these connective tissue disorders, and if what I imagine is true, and that the risk is low, we can still do testing'", explained one participant. "I do a lot of that because I don't like disappointing people".

Another participant found contracting important because patients arrive with differing goals: "If someone just wants medical information and good referrals of the whole system, we can give them that. And if someone is just really looking for social support, I can do that" (participant 12).

Almost all participants discussed psychosocial counseling as their predominant role for hEDS patients. They provided support for their patients by listening, validating, and empathizing with their stories. Many stated that this part of their role is what differentiates them from other healthcare professionals.

### Rare vascular complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^1149pUYw]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders associated with skin, ligament, blood vessel, and organ abnormalities. Skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and widened atrophic scars are characteristic of classical EDS. Vascular complications, though rare in classical EDS, can be life-threatening, necessitating vigilance for vascular associations even in non-vascular forms of EDS due to the syndrome's heterogeneity. Reports of vascular complications in classical EDS often describe haematomas as the most frequent manifestation.

This case report discusses an elderly patient with genetically confirmed classical EDS who suffered from a series of pulmonary and vascular complications, including spontaneous haemopneumothorax, aortic dissection, and eventual mesenteric haemorrhage, which resulted in his death. Identifying clinical red flags is crucial to predict such future catastrophic vascular events and guide appropriate counseling and management strategies for individuals with classical EDS.

### Ehlers-Danlos syndrome presenting with primary nocturnal enuresis [^114p2qP7]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), hypermobility type, is probably the most common EDS type and is the most frequent heritable connective tissue disorder. Bladder dysfunction is a rare clinical manifestation of EDS and manifests as primary nocturnal enuresis. We present a 10-year-old boy referred to the pediatric nephrology consultation due to primary nocturnal enuresis and daytime symptoms of urinary urgency. During the appointment, a tendency towards joint hypermobility was noted. Upon evaluation, the skin was hyperextensible, and the Beighton score was positive. Genetic testing revealed a variant of the COL5A1 gene not yet described in the literature.

### Hippotherapy in the management of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113xz3ng]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an inherited condition marked by joint hypermobility, instability, chronic pain, and fatigue, significantly impacting quality of life and autonomy. Management focuses solely on symptom alleviation. After experiencing a rapid decline in functional abilities, a patient in late adolescence with hypermobile EDS underwent hippotherapy rehabilitation (30 hours). She saw substantial improvements in fatigue, chronic pain, and regained walking abilities. Hippotherapy played a crucial role in refining her postural balance, motor skills, proprioception, muscle function, and endurance. It also positively affected her cognitive and emotional regulation by stimulating sensory inputs that activate neural pathways, providing relief from pain and fatigue.

Notably, the patient transitioned from wheelchair reliance to walking with crutches, and then greatly enhanced both gait quality and speed. These findings demonstrate the relevance of hippotherapy for the rehabilitation of hypermobile EDS, reducing the need for pharmacological interventions and fostering a proactive approach to future challenges.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, more specifically with respect to the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for celiac disease earlier in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders who report a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, not only those with diarrhea. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing for disaccharidase deficiencies or other diet-mediated mechanisms as causes of gastrointestinal symptoms in hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders.

### Predictors of pain and mobility disability in the hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^111X5VPX]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Among the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, the hypermobile subtype (hEDS) is the most common. The variety, accumulation, and duration of the painful symptoms make hEDS a chronic and highly disabling condition. Identifying drivers of pain and mobility disability in hEDS is necessary to provide adapted prevention and intervention programs.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional sample of 75 adults with hEDS according to Villefranche criteria (67 women; 36 years, SD = 11.2) responded to self-assessment questionnaires regarding psychological (negative thoughts and emotions), health (pain, fatigue, diagnostic delay, body mass index, and mobility disability), and socio-demographic variables.

- **Results**: Forty-three percent of the participants suffer from severe pain, and two-thirds suffer from a high level of mobility disability. Multivariate analyses show that delay of diagnosis, being professionally active, and thoughts of helplessness are variables that increase the likelihood of severe pain, whereas age, fatigue, and body mass index predict mobility disability.

These results confirm previous research concerning the high disease burden observed in hEDS patients and highlight the importance of multidisciplinary management that includes nutritional and psychological advice to address this pathology. Increasing awareness of the clinical aspects of hEDS among physicians is necessary to reduce diagnostic delay and minimize negative outcomes.

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113xMwSD]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue, characterized by joint hypermobility, soft and hyperextensible skin, abnormal wound healing, and easy bruising. Fourteen different types of EDS are recognized, with the molecular cause identified for 13 types. These are caused by variants in 20 different genes, most of which encode the fibrillar collagen types I, III, and V, as well as enzymes involved in protein processing or those that modify glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. The hypermobile type of EDS has unknown molecular underpinnings. Given that connective tissue is present throughout the body, manifestations of different EDS types occur in virtually every organ system, making diagnosis and management particularly challenging. Management requires a care team responsible for monitoring major and organ-specific complications, such as arterial aneurysm and dissection, and integrating physical medicine and rehabilitation. Currently, no specific medical or genetic therapies are available for any type of EDS.

### Subjective health complaints and illness perception amongst adults with joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobility type - a cross-sectional study [^116RWLCM]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and severity of subjective health complaints and describe illness perception in a population of individuals with joint hypermobility syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobile type.

The method involved a postal survey with a questionnaire battery on demographic data, subjective health complaints inventory, and illness perception. A total of 110 individuals diagnosed with joint hypermobility syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobile type from two specialized hospitals in Norway were offered participation. Furthermore, 140 gender- and age-matched healthy controls from Statistics Norway, representing the general population, were sent the questionnaire for reference.

The results showed an overall response rate of 30.4% (n = 76), with 44.5% (n = 49) in the joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobile type group and 19.3% (n = 27) in the control group. Subjective health complaints were significantly higher in the joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobile type group than in the controls (32.06 vs. 11.08; p < 0.001). Furthermore, the brief illness perception questionnaire indicated that adults with joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobile type had a low understanding of their illness and symptoms (understanding, mean: 3.93, SD 2.88) and reported having moderate personal and treatment control over their illness.

In conclusion, adults with joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobile type reported a higher frequency and severity of subjective health complaints than the matched controls from the general adult population.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS): Association with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and orthopaedic considerations [^117GwFhy]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the most common form of dysautonomia. It is characterized by dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, manifesting as symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, with or without associated orthostatic hypotension and excessive autonomic excitation. Given the numerous musculoskeletal symptoms associated with POTS and its known link to other clinical conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, POTS poses a unique treatment challenge that orthopaedic surgeons and related healthcare providers should recognize.

- **Case description**: We describe two patients with a diagnosis of POTS and musculoskeletal manifestations. The first is a 13-year-old boy diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and experiencing worsening back pain. His musculoskeletal symptoms resolved after treatment with a Boston Overlap LSO brace and physical therapy, and his cardiovascular symptoms improved with pharmacologic treatment. The second patient is a 17-year-old girl with an L1 vertebral hemangioma and sudden-onset pain radiating to her lower extremities. Her symptoms were controlled with therapy and gabapentin.

- **Literature review**: POTS is a poorly understood and controversial clinical entity. There is a lack of awareness and knowledge about the syndrome among many medical specialists. Its complex and varied clinical presentation often results in it being mistaken for malingering, depression, or anxiety disorders. A review of the literature did not yield any previous studies addressing these issues comprehensively.

### Rare vascular complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113YTQYQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders often grouped with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes. These syndromes exhibit a range of abnormalities affecting the skin, ligaments, blood vessels, and viscera. The prevalence of EDS is approximately 1 in 5000 births, with no ethnic, racial, or geographical predisposition. The diverse genetic and molecular changes found in EDS lead to poorly described subtypes and overlapping phenotypes. Despite this diversity, skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and widened atrophic scars are the key diagnostic features in classical EDS, along with minor manifestations such as bruising or bleeding diathesis.

In contrast, vascular EDS predominantly presents with thin, translucent skin and a tendency for the rupture of hollow organs and arteries due to generalized vascular fragility, resulting in the worst prognosis among EDS subtypes. We present a case of an elderly man with genetically confirmed classical EDS, who experienced cumulative and devastating vascular complications throughout his life, ultimately resulting in his mortality.
