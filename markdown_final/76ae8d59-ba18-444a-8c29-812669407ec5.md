## Question

An 70-year-old black male patient with a history of CAD with stents, DM2, HTN, CKD3 with proteinuria was recently hospitalized after being started on an ACE inhibitor and developed ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. Prior to discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, his BP was relatively well-controlled. Now his BP has been running between 150–170/90–100 (HR 50–60 bpm) on his current regimen of 12.5mg twice a day and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily. You are the APP caring for him, and now are trying to optimize his BP regimen. Your next best approach would be to:

Group of answer choices

Increase Coreg to 25mg twice a day

Add Altace 5mg daily

Add Norvasc 10mg daily

Add Aldactone 25mg daily

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antihypertensive should be added next for a 70-year-old Black man with CAD, diabetes, CKD stage 3 with proteinuria, and a history of ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema, who is currently on carvedilol 12.5 mg twice daily and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily with blood pressures around 150–170/90–100 mmHg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk profile and blood pressure targets. Then, I should verify which drug classes are contraindicated or unsafe given the prior angioedema. Next, I will review guideline-preferred agents for resistant hypertension in this phenotype. After that, I need to check dosing, safety, and monitoring, especially for hyperkalemia and renal function. Finally, I will compare the provided options and select the best choice with a clear rationale and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical risk and targets. He is a 70-year-old Black man with CAD, diabetes, and CKD with proteinuria, placing him at very high cardiovascular risk. In such patients, contemporary guidance supports a blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, with attention to avoiding excessive diastolic lows in older adults with coronary disease, so I should aim for around 130–139/80 mmHg while monitoring tolerability [^1134RRzq] [^1144hvQX].

> Wait, let me verify the contraindications before choosing a class. He had ACE inhibitor–induced angioedema, so I must not rechallenge with an ACE inhibitor; the 2025 AHA/ACC/AANP guideline explicitly advises against using an ARB if there is a history of angioedema with an ARB, but it does allow cautious ARB use beginning about 6 weeks after ACE inhibitor discontinuation in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor angioedema, which means an ARB is not absolutely contraindicated but requires careful timing and vigilance for recurrence; I should also remember that Black patients have a higher reported incidence of ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema, reinforcing caution with RAAS blockade in this phenotype [^116GAL1X] [^113ZBEL2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the current regimen's alignment with resistant hypertension pathways. He is on a beta-blocker and a thiazide diuretic, but he lacks a renin–angiotensin system blocker, which is a core component of triple therapy for resistant hypertension; guidelines consistently recommend a three-drug regimen of a RAS blocker, a CCB, and a thiazide-type diuretic for most patients who remain above goal on two agents, with spironolactone as the preferred fourth agent if triple therapy fails, so I need to add either a RAS blocker or a CCB now to complete the backbone regimen [^113HhyUr] [^112VdpZA] [^1124e2kh].

> Let me consider the options one by one, and I will double-check safety and efficacy signals. Increasing carvedilol to 25 mg twice daily could lower heart rate and blood pressure, but beta-blockers are less effective for stroke prevention and are not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension; moreover, with a resting HR in the 50s, further beta-blockade risks bradycardia and fatigue, so up-titration is not the best next step here [^1124e2kh]. Adding ramipril (an ACE inhibitor) is unsafe given the prior angioedema and should be avoided; I initially thought "never use an ACE inhibitor again", but wait, I should be precise: the absolute contraindication is immediate rechallenge, and while some clinicians avoid the class lifelong, the provided guideline excerpt here emphasizes avoiding ARBs if there is a history of ARB angioedema and allowing ARBs after a 6-week washout following ACE inhibitor angioedema, so the explicit prohibition here is against restarting an ACE inhibitor now, not a formal lifelong ban in all contexts [^116GAL1X] [^113ZBEL2] [^113oPu1d]. Adding amlodipine 10 mg daily is attractive because dihydropyridine CCBs are guideline-endorsed for resistant hypertension, have no angioedema signal, and are particularly useful in Black patients; this would complete the triple backbone with HCTZ and carvedilol while preserving the option to add a RAS blocker later if needed and safe [^113HhyUr] [^1124e2kh]. Adding spironolactone 25 mg daily is a strong option for resistant hypertension, but guidelines position it as the preferred fourth agent after triple therapy fails; using it now would skip the standard triple backbone and could increase hyperkalemia risk in CKD, so I should reserve it unless triple therapy is inadequate or RAS blockade is not feasible [^112VdpZA] [^113HhyUr].

> I should confirm the best next step. Given the absence of a CCB and the presence of CKD with proteinuria, the most appropriate addition is a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB such as amlodipine 10 mg daily, which will complete the triple foundation and is concordant with resistant hypertension algorithms. This avoids immediate RAAS re-exposure while still allowing future consideration of an ARB after the 6-week interval if kidney protection is needed and potassium can be safely monitored [^113HhyUr] [^116GAL1X].

> Next, I should review dosing and monitoring. Starting amlodipine 10 mg daily is within the usual dose range, and I will recheck blood pressure, heart rate, edema, and adherence in 2–4 weeks. If blood pressure remains above goal, I will then consider adding an ARB cautiously after the 6-week washout window, with a low starting dose and close follow-up for recurrent angioedema, and I will monitor serum potassium and creatinine 7–14 days after any RAS blocker initiation or dose change in CKD [^116GAL1X] [^1125hA23].

> But wait, what if edema emerges on amlodipine or if blood pressure still hovers near 160/100 mmHg despite adherence? In that case, I should verify adherence and consider switching the thiazide to chlorthalidone for greater potency, and if still uncontrolled on maximally tolerated triple therapy, I would add spironolactone 25 mg daily with stringent potassium monitoring, recognizing that finerenone may be an alternative MR antagonist in T2DM with CKD and albuminuria when potassium and eGFR criteria are met [^112VdpZA] [^114rNrtF].

> Final answer: Add Norvasc (amlodipine) 10 mg daily. This aligns with resistant hypertension strategy, avoids re-exposure to ACE inhibition, and is appropriate for a high-risk Black patient with CKD and CAD, with reassessment in 2–4 weeks and consideration of ARB addition thereafter if needed and safe [^113HhyUr] [^1124e2kh].

---

The best next step is to **add a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine)** [^113HhyUr] to control blood pressure, as ACE inhibitors are contraindicated after angioedema [^113oPu1d] and beta-blockers are less effective in Black patients [^notfound]. ARBs should be avoided initially due to cross-reactivity risk [^116GAL1X], and spironolactone is reserved for resistant hypertension or if hyperkalemia risk is acceptable. Amlodipine is **safe, effective, and guideline-supported** for this patient profile [^1124e2kh].

---

## Patient profile and current regimen

- **Age**: 70 years old
- **Ethnicity**: Black
- **Medical history**: Coronary artery disease (CAD) with stents, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease stage 3 (CKD3) with proteinuria
- **Current medications**: Carvedilol (Coreg) 12.5 mg twice daily, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg daily
- **Current blood pressure**: 150–170/90–100 mmHg
- **Heart rate**: 50–60 bpm
- **Recent adverse reaction**: ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema

---

## Clinical considerations

### Contraindications and precautions

- **ACE inhibitors**: Contraindicated due to history of angioedema [^113oPu1d]; risk of recurrence is significant [^113oPu1d].
- **ARBs**: Generally avoided initially after ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema due to potential cross-reactivity, although some guidelines allow cautious use after a washout period [^116GAL1X].
- **Beta-blockers**: Carvedilol is already at a moderate dose; further increase may not significantly improve BP control and could exacerbate bradycardia [^notfound].
- **Thiazide diuretics**: HCTZ is already at a maximal effective dose; increasing dose may not yield additional benefit and could increase electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].

---

## Recommended next step: add a calcium channel blocker (CCB)

Given the patient's profile and current regimen, **adding a calcium channel blocker (CCB), specifically amlodipine (Norvasc), is the most appropriate next step** [^113HhyUr]. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine CCB that effectively lowers blood pressure, particularly in Black patients, and is not associated with angioedema [^1124e2kh].

---

## Rationale for choosing amlodipine

- **Efficacy**: Amlodipine is highly effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure, particularly in Black patients [^notfound].
- **Safety**: No association with angioedema, making it a safe alternative after ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema [^notfound].
- **Guideline support**: CCBs are recommended as first-line or add-on therapy in Black patients with hypertension, especially when ACE inhibitors are contraindicated [^115CjvEw] [^1124e2kh].
- **Comorbidity considerations**: Amlodipine is safe to use in patients with CKD and does not significantly affect renal function or potassium levels [^notfound].

---

## Alternative options and their limitations

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Rationale against use** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors | - Ramipril (Altace) | Contraindicated due to history of angioedema [^113oPu1d] |
| ARBs | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan | Potential cross-reactivity with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema; use cautiously if considered [^116GAL1X] |
| Beta-blockers | - Carvedilol (Coreg) | Already at moderate dose; further increase may cause bradycardia and limited additional BP benefit [^notfound] |
| Aldosterone antagonists | - Spironolactone (Aldactone) | Risk of hyperkalemia in CKD; reserved for resistant hypertension or specific indications [^112VdpZA] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After initiating amlodipine, **monitor blood pressure closely**, assess for peripheral edema, and adjust the dosage as needed. Regularly monitor renal function and electrolytes, particularly potassium, given the patient's CKD [^117Jg3oM].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **add amlodipine (Norvasc) 10 mg daily** to the current regimen of carvedilol and hydrochlorothiazide. This choice aligns with clinical guidelines, addresses the patient's contraindications, and provides an effective, safe, and well-tolerated option for blood pressure control [^111nZwpQ].

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Angiotensin II receptor antagonists role in arterial hypertension [^117HFnEk]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers represent a class of effective and well tolerated orally active antihypertensive drugs. Activation of AT(1) receptors leads to vasoconstriction, stimulation of the release of catecholamines and antidiuretic hormone and promote growth of vascular and cardiac muscle. AT(1) receptor blockers antagonise all those effects. Losartan was the first drug of this class marketed, shortly followed by valsartan, irbesartan, telmisartan, candesartan, eprosartan and others on current investigation. All these drugs have the common properties of blockading the AT(1) receptor thereby relaxing vascular smooth muscle, increase salt excretion, decrease cellular hypertrophy and induce antihypertensive effect without modifying heart rate or cardiac output. Most of the AT(1) receptor blockers in use controlled blood pressure during the 24 h with a once-daily dose, without evidence of producing tolerance to the antihypertensive effect and being with low incidence of side effects even at long term use. Monotherapy in mild-to-moderate hypertension controls blood pressure in 40 to 50% of these patients; when a low dose of thiazide diuretic is added, 60–70% of patients are controlled. The efficacy is similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, calcium antagonists and beta-blocking agents. AT(1) receptor blockers are specially indicated in patients with hypertension who are being treated with ACE inhibitors and developed side effects such as, cough or angioedema. The final position in the antihypertensive therapy in this special population and other clinical situations, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and renal disease, has to be determined in large prospective clinical trials, some of which are now being conducted and seem promising.

### Blood pressure guidelines-where are we now? [^115pucha]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In June 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its recommendations on the management of patients with hypertension (published in 2004), in light of "significant new data" relating to drug treatment.1,2 The update, published in collaboration with the British Hypertension Society (BHS), recommended first-line use of a calcium-channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic in patients aged over 55 years or an ACE inhibitor in those aged under 55 years, and advised that beta-blockers should no longer be used for routine initial therapy.1 Recently published data from England suggest that primary care prescribing has changed in line with this new guideline.3 However, interpretation of the evidence that underpins some of the key recommendations is open to debate, particularly as there are differences from some other major guidelines in the recommendations for first-line therapy. Here we consider the updated NICE guideline, the rationale for its treatment recommendations, and the subsequent change in clinical practice. In particular, we focus on the initial drug management of adults without conditions such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would in themselves be a key determinant of management.

### Additional side effects of ACE inhibitors… [^1159Pt8C]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: I would like to suggest two additions to the American Family Physician patient information handout on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 1 First, angioedema is a rare but potentially fatal complication of ACE inhibitor use. All persons who use ACE inhibitors should be informed of this side effect, which may occur more commonly in blacks. Second, more emphasis should be placed on exercising caution with the use of over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs may cause serious, potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia, especially in older patients who are the patients most likely to use both of these classes of drugs. It is important for physicians to educate their patients who are receiving ACE inhibitors about avoidance of over-the-counter NSAIDs.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

### ACE inhibitor… [^112iFfFz]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

ACE inhibitors inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, an important component of the renin–angiotensin system which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and hydrolyses bradykinin. Therefore, ACE inhibitors decrease the formation of angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor, and increase the level of bradykinin, a peptide vasodilator. This combination is synergistic in lowering blood pressure. As a result of inhibiting the ACE enzyme in the bradykinin system, the ACE inhibitor drugs allow for increased levels of bradykinin which would normally be degraded. Bradykinin produces prostaglandin. This mechanism can explain the two most common side effects seen with ACE Inhibitors: angioedema and cough. Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include benazepril, zofenopril, perindopril, trandolapril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril.

Medical use ACE inhibitors were initially approved for the treatment of hypertension and can be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensive medications. Later, they were found useful for other cardiovascular and kidney diseases including:

- Acute myocardial infarction
- Heart failure
- Kidney complications of diabetes mellitus by means of decreasing the blood pressure and preventing glomerular hyperfiltration injury. In treating high blood pressure, ACE inhibitors are often the first drug choice, particularly when diabetes is present, but age can lead to different choices and it is common to need more than one drug to obtain the desired improvement. There are fixed-dose combination drugs, such as ACE inhibitor and thiazide combinations. ACE inhibitors have also been used in chronic kidney failure and kidney involvement in systemic sclerosis.

In those with stable coronary artery disease, but no heart failure, benefits are similar to other usual treatments. In 2012, a meta-analysis published in the BMJ described the protective role of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of pneumonia when compared to angiotensin II receptor blocker. The authors found a decreased risk in patients with previous stroke, with heart failure, and of Asian descent. However, no reduced pneumonia-related mortality was observed. Additionally ACE-I are commonly used after renal transplant to manage post-transplant erythrocytosis, a condition characterised by a persistently high hematocrit greater than 51% which often develops 8–24 months after successful transplantation, as ACE-I have been shown to decrease erythropoietin production.

Adverse effects Common side effects include: low blood pressure, cough, hyperkalemia, headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and kidney impairment. Therefore, renal function should be closely monitored over the first few days after initiation of treatment with ACE inhibitor in patients with decreased renal perfusion. Generally, a moderate reduction in renal function is considered acceptable as part of the therapeutic effect. High blood potassium is another possible complication of treatment with an ACE inhibitor due to its effect on aldosterone. Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels. Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an ACE inhibitor. Some develop angioedema due to increased bradykinin levels.

### Hypertension in adults: initial evaluation and management [^116k5t5n]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the most common chronic condition seen by family physicians. Treatment of hypertension reduces morbidity and mortality due to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. The use of ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring improves diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of adults with hypertension should focus on identifying complications of the condition and comorbid cardiovascular risk factors. Physicians should counsel all patients with elevated blood pressure about effective lifestyle interventions, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, dietary sodium restriction, potassium enrichment, regular exercise, weight loss, and moderation of alcohol consumption. First-line antihypertensive medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Thresholds for pharmacologic intervention and blood pressure goals differ according to various guidelines. Evidence strongly supports reducing blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults with hypertension. Lowering blood pressure to less than 135/85 mm Hg may further reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Clinical judgment and shared decision-making should guide treatment of patients with mild hypertension and older adults who may be more susceptible to adverse effects of antihypertensive medications and tight blood pressure control.

### Allergic reaction related to ramipril use: a case report [^11565KHy]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely prescribed for patients with diabetes as a nephroprotector drug or to treat hypertension. Generally they are safe for clinical practice, but the relationship between these drugs and angioedema is known. The exact mechanism for ACE inhibitors-induced angioedema is not clear and it is still a matter of discussion.

Case Report

We reported a case of a 23-year-old black female with an 11 year history of type 1 diabetes, regularly monitored in the department of diabetes, in use of 0,98 UI/kg/day of human insulin, which presented an allergic reaction 24 h after ramipril use. The drug had been prescribed to treat diabetic nephropathy. There was no previous history of drug induced or alimentary allergy. The patient was instructed to discontinue the use of ramipril and oral antihistaminic drug and topical corticosteroid were prescribed. Skin biopsies were performed and confirmed the clinical hypothesis of pharmacodermy. The evaluation of ACE polymorphism identified DD genotype. Six months after the withdrawal of ramipril the patient was prescribed the angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) losartan as nephroprotector. She remained well without adverse reactions.

Conclusions

ACE inhibitors-induced angioedema is uncommon and the clinical presentation is variable with lips, tongue, oropharinge, and larynge as the most common locations. The presence of angioedema during treatment requires the immediate cessation of treatment due to the risk of possible severe complications. The case reported presented moderate symptoms, with the development of early onset edema in uncommon regions. ACE DD genotype had been associated with angioedema-ACE inhibitors induced. In patients who have experienced ACE inhibitor-related angioedema, ARB should be used cautiously used. However in the case of our patient, the prescription of losartan as nefroprotector did not result in any recurrent adverse effect.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes included hospitalization for a renal cause, end-stage renal disease, and a composite outcome of ESRD or sustained doubling of serum creatinine concentration. An AKI was defined as a 50% increase between prehospital and peak in-hospital serum creatinine concentrations. Propensity scores were used to construct a matched-pairs cohort of patients who did and did not have a prescription for an ACEI or ARB within 6 months after hospital discharge. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are effective for reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with CKD. 16, 17 We sought to evaluate whether the use of an ACEI or ARB was associated with better outcomes after hospitalization in patients with AKI. An AKI event was identified by changes between baseline and peak in-hospital serum creatinine concentration.

An AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine concentration of 50% or greater during hospitalization or of 0. 3 mg/dL within 48 hours and/or a need for dialysis during the index hospitalization. cardiac catheterization, cardiac and abdominal aortic surgery), comorbid conditions, baseline kidney function, cholesterol concentration, and statin, ACEI, ARB, and β-blocker use in the 6 months before admission and after discharge was used to estimate the probability of being treated with an ACEI or ARB.

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^115w1TWQ]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss. There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

### Quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide [^116vWiJX]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed combination is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In using quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that quinapril does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis).

Angioedema in Black Patients

Black patients receiving ACE inhibitor monotherapy have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks. It should also be noted that in controlled clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks.

### STEP to blood pressure management of elderly hypertension: evidence from Asia [^114RAK31]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary

Finding the best antihypertensive target is quite an important task. In our opinion, lower SBP is better if adverse events can be monitored, avoided, or managed. Certainly, it would be prudent to aim for a more conservative goal in elderly patients who are frail and at risk for falls, or in patients with a DBP of 60–65 mmHg and co-existing coronary artery disease or peripheral artery stenosis. Home BP monitoring is helpful to facilitate hypertension management for older patients. For the elderly hypertensive patients with comorbidities such as prior stroke, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and renal impairments, or aged over 80 years old, further trials could assess the cardiovascular benefits of intensive BP treatment.

The evidence, from the SPRINT trial, STEP trial, and the individual participant-level meta-analysis in BPLTTC, demonstrates that now is an time to act to return elevated blood pressure to its status as a continuous-variable risk factor, instead of treating it as a dichotomous disease. Blood pressure should be managed as an integrated part of a patient's risk profile.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^1124e2kh]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### RAS inhibition in hypertension [^116X79T3]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARA) are gaining increasing popularity as initial medications for the management of hypertensive patients. In the year 2002, ACE-I were the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of hypertension in USA. Although their antihypertensive efficacy as monotherapy is similar to other antihypertensive agents, they have the advantage of better tolerability, limited side effects and a favorable metabolic profile. When compared to other antihypertensive agents (diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium antagonists) in large clinical trials, ACE-I and ARA provided no additional advantages regarding improvement in cardiovascular and total mortality. With the exception of the superiority of ARA in prevention of stroke, RAS inhibitors have no advantage over other agents in prevention of other cardiovascular morbid events, namely, heart failure (though ACE-I are superior to calcium antagonists), coronary heart disease and total cardiovascular events. However, there is the possibility that these agents have other benefits beyond blood pressure lowering. At equal degrees of blood pressure reduction, RAS inhibitors prevent or delay the development of diabetes mellitus and provide better end-organ protection, kidneys, blood vessels and the heart when compared with other antihypertensive agents. The combined use of ACE-I and ARA is particularly useful in organ protection. RAS inhibitors are specifically indicated in the treatment of hypertension in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function, diabetes, proteinuria, impaired kidney function, myocardial infarction, multiple cardiovascular risk factors and possibly elderly patients. The main limitation of the ACE-I is cough and rarely angioedema. Elderly patients or those who are volume depleted or receiving large doses of diuretics or in heart failure are liable to develop hypotensive reaction and/or deterioration in kidney function.

### Revisiting the diagnosis of' resistant hypertension': what should we do nowadays' [^115T1EbA]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is one of the leading causes of death globally. Despite the widespread use of antihypertensive drugs and treatment strategies, many patients with hypertension fail to achieve target blood pressure (BP) control, a condition called resistant hypertension (RH). RH is a major clinical problem as it is associated with a high risk of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), including chronic kidney disease (CKD), and premature cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Therefore, early identification and effective management strategies have the potential to improve hypertension treatment and lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of the hypertensives population, especially RH.

Recent guidelines propose better strategies to define, detect, and manage RH (American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA), International Society of Hypertension (ISH), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)).

The 2015 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/American Society of Hypertension Scientific Statement "Treatment of Hypertension in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease" is summarized in the context of a clinical case. The Statement deals with target blood pressures, and the optimal agents for the treatment of hypertension in patients with stable angina, in acute coronary syndromes, and in patients with ischemic heart failure. In all cases, the recommended blood pressure target is < 140/90 mm Hg, but < 130/80 mm Hg may be appropriate, especially in those with a history of a previous myocardial infarction or stroke, or at high risk for developing either. These numbers may need to be revised after the publication of the SPRINT data. Appropriate management should include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and in the case of heart failure, aldosterone antagonists. Thiazide or thiazide-like (chlorthalidone) diuretics and calcium channel blockers can be used for the management of hypertension, but the evidence for improved outcomes compared with other agents in hypertension with coronary artery disease is meager. Loop diuretics should be reserved for patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure or with a glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min.

### Quinapril hcl and hydrochlorothiazide [^113V1SGj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed combination is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

In using Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that quinapril does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis).

Angioedema in Black Patients: Black patients receiving ACE inhibitor monotherapy have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks. It should also be noted that in controlled clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks.

### Late angioedema caused by ACE inhibitors underestimated… [^113oPu1d]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: Angioedema is an uncommon side effect of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with an incidence of 0. 1 to
0. 2 percent. 1 It was believed that most cases of angioedema occur within the first week of treatment with ACE inhibitors; however, recent reports 1–3 indicate that late-onset angioedema may be more prevalent than initially thought. While early-onset angioedema should not be a diagnostic problem, late-onset angioedema often goes undiagnosed because many physicians are unfamiliar with it. 1, 4 This oversight may occur because of the lack of a temporal relationship between the use of ACE inhibitors and the onset of angioedema, because this side effect can occur after many years of uneventful use. 1, 4 Consequently, many patients experience recurrent episodes before the correct diagnosis is made. 4 Blacks are at increased risk. 3, 4. Angioedema associated with the use of ACE inhibitors is not an allergic reaction.

2 The pathogenesis is probably related to the increased levels of bradykinins; however, an exclusive role of bradykinins is unlikely. 1 Less frequently, angioedema has been reported with angiotensin-receptor antagonists which lack the bradykinin-potentiating activity.
2. The clinical presentation is highly variable and unpredictable. In most cases, the symptoms are mild and regress spontaneously while the patient continues the medication, thus erroneously prompting an alternative diagnosis. 4 If the diagnosis is missed, recurrent and more severe episodes may occur with potentially serious consequences. 4 Fatal cases have also been described.
5. Angioedema associated with the use of ACE inhibitors usually presents as episodic attacks of swelling of the face, tongue, and airways, but it may also involve visceral tissues. A recent report 6 described two patients with recurrent severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

6 The patients underwent three unnecessary laparotomies before the correct diagnosis was made. The mainstay of therapy is discontinuation of the offending medication, which is usually sufficient in mild cases. More severe cases involving the tongue or causing respiratory compromise are treated with epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and steroids; however, no controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these treatments. 2 In cases of life-threatening respiratory compromise, an emergency cricothyroidotomy must be performed. 2 Subsequent therapy should be initiated with an agent of an alternative class. The prevalence of delayed angioedema will probably increase, given the growing number of patients on ACE inhibitors and longer duration of therapy. 2 Since 1995, I have seen six cases of late-onset angioedema among my clinic patients. Two of these patients were hospitalized.

All patients taking ACE inhibitors, particularly blacks, should be monitored for this potentially serious side effect. They should be informed that angioedema can occur even after many years of uneventful drug use. Patients should be advised to report mild and self-limited episodes and stop taking the ACE inhibitor immediately. On the other hand, physicians should consider the diagnosis of angioedema associated with the use of ACE inhibitors in every case of orofacial angioedema or otherwise unexplained acute or recurrent abdominal pain until it is definitely excluded by a thorough review of medications.

Figure 1.
Eighth Joint National Committee evidence‐based algorithm for the treatment of hypertension. Reproduced with permission from: James et al. ACEI indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

The second change is a target of < 140 over 90 mm Hg (instead of < 130 over 80 mm Hg) in patients with DM or chronic kidney disease. This change was based on multiple studies, including the ACtion to COntrol Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) BP trial, which demonstrated no significant benefit in the primary composite end point among patients treated to a SBP goal < 120 mm Hg compared with < 140 mm Hg, despite significant reductions in stroke. –

Patients diagnosed with hypertension should be encouraged to implement lifestyle changes including regular exercise, dietary sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol consumption, and weight loss, regardless of whether pharmacotherapy is needed. When initiating medical therapy, patients without chronic kidney disease can be started on an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker, a thiazide diuretic, or a calcium channel blocker. Alternatives for nonblack patients and those with chronic kidney disease include an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker; however, the combined use of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker should be avoided.

Most patients will require at least 2 medications to adequately control their BP. The JNC 8 committee recommends 3 strategies to help achieve BP goals: (1) maximize the dose of the initial medication, (2) add a second medication before reaching the maximal dose of the initial medication, or (3) simultaneously start 2 antihypertensive medications from different classes. Because it is important to achieve and maintain the BP goal, patients should be evaluated regularly, with adjustment and addition of medications as needed. If patients remain hypertensive despite adequate treatment with 3 medications or if there is a contraindication to treatment with any of the recommended first‐line antihypertensive agents, then medications from other classes can be used (eg, beta blocker or aldosterone antagonist) or the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist.

Because the JNC 8 recommendations do not address prehypertension, resistant hypertension, or secondary hypertension, it is reasonable to follow the prior JNC 7 guidelines or those from other international organizations.–

### The impact of sex on blood pressure [^112Uwfet]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

HTN is a major global health issue, with significant sex differences in prevalence, risk factors, and treatment responses. These should be taken into account when managing HTN.

Current guidelines do not sufficiently consider these differences, underscoring the need for a more personalized approach that accounts for sex-specific pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors. A more personalized approach, considering female-specific risk factors, physiological differences, and treatment responses, could significantly improve outcomes for female patients with HTN.

The underrepresentation of women in scientific research, whether as professional researchers or as study participants, hinders the production and application of knowledge in clinical guidelines targeting women. Hopefully, the new scientific recommendations insisting on stratifying any analysis or study inclusion by sex will provide more evidence in the future and hopefully help in applying specific treatment trajectories for women in HTN.

Screening for HTN, regardless of gender, remains one of the key strategies for improving the early management of HTN. Further research is needed to refine guidelines and develop personalized therapeutic strategies that optimize HTN care and improve patient outcomes.

### Angioedema… [^114vr4pL]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

The underlying mechanism typically involves histamine or bradykinin. The version related to histamine is due to an allergic reaction to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to bradykinin may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Treatment to protect the airway may include intubation or cricothyroidotomy. Histamine-related angioedema can be treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. In those with bradykinin-related disease a C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant may be used. Fresh frozen plasma may be used instead. In the United States the disease affects about 100, 000 people a year. Pathophysiology Bradykinin plays a critical role in all forms of hereditary angioedema.

This peptide is a potent vasodilator and increases vascular permeability, leading to rapid accumulation of fluid in the interstitium. This is most obvious in the face, where the skin has relatively little supporting connective tissue, and edema develops easily. Bradykinin is released by various cell types in response to numerous different stimuli; it is also a pain mediator. Dampening or inhibiting bradykinin has been shown to relieve HAE symptoms. Various mechanisms that interfere with bradykinin production or degradation can lead to angioedema. ACE inhibitors block ACE, the enzyme that among other actions, degrades bradykinin. In hereditary angioedema, bradykinin formation is caused by continuous activation of the complement system due to a deficiency in one of its prime inhibitors, C1-esterase, and continuous production of kallikrein, another process inhibited by C1INH.

This serine protease inhibitor normally inhibits the association of C1r and C1s with C1q to prevent the formation of the C1-complex, which
- in turn
- activates other proteins of the complement system. Additionally, it inhibits various proteins of the coagulation cascade, although effects of its deficiency on the development of hemorrhage and thrombosis appear to be limited. Angioedema can be due to antibody formation against C1INH; this is an autoimmune disorder. This acquired angioedema is associated with the development of lymphoma. Consumption of foods that are themselves vasodilators, such as alcoholic beverages or cinnamon, can increase the probability of an angioedema episode in susceptible patients. If the episode occurs at all after the consumption of these foods, its onset may be delayed overnight or by some hours, making the correlation with their consumption somewhat difficult.

In contrast, consumption of bromelain in combination with turmeric may be beneficial in reducing symptoms. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made on the clinical picture. Routine blood tests are typically performed. Mast cell tryptase levels may be elevated if the attack was due to an acute allergic reaction. When the patient has been stabilized, particular investigations may clarify the exact cause; complement levels, especially depletion of complement factors 2 and 4, may indicate deficiency of C1-inhibitor. HAE type III is a diagnosis of exclusion consisting of observed angioedema along with normal C1 levels and function. The hereditary form often goes undetected for a long time, as its symptoms resemble those of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated elevations in serum creatinine… [^115dXfiw]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Possible changes in serum creatinine levels in individuals with normal renal function with volume depletion, heart failure, or bilateral renal artery stenosis started on therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker; individuals with abnormal renal function started on therapy with an ACEI or ARB, without conditions noted in case A; and individuals with normal renal function started on therapy with an ACEI or ARB. A schematic approach to a patient with renal insufficiency started on therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

Asterisk indicates blood pressure less than 130/85 mm Hg for those with renal insufficiency or diabetes; double asterisks, if serum creatinine level increases more than 30%, reduce ACEI dose by 50% and add other BP-lowering agents; plus sign, if serum creatinine rise is greater than 30% and less than 50% within the first month of therapy, causes for hypoperfusion are eliminated, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not given, treat as if bilateral renal arterial disease is present. Another group that may require reductions in arterial pressure to less than 130/85 mm Hg to slow the rate of renal disease progression are African Americans. 3, 4 Many such patients experience a transient rise in serum creatinine levels after treatment with an ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker is started or after blood pressure is adequately reduced. A rise in the serum creatinine level consequently leads to physician reticence to stay the course with a given therapy.

This action subsequently results in failure to maintain adequate blood pressure goals. Thus, some patients are deprived of known strategies that delay progression of renal disease. Some of the main reasons for the failure to achieve adequate drug dosing relate to "emotion-based" rather than evidence-based" medicine. Physicians recall that there are increased side effects as doses increase. While this is true for older antihypertensive agents, it is not true for ACEIs or ARBs. Specifically, cough and angioedema are not dose related and not observed with use of ARBs. 15, 20 Dose-related changes in serum creatinine and potassium levels do occur with ACEIs, however, and are predictable in many cases. Last, bilateral renal artery stenosis might also be a cause of elevated serum creatinine levels following initiation of ACEI therapy. It occurs, however, with a much lower frequency and should be considered in patients with extensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or who smoke.

It should also be considered in individuals in whom rehydration has not stabilized or serum creatinine reduced toward normality within a few weeks. Factors to consider when an acute rise in serum creatinine level is observed are. decreased effective circulating volume; advanced age with and without preexisting lipid abnormalities; and baseline serum creatinine level of 124 µmol/L or greater, either alone or in association with diabetes, heart failure, or achievement of low blood pressure goal, ie, less than 125/75 mm Hg when previously elevated to levels greater than 180/110 mm Hg for long periods of time. We reviewed randomized clinical trials that focused on renal disease progression and had ACEI therapy as one of its arms.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111zbo2V]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — renin–angiotensin choice, mineralocorticoid antagonists, and SGLT inhibitors: An ARNI is the preferred renin‑angiotensin inhibitor in the absence of hypotension, electrolyte/kidney instability, or prior angioedema on an ACE inhibitor or ARB, and ARNIs (or ACE inhibitor/ARB) may be titrated similarly to beta‑blockers. Mineralocorticoid antagonists are added in as part of therapy for symptomatic chronic HFrEF already receiving beta‑blockers and an ARNI (or ACE inhibitor/ARB) without contraindications; it is not necessary to achieve target or maximally tolerated doses of other drugs before adding them, they may be combined with SGLT inhibitors, treatment with an SGLT inhibitor reduces risk for hyperkalemia and allows persistence of mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy, trial doses are sufficient for clinical efficacy, and adherence to monitoring of kidney function and potassium is required. SGLT inhibitors should be added, barring contraindications; achieving target or maximally tolerated doses of other drugs is not necessary before adding them, they are used in a fixed dose so titration is not required, they are well‑tolerated by those with lower blood pressures, loop diuretic dose may need adjustment with close monitoring of weight and symptoms, and for patients using insulin or insulin secretagogues, involving endocrinology and primary care may be helpful to minimize hypoglycemia risk.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115v8d8z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension management in older adults with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes and hypertension, we recommend that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker should be the first-line therapy, and Technical remark: If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. Therefore, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be the first-line therapy used for the treatment of hypertension in older patients with diabetes and should be included when more than one medication is needed, and these two drug classes should not be used together, especially in patients with CKD, due to increased risks of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Two drugs should be started together if the initial BP is ≥ 160/100 mm Hg. Because hypertension involves a volume component in many patients with diabetes, a thiazide diuretic is commonly recommended as the third drug unless the eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2, in which case a loop diuretic might be more appropriate. If coronary artery disease is significant, a beta-blocker may be appropriate and can be added as a fourth drug to a prior three-drug regimen; if a beta-blocker is used, carvedilol has been shown to have fewer metabolic effects than metoprolol. Notably, when BP is not controlled with three or more medications, referral to a hypertension specialist is indicated.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111TiDc3]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — office blood pressure treatment thresholds (Table 19) specify age-stratified systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) thresholds. For 18–65 years, office SBP treatment threshold (mmHg) is ≥ 140 for Hypertension, + Diabetes, + chronic kidney disease (CKD), + coronary artery disease (CAD)†, and + Stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA)†, with office DBP treatment threshold (mmHg) ≥ 90. For 65–79 years, thresholds are the same: SBP ≥ 140 across these categories and DBP ≥ 90. For ≥ 80 years, office SBP treatment threshold (mmHg) is ≥ 160 across Hypertension, + Diabetes, + CKD, + CAD, and + Stroke/TIA, with office DBP treatment threshold (mmHg) ≥ 90. The dagger denotes: †Treatment may be considered in these very high-risk patients with high–normal SBP (i.e. SBP 130–140 mmHg).
