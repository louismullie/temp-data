## Question

blood pressure goal of < 140/90

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mmHg is still appropriate and how this target compares to newer, lower recommendations in various guidelines and patient populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical role of the < 140/90 mmHg target and its evidence base. Then, I should verify how contemporary guidelines have shifted toward lower thresholds and why. Next, I will examine exceptions where a < 140/90 mmHg goal is still reasonable or preferred. After that, I should review special populations such as older adults, diabetes, CKD, and frailty. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and confirm measurement implications and safety boundaries before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the historical anchor: for decades, < 140/90 mmHg was the universal treatment target and remains a foundational benchmark in many primary care frameworks, with JNC 8 recommending SBP < 140 mmHg for adults < 60 years and DBP < 90 mmHg for adults 18–59 years, and AAFP 2022 endorsing < 140/90 mmHg to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, reflecting robust mortality benefit at this threshold [^116BWX61] [^111LQYRW] [^111qiJtZ] [^112Q6Uqo].

> Wait, let me verify the contemporary shift before I overstate anything: multiple recent guidelines have moved toward lower targets, typically < 130/80 mmHg, for most adults with hypertension, driven by trials like SPRINT and meta-analyses showing incremental reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality with more intensive BP lowering, with ESC/ESH 2018 recommending < 140/90 mmHg first and then < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, ACC/AHA 2019 recommending < 130/80 mmHg for adults with ≥ 10% ASCVD risk or diabetes/CKD, and the 2025 AHA/ACC multisociety guideline endorsing < 130/80 mmHg broadly with encouragement to target < 120 mmHg in appropriate patients [^112j6vuh] [^113oyPSN] [^113EwtCT] [^115VK1N3] [^115Fvm1j].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check where < 140/90 mmHg still fits. Several high-credibility sources explicitly retain < 140/90 mmHg as an acceptable or initial target in selected contexts: ESC/ESH 2018 uses it as the first objective before intensifying, ESH 2023 accepts < 140/80 mmHg as the primary goal in adults 65–79 years with consideration of < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, ESC 2024 suggests more lenient targets such as < 140/90 mmHg in frailty, limited lifespan, or very old age, and VA/DoD recommends < 150 mmHg SBP for patients ≥ 60 years with flexibility to individualize, while AAFP 2022 still endorses < 140/90 mmHg as standard with optional lower targets to reduce MI risk [^112j6vuh] [^111yiHyr] [^114WUXKM] [^113EG6zk] [^111qiJtZ] [^111g6o5o].

> I need to check older adults carefully because recommendations diverge: for ≥ 65 years, many European guidelines favor 130–139 mmHg SBP if tolerated, whereas some North American guidance has historically accepted < 150 mmHg or < 140 mmHg depending on risk and tolerance. Importantly, very elderly or frail patients often merit individualized, more lenient targets such as < 140/90 mmHg or even 140–150 mmHg SBP to mitigate hypotension, falls, and polypharmacy harms, with shared decision-making emphasized [^114C7Bck] [^116RZYXB] [^114WUXKM] [^113EG6zk].

> Next, I should review diabetes and CKD, where targets are typically more intensive: ACC/AHA 2019 and ADA 2025 recommend < 130/80 mmHg for diabetes and CKD given stronger event reduction, while acknowledging trade-offs. ESH 2023 aligns with < 130/80 mmHg for T2DM, and KDIGO 2024 even suggests considering SBP < 120 mmHg in non-dialysis CKD when feasible, though this requires careful monitoring for adverse effects and is not universally applicable to all CKD patients [^113oyPSN] [^112yZ4af] [^114tfBLF] [^114DsSSs].

> But wait, what about safety floors and measurement nuances? I should confirm those before recommending intensification. Multiple guidelines caution against targeting SBP < 120 mmHg routinely due to increased adverse events, particularly in older or multimorbid patients, and emphasize that SPRINT's " < 120 mmHg" was measured with automated unattended office BP, which corresponds to roughly 130–139 mmHg on conventional measurements; thus, if pursuing lower targets, I need to ensure accurate, repeated measurements and vigilance for hypotension, syncope, electrolyte disturbances, and renal injury [^114FFvZw] [^1173Daym] [^113uiL6k] [^115hfUxF].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and make sure it aligns with the evidence. First, achieve at least < 140/90 mmHg for all adults with hypertension as a foundational target because it reliably reduces mortality and major cardiovascular events. Second, assess risk, comorbidities, age, frailty, and patient preferences; if treatment is well tolerated and the patient is at increased cardiovascular risk, consider intensifying to < 130/80 mmHg, and in selected high-risk, non-frail patients, discuss pursuing < 120 mmHg with close monitoring. Third, in older adults, especially ≥ 80 years or those with frailty or limited life expectancy, prioritize tolerability and consider more lenient targets such as 130–139 mmHg or even < 140/90 mmHg to balance benefits and harms. Finally, tailor for diabetes and CKD toward < 130/80 mmHg when safe, and use shared decision-making to weigh pill burden, monitoring, and adverse event risk [^111qiJtZ] [^112j6vuh] [^115VK1N3] [^114WUXKM] [^112yZ4af].

> I should double-check the bottom line so I don't overgeneralize. Yes, < 140/90 mmHg remains an appropriate and evidence-based goal for many patients, particularly as an initial target or when lower targets are not tolerated or are inappropriate due to age, frailty, or comorbidity. However, contemporary guidelines increasingly support < 130/80 mmHg for most adults when feasible, with further intensification considered case-by-case, so the clinician's task is to individualize within guideline frameworks and reassess continuously for tolerability and net clinical benefit [^111qiJtZ] [^112Q6Uqo] [^113oyPSN] [^115VK1N3].

A blood pressure goal of < 140/90 mmHg is the **minimum target for all adults with hypertension** [^112j6vuh] [^111qiJtZ], balancing cardiovascular risk reduction with tolerability [^111g6o5o]. For most patients who can tolerate it, **lower targets (< 130/80 mmHg)** are recommended to further reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^113oyPSN] [^113EwtCT], especially in high-risk groups such as those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or elevated cardiovascular risk [^113oyPSN]. In older adults (≥ 65 years), individualized targets are advised: aim for 130–139 mmHg if tolerated, but avoid SBP < 120 mmHg due to harm risk [^114FFvZw] [^112j6vuh]. Always tailor targets to patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and tolerance, and use shared decision-making [^114WUXKM].

## Historical context and evolution of blood pressure targets

Historically, **JNC 8 (2014)** recommended < 140/90 mmHg for most adults, including those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^112inVHR] [^1118rZC5]. In contrast, **ESC/ESH 2018** advised achieving < 140/90 mmHg in all patients, then targeting < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^112j6vuh] [^113Xz66w]. The **ACC/AHA 2019** guideline recommended < 130/80 mmHg for adults with hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk, including those with diabetes or CKD [^113oyPSN] [^113EwtCT].

---

## Evidence supporting the < 140/90 mmHg target

Multiple large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that achieving **< 140/90 mmHg** significantly reduces cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality [^114HyeaP] [^111qiJtZ]. The **SPRINT trial** showed that targeting < 120 mmHg reduced cardiovascular events and mortality compared with < 140 mmHg in high-risk patients, though with more adverse events [^116y9jy9]. Meta-analyses consistently show that lowering BP to < 140/90 mmHg yields substantial cardiovascular risk reduction across diverse populations [^112j6vuh] [^114HyeaP].

---

## Benefits of achieving < 140/90 mmHg

Benefits include **cardiovascular risk reduction** — lower rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death [^1173Daym] [^112Q6Uqo] — and **mortality reduction**, with improved all-cause mortality compared with higher BP targets [^112Q6Uqo].

---

## Risks and limitations of < 140/90 mmHg target

- **Residual risk**: Patients at < 140/90 mmHg still have residual cardiovascular risk, particularly at higher risk profiles [^115hfUxF].
- **Adverse effects**: Lower targets may increase risks of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte disturbances, and renal impairment, especially in older adults [^111g6o5o].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Frailty, comorbidities, and limited life expectancy may necessitate more lenient targets [^114WUXKM].

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

| **Guideline** | **Recommended target** | **Special considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| ESC/ESH 2018 | < 140/90 mmHg initially, then < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated | Age-specific targets for older adults [^112j6vuh] [^111xtZ1o] |
| ACC/AHA 2019 | < 130/80 mmHg for high-risk patients | Diabetes, CKD, elevated cardiovascular risk [^113oyPSN] [^113EwtCT] |
| AAFP 2022 | < 140/90 mmHg standard target | Consider < 135/85 mmHg to reduce MI risk [^11649az8] [^111g6o5o] |
| ESH 2023 | < 130/80 mmHg for most adults | Individualized targets for elderly and frail patients [^115c7RU1] [^111yiHyr] |

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

- **General population**: < 140/90 mmHg is the minimum target; consider < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^112j6vuh] [^111qiJtZ].
- **Diabetes and CKD**: < 130/80 mmHg recommended to reduce cardiovascular and renal events [^113oyPSN] [^113EwtCT].
- **Elderly patients**: Individualized targets; aim for 130–139 mmHg if tolerated, avoid < 120 mmHg [^112j6vuh] [^114FFvZw].
- **Frail or limited life expectancy**: More lenient targets may be appropriate [^114WUXKM].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with < 140/90 mmHg

Outcomes include **cardiovascular events** — reduced myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure — and **mortality**, with improved all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with higher targets [^111g6o5o] [^111qiJtZ].

---

## Individualized patient care and shared decision-making

Individualized care requires **tailoring targets** to age, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences [^114WUXKM], and **shared decision-making** should engage patients in discussions about benefits, risks, and tolerability of lower targets [^111g6o5o].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **< 140/90 mmHg remains the minimum target** for all adults with hypertension, effectively reducing cardiovascular risk and mortality [^112j6vuh] [^111qiJtZ].
- **Lower targets (< 130/80 mmHg)** are recommended for most patients who can tolerate them, especially those at high cardiovascular risk [^113oyPSN] [^113EwtCT].
- **Individualized targets** are essential for older adults, frail patients, or those with limited life expectancy [^114WUXKM].
- **Shared decision-making** is crucial to balance benefits and risks, ensuring patient-centered care [^111g6o5o].

---

A blood pressure goal of < 140/90 mmHg is a **foundational target** that balances efficacy and safety; lower targets are encouraged when appropriate, with care individualized to patient characteristics and preferences.

Benefits of treating higher versus lower BP targets in older adults indicate that across all trials treating high BP in older adults was beneficial, but most evidence came from patients with moderate or severe hypertension (SBP > 160 mm Hg) at baseline who with treatment achieved SBP targets greater than 140 mm Hg; among those with baseline SBP of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP less than 150 mm Hg, moderate-quality evidence showed a reduction in all-cause mortality, although not quite statistically significant (relative risk [RR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 1.13), with high-quality evidence showing reductions in stroke (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.64 to 0.91]; ARR, 0.92) and cardiac events (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.96]; ARR, 0.72); in studies with lower SBP targets (< 140 mm Hg), low-quality evidence showed no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to 1.14]; ARR, 0.21), cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.08]; ARR, 0.35), or stroke (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.64 to 1.01]; ARR, 0.19) compared with higher BP targets, noting many studies did not achieve the targeted BP and had little difference between intensive treatment and control groups.

Older patients with hypertension (defined as aged ≥ 65 years) — trial evidence and treatment target recommendations are as follows: The SPRINT trial included a high proportion of patients over the age of 75 years (n = 2636) and with more intensive BP-lowering treatment (mean achieved BP = 124/62 mmHg) significantly reduced major CV events, heart failure, and all-cause death (all by > 30%) compared with standard treatment targeting SBP to < 140 mmHg; because automated office BP measurement was used, the SBP of 124 mmHg most probably reflects a conventional office SBP range of 130–139 mmHg. The HYVET trial suggested benefit when treating to an SBP target of < 150 mmHg (achieving a mean SBP of 144 mmHg) in the very old (> 80 years). Based on these data, we recommend that in older patients treated for hypertension, BP should be lowered to < 140/90 mmHg, but not below an SBP of 130 mmHg, and the impact of BP-lowering on the well-being of the patient should be closely monitored.

Hypertension targets and outcomes in adults aged 60 years or older — evidence revisions report that among patients with a baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP of less than 150 mm Hg, all-cause mortality reduction did not quite reach statistical significance (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]; ARR, 1.13), while high-quality evidence showed reductions in stroke (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.64 to 0.91]; ARR, 0.92) and cardiac events (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.96]; ARR, 0.72). In studies with lower SBP targets (< 140 mm Hg), low-quality evidence showed no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to 1.14]; ARR, 0.21), cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.04]; ARR, 0.35), or stroke (RR, 0.88 [CI, 0.64 to 1.01]; ARR, 0.19) compared with higher BP targets, and many studies did not achieve the targeted BP with little difference between intensive treatment and control groups. In the figure, the benefits statements read that "Incidence of stroke and cardiac events were reduced with treatment to < 150 mm Hg" and "Treating to 140 mm Hg did not have additional benefit".

Adults with high blood pressure or hypertension — adapted recommendations specify that in adults with elevated blood pressure (BP) or hypertension, including those requiring antihypertensive medications, nonpharmacological interventions are recommended to reduce BP, including weight loss, a heart-healthy dietary pattern, sodium reduction, dietary potassium supplementation, increased physical activity with a structured exercise program, and limited alcohol. In adults with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 10% or higher and an average systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mm Hg or higher or an average diastolic BP (DBP) of 80 mm Hg or higher, use of BP-lowering medications is recommended for primary prevention of CVD. In adults with confirmed hypertension and a 10-year ASCVD event risk of 10% or higher, a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. In adults with hypertension and chronic kidney disease, treatment to a BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at a BP of 130/80 mm Hg or higher, with a treatment goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. In adults with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk < 10% and an SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher or a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher, initiation and use of BP-lowering medication are recommended. In adults with confirmed hypertension without additional markers of increased ASCVD risk, a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg may be reasonable.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114FFvZw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — blood pressure targets: In patients (≥ 65 years), SBP should be targeted to between 130 and 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) to < 80 mmHg, and treated SBP should not be targeted to < 120 mmHg. The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

Higher versus lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) targets — subgroup effects: High-quality evidence showed a similar risk reduction for mortality and cardiac events when comparing trials with target ≥ 140 mm Hg versus < 140 mm Hg, with mortality (RR for target ≥ 140 mm Hg, 0.91 [CI, 0.84 to 0.99] vs. RR for target < 140 mm Hg, 0.84 [CI, 0.74 to 0.95]) and cardiac events (RR for target ≥ 140 mm Hg, 0.78 [CI, 0.68 to 0.93] vs. RR for target < 140 mm Hg, 0.83 [CI, 0.70 to 0.94]). The relative reduction in stroke events was slightly larger for studies that achieved a target SBP of 140 mm Hg or greater (RR, 0.72 [CI, 0.62 to 0.82]) than those that achieved a target SBP of less than 140 mm Hg (RR, 0.81 [CI, 0.66 to 0.96]).

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension… [^111oTBnk]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Blood pressure targets of 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic offer similar reduction in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality as lower targets and have fewer adverse effects.
- Lower blood pressure targets lead to a reduction in myocardial infarction, with a number needed to treat of 137 over 3. 7 years.
- After achieving initial blood pressure control, shared decision-making can be used to determine whether lower blood pressure targets should be considered. From the AFP Editors Nearly one-third of people in the United States are affected by hypertension, which is a leading cause of premature death. The aim of hypertension treatment is to reduce mortality and morbidity while minimizing harms from medical interventions. Numerous guidelines recommend different blood pressure targets, obscuring the risk-benefit ratio.

The American Academy of Family Physicians updated a recent systematic review with a literature review of subsequent studies to recommend blood pressure targets for primary care management of hypertension. Primarily Focus on 140/90 mm Hg Using a blood pressure target of 140/90 mm Hg reduces cardiovascular and all-cause mortality as much as lower targets. Studies in the lower blood pressure target group included target systolic pressures between 120 and 130 mm Hg and diastolic pressures between 65 and 80 mm Hg. Consider Lower Targets to Reduce Myocardial Infarction Although lower blood pressure targets do not improve mortality, they do appear to reduce cardiovascular events. Specifically, targets of 130/80 mm Hg or lower reduce myocardial infarction with a number needed to treat of 137 over 3. 7 years. Similar reduction in myocardial infarction was noted in the subsequent trial, although early discontinuation may exaggerate the benefit.

The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the U. S. Navy, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, U. S. Department of Defense, or the U. S. government. Editor's Note: These recommendations by the AAFP provide some nuance to the decision of blood pressure targets in hypertension. Based on mortality, the standard target of 140/90 mm Hg is equivalent to lower targets, making this our primary goal. Because lower targets lead to reduced myocardial infarction despite increases in adverse events, this may be a beneficial trade for some patients. This guideline provides a stepped framework for patient treatment and clarifies the risks and benefits of different targets. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

Hypertension blood pressure targets — trial evidence contrasts SPRINT and ACCORD. In SPRINT, "targeting SBP to less than 120 mm Hg compared with less than 140 mm Hg in adults without diabetes or prior stroke, at high-risk for cardiovascular disease, and with a baseline SBP of less than 140 mm Hg significantly reduced fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality", and increased-risk criteria included "an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²", "10-year risk for cardiovascular disease of 15% or greater", and "age 75 years or older". In contrast, ACCORD "included only adults with type 2 diabetes" and found "no statistically significant reduction in the primary composite outcome… (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.80 to 1.11])", did find a "reduction in stroke events (RR, 0.58 [CI, 0.39 to 0.88])", and reported "more serious adverse events associated with an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg versus less than 140 mm Hg".

The evidence supports the recommendation that older patients (> 65 years, including patients over 80 years) should be offered BP-lowering treatment if their SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg, and there is also justification to now recommend BP-lowering treatment for old patients (aged ≥ 65 but not > 80 years) at a lower BP (i.e.g.rade 1 hypertension: SBP = 140–159 mmHg). BP-lowering drugs should not be withdrawn on the basis of age alone, and in patients aged > 80 years, CV risk reduction was greatest in those who continued treatment rather than in those whose treatment was discontinued; as stated, these recommendations relate to relatively fit and independent older patients.

### AAFP issues new clinical practice guideline on hypertension… [^111g6o5o]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on its review, the AAFP strongly recommends that clinicians treat adults who have hypertension to a standard blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce the risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The AAFP also recommends that clinicians consider treating adults who have hypertension to a blood pressure target of less than 135/85 mm Hg to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, based on evidence showing a small additional benefit with this lower target. First, the AAFP recommends that clinicians treat adults with hypertension to a standard blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. This is a strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence. While treating to a lower blood pressure target of less than 135/85 mm Hg may be considered based on patient preferences and values, the lower target does not provide additional benefit at preventing mortality.

Second, the AAFP recommends that clinicians consider treating adults with hypertension to a lower blood pressure target of less than 135/85 mm Hg to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. This is considered a weak recommendation and is based on moderate-quality evidence. Although treating to a standard blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg reduced the risk of MI, there was a small additional benefit observed with a lower blood pressure target; however, there was no observed additional benefit in preventing stroke. Coles noted several key takeaways for FPs to consider when implementing the recommendations. "High-quality evidence shows that treating adults with hypertension to a target blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg reduces the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, " she said. "Treating a lower blood pressure target does not provide any additional benefit to mortality or stroke risk.

This holds true for adults with and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. "Treating to a target of less than 135/85 can further reduce the risk of MI by about four fewer MIs per 1, 000 patients. However, treating to a lower blood pressure target does come with harms. People treated to a lower blood pressure target increased rates of adverse events, including syncope and hypotension, with a number needed to harm of 33 over 3. 7 years. On average, each patient would need to take one additional medication to get to the lower target. This could increase cost, medication adverse effects and drug-drug interactions.

Systolic blood pressure target less than 130 mm Hg — evidence gap and ongoing trials: Additional RCTs would be needed to definitively recommend an SBP target of less than 130 mm Hg. Given the results of SPRINT, such a large clinical trial is unlikely to be performed in the U.S. in a general (lower risk) hypertensive population. In hypertension patients with diabetes, additional data from RCTs may be available in the next few years as two large trials, Blood Pressure Control Target in Diabetes (BPROAD) and Intervention for High-normal or Borderline-elevated Blood Pressure in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (IPAD) are currently enrolling in China, and these trials should provide further evidence for the benefit of specific SBP thresholds and goals in patients with diabetes.

Background and evidence informing BP targets — trial data and guideline development: Clinical trials indicate that lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events among high–cardiovascular-risk adults and may reduce mortality. When the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) work group report was released in 2014, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) was not yet completed and evaluated adults with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the absence of diabetes mellitus (DM). SPRINT was stopped early for efficacy in 2015 after an interim analysis showed a significantly lower risk of CVD events and all-cause mortality with intensive SBP lowering. In 2017, ACC/AHA issued a new clinical practice guideline incorporating data from trials such as SPRINT and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) 3 trial and describing best practices for BP measurement along with algorithms for hypertension goals based on comorbid conditions and age.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115hfUxF]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — new evidence on systolic and diastolic targets: Prior guidance recommended an office blood pressure (BP) target of < 140/90 mmHg with no obvious incremental benefit of lowering BP to < 130/80 mmHg, but newer RCTs and meta-analyses refine thresholds. In post hoc analyses, compared with 130–139 mmHg, lowering systolic BP (SBP) to < 130 mmHg was generally not associated with further benefit on major cardiovascular (CV) events, and reducing SBP to < 120 mmHg increased the incidence of CV events and death. The SPRINT trial compared SBP targets < 140 vs < 120 mmHg in > 9000 high-risk patients (excluding diabetes or previous stroke), where achieved SBP 121 vs 136 mmHg yielded a 25% reduction in major CV events and a 27% reduction in all-cause death, though interpretation is influenced by unattended automated office BP measurement and the possibility that SPRINT BP values correspond to conventional office SBPs in the 130–140 and 140–150 mmHg ranges. Meta-analyses stratified achieved SBP into 149–140 mmHg, 139–130 mmHg, and < 130 mmHg, and one analysis found every 10 mmHg SBP reduction reduced major CV events and death down to baseline SBP 130–139 mmHg, with benefit also reported when baseline SBP was < 130 mmHg and achieved values < 120 mmHg; however, the incremental benefit decreased as targets were lowered, and more intensive targets must be weighed against an increased risk of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Notably, < 50% of patients treated for hypertension currently achieve a target office SBP of < 140 mmHg.
