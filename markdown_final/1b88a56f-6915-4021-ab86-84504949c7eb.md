## Question

What is the appropriate oral mesalamine dosing for an ulcerative colitis flare?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about appropriate oral mesalamine dosing during an ulcerative colitis flare, with attention to dose range, frequency, formulation, severity-based selection, treatment duration, safety monitoring, patient-specific factors, and a final dosing recommendation plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and guideline-defined targets for induction in mild-to-moderate UC. Then, I should verify the evidence-based oral mesalamine dose range and optimal frequency. Next, I will compare formulation-specific regimens and align dose to disease severity. After that, I need to confirm the induction duration, escalation rules, and when to add rectal therapy. Finally, I should double-check safety monitoring, special populations, and summarize a practical dosing algorithm anchored in guidelines and labels [^1169438b] [^116SCadc].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and goal. In a typical "flare" of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis, induction of remission with appropriately dosed 5-ASA is first-line, and if remission is not achieved on adequate oral and/or rectal mesalamine, guidelines advise against switching to another 5-ASA formulation and instead recommend moving to a different therapeutic class for induction, which frames our dosing and escalation logic here [^111mU1Eg] [^1169438b].

> I need to establish the therapeutic dose window. Wait, let me verify the lower and upper bounds: guideline and FDA sources converge on 2.4 to 4.8 grams per day of oral mesalamine for induction in mild-to-moderate UC, with the higher end favored in moderate activity or when response is suboptimal on standard dosing, and not to exceed 4.8 grams daily [^111mU1Eg] [^116SCadc] [^115JcgWp]. Clinical trial data, such as ASCEND II, demonstrate that 4.8 g/day can outperform 2.4 g/day in moderately active disease, supporting dose escalation when indicated [^117SzL6Y].

> Next, I should review dosing frequency and adherence. Hold on, I should verify whether once-daily dosing is as effective as divided dosing: high-quality data and guidelines support once-daily regimens as clinically equivalent to multiple daily dosing for induction and maintenance, with potential adherence advantages when the formulation supports true once-daily delivery, while traditional delayed-release tablets may still be labeled for divided dosing in practice [^1169438b] [^111h9cAk]. MMX mesalamine specifically was effective at 2.4 or 4.8 g once daily for induction, providing a convenient pathway to optimize adherence without compromising efficacy [^114yiur5].

> I will now examine formulation-specific regimens to ensure correct product-by-product dosing. For delayed-release mesalamine tablets, 800 mg three times daily for a total of 2.4 g/day over 6 weeks is a labeled induction regimen, with allowable escalation up to 4.8 g/day depending on severity and response, whereas extended-release products may be dosed at 1 g four times daily up to 8 weeks for induction, and MMX formulations allow 2.4–4.8 g once daily for approximately 8 weeks, which I need to align to patient preference and adherence needs [^112bpqHL] [^115JcgWp] [^113ceUbC] [^114yiur5]. Wait, I should double-check administration nuances: two 400 mg DR capsules are not interchangeable with a single 800 mg DR tablet, so product-specific instructions must be followed precisely to avoid dosing errors [^11173pJY].

> Let me consider how disease severity should guide starting dose and escalation. For mild activity, starting at 2.4 g/day is reasonable and guideline-concordant, but for moderate activity or if there is inadequate response after a reasonable trial, escalation to 4.8 g/day improves the likelihood of induction success as supported by ASCEND data; but wait, let's not jump to conclusions — severe flares typically require systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies rather than mesalamine monotherapy, and for left-sided disease not responsive to adequate oral and rectal 5-ASA, budesonide MMX 9 mg/day is a recommended next step before systemic steroids in select patients [^117SzL6Y] [^111mU1Eg] [^1151hj4T].

> I should confirm the expected induction duration and when to reassess. The typical induction window ranges from 6 to 8 weeks depending on the product and formulation, and I need to check response at around 6 weeks; if suboptimal on 2.4 g/day, escalation to 4.8 g/day is appropriate rather than switching to a different oral 5-ASA brand, which guidelines discourage after adequate dosing and duration [^116SCadc] [^114yiur5] [^111mU1Eg].

> Next, I should review when to add rectal therapy since it often makes a clinical difference. For distal or left-sided disease, combining oral mesalamine with rectal mesalamine at a dose of at least 1 g/day improves outcomes compared with either route alone, and this adjunctive approach is part of an "appropriately dosed" 5-ASA strategy for induction before moving to other classes if remission is not achieved [^111mU1Eg] [^111CFgxe]. Let me verify rectal efficacy signals: mesalamine enemas show significant improvements in distal disease indices and should be offered when distal inflammation is present, especially early in induction to accelerate symptom control and mucosal healing [^1175f7MV].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring and contraindication screening are explicit. Before and during therapy, baseline and periodic renal function assessment is essential due to risks of interstitial nephritis and nephrolithiasis; I should maintain vigilance for mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome that can mimic a flare, and counsel on photosensitivity and rare internal organ hypersensitivity reactions such as myocarditis and pericarditis, recognizing that while serious cardiac events are rare, case reports do exist, so a high index of suspicion and prompt drug cessation are warranted if concerning symptoms arise [^112WTRMZ] [^112r17Tk] [^113YkKcX] [^115V2hJV].

> But wait, patient-specific factors can change the optimal regimen, so I should review these. When adherence is a concern, true once-daily MMX formulations can simplify dosing without loss of efficacy, supporting better real-world persistence; cost may favor sulfasalazine though tolerability is generally better with mesalamine; pediatric dosing is weight-based with validated ranges, and in lactation, while mesalamine exposure to the infant appears low, shared decision-making and monitoring are prudent [^111h9cAk] [^117Jv1hG] [^113X8U6j] [^113MtqLq].

> Pulling this together into a final, practical recommendation, here is the dosing strategy I should adopt and verify with the patient and product labeling. For an adult with a mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis flare, start oral mesalamine at 2.4 g/day using either DR tablets at 800 mg three times daily for 6 weeks or MMX once daily at 2.4 g for 8 weeks if adherence would benefit, add rectal mesalamine 1 g/day if disease is distal or left sided, reassess at about 6 weeks, and if response is inadequate or disease is moderately active at baseline, escalate to 4.8 g/day using the same formulation rather than switching brands within the class, with a hard ceiling of 4.8 g/day; if remission remains elusive after 8 weeks of optimized 5-ASA (oral ± rectal), step to budesonide MMX for left-sided disease or to systemic steroids or advanced therapies per guideline pathways, and in remission, taper to maintenance at roughly 1.6–2.4 g/day consistent with labeling and maintenance evidence [^112bpqHL] [^114yiur5] [^111mU1Eg] [^115HkXzT].

---

For induction of remission in a UC flare, oral mesalamine 2.4–4.8 g/day [^1169438b] is recommended, with once-daily or divided dosing [^111h9cAk] based on patient preference to optimize adherence [^112P8n44]. Higher doses (4.8 g/day) are appropriate for moderate disease or if initial response is inadequate [^117SzL6Y]. Combine with rectal mesalamine [^111CFgxe] for left-sided or extensive disease, and treat for 6–8 weeks [^111mU1Eg] [^116SCadc]. If remission is not achieved after 8 weeks, escalate therapy to budesonide MMX or systemic corticosteroids [^114tJoXQ] [^1151hj4T]. Monitor renal function at baseline and periodically; common adverse effects include headache, nausea, and abdominal pain [^113YkKcX] [^112WTRMZ].

## Recommended oral mesalamine dosing for UC flare

- **Standard induction dose**: 2.4–4.8 g/day [^1169438b] for mild-to-moderate UC [^111mU1Eg].
- **Dosing frequency**: once daily or divided doses [^1169438b] per patient preference to optimize adherence [^111h9cAk].
- **Higher doses**: 4.8 g/day [^111mU1Eg] for moderate disease or inadequate initial response [^117SzL6Y].
- **Duration**: 6–8 weeks [^1169438b] for induction of remission [^111mU1Eg].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

In the ASCEND II trial, 4.8 g/day was superior to 2.4 g/day in moderate UC (72% vs 59% treatment success at 6 weeks; p = 0.036) [^117SzL6Y]. Once-daily MMX mesalamine 2.4–4.8 g/day was effective for induction [^114yiur5]. Once-daily dosing was non-inferior to divided dosing for induction and maintenance [^115H5KvQ] [^111h9cAk].

---

## Combination therapy with rectal mesalamine

- **Left-sided or extensive disease**: add rectal mesalamine [^1169438b] to oral therapy [^111CFgxe].
- **Rectal dosing**: enemas 1–4 g nightly [^1169438b] or suppositories 1 g daily.
- **Combination therapy**: superior to oral alone for distal disease [^1169438b] [^1171rpa2].

---

## Duration of therapy and monitoring

The induction duration is 6–8 weeks [^1169438b], and monitoring should include renal function at baseline and periodically during treatment [^113YkKcX] [^111mU1Eg].

---

## Adverse effects and safety considerations

- **Common adverse effects**: headache, nausea, abdominal pain [^116kgRU4], diarrhea, dyspepsia, fatigue [^113YkKcX].
- **Serious adverse effects**: renal impairment, acute intolerance syndrome, hypersensitivity reactions [^112WTRMZ], hepatic failure, severe cutaneous reactions, photosensitivity, nephrolithiasis [^113YkKcX].
- **Precautions**: caution in renal or hepatic impairment; monitor renal function regularly [^112r17Tk] [^113YkKcX].

---

## Management of inadequate response

If response is inadequate, escalate to 4.8 g/day [^111mU1Eg] if not already at maximum [^117SzL6Y]. If response remains inadequate, use alternative therapies such as budesonide MMX 9 mg/day [^114tJoXQ] or systemic corticosteroids, and for refractory cases consider immunomodulators or biologics [^111CFgxe] [^1151hj4T].

---

Oral mesalamine is effective for UC flares, with 2.4–4.8 g/day recommended; dosing can be once daily or divided, and higher doses are used for moderate disease or inadequate response.

- **Adverse reactions**: The most serious adverse reactions observed in mesalamine delayed-release capsules clinical trials, or with other products containing or metabolizing to mesalamine, are renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)], severe cutaneous adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], and nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

	- The safety of mesalamine delayed-release capsules has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. In total, mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets have been evaluated in 2,690 patients with ulcerative colitis in controlled and open-label trials. Below is a description of the adverse reactions of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in these adequate and well-controlled studies. Clinical studies supporting mesalamine delayed-release tablets for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis included two 6-week, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies in adults with mild to moderate outcomes.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological agents for management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and network meta-analyses [^1171rpa2]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

The majority of patients with ulcerative colitis have mildly to moderately active disease. To inform the management of patients with left-sided or extensive mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis, we assessed the comparative efficacy and tolerability of different therapies.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched Epub, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to Dec 14, 2015, and updated on MEDLINE on March 1, 2018, for randomized controlled trials in adults (age ≥ 17 years) with left-sided or extensive mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Studies were included if patients were treated with oral sulfasalazine, diazo-bonded 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), mesalazine (low dose 3 g/day), controlled ileal-release budesonide, or budesonide multimatrix, alone or in combination with rectal 5-ASA therapy, and were compared with each other or placebo for induction or maintenance of clinical remission. The minimum duration of therapy was 4 weeks for trials of induction and 24 weeks for trials of maintenance therapy. We did pairwise and random-effects network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs; agents were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise.

### Andrographis paniculata extract (HMPL-004) for active ulcerative colitis [^111sMvSo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

A previous pilot study demonstrated that treatment with A. paniculata 1,200 mg daily for 8 weeks resulted in a similar reduction from baseline in disease activity to that observed with oral mesalamine in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. We also found preliminary evidence of efficacy for A. paniculata 1,200 mg daily for 8 weeks compared with placebo in patients with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. In the study, we demonstrated a dose response with A. paniculata 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg daily and no dose-dependent toxicity. Additional clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of even higher doses of A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) should be undertaken for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Subgroup analysis showed a larger therapeutic effect for A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) relative to placebo in patients who were currently failing oral mesalamine, and a smaller and non-significant effect relative to placebo among patients not receiving mesalamine. This latter result appears largely due to a greater rate of placebo response among patients not receiving mesalamine. This subgroup of patients was relatively small, and the study lacked sufficient statistical power to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding the efficacy of A. paniculata in this patient population. Additional adequately powered studies to assess the efficacy of A. paniculata extract (HMPL-004) as monotherapy in patients with ulcerative colitis are warranted.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mesalamine DR PO (also known as Lialda, Delzicol):

- **ALF**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause hypersensitivity reactions involving internal organs, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Use caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfasalazine.

- **Mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause acute intolerance syndrome, presenting with symptoms such as cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash, which may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis.

- **Minimal change disease, interstitial nephritis, renal failure**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Assess renal function at baseline and periodically during treatment.

- **Nephrolithiasis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis, including mesalamine-containing stones. Advise adequate fluid intake during treatment.

- **Photosensitivity of skin**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and apply sunscreen while outdoors.

- **Positive urine normetanephrine test**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine has been reported to cause a positive urine normetanephrine test.

### Mesalamine [^116kgRU4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults, a 6-week placebo-controlled clinical study (Study 1) involved 105 patients, 53 of whom were randomized to receive mesalamine delayed-release tablets at a dosage of 2.4 grams per day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this study, 4% of the patients treated with mesalamine delayed-release tablets at this dosage discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions, compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients. The average age of patients was 41 years, and 49% were male. Adverse reactions leading to withdrawal included, in single cases, diarrhea and colitis flare, dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache.

The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with mesalamine delayed-release tablets at 2.4 grams per day in Study 1 are listed in the following table:

- **At least 2% of patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablets group and at a rate greater than placebo**:

For pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years, a randomized, double-blind, 6-week study (Study 3) assessed two dosage levels of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in 82 pediatric patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Patients were categorized by body weight (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive either a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective body weight category) or a high dosage (2.0, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day).

### Best practice in the management of mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis and achieving maintenance of remission using mesalazine [^111Tjz4Y]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Optimizing treatment goals in ulcerative colitis requires recognizing the needs of patients. It is increasingly recognized that adapting treatment strategies aligned with patient needs can improve patient compliance and consequently minimize relapse rates. Tailoring of treatment strategies can improve not only patient quality of life and decrease the number harmed by adverse events from more potent drugs, but can also save valuable healthcare costs by avoiding high-cost treatment interventions associated with acute ulcerative colitis. This review will consider several elements of mesalazine management from the patient perspective based on a range of clinical and patient-focused evidence. By highlighting patient preferences in disease management, it is envisaged that this review will aid physicians to optimize treatment decisions with the different mesalazine preparations available.

### SPL drug information for mesalamine ER [^112r17Tk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mesalamine ER PO (also known as Apriso, Pentasa):

- **ALF**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease.

- **Exacerbation of phenylketonuria**: Use caution in patients with phenylketonuria, as extended-release mesalamine tablets contain phenylalanine.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause hypersensitivity reactions involving internal organs, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Use caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfasalazine.

- **Mesalamine-induced acute intolerance syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mesalamine may cause acute intolerance syndrome, presenting with symptoms such as cramping, acute abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fever, headache, and rash, which may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis.

### Mesalamine [^1175f7MV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a placebo-controlled, international, multicenter trial with 153 patients suffering from active distal ulcerative colitis, proctosigmoiditis, or proctitis, the efficacy of Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema was evident. It significantly reduced the overall disease activity index (DAI) and individual components. Each parameter in the DAI has a 4-point scale with ratings: 0 for normal, 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, and 3 for severe. These four parameters are summed to produce a maximum overall DAI of 12. The percent change for overall DAI is calculated by taking the average of the change for each individual patient.

- **Trial findings**:
	* Significant Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema/placebo difference (p < 0.01).
	* Significant Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema/placebo difference (p < 0.001).
	* Significant Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema/placebo difference (p < 0.05).

Differences between Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema and placebo were also statistically significant in subgroups of patients on consilfasalazine and in those having an upper disease boundary between 5 and 20 cm or 20 and 40 cm. However, significant differences between Mesalamine Rectal Suspension Enema and placebo were not achieved in subgroups of patients on conprednisone or with an upper disease boundary between 40 and 50 cm.

### Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^1149gwEg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Maintenance of remission is a major issue in inflammatory bowel disease. In ulcerative colitis, the evidence for the effectiveness of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the maintenance of remission is still controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis.

- **Search methods**: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to June 2012. A manual search was also performed using references from these articles as well as review articles and proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings. Authors of maintenance trials were consulted about unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of at least 12 months' duration that compared azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine with placebo or standard maintenance therapy (e.g. mesalazine) were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data using standard forms. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, including a third author. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was failure to maintain clinical or endoscopic remission. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. Analyses were performed separately by type of control (placebo or active comparator). Pooled risk ratios were calculated based on the fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was shown. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence for pooled outcomes.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: Ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^112RFn4P]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Mesalamine suppositories (0.5 g daily) improved disease activity at 3 and 6 weeks in children with mild-to-moderate proctitis. Combining oral and rectal 5-ASA therapy further improved clinical outcomes. Remission was gained in 16 out of 38 children (42%) unresponsive to oral high-dose mesalamine in a prospective uncontrolled trial of 3 weeks' rectal mesalamine. Adult studies with larger numbers, summarized in Cochrane reviews, show that rectal mesalamine foam, gel, or liquid enema formulations are effective for induction and maintenance of remission in distal colitis; all formulations have comparable tolerance, safety, and outcomes. Once-daily rectal therapy is as effective as divided daily dosing. In adults, more than 1 g daily of rectal mesalamine did not enhance clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission. Once clinical remission and mucosal healing are gained, enemas may be stopped at the patient's choice, and maintenance attempted with oral mesalamine.

Rectal corticosteroid preparations are useful for patients who are 5-ASA intolerant; novel budesonide suppositories were shown in an RCT to be non-inferior to budesonide foam enema in adult ulcerative proctitis. Although corticosteroid preparations are superior to placebo in inducing proctitis remission at all ages, meta-analyses consistently support the superiority of rectal mesalamine over rectal corticosteroids, with a symptomatic remission odds ratio (OR) of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.1–2.45).

Rectal tacrolimus can be a successful third-line treatment of ulcerative proctitis at all ages, as shown in an adult placebo-controlled RCT.

### Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^1137awo2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The newer 5-ASA preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of SASP while maintaining its therapeutic benefits. The efficacy and safety of 5-ASA preparations have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials that often lacked sufficient statistical power to arrive at definitive conclusions. Previously, it was found that newer 5-ASA drugs were more effective than placebo but no more effective than SASP in inducing remission in ulcerative colitis. This updated review includes more recent studies and evaluates the effectiveness, dose-responsiveness, and safety of 5-ASA preparations in terms of more precise outcome measures.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy, dose-responsiveness, and safety of the newer release formulations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compared to placebo or sulfasalazine (SASP) in the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Search strategy**: A computer-assisted literature search for relevant studies (1981–2002) was performed using MEDLINE, BIOS, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register, and the Science Citation Index, followed by a manual search of reference lists from previously retrieved articles, review articles, symposia proceedings, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal conferences.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were accepted for analysis if they were prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo- or SASP-controlled clinical trials of parallel design with treatment duration of at least six months.

### Delzicol [^113X8U6j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis:

- **Adults**: In a 6-week placebo-controlled clinical study (Study 1) involving 105 patients, 53 were randomized to receive mesalamine delayed-release tablets at a dose of 2.4 grams per day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Of these patients, 4% discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions, compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients. The average age of participants was 41 years, and 49% were male. Adverse reactions leading to withdrawal included diarrhea and colitis flare, as well as dizziness, nausea, joint pain, and headache. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 grams per day in Study 1 are listed in Table 2 below.

- **At least 2% of patients** in the mesalamine delayed-release tablets group experienced these adverse reactions at a rate greater than the placebo group.

- **Pediatric patients 5 to 17 years old**: A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study (Study 3) was conducted involving 82 pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Participants were categorized by body weight (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to either a low dosage (1.2, 2, and 2.4 grams per day for the respective weight category) or a high dosage (2.0, 3.6, and 4.8 grams per day).

### Mesalamine [^112oYiVk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release capsules has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of the adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years, and the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.

- **Treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis**:

	- **Adults**:
		Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.

		In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks' duration in 158 patients (Study 1), patients received mesalamine delayed-release dosages of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n = 53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n = 53), compared to placebo (n = 52). The scoring system for determination of treatment efficacy included assessment of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient's functional assessment, and physician global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets showed an improvement in sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048).

### Mesalamine [^11173pJY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Important administration instructions**: Do not substitute two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg capsules with one mesalamine delayed-release 800 mg tablet. Evaluate renal function prior to initiation of mesalamine delayed-release capsules. Take mesalamine delayed-release capsules with or without food. Swallow the capsules whole; do not cut, break, crush, or chew the capsules. For patients who are unable to swallow the capsules whole, carefully open the capsule(s) and swallow the contents, which consist of four 100 mg tablets.

	- Open the number of capsules required to make up a complete dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].
	- There are 4 tablets per capsule. Ensure all tablets per capsule are swallowed and no tablets are retained in the mouth.
	- Swallow the tablets whole; do not cut, break, crush, or chew the tablets.

	- Drink an adequate amount of fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Intact, partially intact, and/or tablet shells have been reported in the stool; instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if this occurs repeatedly. Protect mesalamine delayed-release capsules from moisture. Close the container tightly and leave any desiccant pouches present in the bottle along with the tablets.

- **Dosage for treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis**:

	- **Adults**: For adults, the recommended dosage of mesalamine delayed-release capsules is 800 mg (two 400 mg capsules) three times daily (total daily dosage of 2.4 grams) for a duration of 6 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^115qNy3R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). High credibility.

The newer 5-ASA preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of SASP while maintaining its therapeutic benefits. The efficacy and safety of 5-ASA preparations have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials that have often lacked sufficient statistical power to arrive at definitive conclusions. Previously, it was found that newer 5-ASA drugs were more effective than placebo but no more effective than SASP in inducing remission in ulcerative colitis. This updated review includes more recent studies and evaluates the effectiveness, dose-responsiveness, and safety of 5-ASA preparations in terms of more precise outcome measures.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy, dose-responsiveness, and safety of the newer release formulations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compared to placebo or sulfasalazine (SASP) in the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Search strategy**: A computer-assisted literature search for relevant studies (1981–2005) was performed using MEDLINE, BIOS, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialized Trials Register, and the Science Citation Index, followed by a manual search of reference lists from previously retrieved articles, review articles, symposia proceedings, and abstracts from major gastrointestinal conferences.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were accepted for analysis if they were prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo- or SASP-controlled clinical trials of parallel design with a treatment duration of at least six months.

### Constrictive pericarditis in chronic ulcerative colitis [^115V2hJV]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis has been described as an extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a consequence of IBD treatment, specifically sulfasalazine and mesalamine. Until now, there have been no reported cases of constrictive pericarditis associated with IBD or its treatment. A 37-year-old woman with a 24-year history of chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) presented with a 3-month history of fevers, palpitations, dyspnea, syncope, and retrosternal chest pain. Two weeks before symptoms, she had initiated oral mesalamine for an ongoing CUC flare. Physical examination suggested constrictive pericarditis. An echocardiogram revealed a thickened pericardium with a nearly circumferential fibrinous effusion, with Doppler confirming diastolic compromise. The patient proceeded to radical pericardectomy. Pathological examination showed grossly hemorrhagic acute and chronic pericarditis, with cultures and cytology negative. At the time of writing, only 104 cases of IBD with acute pericarditis have been reported, with fewer than 10 cases of mesalamine-induced acute pericarditis reported. This is the first reported case of constrictive pericarditis related to IBD or its treatment. Although our patient may have had IBD-associated constrictive pericarditis, her mesalamine use raises the possibility of a drug-induced constrictive pericarditis.

### Mesalamine [^115HkXzT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis**:

	- In a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months' duration in 264 patients (Study 4), patients received mesalamine delayed-release tablets of 0.8 grams per day (400 mg twice a day; n = 90) and 1.6 grams per day (400 mg four times a day; n = 87), compared to placebo four times a day (n = 87). The proportion of patients treated with 0.8 grams per day who maintained endoscopic remission was not statistically significant compared to placebo; the 0.8 grams per day dosage regimen is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The number of patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.6 grams per day who maintained endoscopic remission of ulcerative colitis was 61 of 87 (70%) compared with 42 of 87 (48%) of placebo patients (p = 0.005).

	- A pooled efficacy analysis of four maintenance trials compared mesalamine delayed-release tablets at dosages of 0.8 to 2.8 grams per day, in divided doses ranging from twice daily to four times per day, with sulfasalazine, at dosages of 2 to 4 grams per day. Treatment success was seen in 59 of 98 (59%) patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets and 70 of 102 (69%) patients using sulfasalazine, a non-significant difference.

### Combined oral and topical mesalazine treatment for extensive ulcerative colitis [^112nTLV9]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old white Jewish woman was referred to our clinic in October 2002 for a second opinion on the management of her active extensive ulcerative colitis, which did not respond to oral mesalazine (mesalamine) 3.6 g/day. The severity of her symptoms had affected her plans to have children.

- **Investigations**: Laboratory investigations included perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and antibodies to *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, stool cultures, and sigmoidoscopy to 40 cm from the rectum, with biopsies.

- **Diagnosis**: Moderate-to-severe active extensive ulcerative colitis, unresponsive to mesalazine at 3.6 g/day.

- **Management**: Oral mesalazine 4.8 g/day and 4 g mesalazine enemas nightly.

### Curcumin use in ulcerative colitis: Is it ready for prime time? A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^1122CA1G]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition that presents with watery and/or hemorrhagic diarrhea associated with rectal urgency. Symptoms can be debilitating and severely affect a person's quality of life. At diagnosis, 30–50% of patients have disease confined to the rectum or the sigmoid colon (distal colitis); 20–30% have left-sided colitis; and about 20% have pancolitis. Of the patients with distal colitis, 25–50% progress to more extensive forms of the disease over time.

In early 2019, the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) released clinical guidelines for the management of mild to moderate UC. The recommendation is to start with a standard dose of mesalamine (2–3 g/day) or diazo-bonded 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA) rather than low-dose mesalamine, sulfasalazine, or no treatment in patients with extensive mild-moderate UC. The addition of rectal mesalamine to oral 5-ASA is recommended for patients with extensive or left-sided mild-to-moderate UC.

There have been reports regarding the efficacy of curcumin, a natural phenol found in the large-leafed herb Curcuma longa L. (common names turmeric, Indian saffron), in the treatment of various diseases such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as UC. However, the AGA made no recommendations on its use in mild-to-moderate UC patients already on a 5-ASA agent. The reason for this was stated to be a "knowledge gap", probably due to the lack of large randomized placebo-controlled studies (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of curcumin and its side-effect profile.

### Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^115WWkbU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Oral 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of sulfasalazine (SASP) while maintaining its therapeutic benefits. Previously, it was found that 5-ASA drugs were more effective than placebo but had a statistically significant therapeutic inferiority relative to SASP. This updated review includes more recent studies and evaluates the effectiveness, dose-responsiveness, and safety of 5-ASA preparations used for maintenance of remission in quiescent ulcerative colitis.

- **Objectives**: The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy, dose-responsiveness, and safety of oral 5-ASA compared to placebo, SASP, or 5-ASA comparators for maintenance of remission in quiescent ulcerative colitis. A secondary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing of oral 5-ASA with conventional (two or three times daily) dosing regimens.

- **Search methods**: A literature search for relevant studies (from inception to January 20, 2012) was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Review articles and conference proceedings were also searched to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were accepted for analysis if they were randomized controlled trials with a minimum treatment duration of six months. Studies of oral 5-ASA therapy for treatment of patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis compared with placebo, SASP, or other 5-ASA formulations were considered for inclusion. Studies that compared once-daily 5-ASA treatment with conventional dosing of 5-ASA and 5-ASA dose-ranging studies were also consid.

### Mesalamine [^112sJxLi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

There were 41 patients in the low dosage group and 41 patients in the high dosage group who received at least one dose of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets. Thirty-six patients in each dosage group completed the study. Patients were considered treatment failures if they did not achieve success or dropped out due to adverse reactions or lack of efficacy.

At Week 6, 73% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 70% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the TM-Mayo; 34% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved complete response. At Week 6, 56% of the patients in the low dosage group, and 55% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved success based on the PUCAI; 46% of the patients in the low dosage group and 43% of the patients in the high dosage group achieved complete response.

The high dosage regimen is not recommended because it was not more effective than the low dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: Ambulatory care - An updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^114sj389]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Thiopurines (azathioprine and mercaptopurine) are a mainstay of paediatric UC maintenance management. Meta‐analyses of placebo‐controlled RCTs affirm that azathioprine is more effective than placebo in preventing relapse but not in inducing remission.

Paediatric data support the efficacy of thiopurines in maintaining remission and reducing the need for corticosteroids. The median time to achieve steady thiopurine levels is 55 days. A prospective dose optimisation study including 33 patients with UC reported 1‐year corticosteroid‐free remission in 39%, with corticosteroid‐free remission plus normal CRP and ESR in 27%. A retrospective study from the 'biologic-era' reported a 56% 1‐year corticosteroid‐free remission in children on thiopurines without previous or concomitant biologic therapy, with a probability of not requiring rescue therapy of 83% at 1 year, 62% at 2 years, 45% at 3 years, and 37% at 4 years. However, earlier introduction of thiopurines neither benefits clinical nor endoscopic outcomes, nor reduces the ultimate risk of colectomy in children.

Despite a single negative small‐scale study in adults, combining 5‐ASA with thiopurines may be considered due to the excellent safety profile of the former and potential additive effects, including chemoprotection. 5‐ASA may partially inhibit TPMT activity, increasing 6‐TGN levels. A decision to add 5‐ASA should balance between the additive efficacy and chemoprevention with maintaining mesalamine while on thiopurines and the better expected adherence profile when the patient is on monotherapy.

### Mesalamine [^112t7rve]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The mechanism of action of mesalamine (5-ASA) is not fully understood but appears to be a local anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (i.e. prostanoids) and the lipoxygenase pathways (i.e. leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids), is increased in patients with ulcerative colitis. It is possible that 5-ASA diminishes inflammation by blocking the production of these arachidonic acid metabolites.

- **Absorption**: The pharmacokinetics of 5-ASA and its metabolite, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA), were studied after single and multiple oral doses of 1.5 g mesalamine in a crossover study in healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the multiple-dose period, each subject received 1.5 g of mesalamine (four 0.375 g capsules) once daily for seven consecutive days. Steady state was reached on Day 6 of once daily dosing based on trough concentrations. After single and multiple doses of mesalamine, peak plasma concentrations were observed about 4 hours post-dose. At steady state, moderate increases (1.5-fold and 1.7-fold) in systemic exposure (AUC0–24) to 5-ASA and N-Ac-5-ASA were observed compared with a single-dose of mesalamine.

Pharmacokinetic parameters following a single dose of 1.5 g mesalamine and at steady state in healthy subjects under fasting conditions are mentioned but detailed in a table not presented here.

### Efficacy and safety of oral beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide MMX 5-aminosalicylates or placebo in ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vvtpN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

A recent network meta-analysis comparing oral sulfasalazine, low-dose 5-ASA (3 g/day), controlled ileal-release budesonide, or budesonide MMX, alone or in combination with rectal 5-ASA therapy, demonstrated that budesonide MMX was not more effective than combined oral and rectal 5-ASA or high-dose mesalamine and had inferior tolerability. Another meta-analysis by Manguso et al, published in 2016 and including five RCTs, showed that BDP 5 mg was superior to 5-ASA in achieving clinical remission or clinical improvement considered separately. The authors included one trial comparing BDP versus 5-ASA as add-on therapy with prednisone (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.76–2.23 and OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03–1.93, respectively).

However, in clinical practice, if a patient does not respond to induction treatment with 5-ASA, oral steroids are usually the next step. Papi et al, in a study administering oral BDP 10 mg/day for 4 weeks followed by a 4-week administration of 5 mg/day in 64 mild-to-moderate UC patients with a previous 5-ASA treatment failure, found a remission rate of 75%, with most patients achieving 1-year maintenance of remission with no need for further steroid treatment. These data support the crucial role of oral BDP as an alternative therapy to systemic steroids in patients with a mild-to-moderate flare of the disease that is not responsive to 5-ASA. Moreover, these evidences suggest that further larger randomized studies comparing low bioavailability steroids with 5-ASA are warranted.

### Optimizing clinical use of mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) in inflammatory bowel disease [^111dLmQv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Mesalazine [5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)] has been used for over 30 years in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is a highly effective, safe, and well-tolerated drug for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, which represents most patients with this disease. Recent studies of patient adherence to 5-ASA therapies in ulcerative colitis have highlighted the need for regimens that enable long-term compliance to significantly reduce the risk of troublesome and debilitating flares in the short term and possibly colon cancer in the long term. Indeed, much of the recent innovation in the clinical use of 5-ASA in colitis has come from studies of novel delivery mechanisms and simplified oral dosing schedules. These studies have provided much-needed clarity on essential matters such as starting dose, dose escalation, and efficacy in terms of the ideal clinical endpoint — mucosal healing. Various manufacturers are re-evaluating their products to determine the safety and efficacy of such dosing regimens.

Although once widely employed in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), the accumulated body of evidence now suggests that there is a much more limited role for 5-ASA in this particular form of inflammatory bowel disease. Recent 5-ASA randomized-controlled trials, comparative studies, and outcomes research have led to refined treatment strategies and awareness for practitioners to better inform, engage, and facilitate patients in the optimal use of 5-ASA in inflammatory bowel disease.

### Efficacy of dose escalation of oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for ulcerative colitis with a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 1: An open label randomized controlled trial [^1163eNxo]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned, using a computer-generated stratified randomization procedure, to either the group with or without therapeutic intervention. Patients assigned to the group without intervention were defined as the control group. Patients were randomized within 30 days from the confirmation of an MES of 1. The stratified factor in the randomization procedure was the concomitant use of immunomodulators at the time of randomization. Neither patients nor healthcare providers were masked in the randomization.

Endoscopists inspected the entire colon using conventional white-light imaging. All endoscopists were experts in inflammatory bowel disease and were well trained in scoring MES. Endoscopic scores were assessed at colonoscopy. An MES of 0 was defined as normal or inactive disease, and an MES of 1 was defined as mild disease such as erythema, decreased vascular pattern, or mild friability. The MES and the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) were used to assess endoscopic severity. When collecting data for this study, two or more trained monitors reviewed the pictures of endoscopic examination independently and confirmed an MES of 1 before enrollment.

The primary end point was relapse within one year. Patients were followed up to one year or until the time of relapse if it was within one year. Relapse was defined as meeting both of the following two criteria: (1) a partial Mayo score ≥ 3 or a rectal bleeding subscore ≥ 1; and (2) addition of any induction treatment.

### Methotrexate for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^114YeSiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylates are the most commonly used therapies; however, many patients require immunosuppressive therapy for steroid-refractory and steroid-dependent disease. Methotrexate is a medication effective for treating various inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease. This review aims to determine the effectiveness of methotrexate treatment in UC patients and serves as an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with UC.

- **Search methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized trials register were searched from inception to June 26, 2014. Study references and review papers were reviewed for additional trials. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were examined to identify research published in abstract form only.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing methotrexate with placebo or an active comparator in patients with active ulcerative colitis were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission and withdrawal from steroids, as defined by the studies and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients randomized (intention-to-treat basis).

### Mesalamine dose escalation reduces fecal calprotectin in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis [^11688LGy]. Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology (2014). High credibility.

Among patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis (UC), lower fecal concentrations of calprotectin are associated with lower rates of relapse. We performed an open-label, randomized controlled trial to investigate whether increasing doses of mesalamine reduce concentrations of fecal calprotectin (FC) in patients with quiescent UC.

- **Methods**: We screened 119 patients with UC in remission based on Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index scores, FC > 50 μg/g, and intake of no more than 3 g/day mesalamine. Participants taking mesalamine formulations other than multimatrix mesalamine were switched to multimatrix mesalamine (2.4 g/day) for 6 weeks. Fifty-two participants were then randomly assigned (1:1) to a group that continued its dose of mesalamine (controls, n = 26) or a group that increased its dose by 2.4 g/day for 6 weeks (n = 26). The primary outcome was continued remission with FC ≤ 200 μg/g compared with those with FC < 200 μg/g (P = .01).

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with quiescent UC and increased levels of FC, increasing the dose of mesalamine by 2.4 g/day resulted in significant outcomes.

### Randomised trial of once- or twice-daily MMX mesalazine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis [^115H5KvQ]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

- **Discontinuations due to AEs**: Twenty-one patients (4.6%) experienced 23 adverse events (AEs) that led to withdrawal: 11 patients (4.9%) in the once-daily group and 10 patients (4.3%) in the twice-daily group. Most AEs resulting in withdrawal were gastrointestinal disorders, affecting 9 (4.0%) patients in the once-daily group and 6 (2.6%) in the twice-daily group. Eleven patients were withdrawn due to serious adverse events (SAEs), with 5 in the once-daily group and 6 in the twice-daily group. One patient died due to electric shock.

- **Time to withdrawal**: There was no significant difference (p = 0.62) between the two groups in relation to the time to withdrawal. A small and gradual decrease in retention rate was observed over the 12-month treatment period. The retention rate exceeded 90% for the first 6 months of the maintenance phase and was in excess of 80% for the remainder of the study.

- **Other safety parameters**: There were no remarkable changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory parameters in either treatment group.

- **Remission**:
	- **Overall remission**: In the efficacy population, 78.1% of patients in the once-daily group and 82.3% of patients in the divided-dose group were in clinical and endoscopic remission at entry (month 0) according to the strict criteria employed in this study. At month 12, 64.4% of patients in the once-daily group and 68.5% of patients in the divided-dose group were in strictly defined clinical and endoscopic remission. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups (p = 0.351, odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.23).

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: Ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^111JUFyw]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

- **Oral corticosteroids**: Oral corticosteroids should be used as a second-line induction treatment for mild-to-moderate UC not responding to 5-ASA (oral and/or rectal). Corticosteroids may be considered as first-line induction treatment for moderate-to-severe disease based on clinical and endoscopic characteristics [EL3, adults EL1] (Agreement 100%). Second-generation oral corticosteroids with lower systemic effects, such as beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) [EL2, adults EL1] and budesonide-MMX [EL5, adults EL2], may be considered in patients with mild-to-moderate disease refractory to 5-ASA (Agreement 100%). Corticosteroids should not be used for maintaining remission, and the need for repeated courses should prompt a change in therapy. Corticosteroid-sparing strategies should be applied [EL5, adults EL4] (Agreement 100%).

- **Practice points**: The recommended daily dose for oral prednisolone/prednisone is 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 40 mg) once daily in the morning for 1–2 weeks (not exceeding 4 weeks), followed by a tapering period of up to 7 weeks (Agreement 100%). In patients weighing more than 30 kg, the dosing schedule of BDP is 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks, and for budesonide-MMX, it is 9 mg for 8 weeks. Dosing for children under 30 kg has not been established. No liquid formulation is available. There is no evidence to support whether and how to taper either drug. Although abrupt discontinuation has been practiced in RCTs, alternate day tapering over 2–4 weeks may be considered (Agreement 100%).

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: Ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^117Jv1hG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Oral mesalamine may be better tolerated than sulfasalazine, with a relative risk (RR) of adverse effects being 0.48, and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.36–0.63. However, sulfasalazine is cheaper, equally effective, and remains the only 5‐aminosalicylic acid (ASA) available in liquid formulation, making it attractive for young children. Sulfasalazine also has a direct effect on nuclear factor kappa B, which may enhance its mode of action. Sulfasalazine suspension was deemed safe and effective in a retrospective study involving 57 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), with a mean age of 5.3 ± 3.3 years, who were unable to swallow tablets.

Moreover, except for the uncommon allergic reaction (< 0.1%), the vast majority of adverse events, such as headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, are mild and uncommon. Serious adverse events with 5‐ASA treatment are rare and include renal, pancreatic, pulmonary, and cardiac complications. Sulfasalazine hypersensitivity may present with fever, rash, and eosinophilia, which should trigger immediate cessation of treatment. In addition, folic acid deficiency has been reported with sulfasalazine use. In adult studies, withdrawal due to intolerance ranges from 2% to 5%. Intolerance to 5‐ASA medications may mimic a UC flare, and, when clinically proven through rechallenge, it precludes further use of 5‐ASA compounds. Regular laboratory monitoring of complete blood count (CBC), renal function, and urinalysis remains a practice for many clinicians, though it is not supported by evidence. Poor adherence is always a potential cause of nonresponse to therapy.

### Oral budesonide for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^114tJoXQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. Although corticosteroids may improve symptoms, they have significant adverse effects. Steroids that act topically, with fewer systemic side effects, may be more desirable. Budesonide is a topically acting corticosteroid with extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism. There are currently three formulations of budesonide: two standard formulations, including a controlled-ileal release capsule and a pH-dependent capsule, both designed to release the drug in the distal small intestine and right colon; and the newer Budesonide-MMX® capsule, designed to release the drug throughout the entire colon.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialised Register from inception to April 2015. We also searched reference lists of articles, conference proceedings, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing oral budesonide to placebo or another active therapy for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis were considered eligible. There were no exclusions based on patient age, type, dose, duration, or formulation of budesonide therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^117Wox8q]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

Oral methotrexate has reduced and extremely variable bioavailability compared to parenteral administration, particularly at doses above 15 mg. This variability is not corrected by the use of folic acid. Because bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are very similar for subcutaneous and intramuscular methotrexate, the subcutaneous route should be preferred as it is easier and less painful. Induction therapy should be administered via the subcutaneous route. If patients prefer, this can be switched to oral administration during the maintenance phase, with the option to switch back to subcutaneous if effectiveness is lost. Regardless of the administration route, methotrexate should be given with folic acid to reduce gastrointestinal and liver toxicity — 5 mg weekly (traditionally 1–2 days after the methotrexate dose) or 1 mg daily.

- **Mesalazine**: We recommend that mesalazine is not used for induction or maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.7%). UK data from 1990 to 2010 show over half of patients with Crohn's disease were prescribed 5-ASA, and Swiss data show it is more often given for Crohn's colitis. A Cochrane systematic literature review demonstrated that oral 5-ASA has no efficacy in maintaining clinical remission in Crohn's disease, with similar negative findings in meta-analyses for induction or maintenance. A recent review of colonic Crohn's disease found no benefit for 5-ASA in colonic Crohn's disease, although two studies indicated possible benefit for sulphasalazine in remission induction.

### Once-daily, high-concentration MMX mesalamine in active ulcerative colitis [^114yiur5]. Gastroenterology (2007). High credibility.

SPD476 (LIALDA in the US; MEZAVANT in the EU; otherwise known as MMX mesalamine; Shire Pharmaceuticals Inc, Wayne, PA, under license from Giuliani SpA, Milan, Italy) is a novel, once-daily, high-strength (1.2 g/tablet) formulation of mesalamine. It utilizes MMX Multi Matrix System (MMX) technology designed to deliver the active drug throughout the colon. A double-blind, multicenter study was performed, comparing MMX mesalamine versus placebo for treating active ulcerative colitis. A delayed-release oral mesalamine (ASACOL; Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) reference arm was included.

- **Methods**: Three hundred forty-three patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis received MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day or 4.8 g/day given once daily, ASACOL 2.4 g/day given in 3 divided doses, or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in clinical and endoscopic remission, defined as a modified ulcerative colitis disease activity index or a ≥ 1-point reduction in sigmoidoscopy score from baseline.

- **Results**: A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day given once daily (40.5%; p = 0.01) and 4.8 g/day given once daily (41.2%; p = 0.007) achieved clinical and endoscopic remission at week 8, compared with placebo (22.1%). The clinical and endoscopic remission rate for ASACOL (32.6%; p = 0.124) was not significantly superior to placebo. All active treatments were well-tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: Once-daily MMX mesalamine was efficacious.

### Mesalamine [^113MtqLq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Lactation**: Mesalamine and its N-acetyl metabolite are present in human milk. In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 3 g daily. The concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.11 mg/L. The concentration of the N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid metabolite ranged from 5 to 18.1 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily doses for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.017 mg/kg/day of mesalamine and 0.75 to 2.72 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine delayed-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Caution should be exercised when mesalamine delayed-release capsules are administered to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies using mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets. Use of mesalamine delayed-release capsules in these pediatric age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in adults and a single 6-week study in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age.

### Mesalamine once daily is more effective than twice daily in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis [^115MXXQV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

The aims of this study focus on oral mesalamine (5-aminosalicylate) as the standard of care for mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis. We investigated the efficacy and safety of once daily administration of prolonged-release mesalamine granules in the maintenance of remission in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis, compared with the well-established twice daily dosing regimen.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, randomized, single-blind, noninferiority trial, 362 patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups that were given oral mesalamine 2 g once daily, or 1 g twice daily, for 12 months. The primary objective was to compare remission rates at 1 year, based on the ulcerative colitis disease activity index score, using Kaplan-Meier methodology.

- **Results**: At 1 year, 70.9% of the group given 2 g mesalamine once daily remained in remission vs. 58.9% of the group given 1 g mesalamine twice daily; this difference was statistically significant (P = .024), indicating increased efficacy of once daily dosing compared with twice daily dosing. Self-reported adherence to therapy, measured by visual analog scale score after 4, 8, and 12 months, was significantly greater in the group given 2 g mesalamine once daily compared with twice daily at all but one study visit (P < .05). Compliance measured by medication taken was not significantly different between the groups. The difference between the two groups in the overall incidence of adverse events was not statistically significant (P = .23).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with ulcerative colitis given prolonged-release oral mesalamine once daily show increased efficacy in maintaining remission compared to those given the medication twice daily.

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^1118ADXm]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by intermittent periods of disease flaring and remission. It affects approximately 900,000 people in the United States. Although the primary clinical symptom is the presence of bloody diarrhea, patients can also experience a range of additional symptoms, including urgency and abdominal pain. Individuals can also experience more systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss.

The goal of treatment in UC is to induce and maintain remission of symptoms and allow for healing of inflammation. For patients with mild to moderate disease severity, conventional treatment typically consists of oral or topical aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) or topical steroids for the induction of remission and oral and/or topical 5-ASAs for maintenance. For patients who are refractory to 5-ASA therapy or topical steroids, oral steroids can be used to induce remission. However, steroids are not indicated for maintenance therapy in UC. Despite this, 22% of patients develop steroid dependency, and only half achieve steroid-free remission within a year of their first course of systemic steroids. Inability to taper off steroids suggests a need to switch to advanced therapies.

Approximately half of newly diagnosed patients progress to moderate or severe disease, either continuously or intermittently. In addition, many patients with UC do not respond to conventional therapies, either failing to respond to induction therapy (primary nonresponse) or initially achieving remission but not maintaining it with long-term treatment.

### Are there any differences in the efficacy and safety of different formulations of oral 5-ASA used for induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis? Evidence from Cochrane reviews [^11263hkn]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

We systematically reviewed and compared the efficacy and safety of oral mesalamine formulations (sustained release, delayed release, and prodrugs) used for the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. The main objective of this review was to determine if there are any differences in efficacy or safety among the oral 5-ASA drugs.

- **Methods**: A literature search conducted in February 2013 identified all applicable randomized trials. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were used to assess the overall quality of the evidence. Studies were subgrouped by common mesalamine comparators for meta-analysis. Studies were pooled for analysis if they compared equimolar doses of oral 5-ASA.

- **Results**: Seventeen studies that evaluated 2,925 patients were identified. The risk of bias was low for most factors, although one study was single-blind and three were open-label. No difference was observed between oral 5-ASA and comparator 5-ASA formulations in the proportion of patients with clinical remission (relative risk 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.86–1.02), clinical improvement (relative risk 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.77–1.01), or relapse at 12 months (relative risk 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.80–1.28). Subgroup analyses showed no important differences in efficacy. No significant difference was demonstrated in rates of adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: There does not seem to be any difference in efficacy or safety among the various formulations of oral 5-ASA in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

### 2.4 g mesalamine (Asacol 400 mg tablet) once daily is as effective as three times daily in maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: A randomized, noninferiority, multi-center trial [^113VagTo]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A basic objective in the management of ulcerative colitis (UC) in the remission phase is to maintain a comfortable daily life for as long as possible while preventing relapse. Oral mesalamine is recommended as basic treatment of UC in the remission phase. In most cases, long-term administration is needed to maintain remission. Medication adherence for a long period is known to be a key issue in this patient population.

A previous cohort study indicates that nonadherence is a risk factor for relapse of UC. Moreover, it has been reported that administration of multiple daily doses is a factor that influences nonadherence. Thus, once daily (QD) administration is a therapeutic option that encourages compliance. In other reports, no differences in efficacy and safety between QD and twice or three times daily administration in patients with UC in the remission phase have been reported, and QD dosing is approved in several countries.

In Japan, the noninferiority of QD dosing administration was reported when compared with three times daily (TID) dosing administration of a time-dependent release mesalamine formulation, and QD dosing is approved. There has, however, not been a report that compares noninferiority of QD with TID use of a pH-dependent release mesalamine formulation. We conducted the trial to verify that QD administration of a pH-dependent release mesalamine formulation (Asacol) is not inferior to TID administration.

### AGA technical review on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^111CFgxe]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Most patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have mild-to-moderate disease activity, with a low risk of colectomy, and are managed by primary care physicians or gastroenterologists. Optimal management of these patients decreases the risk of relapse and proximal disease extension, and may prevent disease progression, complications, and the need for immunosuppressive therapy. With several medications (e.g. sulfasalazine, diazo-bonded 5-aminosalicylates [ASA], mesalamines, and corticosteroids, including budesonide) and complex dosing formulations, regimens, and routes, to treat a disease with variable anatomic extent, there is considerable practice variability in the management of patients with mild-moderate UC. Hence, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized clinical guidelines on this topic.

To inform clinical guidelines, this technical review was developed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework for interventional studies. Focused questions included the following:

- **Comparative effectiveness and tolerability of different oral 5-ASA therapies**: Sulfasalazine vs. diazo-bonded 5-ASAs vs. mesalamine; low-dose (3 g/d) mesalamine.

- **Comparison of different dosing regimens**: Once-daily vs. multiple times per day dosing and routes (oral vs. rectal vs. both oral and rectal).

- **Role of oral budesonide in patients with mild-moderate UC**.

- **Comparative effectiveness and tolerability of rectal 5-ASA and corticosteroid formulations**: This is especially relevant in patients with distal colitis.

The findings of this review guide clinical decision-making and help standardize care in the management of mild-to-moderate UC.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: Ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^111YJHg4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

A retrospective cohort study from Canada among 125 children with UC showed better remission rates after an intensified infliximab induction scheme. Typically, higher drug concentrations are required during the induction phase as compared to the maintenance phase for children who weigh 15 μg/mL (see Supporting Information S5: Table S6).

Reactive TDM is used in patients who have not achieved remission or lost response, either clinically or by using biomarkers, during the maintenance stage. In these scenarios, it is advised to measure the infliximab concentration before the next drug administration (trough). Proactive TDM involves measuring infliximab concentrations when patients are in remission, especially at protocolized time points, such as post‐induction and following a fixed time period on therapy. While TDM is helpful, it is not available in all countries. Dose adaptations are then aimed at achieving the target drug concentration. When the infliximab concentration is below the target range, a dose increase or shortening of the infusion interval is warranted. For infliximab, a 25% reduction of the dosing interval is generally as effective as a dose increase to 10 mg/kg.

Proactive TDM provides added value in patients at risk for drug underexposure, as defined above, who would require higher drug doses. Obesity may also increase drug clearance, possibly related to greater proteolytic capacity and infliximab distribution in a broader volume.

### Once daily vs multiple daily mesalamine therapy for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis: a meta-analysis [^111h9cAk]. Colorectal Disease (2016). High credibility.

5-Aminosalicylic acid is the first-line drug for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). The most commonly used form is mesalamine. Several systematic reviews have demonstrated that mesalamine is effective in inducing and maintaining remission. This study systematically reviewed and compared the efficacy, safety, and adherence to once daily (OD) and multiple daily (MD) dosing of mesalamine for the induction and maintenance of remission in mild to moderate UC.

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to November 2014. Only randomized controlled trials were considered eligible. STATA software (version 12.0) was used to calculate the pooled risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval.

Seventeen randomized studies, containing 5439 patients, were identified. No significant differences were found in comparisons between OD and MD dosing for maintenance and induction of remission. Additionally, no significant differences were noted in rates of medication adherence or adverse events between OD and MD dosing. Regarding mesalamine suppository, no significant differences were observed in comparisons between dosing regimens and adverse events for induction of remission.

In conclusion, OD dosing of mesalamine is as effective and safe as MD dosing for the induction and maintenance treatment of mild to moderate UC. OD mesalamine, when given as a suppository, can achieve the same effect and safety as MD mesalamine in inducing remission of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.

### Delzicol [^1159mkDB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Absorbed mesalamine is primarily excreted by the kidney in the form of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, while unabsorbed mesalamine is expelled in feces. Following intravenous administration, the elimination half-life of mesalamine is approximately 40 minutes. In contrast, after oral dosing, the median terminal half-life (t1/2) of mesalamine is generally around 25 hours, although it can vary widely from 1.5 to 296 hours. Significant variability is observed in plasma concentrations and terminal half-lives of mesalamine and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid among subjects after Delzicol administration.

- **Specific populations**:
	- **Pediatric patients**: In a dose-ranging pharmacokinetic study, mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets were administered twice daily for four weeks at 30, 60, and 90 mg/kg per day. The mean average concentration (Cavg) of mesalamine in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients varied from approximately 400 ng/mL to 2100 ng/mL across all dose levels. In another study evaluating these tablets in pediatric patients (Study 3), mean plasma concentrations of mesalamine, based on sparse sampling, ranged from 820 to 988 ng/mL at the low dose level. The doses were 1.2, 2, or 2.4 grams per day, determined based on body weight strata (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg, respectively).

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^112P8n44]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

- **5-ASA maintenance therapy for UC**:

- **Statement 8**: We recommend that oral 5-ASA should be the standard maintenance medical therapy in ulcerative colitis (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). We recommend that the choice of formulation considers patient preference, likely adherence, and cost. Once daily dosing is effective (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence) and may improve adherence.

- **Maintenance therapy efficacy**: Maintenance 5-ASA therapy is advocated to decrease the risk and frequency of flares. The most recent Cochrane analysis showed a trend towards greater efficacy with higher doses (2 g or more). Rectal 5-ASA is also an effective maintenance therapy for distal ulcerative colitis. There are randomized controlled trials evaluating once daily dosing with all the major 5-ASA formulations, and systematic reviews confirm that once daily dosing is as effective as divided dosing regimens. In community surveys, 5-ASA adherence is a major problem, and some studies suggest that simplified dosing regimens are associated with better adherence. Therefore, once daily dosing should be considered a standard dosing regimen for all 5-ASA use.

- **Formulation considerations**: In an evaluation of data from Cochrane analyses, there were no differences between the various 5-ASA formulations in terms of efficacy, confirmed in the most recent Cochrane analysis. There is little to choose between the different formulations of 5-ASA in terms of efficacy. The best drug should be selected by taking into account patient preference for formulation, such as granules or tablets, and tablet size and number.

### Health-related quality of life and work-related outcomes for patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis and remission status following short-term and long-term treatment with multimatrix mesalamine: A prospective, open-label study [^113Ans9F]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Patients who completed the full course of induction treatment and achieved partial or complete remission were eligible for enrollment in the maintenance treatment period, during which they received 2.4 g/day of multimatrix mesalamine once daily. Patients' remission status at the end of the maintenance treatment period was determined using the same classification criteria previously described.

A flowchart of the trial design, including patient disposition for each treatment period, is presented in Figure 1. A total of 892 patients were screened; of these, 722 who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the trial. The induction sample included the 717 patients who took at least one dose of multimatrix mesalamine and had at least one post-dose efficacy assessment during the induction treatment period. The final induction period visit occurred at eight weeks for patients who completed the full course of treatment or at the early withdrawal visit for patients who did not complete treatment. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures were administered at post-screening baseline and at the final induction period visit.

- **Flowchart for disposition of trial patients**: The efficacy population within each period was defined as all patients who took at least one dose of the investigational product and had at least one post-dose efficacy assessment during that period. The specific adverse events experienced by patients in this study have been detailed elsewhere.

### Delayed-release oral mesalamine at 4.8 g/day (800 mg tablet) for the treatment of moderately active ulcerative colitis: the ASCEND II trial [^117SzL6Y]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Preliminary data have shown that delayed-release oral mesalamine (Asacol) dosed at 4.8 g/day provides an additional efficacy benefit compared to 1.6 g/day in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Additionally, Asacol dosed at 2.4 g/day has been proven to be more effective than 1.6 g/day. However, whether 4.8 g/day of mesalamine (dosed with an investigational 800 mg tablet) is more effective than Asacol 2.4 g/day (dosed with a 400 mg tablet) in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis is unknown.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (ASCEND II) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 4.8 g/day of mesalamine in adults with active ulcerative colitis. Three hundred eighty-six patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis were randomized for treatment with mesalamine 2.4 g/day (400 mg tablet) or 4.8 g/day (800 mg tablet) for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy population consisted of 268 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis treated with 2.4 g/day (n = 139) or 4.8 g/day (n = 129). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in each treatment group that achieved overall improvement ("treatment success", defined as either complete remission or a clinical response to therapy) from baseline at week 6.

- **Results**: Seventy-two percent of patients receiving 4.8 g/day of mesalamine for moderately active ulcerative colitis (89/124 patients) achieved treatment success at week 6, compared with 59% of those who received 2.4 g/day (77/130 patients) (p = 0.036). Both regimens were well tolerated.
