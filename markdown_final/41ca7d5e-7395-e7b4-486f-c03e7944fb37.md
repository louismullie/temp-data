## Question

does vancomycin always need to be monitored via blood for concentration?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vancomycin always needs to be monitored via blood for concentration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope of "vancomycin" and whether this refers to intravenous therapy for serious infections versus oral therapy or brief empiric use. Then, I should verify what major guidelines actually recommend for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) across populations. Next, I will examine exceptions where routine TDM may not be necessary. After that, I should review the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic rationale for AUC-guided monitoring and the risks of not monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats and monitoring frequencies where applicable [^02dbccaf] [^fe5065c5].

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't overgeneralize. When clinicians ask about "monitoring vancomycin", they usually mean intravenous vancomycin for serious infections such as MRSA bacteremia, pneumonia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or meningitis, where PK/PD targets matter for efficacy and nephrotoxicity risk is nontrivial; this is the focus of the 2020 ASHP/IDSA/PIDS/SIDP consensus and the 2020 Chinese TDM guideline, and it is distinct from oral vancomycin for C. difficile, which is not systemically absorbed and does not require serum level monitoring [^a6a55354] [^e28522db] [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the core recommendation before drawing conclusions. The 2020 ASHP/IDSA/PIDS/SIDP consensus recommends AUC-guided monitoring for serious MRSA infections, targeting a daily AUC of 400–600 mg·h/L assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L, and explicitly advises against relying on trough-only monitoring for serious infections; this is a strong, evidence-informed shift from the older trough-centric approach [^1c13af1e] [^085fd869] [^6122f2fd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "always". I need to check where guidelines allow exceptions. For short-course empiric vancomycin (≤ 3–5 days) in patients with stable renal function, especially when cultures rule out MRSA and therapy is stopped, routine TDM may be omitted; similarly, some clinicians omit early TDM in noncritical patients with stable renal function receiving standard dosing, though this is a judgment call rather than a blanket endorsement, and many hospitals still monitor after 3–5 days by default [^02dbccaf] [^fbb5166f].

> I should confirm the pharmacologic rationale so the recommendation isn't arbitrary. Vancomycin exhibits time-dependent bactericidal activity best indexed by the AUC/MIC ratio; maintaining AUC/MIC ≥ 400 improves bacterial kill and reduces resistance risk, whereas excessive exposure (AUC > 600–650) increases nephrotoxicity, which is why AUC-guided dosing balances efficacy and safety better than trough-only targets of 15–20 mg/L that overexpose many patients [^0b6435f4] [^39bee59f] [^6122f2fd].

> Next, I should review special populations where monitoring is especially critical. In pediatrics, neonates, obesity, critical illness, unstable renal function, and intermittent hemodialysis, interindividual PK variability is high and guidelines recommend AUC-guided monitoring with early sampling and dose adjustment; in these groups, failing to monitor risks underexposure or nephrotoxicity and is not advised [^ec371506] [^022e6537] [^a72edf03] [^e7cdf8af] [^77845c45].

> But wait, what if someone argues that oral vancomycin needs levels too? I should double-check that. Oral vancomycin for C. difficile is not systemically absorbed, so serum level monitoring is not indicated; the FDA labeling and infectious diseases practice do not recommend serum TDM for oral vancomycin, which resolves that potential confusion [^826d0d6d] [^notfound].

> I will now examine the balance of benefits and burdens to ensure the recommendation is practical. Observational data show AUC-guided monitoring is associated with less AKI than trough-only strategies, and cost analyses suggest AUC-guided approaches can be implemented without increasing total costs; conversely, not monitoring risks prolonged subtherapeutic exposure and delayed attainment of targets, particularly in critically ill or obese patients [^4281bc6b] [^0c87d09e] [^4f9c6639].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. No, vancomycin does not absolutely require blood level monitoring in every single scenario; however, for intravenous vancomycin used to treat serious infections, major guidelines recommend AUC-guided therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity, with the clearest exceptions being very short empiric courses (≤ 3–5 days) in patients with stable renal function when therapy is promptly discontinued if MRSA is not confirmed; in pediatrics, obesity, critical illness, renal instability, and dialysis, monitoring is especially important and should not be omitted [^1c13af1e] [^02dbccaf] [^fe5065c5].

> Finally, I should confirm practical monitoring cadence so the clinician can act. For serious MRSA infections, obtain an initial AUC assessment within the first 24–48 hours when feasible using Bayesian estimation or two concentrations, then adjust to maintain AUC 400–600 mg·h/L; in stable inpatients, reassess every 3–5 days or with changes in renal function, and in OPAT, monitor about weekly; in intermittent hemodialysis, monitor predialysis levels and adjust per session dosing to maintain therapeutic exposure, recognizing that predialysis targets of 10–20 mg/L often yield AUCs below 400–600 and require individualized adjustment [^14fa098f] [^02dbccaf] [^fe5065c5] [^04eb5525] [^77845c45].

Vancomycin **does not always require routine blood level monitoring** [^02dbccaf]. For short-term therapy (≤ 3–5 days) in patients with stable renal function and no high-risk features, monitoring is often unnecessary [^02dbccaf]. However, **monitoring is essential** for patients with unstable renal function, critical illness, obesity, or those receiving high doses or prolonged therapy (> 3–5 days) [^02dbccaf] [^a72edf03]. Current guidelines favor AUC-guided monitoring (target AUC/MIC 400–600) [^6122f2fd] over trough-only monitoring to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity risk [^1c13af1e] [^085fd869]. Routine monitoring is also recommended for outpatient parenteral therapy [^fe5065c5] and in pediatrics, especially with renal impairment or high doses [^ec371506] [^c0e19103].

---

## Indications for vancomycin level monitoring

Vancomycin level monitoring is **not universally required**; indications depend on patient-specific factors, infection severity, and treatment duration [^02dbccaf]. The following scenarios **warrant monitoring**:

- **Unstable renal function**: Patients with fluctuating renal function require close monitoring due to altered drug clearance and increased nephrotoxicity risk [^02dbccaf] [^b6228366].

- **Critical illness**: Hemodynamically unstable patients or those in the ICU often have altered pharmacokinetics, necessitating frequent monitoring [^02dbccaf] [^e4aa388a].

- **High-dose or prolonged therapy**: Patients receiving high doses (> 4 g/day) or prolonged therapy (> 3–5 days) should be monitored to avoid nephrotoxicity and ensure therapeutic exposure [^02dbccaf] [^39bee59f].

- **Obesity**: Obese patients have altered pharmacokinetics, making accurate dosing and monitoring crucial [^a72edf03] [^aa4e3631].

- **Pediatric patients**: Children, especially those with renal impairment or receiving high doses, require monitoring due to developmental pharmacokinetic differences [^ec371506] [^c0e19103].

- **Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT)**: Regular monitoring is recommended throughout the OPAT course [^fe5065c5] [^928c8a9f].

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Recent guidelines from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists (SIDP) recommend **AUC-guided monitoring** over traditional trough-only monitoring [^1c13af1e]. The **target AUC/MIC ratio** is 400–600 mg·h/L, assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L [^6122f2fd]. This approach aims to optimize efficacy while minimizing nephrotoxicity [^4281bc6b].

---

## Situations where monitoring may not be necessary

Routine vancomycin level monitoring may not be necessary in the following scenarios:

- **Short-term therapy**: Patients receiving vancomycin for ≤ 3–5 days with stable renal function and no high-risk features may not require routine monitoring [^02dbccaf].

- **Non-severe infections**: Patients with uncomplicated infections, stable renal function, and no significant comorbidities may not need routine monitoring [^02dbccaf].

- **Oral vancomycin**: Oral vancomycin used for Clostridioides difficile infection is not systemically absorbed, so serum level monitoring is not required [^notfound].

---

## Risks associated with inadequate monitoring

Failure to monitor vancomycin levels appropriately can lead to **subtherapeutic exposure**, increasing the risk of treatment failure and resistance [^0b6435f4] [^61496270]. Conversely, excessive exposure increases the risk of **nephrotoxicity** and ototoxicity [^b6228366] [^39bee59f].

---

## Alternative monitoring strategies

Bayesian-guided dosing using population pharmacokinetic models is an emerging strategy that allows accurate AUC estimation with minimal sampling [^2d591377]. This approach is **particularly useful in critically ill patients** and those with altered pharmacokinetics [^ebc1f478].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Monitoring recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Short-term therapy (≤ 3–5 days), stable renal function, no high-risk features | No | Low risk of toxicity or subtherapeutic exposure |
| Unstable renal function, critical illness, high-dose or prolonged therapy, obesity, pediatrics, OPAT | Yes | Increased risk of toxicity or subtherapeutic exposure |
| Oral vancomycin for C. difficile | No | No systemic absorption |

---

Vancomycin **does not always require routine blood level monitoring** [^02dbccaf]. Monitoring is essential in high-risk patients or prolonged therapy, whereas short-term therapy in stable patients may not necessitate routine monitoring. AUC-guided monitoring is preferred to balance efficacy and safety [^1c13af1e].

Background

Clinical practice guidelines or recommendations often require timely and regular updating as new evidence emerges, because this can alter the risk-benefit trade-off. The scientific process of developing and updating guidelines accompanied by adequate implementation can improve outcomes. To promote better management of patients receiving vancomycin therapy, we updated the guideline for the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of vancomycin published in 2015.

Methods

Our updated recommendations complied with standards for developing trustworthy guidelines, including timeliness and rigor of the updating process, as well as the use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We also followed the methodology handbook published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the Spanish National Health System.

Results

We partially updated the 2015 guideline. Apart from adults, the updated guideline also focuses on pediatric patients and neonates requiring intravenous vancomycin therapy. The guideline recommendations involve a broadened range of patients requiring TDM, modified index of TDM (both 24-hour area under the curve and trough concentration), addition regarding the necessity and timing of repeated TDM, and initial dose for specific subpopulations. Overall, 1 recommendation was deleted and 3 recommendations were modified. Eleven new recommendations were added, and no recommendation was made for 2 clinical questions.

Conclusions

We updated an evidence-based guideline regarding the TDM of vancomycin using a rigorous and multidisciplinary approach. The updated guideline provides more comprehensive recommendations to inform rational and optimized vancomycin use and is thus of greater applicability.

### Vancomycin advanced therapeutic drug monitoring: exercise in futility or virtuous endeavor to improve drug efficacy and safety? [^fbb5166f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin is commonly prescribed to hospitalized patients. Decades of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic research culminated in recommendations to monitor the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to the minimum inhibitory concentration in order to optimize vancomycin exposure and minimize toxicity in the revised 2020 guidelines. These guideline recommendations are based on limited data without high-quality evidence and limitations in strength. Despite considerable effort placed on vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), clinicians should recognize that the majority of vancomycin use is empiric. Most patients prescribed empiric vancomycin do not require it beyond a few days. For these patients, AUC determinations during the initial days of vancomycin exposure are futile. This added workload may detract from high-level patient care activities. Loading doses likely achieve AUC targets, so AUC monitoring after a loading dose is largely unnecessary for broad application. The excessive vancomycin TDM for decades has been propagated with limitations in evidence, and it should raise caution on contemporary vancomycin TDM recommendations.

Vancomycin monitoring — Vancomycin blood levels should be measured regularly throughout the course of OPAT treatment (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). The optimal frequency of measurement is undefined, but the current practice in the setting of stable renal function is once weekly.

### Should therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve Be standard for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections?-No [^d177bfb7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In this counterpoint we critically appraise the evidence supporting therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We reveal methodologically weaknesses and inconsistencies in the data and suggest that, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of benefit compared with modestly reducing trough targets, alternative strategies are more likely to result in superior safety and efficacy. These include focusing on fundamental antibiotic stewardship to limit vancomycin exposure overall, achieving earlier and more complete source control, and establishing alternative therapeutic options to vancomycin. Implementation of AUC24-based therapeutic drug monitoring will take resources away from these more promising, alternative solutions.

Vancomycin concentration sampling around hemodialysis — blood sampling for assessment of vancomycin concentrations should not occur during or for at least 2 hours after a hemodialysis treatment because concentrations will be low immediately following dialysis and rebound over the next few hours as drug redistributes.

Vancomycin loading dose administration and infusion parameters indicate that providing loading doses of 20 to 35 mg/kg based on actual body weight rapidly achieves targeted serum concentrations and reduces early subtherapeutic levels. Vancomycin should be administered in a dilute solution with concentrations of no more than 5 mg/mL and infused over not less than 60 minutes or at 10 to 15 mg/min, and an infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events. Loading doses of 25 to 35 mg/kg will require infusion times of at least 2 to 3 hours, and after completion of the loading dose the maintenance dose should begin at the next dosing interval, for example starting 6 hours after the start of the loading dose when the interval is every 6 hours.

Pediatric patients — primary recommendations for vancomycin dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring include a daily dose ceiling and conditional consideration of loading doses. Most children generally should not require more than 3,000 mg/day. Loading doses among the nonobese pediatric population may be considered. The guideline uses minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) terminology to frame exposure targets.

Transition to AUC/MIC monitoring — targeting and timing states that clinicians should conservatively target AUC values for suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections assuming a vancomycin broth microdilution (BMD) minimum inhibitory concentration (MICBMD) of 1 mg/L or less, that targeted exposure should be achieved early preferably within the first 24 to 48 hours (A-II), and that Bayesian-derived AUC monitoring may be prudent because it does not require steady-state serum vancomycin concentrations for early assessment.

### What proportion of vancomycin trough levels are drawn too early? frequency and impact on clinical actions [^2f7f4069]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough levels are recommended to predict vancomycin efficacy, and inaccurate levels may lead to inappropriate clinical actions. However, the frequency of timing errors and associated clinical impact is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed vancomycin levels (n = 2,597) measured during 13 months at a large academic medical center. Of the specimens, 41.3% were drawn too early. These samples yielded significantly higher average ± SD vancomycin concentrations than correctly timed samples (22.1 ± 11.7 mg/L vs 15.5 mg/L ± 8.6 mg/L; P < .001), and, consequently, clinicians were more likely to decrease, discontinue, or hold a patient's vancomycin dose (25.6% vs 21.4%; P < .02) or repeat the vancomycin level (29.2% vs 20.0%; P < .001). A substantial proportion of specimens collected to assess vancomycin efficacy were drawn too early, leading to overestimation of patients' true trough level and possible underdosing of vancomycin or a high rate of repeat tests for vancomycin.

Vancomycin guideline revision — scope and exclusions: the consensus revision "evaluates the current scientific data and controversies associated with vancomycin dosing and serum concentration monitoring for serious MRSA infections (including but not limited to bacteremia, sepsis, infective endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and meningitis)" and, "Due to a lack of data to guide appropriate targets, the development of this guideline excluded evaluation of vancomycin for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and other pathogens".

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Serious MRSA infections — daily vancomycin area under the curve (AUC) values (assuming a minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] of 1 mg/L) should be maintained between 400 and 600 mg·h/L to minimize the likelihood of nephrotoxicity and maximize efficacy; once invasive MRSA is ruled out by culture or clinical presentation, empiric vancomycin at guideline-recommended exposures should be de-escalated by decreasing vancomycin exposure or initiating alternative antibiotics, and extrapolation of these recommendations to noninvasive MRSA and other pathogens should be viewed with extreme caution.

Therapeutic monitoring practices — historically, monitoring centered on maintaining trough concentrations between 15 and 20 mg/L for serious infections due to MRSA, with previous expert guidelines recommending trough concentrations as a surrogate marker for the AUC/MIC ratio due to the historical difficulty in estimating AUC in clinical practice, and the guideline viewed trough-directed dosing as a more practical alternative to AUC/MIC-guided dosing in clinical practice.

Vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — Given the narrow vancomycin AUC range for therapeutic effect and minimal acute kidney injury (AKI) risk, the most accurate and optimal way to manage vancomycin dosing should be through AUC-guided dosing and monitoring (A-II). We recommend to accomplish this in one of two ways. One approach relies on the collection of 2 concentrations obtained near steady-state — a postdistributional peak concentration at 1 to 2 hours after infusion and a trough concentration at the end of the dosing interval — and utilizing first-order pharmacokinetic (PK) equations to estimate the AUC (A-II). It is also highly preferred that concentrations are collected near steady-state conditions.

Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring in adults — 2009 guideline core recommendations emphasized pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets and trough surrogates: the primary recommendations "consisted of eliminating routine monitoring of serum peak concentrations, emphasizing a range of area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) of ≥ 400 as the primary PK/PD predictor of vancomycin activity", and also "promoting serum trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L as a surrogate marker for the optimal vancomycin AUC/MIC if the MIC was ≤ 1 mg/L in patients with normal renal function"; additionally, the guideline "recommended, albeit with limited data support, that actual body weight be used to determine the vancomycin dosage and loading doses for severe infections in patients who were seriously ill".

Vancomycin MIC assumptions and dosing — under most circumstances of empiric dosing, the vancomycin MIC should be assumed to be 1 mg/L. When the MICBMD is > 1 mg/L, the probability of achieving an AUC/MIC target of ≥ 400 is low with conventional dosing; higher doses may risk unnecessary toxicity, and the decision to change therapy should be based on clinical judgment. In addition, when the MICBMD is ≤ 1 mg/L, we do not recommend decreasing the dose to achieve the AUC/MIC target, and limitations in automated susceptibility testing methods include the lack of precision and variability in MIC results depending on method used (B-II).

### Limitations of vancomycin in the management of resistant staphylococcal infections [^e842143b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and has been widely used in the past few years. However, several recent reports have highlighted the limitations of vancomycin, and its role in the management of serious infections is now being reconsidered. Vancomycin treatment failure rates are associated with an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration as well as a decrease in the rate of bacterial killing. The intrinsic limitations of vancomycin also include poor tissue penetration, particularly in the lung; relatively slow bacterial killing; and the potential for toxicity. In addition, intermediate-level vancomycin resistance has emerged among staphylococci, as have rare cases of fully resistant strains. Because of these problems, when using vancomycin, it is probably prudent to carefully establish the diagnosis, test for antimicrobial susceptibility, and monitor serum trough concentrations to ensure adequate dosing.

Guideline on vancomycin monitoring — For neonates and infants up to 3 months old, doses recommended to achieve an AUC of 400 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L) range from 10 to 20 mg/kg every 8 to 48 hours, depending on postmenstrual age, weight, and SCr (A-II). AUC-guided therapeutic dosing and monitoring, preferably with Bayesian estimation, can best achieve the target vancomycin exposure likely to be required for a successful outcome of treatment for a MRSA infection for all neonates, regardless of gestational and chronological age.

Vancomycin pediatric renal impairment — dose adjustment and monitoring are supported by pharmacokinetic data: Vancomycin requires dosage adjustment in children with acute or chronic renal insufficiency. In a Bayesian population analysis of 63 case-control pairs with 319 concentrations (mean age 13 [SD, 6] years), a vancomycin dosage of 45 mg/kg/day (15 mg/kg every 8 hours) in renally impaired children achieved AUC exposure similar to 60 mg/kg/day in children with normal renal function, and in 87% of children with initial renal impairment vancomycin clearance improved within the first 5 days of therapy. Because vancomycin clearance does not always correlate well with renal function and renal function may return rapidly after ICU admission, therapeutic monitoring of both serum concentrations and renal function should be conducted during vancomycin therapy.

### A moving target-vancomycin therapeutic monitoring [^f352587d]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been a common practice to optimize efficacy and safety of vancomycin. While vancomycin trough-only TDM has widely been integrated into pediatric clinical practice since 2009, recently updated vancomycin TDM guidelines published in March 2020 recommend area under the curve (AUC) based TDM for vancomycin instead of trough-only TDM. In this review, we discuss the rationale behind the change in TDM recommendations, describe two approaches for calculating vancomycin AUC in clinical practice, and address considerations for integrating vancomycin AUC TDM into pediatric clinical practice. Our primary goal is to provide pediatric clinicians with a resource for implementing vancomycin AUC monitoring into clinical care.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin in serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — AUC-based targets and MIC considerations state that daily AUC values (assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L) should be maintained between 400 and 600 mg·h/L to maximize efficacy and minimize the likelihood of acute kidney injury (AKI). MIC utility is limited because the BMD MIC90 in most institutions is 1 mg/L or less, measurement is imprecise with dilution of ± 1 log and a variation of 10% to 20% considered acceptable, and results are typically not available within the first 72 hours even though the vancomycin AUC/MIC ratio needs to be optimized early in infection; additionally, trough-only monitoring may be insufficient to guide dosing in all patients.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Bayesian-derived AUC monitoring for vancomycin — dose optimization uses Bayesian software with minimal pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling to estimate AUC and provide AUC-guided dosing recommendations in real time, for example using 1 or 2 vancomycin concentrations, or alternatively using 2 concentrations (peak and trough) with simple analytic PK equations. The Bayesian method uses a vancomycin population PK model as the prior together with the patient's observed drug concentrations to calculate a Bayesian posterior, allows concentrations to be collected within the first 24 to 48 hours rather than after the third or fourth dose to enable adaptive feedback control, and can support front-loading doses with subsequent transition to a lower maintenance regimen to rapidly achieve target concentrations within the first 24 to 48 hours among critically ill patients; programs are now readily available and can be used in real time to identify the optimal vancomycin dosage that achieves the AUC target (assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L).

Serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — For patients with suspected or definite serious MRSA infections, an individualized target of the AUC/MICBMD ratio of 400 to 600 (assuming a vancomycin MICBMD of 1 mg/L) should be advocated to achieve clinical efficacy while improving patient safety (A-II). Doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg (based on actual body weight) administered every 8 to 12 hours as an intermittent infusion are recommended for most patients with normal renal function assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L (A-II), and these doses may not achieve the therapeutic AUC/MIC target when the MIC is 2 mg/L.

Pediatric obesity — vancomycin dosing and monitoring recommendations state that obese children are likely to have vancomycin exposures that may be statistically greater than those in normal-weight children when doses are calculated on a mg/kg basis, but these differences are not known to be of sufficient clinical importance to suggest different mg/kg empiric vancomycin dosages in obese children at this time; obese children < 12 years old, compared with those ≥ 12 years, may require a higher mg/kg dose (B-II). Therapeutic monitoring is likely to be of particular value in obese children, both for therapeutic response and the risk of AKI; the specific recommendations for therapeutic monitoring in nonobese children may also apply for obese children (B-II). A loading dose of 20 mg/kg by total body weight is recommended in obese children (A-III).

### Attainment of therapeutic vancomycin level within the first 24 h: authors' response [^a8aaa8bf]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In sepsis, time is life. However, time is not the only variable of the complex equation of antibiotic therapy; the dose of antibiotic administered needs to be adequate. Subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations potentially lead to decreased microbial killing, treatment failure, and emergence of resistance and/or increased mortality. Early therapeutic drug monitoring and timely dose optimization, ideally during the first 24 h, minimize the likelihood of subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations and ineffective antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin remains a first-line option for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Of note, vancomycin is one of the antibiotics with the highest likelihood of under dosing. Continuous infusion (CI), after adequate loading dose (LD), seems to have pharmacological advantages in the critically ill and enables more consistent achievement of therapeutic exposures.

Vancomycin monitoring — key evidence gaps in the 2009 recommendations included insufficient data for multiple populations and strategies, as the guideline noted that adequate data were not available for "pediatric patients outside of the neonatal age group", for "the morbidly obese patient population and patients with renal failure, including specific dialysis dosage adjustments", for "prolonged or continuous infusion IV vancomycin therapy", and for safety with dosages that "exceed 3 g per day", and that "there were minimal to no data on the safety and efficacy of targeted trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L".

Recent clinical data on vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest a reevaluation of current dosing and monitoring recommendations. The previous 2009 vancomycin consensus guidelines recommend trough monitoring as a surrogate marker for the target area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). However, recent data suggest that trough monitoring is associated with higher nephrotoxicity. This document is an executive summary of the new vancomycin consensus guidelines for vancomycin dosing and monitoring. It was developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists vancomycin consensus guidelines committee. These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400–600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

Pediatric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) vancomycin dosing based on area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) is anchored to an AUC target of 400 mg·h/L (but potentially up to 600 mg·h/L), assuming a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≤ 1 mg/L, and the initial recommended dosage for children with normal renal function and suspected serious MRSA infections is 60 to 80 mg/kg/day in divided doses given every 6 hours for children ages 3 months to less than 12 years, or 60 to 70 mg/kg/day in divided doses given every 6 to 8 hours for those ≥ 12 years old (A-II). The maximum empiric daily dose is usually 3,600 mg in children with adequate renal function (C-III), most children generally should not require more than 3,000 mg/day, and doses should be adjusted based on observed concentrations to achieve the AUC/MIC target; early monitoring of observed concentrations is recommended when doses exceed 2,000 to 3,000 mg/day (A-II), and close monitoring of observed concentrations and renal function is prudent in patients with poor or augmented renal clearance, as resolution of their renal function abnormalities may occur within the first 5 days of therapy.

Vancomycin loading doses in pediatrics — preliminary evidence: Loading doses of 25 to 30 mg/kg for critically ill adults have been suggested to achieve steady-state concentrations more quickly, but preliminary data on pediatric patients suggest that the benefit of a loading dose of 30 mg/kg is quickly lost if the maintenance dose is insufficient to provide adequate ongoing exposure. The concept of a loading dose accompanied by a daily maintenance dose sufficient to achieve the target exposure and initiated at a specified time after the loading dose should be investigated.

### The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin [^8b20a82a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is one of only a few antibiotics available to treat patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. Therefore, understanding the clinical implications of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin is a necessity for clinicians. Vancomycin is a concentration-independent antibiotic (also referred to as a "time-dependent" antibiotic), and there are factors that affect its clinical activity, including variable tissue distribution, inoculum size, and emerging resistance. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data related to vancomycin and discusses such clinical issues as toxicities and serum concentration monitoring.

Vancomycin monitoring in intermittent hemodialysis — area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) guidance states that efficacy data are unavailable for AUC values of < 400 mg·h/L; monitoring based on predialysis serum concentrations and extrapolating these values to estimated AUC is most practical, maintaining predialysis concentrations between 15 and 20 mg/L to achieve the AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L in the previous 24 hours (C-III), and predialysis serum concentration monitoring should be performed not less than weekly and should drive subsequent dosing, with the recommended doses providing a useful starting point until serum concentrations have been determined (B-II).

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^5fe6ff9c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Recently, a revised consensus guideline and review on therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious MRSA infections was published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the IDSA, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists. This consensus revision evaluates the current scientific data and controversies associated with vancomycin dosing and serum concentration monitoring for serious MRSA infections (including but not limited to bacteremia, sepsis, infective endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and meningitis) and provides new recommendations based on recent available evidence.

Oral antibiotic administration has been shown to decrease the cost and length of hospitalization. The general guidance for the timing of intravenous-to-oral switching of antibiotics provided the gastrointestinal tract is functional, includes defervescence and clinical improvement with or without improvement in laboratory markers. Numerous antibiotics with high oral bioavailability can be considered for switching, and the switch need not be to the same agent. Many serious infections can now be treated successfully with partial oral antibiotic therapy. However, the switch to oral antibiotics should not lead to an antibiotic therapy which is longer than that used for parenteral therapy. Actually, it is increasingly evident that prescribing oral antibiotics could influence gut microbiome dynamics, promoting more strongly AMR.

Initiating, as soon as possible, targeted treatment based on the results of culture and susceptibility testing

Microbiologic tests play a crucial role in selecting targeted antibiotic therapy. This testing allows clinicians to tailor the spectrum of the antibiotic, broadening if the initial choice was too narrow, but more commonly narrowing an empiric regimen spectrum that was too broad, known as de-escalation. Antibiotic therapy reassessment based on microbiologic culture and susceptibility testing supports ASP and is associated with improved outcomes in severe infections.

The de-escalation tactic involves transitioning from a broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic regimen to a narrower-spectrum regimen, or reducing the number of antibiotics used in combination therapy, or to monotherapy. The rationale of de-escalation is to avoid broad-spectrum antibiotics whenever possible, diminishing selection pressure and ultimately the prevalence of MDR bacteria, but the practice is controversial as data are scant. The data are strongest for patients with VAP, with higher survival rates reported in several studies, obtaining sputum samples before antibiotic administration is a crucial facet to make de-escalation possible. De-escalation has been embraced as part of ASP.

Vancomycin monitoring indications and frequency recommend monitoring for patients receiving vancomycin for serious MRSA infections to achieve sustained targeted AUC values assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L unless it is known to be greater or less than 1 mg/L by BMD; monitoring is also recommended for patients at high risk for nephrotoxicity, those with unstable renal function, and those receiving prolonged therapy (more than 3 to 5 days), and we suggest the frequency be based on clinical judgment with frequent or daily monitoring for hemodynamically unstable patients and once-weekly monitoring for hemodynamically stable patients (B-II).

Vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — Bayesian approach specifies that the preferred approach to monitor area under the curve (AUC) uses Bayesian software with a pharmacokinetic (PK) model and collection of 1 or 2 vancomycin concentrations with at least 1 trough; it is preferred to obtain 2 PK samples at 1 to 2 hours post infusion and at end of the dosing interval to estimate the AUC with the Bayesian approach (A-I), and a trough concentration alone may be sufficient to estimate the AUC in some patients though further data are needed across populations (B-II).

### Neonatal vancomycin continuous infusion: still a confusion? [^a69906e2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous infusions of vancomycin over 24 hours have been shown in adults to reduce drug toxicity, lower treatment costs and require fewer blood samples for therapeutic drug monitoring. They may also improve clinical outcome through earlier attainment of target drug concentrations. In neonates, there is no consensus on vancomycin dosing. We reviewed the literature to assess the evidence for vancomycin dosing regimens for continuous infusion in neonates.

Methods

Medline and Embase were searched for studies about continuous vancomycin dosing regimens in neonates that reported serum drug concentrations. The search identified 469 articles, of which 5 were relevant.

Results

Five prospective studies were included; 2 studies used non-linear mixed effects modeling. Vancomycin was administered with parenteral nutrition or 5% dextrose. Target serum concentrations varied (range: 10–30 mg/L). Four studies used loading doses before continuous infusion; only 1 documented achievement of therapeutic concentrations after the load. The time to a therapeutic concentration was not reported for the other studies. Attainment of target concentrations ranged from 56% to 89% of measurements. Only 1 study compared intermittent to continuous infusions, reporting higher attainment of target concentrations with continuous dosing (82% vs. 46%). No adverse effects were reported, although 3 neonates developed a reversible raised serum creatinine in the setting of septicemia.

Conclusion

Continuous infusions of vancomycin in neonates are well tolerated, require less blood sampling and may result in improved attainment of target concentrations. Further prospective studies are needed in this population.

### Microbiological features of vancomycin in the 21st century: minimum inhibitory concentration creep, bactericidal / static activity, and applied breakpoints to predict clinical outcomes or detect resistant strains [^6dbed7b4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The results of vancomycin susceptibility tests document that the drug continues to have activity against a wide variety of gram-positive pathogens. The subsequent emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, the persistent failure of vancomycin therapy against strains tested as susceptible, and the more recent discoveries of vancomycin-intermediate or -resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains have compromised the use of vancomycin. Although analyses of surveillance studies fail to demonstrate "minimum inhibitory concentration creep" among populations of wild-type enterococci, streptococci, or staphylococci, enterococci with acquired resistance to vancomycin continue to evolve. The dominantly used automated commercial tests poorly recognize vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus, heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus isolates, which necessitates the use of expensive supplemental screening tests. Monitoring for appropriate serum levels of vancomycin and determinations of the bactericidal activity of vancomycin appear to best predict clinical outcome, thus creating additional diagnostic burdens for clinical laboratories. Improvements in current test methods with breakpoint criteria and expanded use of the vancomycin bactericidal assays to detect "tolerant" strains will be required to increase the value of vancomycin treatment or to refocus therapy toward the use of newer, alternative agents.

### Trough concentrations of vancomycin: adult therapeutic targets are not appropriate for children [^65cfaeef]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the need for effective vancomycin therapy, there are few data guiding vancomycin monitoring in children. We reviewed retrospectively vancomycin use in children 1 month to 12 years of age. Initial and adjusted target trough vancomycin concentrations in serum were infrequently achieved regardless of the dosing schedule. Currently recommended trough concentrations need to be re-examined with a more detailed pharmacokinetic study in children.

Trough-only vancomycin monitoring — practice change indicates that trough-only monitoring with a target of 15 to 20 mg/L is no longer recommended for patients with serious infections due to MRSA (A-II), and there is insufficient evidence to recommend trough-only versus AUC-guided monitoring among patients with noninvasive MRSA or other infections.

### Vancomycin-induced neutropenia: is it dose-or duration-related? [^0cdca925]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the literature to determine whether vancomycin-induced neutropenia is dose- or duration-related and provide clinicians with feasible treatment alternatives.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed (1949-November 2010), MEDLINE (1950-November 2010), EMBASE (1980-November 2010), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-November 2010) was performed using the terms vancomycin, neutropenia, and leukopenia. Citations from publications were reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies and case reports were included if they reported neutropenia with vancomycin administration and excluded if they did not describe vancomycin dosages and/or concentrations, or if neutropenia resolved while the patient was still receiving vancomycin. Cases with significant confounders and those in which authors provided minimal information about patients were also excluded.

Data Synthesis

Seven retrospective chart reviews (ie, case series) and 33 case reports were identified. Of these, 3 retrospective reviews and 26 case reports met inclusion criteria. To our knowledge, no prospective studies have assessed this clinical complication. Data suggest that vancomycin-induced neutropenia may not be completely related to daily dosages, total cumulative dosage, or supratherapeutic vancomycin concentrations. Furthermore, evidence suggests that neutropenia is more likely associated with therapy longer than 7 days, with the majority of episodes occurring beyond 20 days of therapy. Given these findings, a practical approach is to monitor white blood cell (WBC) count with a differential (including absolute neutrophil count) once a week in patients who are receiving vancomycin for more than 7 days.

Conclusions

Vancomycin-induced neutropenia is most likely associated with prolonged vancomycin exposure. Patients receiving vancomycin for longer than 7 days should have WBC count, differential, monitored weekly. Vancomycin should be discontinued if there is a high clinical suspicion of it causing neutropenia, and an alternative agent should be initiated. Prospective case-controlled studies are needed to better characterize this adverse event.

Obese adults — vancomycin dosing and AUC monitoring is addressed with specific thresholds and monitoring guidance. Empiric maintenance doses for most obese patients usually do not exceed 4,500 mg/day (B-II), and early and frequent monitoring of AUC exposure is recommended for dose adjustment, especially when empiric doses exceed 4,000 mg/day (A-II). Measurement of peak and trough concentrations is recommended to improve the accuracy of vancomycin AUC estimation and maintenance dose optimization in obese patients, aligning with recommendations 2 and 5 for nonobese adults.

Vancomycin AUC/MIC exposure–response in MRSA bacteremia — study thresholds and outcome signals are as follows: The formula-based approach will overestimate vancomycin CL by approximately 40% to 50%, and Bayesian software programs can be used to generate accurate and reliable estimates of the daily AUC values with trough-only PK sampling. In a multicenter, observational prospective study evaluating prespecified day 2 AUC/MIC ratios — AUC/MICbroth of ≥ 320 and AUC/MICEtest of ≥ 650 — in adult patients (n = 265) with MRSA bacteremia, treatment failure rates were not significantly different between the prespecified day 2 AUC/MIC groups. Post hoc analyses suggested the best global outcome among patients in the 2 lowest AUC exposure quintiles, defined by an AUC of ≤ 515 mg·h/L, and only 20% of the study population (n = 54) had an AUC of 400 mg·h/L, leaving uncertainty about efficacy below this threshold of 400 mg·h/L. Notably, the higher AUC value cited above (515 mg·h/L) is still within the recommended AUC range of 400 to 600 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L), and MICbest value tends to be 1.5- to 2-fold higher than the MICbroth value, which can affect apparent AUC/MIC targets across methods.

Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) dosing parameters in critically ill patients commonly include a loading dose and higher daily maintenance to achieve target steady-state concentrations, with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets extrapolated rather than validated for CI. Most studies "employed a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg followed by daily maintenance infusions at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg (up to 60 mg/kg) to achieve a target steady-state concentration of 20 to 25 mg/L". By calculation, "a target steady-state concentration of 20 to 25 mg/L would equate to an AUC24/MIC of 480 to 600 (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L)". However, "the PK/PD target for CI has not been validated", and available PK/PD data supporting an AUC24/MIC " > 400" as correlating with outcomes "were derived from patients who received IV vancomycin dosing". Rapid attainment of target serum concentrations "has been cited as a potential advantage of CI over II when treating acute infections".

### Questioning the design of non-inferiority trials: the strange case for therapeutic drug monitoring absence in phase III trials [^b5c80841]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

As shown by Wunderink et al. ensuring an optimized exposure of the control‐arm drug is possible. This group conducted a comparative study between linezolid and vancomycin in 448 adult patients with hospital‐acquired or healthcare‐associated Methicillin‐Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. This RCT showed the superiority of linezolid over vancomycin on clinical cure in the per‐protocol population with 57.6 vs. 46.6% of patients cured in the linezolid and vancomycin arms, respectively (P = 0.04). In this study, the vancomycin dose was adjusted based on trough concentration measurements, as recommended at the time. As a result, the vancomycin exposure was optimized with the median trough concentration being 12.3 μg/mL on day 3, increasing to 14.7 μg/mL on day 6, limiting, therefore, a possible bias due to drug low exposure. Such a design, including TDM as a tool to ensure sufficient and similar drug exposure within participants, strengthens the level of evidence of the clinical trial results. In addition, while renal failure, the main adverse drug reaction concern with vancomycin, was more frequent in patients treated with vancomycin (7.3%) when compared with patients treated with linezolid (3.7%), the rate of nephrotoxicity in the vancomycin arm appears to be relatively low in this severe population of patients (mean APACHE II score = 17). In light of recent guidelines, a TDM based on area under the curve of vancomycin might have even further optimized the treatment and further decreased the risk of renal failure. As for linezolid, there is a clear exposure–toxicity relationship, and studies showed that controlling the drug exposure allows using the drug without toxicity/discontinuation even for a prolonged duration.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) compared with intermittent infusion (II) in critically ill patients is described as potentially usable when AUC targets cannot be met, as "such regimens may be a reasonable alternative to conventional II dosing when the AUC target cannot be achieved (B-II)". For CI, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg followed by daily maintenance CI of 30 to 40 mg/kg (up to 60 mg/kg) to achieve a target steady-state concentration of 20 to 25 mg/L may be considered (B-III), and AUC24 can be simply calculated by multiplying the steady-state concentration by a factor of 24. In two comparative studies, CI reached target steady-state concentrations of 20 to 25 mg/L faster than II with mean times of 36 (SD, 31) hours vs 51 (SD, 39) hours and 16 (SD, 8) hours vs 50 (SD, 21) hours. Nephrotoxicity with CI appears to be similar or lower than with II when targeting a steady-state concentration of 15 to 25 mg/L and a trough concentration of 10 to 20 mg/L (B-II), and incompatibility concerns in the ICU require the use of independent lines or multiple catheters when CI is considered (A-III).

### Trough-guided versus AUC / MIC-guided vancomycin monitoring: a cost analysis [^0c87d09e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Recent vancomycin dosing and monitoring guidelines recommend monitoring vancomycin area under the 24-hour time-concentration curve instead of traditional trough-only monitoring. This study aimed to compare the total costs of vancomycin dosing and monitoring between trough-guided and AUC-guided approaches in a quaternary hospital from Brazil.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, patients were divided into 2 groups according to the monitoring method. Patients with previous renal impairment were excluded. Vancomycin AUC was estimated by using 2 steady-state serum concentrations and first-order kinetics equations. The primary outcome was total cost of vancomycin therapy and monitoring from the hospital perspective, which included costs of cumulative doses, laboratory fees, materials used in blood collection, nursing time for collection, and pharmacist time for result interpretation.

Findings

A total of 68 patients were included in the AUC/MIC-guided monitoring group, and 76 patients were included in the trough-guided monitoring group. There were no significant differences between groups regarding baseline serum creatinine level, duration of vancomycin therapy, and cumulative vancomycin dose. The median (interquartile range) total vancomycin drug and monitoring cost was $298.32 ($153.81-$429.85) for the AUC/MIC-guided group compared with $285.59 ($198.81-$435.57) for the trough-guided group (P = 0.9658).

Implications

Vancomycin AUC estimation using 2 steady-state serum concentrations and first-order kinetics equations is a feasible alternative for limited-resource institutions that intend to transition from a trough approach to AUC/MIC-guided monitoring.

### Appropriate use of vancomycin in a cardiac surgical unit [^5110e086]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the drug's limited therapeutic range, monitoring serum concentrations of vancomycin is essential during its administration to minimize the risk of toxicity or sub-therapeutic levels in a clinical setting. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are two of the primary side effects associated with vancomycin. In our study, vancomycin levels were monitored in 96.6% of the patients. The combination of vancomycin with other nephrotoxic medications increases the risk of nephrotoxicity. In our study, more than 72% of the patients received vancomycin in conjunction with other renally excreted antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides and β-lactam antibiotics.

Even so, there is ongoing debate regarding the monitoring of vancomycin, particularly in patients with normal renal function and uncomplicated infections. However, current guidelines indicate that monitoring serum vancomycin levels is essential for all patients receiving treatment for more than three to five days. This practice aims to reduce the risk of toxicity and achieve the target therapeutic trough level.

In our study, approximately 52.4% of the patients exhibited renal impairment, indicated by a creatinine clearance of less than 60 ml/min. Of all the patients, 97.3% had their vancomycin levels monitored. Among those who were assessed, 82.5% had values within the therapeutic range. Only 12 patients (4.2%) presented with sub-therapeutic levels, while 8 patients (2.7%) reached potentially toxic levels (Table 3). For patients treated with vancomycin over an extended length of time, a multimodal intervention to establish a vancomycin dosage and monitoring guideline greatly improved prescribing, monitoring, pharmacokinetic, and safety outcomes.

Controlling the inappropriate use of vancomycin requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary, institution-wide effort to ensure that physicians are aware of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) standards. Educational lectures for physicians that explain the IDSA guidelines, and stewardship strategies may contribute to reducing the inappropriate use of vancomycin. Additionally, a labor-intensive approach used in some institutions involves obtaining verbal consent from an infectious diseases specialist before administering vancomycin.

Study limitations

Study limitations. This study has several limitations. Firstly, the small sample size may reduce the significance of the results. Another limitation is the data sampling from only one hospital, which limits the generalizability. In addition, the retrospective design was also a limitation

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) efficacy target for vancomycin in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — an AUC/MIC ratio of ≥ 400 (with the MIC determined by broth microdilution [BMD]) is the currently accepted critical PK/PD index; in vitro and in vivo assessments indicate bactericidal activity (ie, a 1- to 2-log reduction in bacterial inoculum in the animal model) when the vancomycin AUC/MICBMD ratio approximates or exceeds 400, and in vitro data suggest that an AUC of < 400 potentiates the emergence of MRSA resistance and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus strains; in adults, an AUC/MICBMD ratio of ≥ 400 is currently considered the optimal PK/PD "efficacy" target.

Pediatric vancomycin exposure targets — dosing in children should be designed to achieve an AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L); this PK target range, specifically a range closer to an AUC/ MIC of 400 rather than 600, has been widely used by investigators to model pediatric dosing and therapeutic monitoring. With inadequate PK studies and outcomes data to support the higher end of the AUC target range in pediatrics, it is prudent to aim for an AUC/MIC of 400 in pediatrics to limit the development of exposure-related AKI. In pediatrics, an AUC/MIC target of 400 is more readily achievable than it is in adults and correlates to trough concentrations of 7 to 10 mg/L rather than concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L as are reported in adults, and this wide variability in trough concentrations between these populations with regard to achieving an AUC/ MIC of 400 corroborates the need for an AUC-guided approach to dosing and monitoring.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin therapeutic monitoring for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — adults and pediatrics: we recommend targeting an AUC/MICBMD ratio of 400 to 600 (assuming an MICBMD of 1 mg/L) for empiric dosing to maximize clinical efficacy and minimize AKI risk. Furthermore, the AUC should be therapeutically monitored using 1 or 2 postdose concentrations (ie, a peak concentration measured after the early vancomycin tissue distribution phase and a trough level measured prior to the next dose), preferably integrating the Bayesian approach. Future studies in all patient populations are necessary to address existing gaps, including efficacy data to support vancomycin use in specific patient populations (including immunocompromised and pediatric patients and patients with renal disease and obesity) and for other types of infections; efficacy data for specific pathogens, including coagulase-negative staphylococcus and Streptococcus species; robust pediatric efficacy data for MRSA and other gram-positive pathogens causing different types of serious infections; optimal loading and maintenance dosing regimens for patients with obesity and renal insufficiency; efficacy benefit and the need for a dosing algorithm (specifically incorporating a loading dose followed by maintenance infusion); and toxicodynamics of vancomycin CI in critically ill patients.

Intermittent hemodialysis — vancomycin exposure targets and dosing frequency emphasize concentration- and AUC-based goals and intradialytic losses. Predialysis vancomycin concentration to MRSA MIC ratios of > 18.6 have been associated with improved bacteremia patient outcomes. Dosing to achieve predialysis concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L results in a mean AUC24 ranging from 250 to 450 mg·h/L, and outcome studies validating the AUC24 goal of 400 to 600 mg·h/L used in other populations have not been conducted in the hemodialysis population, though this section aims to reach this AUC24 target (ie, 400–600 mg·h/L). For non-critically ill patients receiving hemodialysis, 2 or 3 days is the most common interdialytic period, and approximately 20% to 40% of an intradialytically administered dose is removed by simultaneous hemodialysis. Although the package insert states "In anuria, a dose of 1000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended", far more frequent doses are needed to maintain therapeutic serum concentrations in patients receiving hemodialysis. Consequently, maintenance vancomycin doses are recommended to be administered with each hemodialysis session to ensure therapeutic serum concentrations throughout the dosing interval.

Vancomycin pediatric dosing — trough targets and AUC/MIC attainment are characterized as follows: Retrospective non-Bayesian studies targeted trough concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L in children. In preschool-aged children 2 to 5 years old, a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day achieved the target trough in only 17%. Other cohorts required higher doses, with dosages of 70 to 80 mg/kg/day necessary to achieve trough concentrations of 10 to 20 mg/L, and dosages higher than 60 mg/kg/day necessary to achieve an AUC/MIC of ≥ 400 in children with cancer (mean age 6 [SD, 2.5] years). Separately, in children 2 to 12 years of age, a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day achieved AUC/MICss values between 386 and 583 (assuming a MICss of 1 mg/L).

### Monitoring of vancomycin serum levels for the treatment of staphylococcal infections [^0739d585]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Vancomycin serum concentrations were determined for 1,737 patients treated with either 2 × 1 g of vancomycin or 4 × 500 mg daily (780 patients), according to current nomograms, or by continuous infusion (957 patients) with a loading dose (1 g) and a total of 2–6 g daily. Trough serum concentrations were determined after 36–48 h. Adequate serum levels for the treatment of a normal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA) were observed in 81% and 20.9% of patients, respectively. The data support theoretical arguments that higher and more sustained serum levels of vancomycin, obtained by continuous infusion, may enhance clinical efficacy.

### Continuous versus intermittent vancomycin infusions in infants: a randomized controlled trial [^46790ca9]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In adults, continuous infusions of vancomycin (CIV) are associated with earlier attainment of target drug concentrations, require fewer blood samples for monitoring, and may reduce drug toxicity. We aimed to determine, in young infants, if CIV or intermittent infusions of vancomycin (IIV) better achieves target vancomycin concentrations at the first steady-state level and to compare the frequency of drug-related adverse effects.

Methods

In a multicenter randomized controlled trial in 2 tertiary neonatal units over a 40-month period, young infants aged 0 to 90 days requiring vancomycin therapy for at least 48 hours were randomly assigned to CIV and IIV.

Results

Of 111 infants randomized, 104 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups. The proportion of infants achieving target concentrations at the first steady-state level was higher for CIV compared with IIV (45 in 53 [85%] vs 21 in 51 [41%]; P < .001). Fewer dose adjustments were required in the CIV group (median 0; range 0–1) compared with the IIV group (median 1; range 0–3; P < .001). The mean daily dose required to achieve target concentrations was lower with CIV compared with IIV (40.6 [SD 10.7] vs 60.6 [SD 53.0] mg/kg per day, respectively; P = 0.01). No drug-related adverse effects occurred in either group.

Conclusions

In young infants, CIV is associated with earlier and improved attainment of target concentrations compared with IIV. Lower total daily doses are required to achieve target levels with CIV. There is no difference in the rate of drug-related adverse effects.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric vancomycin AUC-guided monitoring — AUC-guided therapeutic monitoring for vancomycin, preferably with Bayesian estimation, is suggested for all pediatric age groups based on developmental changes of vancomycin clearance (CL) documented from the newborn to the adolescent; the suggestion aligns with adults, including application of Bayesian estimation after 1 trough concentration or first-order pharmacokinetic (PK) equations with 2 concentrations (B-II). Both serum concentrations of vancomycin and renal function should be monitored since vancomycin CL and CLcr are not always well correlated in pediatrics, and aggressive dosing to maintain target AUC exposure and decrease the risk of potential acute kidney injury (AKI) in treatment of MRSA infection necessitates drug monitoring.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric patients — Vancomycin was recommended as the drug of choice for invasive MRSA infections in children, but there are limited prospective, comparative data on the value of vancomycin therapeutic monitoring in adults and virtually no prospectively collected data on outcomes of MRSA infection in newborns, infants and children; for newborns, particularly premature infants, immature renal elimination mechanisms and a relative increase in Vd by body weight complicate dosing during the first several weeks of life, and a continual maturation of glomerular filtration directly related to vancomycin CL results in glomerular filtration rate increases through the first years of life to rates in school-aged children that are greater than those in adults, with subsequent decline during the teen years to adult normal rates.

Susceptibility Test Methods

When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.

Dilution Techniques

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on dilution method1,2(broth, agar or microdilution) or equivalent using standardized inoculum and concentrations of vancomycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 1.

Diffusion Techniques

Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure2,3requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg of vancomycin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to vancomycin. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for vancomycin. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg vancomycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria in Table 1.

A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.

Quality Control

Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of the supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test. Standard vancomycin powder should provide MIC values provided below. For the diffusion technique, the 30 mcg vancomycin disk should provide the following zone diameters with the quality control strains:

### Vancomycin area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio predicting clinical outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis with pooled sensitivity and specificity [^210d29e1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vancomycin is a first-line antibiotic for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections or other Gram-positive infections. The area under the curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio is proposed as a therapeutic drug-monitoring parameter. How well clinical efficacy is predicted by this measure has not been established.

Objective

Determine the test performance characteristics (TPC) of AUC:MIC of vancomycin for prediction of positive outcome.

Data Sources

PubMed and Ovid Medline (1946 to 2018) and EMBASE (1974 to 2018). Study Eligibility Criteria and Participants: Studies of patients treated with vancomycin for any type of infection in peer reviewed publications. All patient populations were included.

Interventions

Vancomycin AUC:MIC or AUC was related to patient clinical outcome.

Methods

Searches of medical databases using relevant terms were performed. Screening, study reviewing, data extracting and assessing data quality was performed independently by two reviewers. Studies were stratified by type of primary outcome for calculation of pooled sensitivity, specificity and construction of hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves.

Results

Nineteen studies including 1699 patients were meta-analysed. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.77 (95% CI 0.67–0.84) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.53–0.71) respectively for the seven studies with primary outcome of mortality and 0.65 (95% CI 0.53–0.75), 0.58 (95% CI 0.48–0.67) for studies with composite or clinical cure outcome (n = 12). HSROC curves suggested considerable heterogeneity. An additional 11 studies were described but could not be included for meta-analysis because data were not available. The majority of these studies (9/11) failed to demonstrate a relationship between AUC:MIC and positive clinical outcome.

Conclusions

Vancomycin AUC:MIC performance was modest and inconsistent. Analysis was limited by studies without sufficient data; therefore, meta-analytic results may overestimate TPC values. Given this, as well as the lack of standardization of methods, widespread adoption of AUC:MIC as the preferred vancomycin monitoring parameter may be premature.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^61496270]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The MICs for vancomycin have been slowly increasing ("MIC creep"). 16 Numerous studies have addressed the effectiveness of vancomycin with higher MICs within the CLSI "susceptible range" with variable conclusions. 17, 18, 19 Equipoise remains when the MIC is at the CLSI "susceptible" level of 1.5–2.0 mg/L by Etest or 2.0 mg/L by BMD. The 2009 Guidelines recommend considering alternative therapy, 8 but the IDSA 2011 guidelines state vancomycin should be continued irrespective of the MIC unless lack of response occurs. 1

Determining an AUC, and hence the AUC/MIC, is impractical under normal clinical circumstances due to the large number of blood draws required after a single dose. Thus, the Guidelines recommend measurement of trough serum levels at steady‐state conditions as a surrogate. A trough level < 10 mg/L (10 μg/ml) is unlikely to represent a ratio ≥ 400 and may result in development of resistance, including both vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heteroresistant VISA (hVISA, wherein a small subpopulation (e.g. 1 per 10⁵) of VISA exists within an otherwise susceptible isolate). 20 Hence, the Guidelines recommend always keeping trough levels above 10 mg/L. A trough level of 15–20 mg/L is recommended to ensure an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 in more serious infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis, and osteomyelitis. This corresponds to guidelines by the American Thoracic Society for healthcare‐associated, hospital‐acquired, and ventilator‐associated pneumonias. 21 Importantly, three more recent studies, however, showed that over 50% of patients achieving AUC/MIC ≥ 400 had trough levels < 15 mg/L. 22, 23, 24 Hence, trough levels at best imperfectly predict AUC/MIC ratios. The use of peak levels has not been shown to increase the predictive ability to identify efficacy or toxicity, 25 and is not advocated by the Guidelines. When administered as a continuous infusion, a steady‐state level of 25–30 mg/L obtained 18 or more h after dosage adjustment is recommended.

### A systematic review of vancomycin dosing and monitoring in burn patients [^79e5ad0a]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Vancomycin pharmacokinetics are significantly altered following burn injury, requiring a higher total daily dose to achieve adequate serum concentrations. Wide interpatient variability necessitates close, frequent monitoring of serum concentrations for efficacy and safety. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate published data regarding vancomycin pharmacokinetic alterations in burn patients, to determine whether evidence-based recommendations for dosing and monitoring can be formulated, and to identify future research opportunities. The systematic review included studies published in English, involved human subjects with at least a 10% TBSA burn who received vancomycin intravenously, and obtained serum concentration(s). Database searches returned 130 titles for review. Twelve studies met a priori inclusion criteria. The most common dosing regimens in adult and pediatric patients were 5 to 20 mg/kg/dose every 6 to 8 hours. Mean trough concentrations were 7.24 ± 1.5 mg/L. Only 12.5% of reported trough concentrations were within the currently recommended range of 10 to 20 mg/L. Although no consistent dosing recommendations were provided, all studies recommended close monitoring of trough concentrations. Based on limited clinical outcomes data, standardized recommendations for vancomycin dosing and monitoring in burn patients cannot be made. Higher total daily doses (40–70 mg/kg/day) and increased dosing frequency (every 6–12 hr in adults) may be necessary to achieve current target trough concentrations. Future research goals include prospective investigation of clinical outcomes related to initial doses, loading doses, monitoring peak and trough concentrations, and adverse effects. Further data on the effects of burn size, concomitant diseases, inhalation injury, and time since injury may improve the accuracy of vancomycin dosing in burn patients.

Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) versus intermittent infusion (II) in critically ill inpatients is associated with higher measured concentrations on CI, greater likelihood of ever exceeding > 20 mg/L, mixed exposure metrics, and variable nephrotoxicity findings. Across studies, CI groups had "steady-state concentrations of 20–25 mg/L vs troughs of 10–15 mg/L, respectively", and one study showed more patients attaining " > 20 mg/L" with CI vs II "(63.2% vs 44.9%, P = 0.065)". Another study reported "lower mean AUCτ with CI vs II (529 [SD, 98] mg·h/L vs 612 [SD, 213] mg·h/L)" and compared concentrations "(25 ± 4 vs 17 ± 4.7 mg/L, respectively, P = 0.42)". Nephrotoxicity was "similar or numerically lower with CI vs II (range, 4%-16% vs 11%-19%)", with higher absolute rates under AKIN criteria "(26%-28% vs 35%-37%)". In specific cohorts, CI required less RRT "(7% [7 of 94 patients] vs 23% [12 of 52 patients]; P = 0.007)", whereas a large ICU study "conducted in 1,430 ICU patients" observed higher nephrotoxicity with CI "(25% [161 of 653 patients] vs 20% [77 of 390 patients]; P = 0.001)" and found each "1-mg/L increase" in concentration linked to an "11% increase in the risk", yet logistic regression indicated II was associated with "an 8-fold higher odds of nephrotoxicity (95% confidence interval, 2.87–23.41)".

Vancomycin maintenance dosing and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based monitoring in obesity rely on estimated clearance (CL), commonly using the Cockcroft-Gault equation with patient age, sex, Scr, and body size, though there is considerable controversy regarding the optimal body size metric. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) study in obese patients (n = 346) with BMI values of 30.1 to 85.7 kg/m² and body weights of 70 to 294 kg proposed an equation to estimate vancomycin CL based on age, sex, Scr (IDMS traceable), and allometrically scaled body weight. The population model-estimated vancomycin CL multiplied by the target AUC estimates the initial daily maintenance dose; in obese patients an average CL of approximately 6 L/h equates to an AUC of approximately 500 mg*h/L with a daily dose of 3,000 mg, and empiric maintenance doses above 4,500 mg/day are not expected because vancomycin CL rarely exceeds 9 L/h. Population PK models cannot account for more than 50% of the interindividual variability, and AUC accuracy is improved by measuring both a peak collected at least 1 hour after the end of infusion and a trough, after which trough-only Bayesian estimation is achievable in physiologically stable patients.

Vancomycin monitoring in outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) should occur throughout treatment, as the guideline states that vancomycin levels should be monitored throughout the OPAT course and recommends drug levels be monitored not just during the initial phase; a widely followed statement recommends dose adjustments based on serum trough levels, and there is emerging consensus that area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration monitoring may allow more appropriate dosing, though this practice has not yet gained widespread adoption. An observational study found that nephrotoxicity is frequently noted more than 2 weeks into treatment, which informed the recommendation to monitor levels throughout OPAT.

Vancomycin dosing in obesity — loading dose strategy and weight bands are outlined as follows: Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m² with class I (30.0–34.9 kg/m²), class II (35.0–39.9 kg/m²), and class III (≥ 40 kg/m²). Weight-indexed vancomycin volume of distribution (Vd) is lower in morbid obesity, for example 0.32 L/kg in morbidly obese vs 0.68 L/kg at normal weight, and lower Vd estimates of approximately 0.5 L/kg or weight-independent central tendency estimates approaching 75 L are observed in obese adults. Using actual body weight-based loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg with consideration of capping at 3,000 mg is described as the most practical strategy in obese patients with serious infections, resulting in calculated loading doses of 1,500 to 2,500 mg for 80 to 99 kg, 2,000 to 3,000 mg for 100 to 119 kg, and 2,500 to 3,000 mg for ≥ 120 kg, with doses rounded to the nearest 250 mg.

### Predictive performance of Bayesian vancomycin monitoring in the critically ill [^ebc1f478]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

It is recommended that therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin should be guided by 24-hour area under the curve concentration. This can be done via Bayesian models in dose-optimization software. However, before these models can be incorporated into clinical practice in the critically ill, their predictive performance needs to be evaluated. This study assesses the predictive performance of Bayesian models for vancomycin in the critically ill.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Single-center ICU.

Patients

Data were obtained for all patients in the ICU between 1 January, and 31 May 2020, who received IV vancomycin. The predictive performance of three Bayesian models were evaluated based on their availability in commercially available software. Predictive performance was assessed via bias and precision. Bias was measured as the mean difference between observed and predicted vancomycin concentrations. Precision was measured as the sd of bias, root mean square error, and 95% limits of agreement based on Bland-Altman plots.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 466 concentrations from 188 patients were used to evaluate the three models. All models showed low bias (-1.7 to 1.8mg/L), which was lower with a posteriori estimate (-0.7 to 1.8mg/L). However, all three models showed low precision in terms of sd (4.7–8.8mg/L) and root mean square error (4.8–8.9mg/L). The models underpredicted at higher observed vancomycin concentrations (bias 0.7–3.2mg/L for < 20mg/L; -5.1 to -2.3 for ≥ 20mg/L) and the Bland-Altman plots showed a great deviation between observed and predicted concentrations.

Conclusions

Bayesian models of vancomycin show not only low bias, but also low precision in the critically ill. Thus, Bayesian-guided dosing of vancomycin in this population should be used cautiously.

### Dosing and exposure of vancomycin with continuous infusion: a retrospective study [^8f01c2da]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin continuous infusion (CI) has suggested benefits over intermittent infusion: reduced nephrotoxicity, higher target attainment, and simpler therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Empiric dosing regimens range from 30-60mg/kg/day and it is unclear which regimen results in optimal exposure. This study evaluates whether a dosing regimen of 45mg/kg/day after a 20mg/kg loading dose for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50mL/min results in adequate exposure. We retrospectively analyzed plasma concentrations from patients treated with vancomycin CI as routine clinical care between February and October 2021. Patients under 18years old, with renal replacement therapy, reduced creatinine clearance (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration < 50mLmin/1.73 m²) or outpatient antibiotic therapy were excluded. Dose, renal function, and blood draw procedures were assessed for each measured vancomycin sample. Initially, 121 samples were included. Subsequently, 7 samples, 6 of which with concentrations ≥ 40mg/L, were verified to be incorrectly drawn and excluded. With doses of 40-50mg/kg/day concentrations ranged from 18.4–61.0mg/L. Only 25% were within the target window of 17-25mg/L and 15% were ≥ 40mg/L. Supratherapeutic concentrations were observed in 89% of samples from patients dosed 40-60mg/kg/day with eGFR 50-80mL/min. Concluding, an empiric dosing regimen of 45mg/kg results in too high vancomycin exposure and thus we recommend lower doses and differentiation according to renal function. Additionally, when measuring concentrations over 40mg/L incorrect sampling must be excluded before dose adjustment and the large variability in exposure between patients, warrants the need for swift TDM.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^cadb157c]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Empiric maintenance regimen in children — published retrospective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data in children suggest that current vancomycin dosing of 45 to 60 mg/ kg/day (in divided doses administered every 6 to 8 hours) may be insufficient to achieve currently recommended target for adults of an AUC of 400 to 600 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L). In fact, higher dosages, ranging from 60 to 80 mg/kg/day and given in divided doses every 6 hours, may be needed to achieve these targets for MRSA strains with a vancomycin MIC of 1 mg/L or less, and for children infected by MRSA pathogens with a MIC of > 1 mg/L, it is unlikely that the target exposure can be reliably achieved with previously investigated dosages of vancomycin in children. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling indicated that to achieve an AUC/MIC of ≥ 400 in 90% of subjects, a dosage of 80 mg/kg/ day was necessary, particularly in those less than 12 years of age with normal renal function; at a dosage of 80 mg/ kg/day, the median AUC and median trough concentration were 675 mg·h/L and 16 mg/L, respectively. As expected, subjects 12 years of age or older achieved similar exposure at lower dosages of 60 to 70 mg/kg/day, and at a dosage of 60 to 70 mg/kg/day (divided doses administered every 6 hours), an AUC of 400 mg·h/L correlated to a mean trough of 8 to 9 mg/L.

Continuous infusion versus intermittent infusion of vancomycin — administration by continuous infusion (CI) has been evaluated as an alternative to intermittent infusion (II) with potential advantages of earlier target attainment, less variability in serum concentrations, ease of drug level monitoring, and lower the potential risk of AKI. Most studies compared CI to II for the risk of AKI and attainment of target serum concentrations; only 4 studies included other outcome endpoints such as treatment failure and mortality, and measures of exposure reported include trough and average steady-state concentrations and AUCτ. In critically ill patients, a total of 7 studies compared CI vs II; in one randomized trial comparing CI (n = 61) and II (n = 58) in 119 patients, mean steady-state and trough concentrations were 24 mg/L and 15 mg/L for both groups, with AUCτ values comparable between groups and significantly less variability in the CI group (P = 0.026). Clinical failure rates were similar on day 10 (21% vs 26%) and at end of treatment (21% vs 19%), although the mean AUCτ was lower with CI than II (596 [SD, 159] mg·h/L vs 685 [SD, 260] mg·h/L, P < 0.05). Nephrotoxicity occurred in 18% overall with similar rates between CI and II (16% vs 19%), but dialysis was required more often with CI than II (6 of 10 patients vs 3 of 11 patients). Among critically ill burn patients, another study comparing CI (n = 90) with II (n = 81) reported mortality rates numerically higher for those receiving CI but not reaching statistical significance; when mortality was compared by treatment indications, those who received CI for non-gram-positive sepsis had significantly higher mortality (70% vs 16.7%, P = 0.001). Nephrotoxicity occurred numerically less frequently with CI than II based on increase in Scr of 0.5 mg/dL at end of therapy (6.7% vs 14.8%).

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) dosing and monitoring — For patients receiving CRRT at conventional, KDIGO-recommended effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h, loading doses of 20 to 25 mg/kg by actual body weight should be used (B-III), and initial maintenance dosing for CRRT with effluent rates of 20 to 25 mL/kg/h should be 7.5 to 10 mg/kg every 12 hours (B-II). Maintenance dose and dosing interval should be based on serum concentration monitoring, which should be conducted within the first 24 hours to ensure AUC/MIC targets are met; in fluid overloaded patients, doses may be reduced as patients become euvolemic and Vd decreases, and the use of CI of vancomycin in patients receiving CRRT could be used in place of intermittent dosing especially when high CRRT ultrafiltrate/dialysate flow rates are employed (B-II).

### Decreasing the time to achieve therapeutic vancomycin concentrations in critically ill patients: developing and testing of a dosing nomogram [^092e6fb2]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

Augmented renal clearance appears to be quite common in sub-populations of critically ill patients and can lead to very low serum concentrations of vancomycin on the first day of treatment
Clinicians are used to adjusting the dosing of antibiotics according to renal failure; however the adjustment to elevated function of the kidneys appears important to ensure target concentrations are achieved
This study prospectively validated a new vancomycin dosing nomogram based on the 8-hours renal clearance of creatinine and demonstrated that it is possible to increase the likelihood of target attainment in the first 24 h of treatment, particularly in patients with augmented renal clearance
Adequate serum concentrations of vancomycin should be confirmed with therapeutic drug monitoring, particularly in patients with extreme renal function alteration

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^9129fdcd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Standard vancomycin dosing as approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 1 g q12 h, a dose unlikely to give a ratio ≥ 400 unless the MIC is ≤ 0.5 mg/L. Hence, the Guidelines recommend weight‐based dosing (using actual body weight) at 15–20 mg/kg (not to exceed 2 g/dose) q12 h, with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM; trough levels checked at steady state prior to 4 th dose if normal renal function). With serious infections a loading dose of 25–30 mg/kg may be considered. A meta‐analysis confirmed a benefit to TDM with significantly higher rates of clinical efficacy and significantly reduced nephrotoxicity compared to no TDM. 29 The available evidence for attaining a trough ≥ 15 mg/L (vs. < 15 mg/L) may be questionable in terms of predicting an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 as well as for clinical efficacy, but values < 10 mg/L should be avoided to prevent resistance and to attain the target AUC/MIC. 24 TDM is especially necessary in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Many have decreased kidney function, but others have augmented renal clearance with lower than expected trough levels. 30

Alternative methods to guide vancomycin dosing by intermittent infusion have been published. One nomogram is based on population pharmacokinetics and is aimed at targeting a trough level of 15–20 mg/L. 31 Based on a priori methodology, individual patient data are not required, although one must be careful that a particular patient matches those used to generate the nomogram. Other nomograms are available. Linear regression analysis applying individual patient parameters (a posteriori) has been used but does require at least two measured serum concentrations and a log linear calculator. 32 Bayesian estimation methodology combines a priori population‐based data with a posteriori individual patient data (which may be limited to just a trough level 23) to calculate dose and interval most accurately, 32 and has higher predicative ability to achieve a specific AUC/MIC. 33 Bayesian methodology may be the fastest way to achieve therapeutic targets, but requires specific computer software and specialized practitioners and has had limited implementation.

We recommend that hospitals implement PK monitoring and adjustment programs for vancomycin (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). PK monitoring and adjustment programs can reduce costs and decrease adverse effects, the ASP should encourage implementation and provide support for training and assessment of competencies, and the conduct of those programs should be integrated into routine pharmacy activities.

Neonatal vancomycin pharmacokinetics and AUC–trough targets — Monte Carlo simulations with Bayesian estimation found that trough concentrations ranging from 7 to 11 mg/L were highly predictive of an AUC24 of > 400 mg·h/L in at least 90% of neonates, and dosages to achieve this target ranged from 15 to 20 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours depending on postmenstrual age and SCr. In a study of 243 neonates with 734 vancomycin concentrations, a trough concentration of 11 mg/L predicted the attainment of an AUC of ≥ 400 mg·h/L in 93% of neonates, but a trough concentration alone did not precisely predict AUC and Bayesian approaches to support dosing decisions for neonates in the clinical setting are needed. A model-based dosing calculator improved attainment of a serum concentration of 15 to 25 mg/L from 41% to 72% without any cases of AKI. The incidence of vancomycin-associated AKI reported in neonates has been low, ranging from 1% to 9%, and in a large, retrospective, multicenter, propensity score–matched cohort study AKI was not associated with vancomycin alone but may occur in the presence of other recognized risk factors.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target? [^c3c765cd]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

With few exceptions coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have remained the most frequent causative agents of neonatal late onset sepsis over the last decades. Although CoNS sepsis is characterised by low mortality, the microorganism is known to be highly resistant to antibiotics - methicillin resistance exceeds 70% in most centres. Therefore vancomycin has become the antimicrobial therapy of choice for targeted or empiric treatment of neonatal sepsis, especially in extremely premature babies. However, despite extensive research and widespread use considerable controversies in vancomycin exposure required for optimal efficacy and consequently in dosing, remain. Poor tissue penetration of vancomycin suggests that different serum concentrations may be required depending on the site of infection, i.e. pneumonia vs blood stream vs bone infection. Further complexity is added by pathogen-specific pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets, supported by recent experimental studies. Leiva et al. have demonstrated in the neutropenic mouse thigh infection model without the use of a foreign body that to stop or kill methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis 2.5–3.0 times lower area under the curve to minimal inhibitory concentration ratios (AUC/MIC) were needed compared to values required for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus.

For neonates, in whom CoNS blood stream infections (BSI) predominate, effective vancomycin AUC/MIC has not been studied, but lower ratios could likely be sufficient as CoNS rarely invades tissues where vancomycin concentrations are lower than in blood.

Current vancomycin treatment in neonates is guided by the trough concentration (C trough) values derived from studies in adults and recommendations range between 5 and 20 mg/L. Modelling studies have shown that a C trough of at least 15 mg/L is required to achieve an AUC/MIC > 400 for a pathogen with MIC of 1 mg/L in adults, but lower values of 8–9 mg/L for children and 7–11 mg/L for neonates have been suggested in recent studies using samples, collected for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), and population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis. Vancomycin C trough values used regularly in clinical practice unfortunately poorly predict AUC. Furthermore, total vancomycin concentrations are usually measured, but only unbound fraction of drug is active. Free vancomycin concentration cannot be predicted from total vancomycin concentration measurement.

Vancomycin exposure–related acute kidney injury (AKI) — data suggest risk rises with higher trough concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) exposures, particularly when troughs are maintained above 15 to 20 mg/L and when daily AUC exceeds 650 to 1,300 mg·h/L; in cohorts, AKI was more frequent with AUC 600–800 mg·h/L than 400–600 mg·h/L (P = 0.014), increased 2.5-fold when AUC was above 1,300 mg·h/L vs lower values (30.8% vs 13.1%, P = 0.002), and AUC thresholds of ≥ 1,218 mg·h/L for 0 to 48 hours, ≥ 677 for 0 to 24 hours, and ≥ 683 for 24 to 48 hours or troughs of ≥ 18.2 mg/L were associated with a 3- to 4-fold increased risk; risk increased stepwise along the day 2 AUC continuum with values of ≥ 793 mg·h/L at greatest risk, and additional risk factors include increased body weight, pre-existing renal dysfunction, critical illness, and concurrent nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, amphotericin B, intravenous (i.v.) contrast, vasopressors, piperacillin/ tazobactam, and flucloxacillin.

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^af59fdaa]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major pathogen in severe healthcare-associated infections. In the past decades, the anti-MRSA armamentarium has broadened. Still, vancomycin remains the most common first-line option for treating severe infections with parenteral therapy. Achievement of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices associated with maximal bacterial kill is recommended to increase the likelihood of clinical cure. To achieve target serum concentrations in life-threatening infections such as sepsis, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia, current guidelines recommend trough serum concentrations of vancomycin (C min) ranging 15 to 20 mg/L. Such serum concentrations should achieve an area under the concentration-time curve over a 24-hour period divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected bacteria (AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio) of > 400 (assuming an MIC ≤ 1 mg/L). This threshold was significantly associated with favourable clinical and bacteriological outcomes in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and therefore generally accepted as the appropriate PK/PD target. Other investigators confirmed that an AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio for optimizing clinical outcomes should be at least 400.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^9e045c82]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Aminoglycosides — research recommendations: No standard method exists for therapeutic drug monitoring with single-daily dosing, and uniform guidance based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of timing and method would be of greatest assistance. Patients receiving extended-dosing interval aminoglycosides should have even greater dosing intervals if mild or moderate renal impairment exists, and optimal therapeutic monitoring for infrequent dosing in CKD needs to be standardized. The impact of IHD and high-flux CRRT on efficacy and toxicity of extended-duration aminoglycoside dosing needs further study, potentially via RCTs comparing standard versus individualized regimens with frequent drug-level monitoring and kidney injury markers as outcomes. Interactions with nephrotoxic agents such as vancomycin, amphotericin B, cephalosporins, extended-spectrum penicillins, colistin, loop diuretics, clindamycin, cisplatin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents need more careful observational examination.

### What's new in therapeutic drug monitoring of antimicrobials? [^cfcc749e]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Areas of uncertainty

What concentrations should be targeted and where?

There is significant heterogeneity in TDM studies regarding the definition of target concentrations, and the PTA of empirical dosing is dependent on if "high" or "low" targets are defined. As an example, while there is consensus that concentrations for ß-lactams should be above the MIC of pathogens for the better part of a dosing interval, it is debated whether target concentrations of up to 4–6 × MIC add further benefit. As individual MICs are often not available, the use of empiric MICs for the respective antimicrobial, usually at the higher end of "sensitive", is common. While the use of high MICs in combination with high target attainment aims at avoiding underdosing, the necessity of such high targets is questionable as it also increases the risk of attaining potentially toxic levels. It is unclear whether targets should be adjusted according to local resistance epidemiology and if TDM is particularly valuable in settings with high rates of resistance. It must also be recognized that antimicrobial concentrations are usually measured in plasma samples, that not necessarily reflect concentrations at the site of infection and will thus act as a surrogate marker.

### Vancomycin dosing: assessment of time to therapeutic concentration and predictive accuracy of pharmacokinetic modeling software [^4f9c6639]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic drug monitoring is usually required for safe and effective administration of vancomycin. However, dosing recommendations from published guidelines are not suitable in achieving therapeutic vancomycin concentrations in a timely manner in patients with normal renal function.

Objective

To audit vancomycin dosing and concentrations at our institution and evaluate the predictive accuracy of a pharmacokinetic simulation program, with a view to implementing a pharmacy-based pharmacokinetic service for vancomycin monitoring.

Methods

Patients receiving vancomycin were identified prospectively through the therapeutic drug monitoring archives. Patient information was obtained from medication charts and medical records that were located on wards. Data were entered into the MM-USC*Pack program (Jelliffe R, University of Southern California, 2008, version 12.10). This software was used to predict initial and subsequent concentrations of vancomycin based on patient parameters. The predictive accuracy of this software was evaluated by comparing the predicted concentrations to the observed concentrations.

Results

During a 6-week period, 204 concentrations were measured in 77 patients. The most common dosing regimen was 1 g every 12 hours. Overall, initial trough concentrations were subtherapeutic (< 10 mg/L) in 58% of patients and trough concentrations did not become therapeutic at any stage throughout therapy in 25% of patients. The pharmacokinetic modeling software demonstrated little systematic bias (-3.1%), but the precision (median prediction error) was 23% (interquartile range, 11–45%). Predictions were poorer in obese patients (body mass index > 35 kg/m²) and in patients with unstable renal function.

Conclusions

A delay in attaining target trough concentrations was observed in a significant proportion of patients. Pharmacokinetic modeling software is a potential tool to improve the timeliness of achieving adequate dosing by allowing concentrations to be determined prior to steady-state. The program was able to predict vancomycin concentrations across a heterogeneous patient population with little systematic bias, but only moderate precision.

AUC-guided vancomycin dosing — compared with trough monitoring, individualized AUC-guided dosing was independently associated with a significant decrease in AKI (odds ratio [OR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34–0.80; P = 0.003) and produced lower median Bayesian-estimated AUCs (474 [SD, 360–611] mg·h/L vs 705 [SD, 540–883] mg·h/L; P < 0.001); in a prospective cohort transitioning from troughs of 10 to 20 mg/L to AUC values of > 400 mg·h/L, nephrotoxicity occurred in 8% in year 1 and in 0% and 2% in years 2 and 3 (P = 0.01), and AKI was associated with a median trough of 15.7 mg/L and AUC of 625 mg·h/L versus 8.7 mg/L and 423 mg·h/L without AKI (P = 0.02).

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^e4aa388a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Vancomycin used at currently recommended doses is minimally nephrotoxic when used in noncritically ill patients with less serious infections. In sicker patients with multiple risk factors for AKI, VANT occurs much more commonly, but it remains uncertain to what degree vancomycin is directly responsible. In our opinion, it is safe to initiate therapy with vancomycin in critically ill patients with multiple risk factors for AKI, pending culture results with use of TDM and antibiotic stewardship (Table 5). Trough levels should be obtained within 48–72 h, by which time initial culture results should be available. Decisions regarding continuation of vancomycin therapy can be individualized, based on culture result, MIC (if staphylococci are isolated), AKI risk, and side‐effect profile of alternative agents. Loading doses are safe. Trough levels with intermittent dosing should always be > 10 mg/L to prevent resistance. It remains uncertain whether Guideline‐based trough levels of 15–20 mg/L are more efficacious than 10–15 mg/L in serious infections. Trough levels of 15–20 mg/L, however, are clearly associated with greater VANT than levels < 15 mg/L, but it remains uncertain whether these levels are the cause or the result of the nephrotoxicity. Combination with PTZ should be avoided or duration minimized. In patients receiving vancomycin who develop AKI that is not easily correctible with fluid resuscitation or discontinuation of other agents, cessation of vancomycin should be considered. This very important issue clearly warrants a large, multicenter RCT to answer definitively. Further issues need research as well, preferably with RCTs (Table 6).

Vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) in pediatrics — exposure–response and dose limits: The risk of AKI increases with vancomycin exposure, especially when trough concentrations exceed 15 to 20 mg/L. A meta-analysis of 10 pediatric studies found that troughs of 15 to 20 mg/L increased the risk for AKI by 2.71-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.82–4.05). Additional risk correlates include dose augmentation of 5 mg/kg at each additional day of therapy and late-onset AKI occurring after 7 days with association to age < 1 year. In a large PK analysis using 1,576 concentrations from 680 pediatric subjects, AKI occurred in 10%, 33%, and 57% among those achieving AUC values of ≥ 400, 800, and 1,000 mg·h/L, respectively; an AUC of ≥ 800 mg·h/L and trough concentrations of ≥ 15 mg/L were independently associated with a greater than 2.5-fold increased AKI risk, and AUC correlated strongly with troughs (Spearman's coefficient, 0.963; P < 0.001). Based on projected exposure, vancomycin doses of ≥ 100 mg/kg/day should be avoided because the projected median AUC and trough values are 843 mg·h/L and 21 mg/L, respectively, at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day.

5.3 Nephrotoxicity

Vancomycin Injection can result in acute kidney injury (AKI), including acute renal failure, mainly due to interstitial nephritis or less commonly acute tubular necrosis. AKI is manifested by increasing blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr). The risk of AKI increases with higher vancomycin serum levels, prolonged exposure, concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs, concomitant administration of piperacillin-tazobactam [see Drug Interactions (7.2)], volume depletion, pre-existing renal impairment and in critically ill patients and patients with co-morbid conditions that predispose to renal impairment.

Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function in all patients receiving Vancomycin Injection. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with comorbidities that predispose to impairment in renal function or are concomitantly receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, in critically ill patients, in patients with changing renal function, and in patients requiring higher therapeutic vancomycin levels. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue Vancomycin Injection or reduce the dose.

5.4 Ototoxicity

Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin. It may be transient or permanent. Ototoxicity manifests as tinnitus, hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo. The risk is higher in older patients, patients who are receiving higher doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside or who have underlying renal impairment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ototoxicity during therapy. Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function in all patients receiving parenteral vancomycin. Discontinue Vancomycin Injection if ototoxicity occurs. Dosage of Vancomycin Injection must be adjusted for patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity.

5.5 Severe Dermatologic Reactions

Severe dermatologic reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) have been reported in association with the use of vancomycin. Cutaneous signs or symptoms reported include skin rashes, mucosal lesions, and blisters.

Discontinue Vancomycin Injection at the first appearance of signs and symptoms of TEN, SJS, DRESS, AGEP, or LABD.
