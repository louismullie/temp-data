## Question

21. Find the sum [1/2!] + [2/3!] + [3/4!] +… + [n/((n+1)!)] and compute its limit as n → ∞.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the sum of the series ([1/2!] + [2/3!] + [3/4!] +… + [n/((n+1)!)]) and to compute its limit as (n → ∞). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the general term and whether it can be rewritten in a telescoping form. Then, I should verify the partial sum and check for cancellation. Next, I will evaluate the limit as (n) approaches infinity. Finally, I will consider whether the infinite series converges and, if so, to what value, and I should double-check my arithmetic at each step to avoid mistakes.

> Let me first confirm the general term. The (k)-th term of the series is ([k/((k+1)!)]), so the partial sum up to (n) is (Sₙ = ∑(k = 1 to n) [k/((k+1)!)]). Wait, let me verify the indexing: yes, the first term corresponds to (k = 1) giving ([1/2!]), the second to (k = 2) giving ([2/3!]), and so on, which matches the stated pattern [^notfound].

> Now, I need to rewrite the general term to expose telescoping behavior. I will express ([k/((k+1)!)]) as a difference of factorials. Let me think about this: ([k/((k+1)!)] = [((k+1) − 1)/((k+1)!)] = [(k+1)/((k+1)!)] − [1/((k+1)!)] = [1/k!] − [1/((k+1)!)]). Hold on, I should verify that algebra: yes, that decomposition is correct and it sets up a telescoping sum [^notfound].

> Next, I should write out the partial sum explicitly and look for cancellations. Substituting the telescoping form, (Sₙ = ∑(k = 1 to n) ([1/k!] − [1/((k+1)!)])). Expanding this, I get ([1/1!] − [1/2!]) + ([1/2!] − [1/3!]) + ([1/3!] − [1/4!]) +… + ([1/n!] − [1/((n+1)!)]). I should double-check the cancellation: the (-[1/2!]) from the first term cancels with the (+[1/2!]) from the second, the (-[1/3!]) from the second cancels with the (+[1/3!]) from the third, and so on, leaving only the first positive term and the last negative term [^notfound].

> So, the partial sum simplifies to (Sₙ = 1 − [1/((n+1)!)]). Wait, let me verify the boundary: when (k = 1), the positive piece is ([1/1!] = 1), and when (k = n), the negative piece is (−[1/((n+1)!)]), so yes, (Sₙ = 1 - [1/((n+1)!)]) is correct [^notfound].

> Now, I will compute the limit as (n → ∞). I need to ensure that ([1/((n+1)!)]) tends to zero. Since factorial growth dominates any polynomial, (lim(n → ∞) [1/((n+1)!)] = 0), and therefore (lim(n → ∞) Sₙ = 1 − 0 = 1). Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm that this aligns with the intuition that the infinite series converges to 1, which it does [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I am conflating the partial sum with the infinite series? Let me reconsider and be precise: the infinite series (∑(k = 1 to ∞) [k/((k+1)!)]) is the limit of the partial sums, so it converges to 1. I should also note that this result is consistent with the known series for (e) and related exponential sums, even though I did not directly invoke (e) here, which gives me additional confidence in the answer [^notfound].

> Final answer: The sum of the series is (1 - [1/((n+1)!)]), and its limit as (n → ∞) is 1 [^notfound].

---

The sum of the series ([1/2!] + [2/3!] + [3/4!] +… + [n/((n+1)!)]) is (1 − [1/((n+1)!)]). As (n → ∞), the limit is **1**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: Rewrite the general term

The general term is ([k/((k+1)!)]). We can rewrite it as:

[k/((k+1)!)] = [((k+1) − 1)/((k+1)!)] = [(k+1)/((k+1)!)] − [1/((k+1)!)] = [1/k!] − [1/((k+1)!)]

---

### Step 2: Write the partial sum

The partial sum (Sₙ) is:

Sₙ = ∑(k = 1 to n) [k/((k+1)!)] = ∑(k = 1 to n) ([1/k!] − [1/((k+1)!)])

---

### Step 3: Expand the partial sum

Expanding the sum reveals a telescoping series:

Sₙ = ([1/1!] − [1/2!]) + ([1/2!] − [1/3!]) + ([1/3!] − [1/4!]) +… + ([1/n!] − [1/((n+1)!)])

---

### Step 4: Simplify the partial sum

Most terms cancel, leaving:

Sₙ = 1 − [1/((n+1)!)]

---

### Step 5: Compute the limit as (n → ∞)

As (n → ∞), ([1/((n+1)!)] → 0), so:

lim(n → ∞) Sₙ = 1 − 0 = 1

---

## Final answer

The sum of the series is (1 − [1/((n+1)!)]), and its limit as (n → ∞) is **1**.

### Mammalian skull dimensions and the golden ratio (φ) [^3a12f466]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The Golden Ratio characterizes a unique relationship in the study of integers, a branch of mathematics called Number Theory. Numerically, Φ can be calculated as a ratio within the Fibonacci series as the series approaches infinity. The Fibonacci series is a well-known, infinite series in which the next term in the series is the sum of the prior 2 terms. The Fibonacci series starts as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55… Initially, the ratios of consecutive terms in the Fibonacci series (F n / F n-1) fluctuate between 1 and 2, but rapidly converge on the value Φ as the series grows: 1/1 = 1, 2/1 = 2, 3/2 = 1.5, 5/3 = 1.667, 8/5 = 1.6, 13/8 = 1.625, 21/34 = 1.615, 34/21 = 1.619, 55/34 = 1.618,…

The division of the 40th Fibonacci term (102,334,155) by the 39th (63,245,986) matches Φ to 15 decimal places. For convenience, authors and mathematicians typically truncate Φ to 1.618. Interestingly, the reciprocal of Φ (1/Φ or 1/1.61803…) is 1 integer less than Φ (0.61803…) and has the same decimal extension as Φ, and the square of Φ (Φ 2 or 1.61803… 2) is 1 integer more than Φ (2.61803…) and also has the same decimal extension. Φ is the only number that has these 2 properties. By convention, the reciprocal of Φ is represented by the Greek lower-case letter phi (ϕ), although sometimes this convention is reversed.

### Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs [^0572d7a0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We also have the similar notation for expected single-game payoff. To specify, the expected payoff of an i -player in a single game over all co-player configuration k, where k is found neighboring an X -player, is expressed as

The concepts in Eqs. (8)–(12) are sufficient to identify the difference between this work and the previous literature. In particular, they emphasize that the minimal unit to refer is the co-player configuration k, based on which the payoff of the multiplayer game is computed. We do not try to decompose the multi-body interaction identified by k into multiple pairwise interactions.

Combined with the pair approximation methodand detailed calculations in the strategy evolution dynamics, we can then obtain the master equation (4) in the main text (see Supplementary Note 2.4.3 for the approach of pair approximation deduction).

The decomposition to single games

The following form of the master equation is important, which holds for any n -strategy multiplayer game and allows us to obtain the replicator dynamics by summing the expected payoff calculations in a series of single games:In application, given the payoff functions a i ∣ k where i = 1, 2, …, n, we can compute all 〈 ⋅ 〉 terms and then ensemble them to obtain the replicator equations. The result of each 〈 ⋅ 〉 should be a function of x 1, x 2, …, x n (transformed from q j ∣ i manually), degree k, and game parameters.

The advantage of Eq. (13) is that we have attributed everything about 〈 ⋅ 〉 into two types, the 'type' and the 'type'. They can be expressed by matrices through i and j:
Thetype:

Thetype:

There are n 2 elements in each matrix. Their diagonals are equal, meaning we can compute n fewer elements. Therefore, the total amount of computation is n 2 + n 2 − n = (2 n − 1) n elements. The computational complexity is O(n 2), which can be accomplished in polynomial time (we also see that the death-birth rule's computational complexity is O(n 3), as specified in Supplementary Information).

### Steady-state free precession for T* relaxometry: all echoes in every readout with k-space aliasing [^75503663]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Problems with F‐states > N

If the number of F‐state signal components in each measurement is greater than the number of measurements N, then Eq. (5) will result in an incomplete basis: each measured F‐state signal component S F will contain contributions from S F‐N, S F‐2N,… and S F+N, S F+2N,… components.

In OSSI, a bSSFP acquisition is used with quadratic RF spoiling, which means that all F‐state signal components in the magnetization contribute to each measured signal. Examining Eq. (1), it follows that the measured signal is a sum of many different T 2 * weighted signal components.

If there was a way of restricting the number of F‐states to be less than N, then it would be possible to perform T 2 * relaxometry with OSSI using (Eqs. 1 and 4). One way of achieving this would be to set N or TR to be long, such that N.TR ≫ T 2 *, and only the first N F‐state signals are detectable above noise.

However, we can also apply an additional spoiler gradient in the pulse sequence to effectively isolate a series of F‐states. We call this approach "k‐space aliasing".

### A faster and more accurate algorithm for calculating population genetics statistics requiring sums of stirling numbers of the first kind [^068c33f2]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Ewen's sampling formula is a foundational theoretical result that connects probability and number theory with molecular genetics and molecular evolution; it was the analytical result required for testing the neutral theory of evolution, and has since been directly or indirectly utilized in a number of population genetics statistics. Ewen's sampling formula, in turn, is deeply connected to Stirling numbers of the first kind. Here, we explore the cumulative distribution function of these Stirling numbers, which enables a single direct estimate of the sum, using representations in terms of the incomplete beta function. This estimator enables an improved method for calculating an asymptotic estimate for one useful statistic, Fu's. By reducing the calculation from a sum of terms involving Stirling numbers to a single estimate, we simultaneously improve accuracy and dramatically increase speed.

### Detecting and tracking drift in quantum information processors [^57be0be9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

All standard characterization protocols, including all forms of tomography, and RB –, are founded on some time-independent parameterized model that describes the outcome probabilities for the circuits in the experiment, or a coarse-graining of them (e.g. mean survival probabilities in RB). When analyzing data from these experiments, the counts data from these circuits are fed into an analysis tool that estimates the model parameters, which we denote { γ i }. To upgrade such a protocol using the non-intrusive method, we: (i) use the spectral analysis tools above to construct time-resolved estimates of the probabilities; (ii) for a given time, t j, input the estimated probabilities directly into the analysis tool in place of frequencies; (iii) recover an estimate of the model parameters, { γ i (t i)} at that time; and (iv) repeat for all times of interest { t j }. This non-intrusive approach is simple, but statistically ad hoc.

The intrusive approach permits statistical rigor at the cost of more complex analysis. It consists of (i) selecting an appropriate time-resolved model for the protocol and (ii) fitting that model to the time-series data (steps 5a-5b, Fig. 1 a). In the model selection step, we expand each model parameter γ into a sum of Fourier components: γ → γ 0 + ∑ ω γ ω f ω (t), where the γ ω are real-valued amplitudes, and the summation is over some set of non-zero frequencies. This set of frequencies can vary from one parameter to another and may be empty if the parameter in question appears to be constant. To choose these expansions we need to understand how any drift frequencies in the model parameters would manifest in the circuit probability trajectories, and thus in the data.

Data and software availability

All simulated data used in this paper, as well as data analysis and plotting scripts, are available at. Additional instructions on how to work with the data can be found in the archive. The Python-based software implementation of Sir Isaac is available from.

Classes of phenomenological models used by Sir Isaac

To create a model in the form of Eq. (1), we would like to gradually increase the complexity of F until we find the best tradeoff between good fit and sufficient robustness, essentially extending traditional Bayesian model selection techniques to the realm of an infinite set of possible dynamical models. Ideally, this process should progress similarly to a Taylor series approximation to a function, adding terms one at a time in a hierarchy from simple to more complex, until a desired performance is obtained. To guarantee that this is possible, the hierarchy of models must be nested (or ordered) and complete in the sense that any possible dynamics can be represented within the hierarchy(Supplementary Note 1). Any model hierarchy that fits these criteria may be used, yet specification of the hierarchy is nontrivial in that it requires choosing an ordering of models that gradually adds both nonlinearities and unobserved variables. Further, different model hierarchies may naturally perform differently on the same data, depending on whether the studied dynamics can be represented succinctly within a hierarchy. Our results suggest that the choice of model class, specifying the functional forms used to model the dynamics, is more important to performance than the subsequent choice of the order of adding parameters within that class (Supplementary Fig. 2C).

### A faster and more accurate algorithm for calculating population genetics statistics requiring sums of stirling numbers of the first kind [^be86d2bc]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Because of the relation in (4), the statistics quantitysatisfies. Also, this relation and (3) show thatare non-negative. We have the special valuesThere is a recurrence relationwhich easily follows from (4). For a concise overview of properties, with a summary of the uniform approximations, see (, §11.3).

We introduce a complementary relationleading to an alternate calculation for Fu'sofThe recent algorithm considered in is based on asymptotic estimates ofderived in, which are valid for large values of n, with unrestricted values of. It avoids the use of the recursion relation given in (7).

In the present paper we derive an integral representation ofand of the complementary function, for which we can use the same asymptotic approach as for the Stirling numbers without calculating the Stirling numbers themselves. From the integral representation we also obtain a representation in which the incomplete beta function occurs as the main approximant. In this way we have a convenient representation, which is available as well for many classical cumulative distribution functions. We show numerical tests based on a first-order asymptotic approximation, which includes the incomplete beta function. In a future paper we give more details on the complete asymptotic expansion of, and, in addition, we will consider an inversion problem for large n and m: to find θ either from the equation, whenis given, or from the equation, whenis given.

### Current sample size conventions: flaws, harms, and alternatives [^f34a2bb9]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Value of information methods

Many methods have already been described in the statistical literature for choosing the sample size that maximizes the expected value of the information produced minus the total cost of the study. See for an early discussion, for recent examples, and the introduction of for additional references. These require projecting both value and cost at various different sample sizes, including quantifying cost and value on the same scale (note, however, that this could be avoided by instead maximizing value divided by total cost). They also require formally specifying uncertainty about the state of nature; although this can be criticized as being subjective, it improves vastly on the usual conventional approach of assuming that one particular guess is accurate. These methods can require considerable effort and technical expertise, but they can also produce the sort of thorough and directly meaningful assessment that should be required to justify studies that are very expensive or that put many people at risk.

Simple choices based on cost or feasibility

Recent work has justified two simple choices that are based only on costs, with no need to quantify projected value or current uncertainty about the topic being studied. Because costs can generally be more accurately projected than the inputs for conventional calculations, this avoids the inherent inaccuracy that besets the conventional approach. One choice, called n min, is the sample size that minimizes the total cost per subject studied. This is guaranteed to be more cost-efficient (produce a better ratio of projected value to cost) than any larger sample size. It therefore cannot be validly criticized as inadequate. The other, called n root, is the sample size that minimizes the total cost divided by the square root of sample size. This is smaller than n min and is most justifiable for innovative studies where very little is already known about the issue to be studied, in which case it is also guaranteed to be more cost efficient than any larger sample size. An interactive spreadsheet that facilitates identification of n min and n root is provided as Additional file 2.

A common pragmatic strategy is to use the maximum sample size that is reasonably feasible. When sample size is constrained by cost barriers, such as exhausting the pool of the most easily studied subjects, this strategy may closely approximate use of n min and therefore share its justification. When constraints imposed by funders determine feasibility, doing the maximum possible within those constraints is a sensible choice.

### The minimal work cost of information processing [^927873c9]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Classical mappings and dependence on the logical process

Our result, which is applicable to arbitrary quantum processes, applies to all classical computations as a special case. Classically, logical processes correspond to stochastic maps, of which deterministic functions are a special case. As a simple example, consider the AND gate. This is one of the elementary operations computing devices can perform, from which more complex circuits can be designed. The gate takes two bits as input, and outputs a single bit that is set to 1 exactly when both input bits are 1, as illustrated in Fig. 2a.

The logical process is manifestly irreversible, as the output alone does not allow to infer the input uniquely. If one of the inputs is zero, then the logical process effectively has to reset a three-level system to zero, forgetting which of the three possible inputs 00, 01 or 10 was given; this information can be viewed as being discarded, and hence dumped into the environment. We can confirm this intuition with our main result, using the fact that a general classical mapping is given by the specification of the conditional probability p (x ′| x) of observing x ′ at the output if the input was x. Embedding the classical probability distributions into the diagonals of quantum states, the infinity norm in expression (2) becomes simply

### Filters: when, why, and how (not) to use them [^c9bfe740]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

Filters are commonly used to reduce noise and improve data quality. Filter theory is part of a scientist's training, yet the impact of filters on interpreting data is not always fully appreciated. This paper reviews the issue and explains what a filter is, what problems are to be expected when using them, how to choose the right filter, and how to avoid filtering by using alternative tools. Time-frequency analysis shares some of the same problems that filters have, particularly in the case of wavelet transforms. We recommend reporting filter characteristics with sufficient details, including a plot of the impulse or step response as an inset.

Stochastic processes and minimal-memory classical modelling

A discrete-time stochastic processconsists of a sequence of random variables X t, corresponding to events drawn from a set, and indexed by a timestep. The process is defined by a joint distribution of these random variables across all timesteps, whererepresents the contiguous (across timesteps) series of events between timesteps t 1 and t 2. We consider stochastic processes that are bi-infinite, such thatand, and stationary (time-invariant), such that P (X 0: L) = P (X t: t + L) ∀ t, L ∈. Without loss of generality, we can take the present to be t = 0, such that the past is given by, and the future. Note that we use upper case for random variables and lower case for the corresponding variates.

A (causal) model of such a (bi-infinite and stationary) discrete-time stochastic process consists of an encoding functionthat maps from the set of possible past observationsto a set of memory states –. The model also requires an update rulethat produces the outputs and updates the memory state accordingly. We then designate the memory cost D f of the encoding as the logarithm of the dimension (i.e. the number of (qu)bits) of the smallest system into which these memory states can be embedded. For classical (i.e. mutually orthogonal) memory states, this corresponds to. For quantum memory states, which may, in general, be linearly dependent.

Let us, for now, restrict our attention to statistically-exact models, such that (f, Λ) must produce outputs with a distribution that is identical to the stochastic process being modelled. Under such a condition, the provably-memory minimal classical model of any given discrete-time stochastic process is known and can be systematically constructed. These models are referred to as the ε - machine of the process, which employs an encoding function f ε based on the causal states of the process. This encoding function satisfiesand given initial memory state, the evolution produces output x 0 with probabilityand updates the memory to state. The memory states are referred to as the causal states of the process, and the associated cost D μ is given by the logarithm of the number of causal states.

### Oversimplifying quantum factoring [^9011a539]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Shor's quantum factoring algorithm exponentially outperforms known classical methods. Previous experimental implementations have used simplifications dependent on knowing the factors in advance. However, as we show here, all composite numbers admit simplification of the algorithm to a circuit equivalent to flipping coins. The difficulty of a particular experiment therefore depends on the level of simplification chosen, not the size of the number factored. Valid implementations should not make use of the answer sought.

### CurveCurator: a recalibrated F-statistic to assess, classify, and explore significance of dose-response curves [^d55d13ff]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

F-statistics and p -values

The basic idea behind the F-value in classical linear regression problems is to quantify how much better a more complex model (M 1 with k linear parameters) fits the data compared to a simpler model (M 0 with j linear parameters and j < k) given the n observed data points and the corresponding sum-squared errors (SSE) (Eq. 6).

Although not a linear model by nature, the log-logistic function still meets the required assumptions of random sampling, independence of observations, residual normality, and equal variance of the errors. The basic rationality behind CurveCurator's recalibrated F-statistic is similar to the linear F-statistic above. It also quantifies how much better the fitted log-logistic model (M 1) is compared to the mean model (M 0), which describes that there is no relationship between the applied dose and the observed response. We found, however, that n/k was a more appropriate scaling factor for the 4-parameter log-logistic function.

The obtained recalibrated F-value (Eq. 7) can then be used to calculate a p -value that quantifies how often a curve with a similar or bigger F-value can be found by random chance. We observed that these F-values follow a parameterized F-distribution with degrees of freedom that diverged from the case of linear models. Using extensive simulations under the null hypothesis (5 million curves for n = 5… 50), we obtained a simple quasi-linear function to calculate the "effective "degrees of freedom as a function of n (Eqs. 8–10).

### Odor-evoked inhibition of olfactory sensory neurons drives olfactory perception in drosophila [^80e6dcc8]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Equivalence of the kinetic approach and energetic approach: Both the kinetic and the energetic approaches can be used to describe the odor responses in OSNs. We used the energetic approach in the main text because it is easier to generalize to odor mixtures. The kinetic approach (Supplementary Fig. 9) can yield additional time-dependent information. However, this information is not considered in this study. In the following section, we determine the steady-state response by solving the kinetic equations. We first consider the simple situation with only one odor. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 9, an OR/OSN j can exist in two functional states: the active and the inactive states labeled byand R j, respectively. In addition, a receptor can be either bound or unbound by odor molecules L i. Therefore, there are four microscopic states: denoted as 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, for simplicity. The ligand binding/unbinding kinetics and the active/inactive kinetics among the four states are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 9 with their rates specified. The kinetics of the four microscopic states can be described by the following rate equations:where p n (t) is the probability in a given state n (= 1, 2, 3, 4) at time t with the sum P 1 + P 2 + P 3 + P 4 = 1.

### Limits on fundamental limits to computation [^98c96d2d]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

An indispensable part of our personal and working lives, computing has also become essential to industries and governments. Steady improvements in computer hardware have been supported by periodic doubling of transistor densities in integrated circuits over the past fifty years. Such Moore scaling now requires ever-increasing efforts, stimulating research in alternative hardware and stirring controversy. To help evaluate emerging technologies and increase our understanding of integrated-circuit scaling, here I review fundamental limits to computation in the areas of manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and algorithms. To outline what is achievable in principle and in practice, I recapitulate how some limits were circumvented, and compare loose and tight limits. Engineering difficulties encountered by emerging technologies may indicate yet unknown limits.

### Explaining a series of models by propagating shapley values [^85e04748]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Local feature attribution methods are increasingly used to explain complex machine learning models. However, current methods are limited because they are extremely expensive to compute or are not capable of explaining a distributed series of models where each model is owned by a separate institution. The latter is particularly important because it often arises in finance where explanations are mandated. Here, we present Generalized DeepSHAP (G-DeepSHAP), a tractable method to propagate local feature attributions through complex series of models based on a connection to the Shapley value. We evaluate G-DeepSHAP across biological, health, and financial datasets to show that it provides equally salient explanations an order of magnitude faster than existing model-agnostic attribution techniques and demonstrate its use in an important distributed series of models setting.

Mean fitnesses for different classes of offspring-mother combinations at Generation 10 4 in 1000 replicate constructionist simulations of maternal selection, plotted for different final numbers of alleles (n). Combination C iiii is the mean of homozygous offspring with homozygous mothers, for example, whereas C ijij is the mean of heterozygous offspring with identically heterozygous mothers. For a full explanation see text. Means for each class are shown in yellow circles.

It is also of interest to know about the values of the allele frequencies at Generation 10 4: Are these even or skewed? We can summarize information about the distribution using the sum of the squared distances from the centroid of the state space of allele frequencies. Large values of I indicate uneven allele frequencies; equal allele frequencies give I = 0. The distribution of the values of I for n = 2, 3, and 4 is shown in Figure 6, along with the values expected in allele frequencies drawn at random under the broken-stick model. For n = 2 we also plot the values of p 1. It is clear that for n = 2 and 3 (but not 4), constructed polymorphisms have allele frequencies that are more even than our random expectation. Also shown in Figure 6 are histograms of the values of I under the parameter-space approach. For n = 2 and 3, these values are intermediate; for n = 4, they are more even than both the random and constructed frequencies.

Figure 6

Also shown (black solid lines) is the distribution expected if allele frequencies were random, values generated using the broken-stick approach. For n = 2, the same information is shown as a small histogram of the respective values of p 1.

### Optimizing case reports and case series: guidance on how to improve quality [^4020b18a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Case reports and case series remain an important part of journals and are often first to document medical breakthroughs. This article reviews their characteristics, aims and limitations. It provides information on how to increase the validity of the bedside decision-making process that these studies report, using tools such as validated outcomes and split-body or n-of-1 trials. A section describing tools to improve writing of case reports and case series provides suggestions for detailed reporting and good evaluation of novelty, validity and relevance. It includes general and British Journal of Dermatology-specific guidance.

### Exponential rise of dynamical complexity in quantum computing through projections [^deca14e4]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The ability of quantum systems to host exponentially complex dynamics has the potential to revolutionize science and technology. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to developing of protocols for computation, communication and metrology, which exploit this scaling, despite formidable technical difficulties. Here we show that the mere frequent observation of a small part of a quantum system can turn its dynamics from a very simple one into an exponentially complex one, capable of universal quantum computation. After discussing examples, we go on to show that this effect is generally to be expected: almost any quantum dynamics becomes universal once 'observed' as outlined above. Conversely, we show that any complex quantum dynamics can be 'purified' into a simpler one in larger dimensions. We conclude by demonstrating that even local noise can lead to an exponentially complex dynamics.

### IDEAL framework for surgical innovation 1: the idea and development stages [^3d05d33f]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Development (IDEAL stage 2a)

The IDEAL development stage begins once surgeons start to plan a series of procedures using a new technique or device (table). Innovations are especially fluid in this phase; innovations undergo rapid iterative change in the light of experience. Therefore, it is the development stage that most clearly differentiates the pathway for surgery innovation from that for pharmaceutical innovations. In both a scientific and ethical sense, development is the most problematic of the stages, and as a result is often poorly reported.

Experience often makes the need for modification obvious after only a few repetitions, although surgeons are insecure about the logical and ethical justification for making changes on the basis of scarce data that are not definitive. It is therefore tempting for authors to wait until the development stage has ended, and then report the initial results as if the final version of the technique had been used in all cases. This strategy is adopted in the classic retrospective surgical case series, and is deeply problematic. Obscuring details that authors may not wish to report deprives others of the opportunity to learn from the development process, and can provide a misleading picture of the use of a procedure or device. Authors obscuring changes in eligibility, which naturally occur during development, in order to make it appear predetermined is similarly unhelpful. If the patients undergoing a technique are different at the beginning and end of a reported series, the aggregate outcome might not indicate much about what can be expected from using the final version of the technique in the patient group that trial and error has shown to be most suited to it.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^3057acbd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Protocols — scope and utility in the intensive care unit distinguish protocols from clinical practice guidelines by stating that after initiation "the protocol prescribes a specific series of behaviors… or changes in treatment… without the requirement of further clinician input". Protocols may be adopted from research studies, but "this approach is not always appropriate". In the ICU, "protocols may help avoid errors of omission, improve unit efficiency, decrease cost, and maintain standard of care", yet "are not always superior to expert clinician-directed care". They are "particularly useful for setting "default" actions in common decisions", and "are likely to be less valuable when applied to highly variable clinical processes, particularly those with multiple and competing endpoints".

### Fundamental limits to learning closed-form mathematical models from data [^be546343]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To address the model-learning question above, we formulate the problem of identifying the true generating model probabilistically, and show that probabilistic model selection is quasi-optimal at generalization, that is, at making predictions about unobserved data. This is in contrast to standard machine learning approaches, which, in this case, are suboptimal in the region of low observation noise. We then investigate the transition occurring between: (i) a learnable phase at low observation noise, in which the true model can in principle be learned from the data; and (ii) an unlearnable phase, in which the observation noise is too large for the true model to be learned from the data by any method. Finally, we provide an upper bound for the noise at which the learnability transition takes place, that is, the noise beyond which the true generating model cannot be learned by any method. This bound corresponds to the noise at which most plausible a priori models, which we call trivial, become more parsimonious descriptions of the data than the true generating model. Despite the simplicity of the approach, the bound provides a good approximation to the actual transition point.

### Fundamental limits to learning closed-form mathematical models from data [^a345300f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Given a finite and noisy dataset generated with a closed-form mathematical model, when is it possible to learn the true generating model from the data alone? This is the question we investigate here. We show that this model-learning problem displays a transition from a low-noise phase in which the true model can be learned, to a phase in which the observation noise is too high for the true model to be learned by any method. Both in the low-noise phase and in the high-noise phase, probabilistic model selection leads to optimal generalization to unseen data. This is in contrast to standard machine learning approaches, including artificial neural networks, which in this particular problem are limited, in the low-noise phase, by their ability to interpolate. In the transition region between the learnable and unlearnable phases, generalization is hard for all approaches including probabilistic model selection.

### Next generation reservoir computing [^398d0bfe]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Reservoir computing is a best-in-class machine learning algorithm for processing information generated by dynamical systems using observed time-series data. Importantly, it requires very small training data sets, uses linear optimization, and thus requires minimal computing resources. However, the algorithm uses randomly sampled matrices to define the underlying recurrent neural network and has a multitude of metaparameters that must be optimized. Recent results demonstrate the equivalence of reservoir computing to nonlinear vector autoregression, which requires no random matrices, fewer metaparameters, and provides interpretable results. Here, we demonstrate that nonlinear vector autoregression excels at reservoir computing benchmark tasks and requires even shorter training data sets and training time, heralding the next generation of reservoir computing.

### An introduction to machine learning [^70a823d9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Different categories of loss functions

Different objective functions can be chosen to measure the distance between observed data and values predicted by the model. Some of the distance metrics used in practice can be associated to a likelihood. The likelihood indicates how probable it is to observe our data according to the selected model. The most common use of a likelihood is to find the parameters that make the model fit optimally to the data (i.e. the maximum likelihood parameter estimates). Usually, the negative logarithm of the likelihood is minimized and considered as objective function because it has favorable numerical properties. Similarly, in ML metrics, such as mean squared error, logistic objective, or cross‐entropy, are used to find optimal parameters or assess the fitness of the model.

In practice, analytical calculation of maximum likelihood or minimal loss may not be feasible, and it is often necessary to use a numerical optimization algorithm to solve for the best parameter values. Gradient descent is such an algorithm, where we first define an objective function for which we want to minimize and then iteratively update the values of the parameters in the direction with the steepest decrease (first‐order derivative) of the objective function until a convergence to a minimum distance is deemed reached. In the scenario of a nonconvex objective function, the success of finding a global minimum, as opposed to landing in some local minima, will depend on the choice of the initial set of parameter values, the learning rate (i.e. step size of each iteration) and the criterion for convergence. The reader can refer to ref. 35 for details on convex and nonconvex optimization processes. Stochastic gradient descent is an additional trick that can further speed up the optimization by randomly sampling a training dataset and summing the distances across this subset of training data points for approximating the objective function.

### Statistical ensembles without typicality [^c8e48c72]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Maximum-entropy ensembles are key primitives in statistical mechanics. Several approaches have been developed in order to justify the use of these ensembles in statistical descriptions. However, there is still no full consensus on the precise reasoning justifying the use of such ensembles. In this work, we provide an approach to derive maximum-entropy ensembles, taking a strictly operational perspective. We investigate the set of possible transitions that a system can undergo together with an environment, when one only has partial information about the system and its environment. The set of these transitions encodes thermodynamic laws and limitations on thermodynamic tasks as particular cases. Our main result is that the possible transitions are exactly those that are possible if both system and environment are assigned the maximum-entropy state compatible with the partial information. This justifies the overwhelming success of such ensembles and provides a derivation independent of typicality or information-theoretic measures.

### Interpreting trial results-time for confidence and magnitude and not P values please [^f6868fcd]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

The problems with the P value as the single metric to summarize the results of a study are being recognized. It captures a single domain-random error-but it is relatively uninformative about more critical domains for deciding whether the results should be applied to clinical care and policy. Alternatives include the components of the outcomes reported (relevance, magnitude, frailty, and net benefit) and confidence (risk of bias and directness).

### Selecting fitted models under epistemic uncertainty using a stochastic process on quantile functions [^aeeaae45]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fitting models to data is an important part of the practice of science. Advances in machine learning have made it possible to fit more-and more complex-models, but have also exacerbated a problem: when multiple models fit the data equally well, which one(s) should we pick? The answer depends entirely on the modelling goal. In the scientific context, the essential goal is replicability: if a model works well to describe one experiment, it should continue to do so when that experiment is replicated tomorrow, or in another laboratory. The selection criterion must therefore be robust to the variations inherent to the replication process. In this work we develop a nonparametric method for estimating uncertainty on a model's empirical risk when replications are non-stationary, thus ensuring that a model is only rejected when another is reproducibly better. We illustrate the method with two examples: one a more classical setting, where the models are structurally distinct, and a machine learning-inspired setting, where they differ only in the value of their parameters. We show how, in this context of replicability or "epistemic uncertainty", it compares favourably to existing model selection criteria, and has more satisfactory behaviour with large experimental datasets.

CHEST strength of recommendations — strong recommendations are graded 1A, 1B, and 1C with specified evidence and implications. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (1B): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Strong recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (1C): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

### A general derivation and quantification of the third law of thermodynamics [^43738480]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The most accepted version of the third law of thermodynamics, the unattainability principle, states that any process cannot reach absolute zero temperature in a finite number of steps and within a finite time. Here, we provide a derivation of the principle that applies to arbitrary cooling processes, even those exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics or involving an infinite-dimensional reservoir. We quantify the resources needed to cool a system to any temperature, and translate these resources into the minimal time or number of steps, by considering the notion of a thermal machine that obeys similar restrictions to universal computers. We generally find that the obtainable temperature can scale as an inverse power of the cooling time. Our results also clarify the connection between two versions of the third law (the unattainability principle and the heat theorem), and place ultimate bounds on the speed at which information can be erased.

### Selecting fitted models under epistemic uncertainty using a stochastic process on quantile functions [^bb9b7f12]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

After n refinement steps, we thus obtain a functiondefined at discrete points:which we extend to the entire interval [0, 1) by linear interpolation; see Fig. 5 d for an illustration. In practice we found that computations (specifically the risk computed by integrating) converge after about eight refinement steps.

This procedure has the important property that once a point is sampled, it does not change on further refinements:which follows from equation (67). Recall now that, as stated above, a process is self-consistent if "for small enough Δ Φ, the probability distribution at a point Φ [does] not depend on the level of refinement". Since equation (70) clearly satisfies that requirement, we see that the process obtained after infinitely many refinement steps is indeed self-consistent. We thus define the hierarchical beta (HB) process as

To complete the definition of, we need to specify how we choose the initial end pointsand. In our implementation, they are drawn from normal distributionswith Φ ∈ {0, 1}, where again c is determined via our proposed calibration procedure; this is simple and convenient, but otherwise arbitrary. We also need to explain how we choose the beta parameters α and β, which is the topic of the next subsection.

Choosing beta distribution parameters

All HB processes are monotone, continuous and self-consistent, but within this class there is still a lot of flexibility: since α and β are chosen independently for each subinterval, we can mouldinto a wide variety of statistical shapes. We use this flexibility to satisfy the two remaining desiderata: a) that realisationstrackover Φ ∈ [0, 1]; and b) that the variability ofbe proportional to. It is the goal of this subsection to give a precise mathematical meaning to those requirements.

Let x 1 ~ Beta(α, β) and x 2 = 1 − x 1. (The density function of a beta distribution is given in (24).) The mean and variance of x 1 areFor a given Φ, it may seem natural to select α and β by matchingtoandto. However both equations are tightly coupled, and we found that numerical solutions were unstable and unsatisfactory; in particular, it is not possible to make the variance large whenapproaches either 0 or 1 (otherwise the distribution of x 1 would exceed [0, 1]).

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Model selection: finding the right fit [^6940b900]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

There are numerous possible goals for building statistical models. Those statistical goals, the associated model types, and each statistical tool involved in model building come with its own assumptions and requirements. In turn, these requirements must be met if we are to ensure that our models produce meaningful, interpretable results. However, beyond these technical details is the intuition, and the additional set of tools and algorithms, used by the statistician, to build the contextually appropriate model: not only must we build an interpretable model, we must build a model that answers the particular question at hand and addresses the particular goal we have in mind. In this column we discuss the methods by which statisticians build models for description, risk factor identification, and prediction.

Meta-analyses by definition are a subtype of systematic review intended to quantitatively assess the strength of evidence present on an intervention or treatment. Such analyses may use individual-level data or aggregate data to produce a point estimate of an effect, also known as the combined effect, and measure precision of the calculated estimate. The current article will review several important considerations during the analytic phase of a meta-analysis, including selection of effect estimators, heterogeneity and various sub-types of meta-analytic approaches.

### Statistical inference links data and theory in network science [^2e83d877]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

As attractive as it sounds that we can represent so many complex systems as networks to make use of a common set of tools, ultimately we should be moving away from creating one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, we should be working more closely together to develop rigorous methods that incorporate relevant domain knowledge and allow us to probe more deeply and directly address the questions that can only be answered by viewing the system as a whole.

Here we have demonstrated how generative models provide promising means to progress towards these common goals. Generative models are extensible and can be easily adapted to explicitly encode specific hypotheses and assumptions about complex systems and how we observe them. Statistical inference allows us to fit these models and compare levels of support for competing hypotheses. Developing end-to-end models in this manner acknowledges that the process of network analysis, from data to conclusion, is itself a complex system. No stage in the analytical process is independent and therefore should not be handled in isolation. Our design decisions across the whole of the analytical process should be connected such that specific choices can inform one another.

Based on our analysis, we can identify a succinct set of best practices for the next advances of network science and its applications to domain-specific challenges. First, we must understand the provenance of network data and make explicit, via a generative model, the underlying abstraction that one wishes to extract from it. Ideally, our chosen abstraction should not depend on an arbitrary choice of spatial and/or temporal granularity, or we should at least demonstrate that the resulting analysis is not sensitive to this choice. Second, we must incorporate, both theoretically and in practice, the presence and the effects of errors and incompleteness in network measurements. Third, when developing a new analytical approach, we should validate it on synthetic data to guarantee that expected outcomes are found. If the validity of a method cannot be demonstrated on controlled synthetic experiments, results obtained when it is applied to empirical data have little value.

### Research techniques made simple: sample size Estimation and power calculation [^b2b6b836]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Sample size and power calculations help determine if a study is feasible based on a priori assumptions about the study results and available resources. Trade-offs must be made between the probability of observing the true effect and the probability of type I errors (α, false positive) and type II errors (β, false negative). Calculations require specification of the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis, type of outcome measure and statistical test, α level, β, effect size, and variability (if applicable). Because the choice of these parameters may be quite arbitrary in some cases, one approach is to calculate the sample size or power over a range of plausible parameters before selecting the final sample size or power. Considerations that should be taken into account could include correction for nonadherence of the participants, adjustment for multiple comparisons, or innovative study designs.

### Evidence for ligand-and solvent-induced disproportionation of uranium (IV) [^f75250cd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Crystallographic characterisation

The characterisation data and crystallographic unit cell checks for 4K / Rb / Cs produced by disproportionation match those of authentic samples –. The solid-state structures of the 3M and 5M series were determined, confirming their formulations, Figs. 2 and 3 (Supplementary Tables 1–6). For each complex, a triamidoamine-uranium component is bound to a central nitrogen, that resides in the pocket defined by the Tren TIPS ligand, with that nitrogen atom bridging to a Me 6 -Tren-capped alkali metal. The salient, key difference between the 3M and 5M series is the presence of a hydrogen atom on the central nitrogen of the 3M imido complexes, whereas no hydrogen atom is present in the 5M nitride series, resulting in decisively different, and characteristic, U-N imido bond lengths that average 2.007 Å (range: 1.979(4)–2.070(4) Å) for the 3M series and shorter U-N nitride distances averaging 1.810 Å (range: 1.792(4)–1.823(3) Å) for the 5M complexes. For comparison, the U-N imido distances in the 2M series span the range 2.042(3)–2.135(3) Å, uranium(V)-nitride complexes of the form [U V (Tren TIPS)(μ-N)(μ-M)(crown)] exhibit U-N nitride distances spanning the range 1.803(5)–1.840(3) Å, and the sum of the covalent radii for doubly and triply bonded uranium and nitrogen are 1.94 and 1.72 Å, respectively. Notably, the U-N-M angles span a larger range for the 3M series (141.01(19)–175.8(2)°) compared to the 5M series (155.8(3)–177.66(18)°), consistent with the nitride ligand being a harder and less flexible ligand than imido.

### Information-theoretic implications of quantum causal structures [^2cf5e80e]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

It is a relatively new insight of classical statistics that empirical data can contain information about causation rather than mere correlation. First algorithms have been proposed that are capable of testing whether a presumed causal relationship is compatible with an observed distribution. However, no systematic method is known for treating such problems in a way that generalizes to quantum systems. Here, we describe a general algorithm for computing information-theoretic constraints on the correlations that can arise from a given causal structure, where we allow for quantum systems as well as classical random variables. The general technique is applied to two relevant cases: first, we show that the principle of information causality appears naturally in our framework and go on to generalize and strengthen it. Second, we derive bounds on the correlations that can occur in a networked architecture, where a set of few-body quantum systems is distributed among some parties.

### The certainty behind reporting a significance result: what the clinician should know [^c7e6f766]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

The P value is the most common method used in medical literature for the result of a statistical test. It is the probability of the data with a true null hypothesis and is calculated using a formal statistical test after the appropriate model has been determined to analyze study data. The P value is dependent on the effect size, sample size, and a measure of variability within the outcomes. For many years, the P value has been set at 0.05, which is an arbitrary cutoff. It is important to understand that setting the cutoff at 0.05 may be correct for some study designs but not in others. Therefore, we recommend that in addition to the P value, another metric should be reported that specifies the magnitude of the effect such as effect size, confidence interval of the effect size, or fragility index.

In the first round, acquired on a Krios G2 at 81 k× magnification (corresponding to ~0.94 Å/pixel) and a dose rate of ~8 e − Å −2 s −1, four tilt series were obtained in a tilting range of ± 60° in a tilting step of 5° and total dose of ~325 e − Å −2 (at exposure time of ~1.43 s per tilt image); two series were collected in a tilting range of ± 50° in a tilting step of 5° and a total dose of ~168 e − Å −2 (at an exposure time of ~0.88 s per tilt image); one series was obtained in a tilting range of ± 51° in a tilting step of 3° and total dose of ~280 e − Å −2 (at an exposure time of ~0.88 s per tilt image); one series was acquired in a tilting range of ± 60° in a tilting step of 5° and total dose of ~200 e − Å −2 (at an exposure time of ~0.88 s per tilt image); one series was collected in a tilting range of ± 56° in a tilting step of 7° and total dose of ~221 e − Å −2 (at an exposure time of ~1.43 s per tilt image).

### Estimation of multicomponent reactions' yields from networks of mechanistic steps [^0ade1543]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Given these limitations, we recently began to teach the computer mechanistic transformations which, when applied to desired substrates, propagate large networks of mechanistic steps. In ref. we encoded some 400 mechanistic steps specific to carbocations, and used the network approach to predict the mechanisms of complex carbocationic rearrangements. Therein, we parametrized the heights of kinetic barriers (based on quantum-mechanical calculations) and used this knowledge of kinetics to predict products' distributions and yields. More recently, we deployed a much larger set of ~8000 general-scope mechanistic transforms (cf. below) and applied them to multiple small-molecule substrates. This effort was intended to trace mechanistic pathways defining new multicomponent reactions, MCRs, which are particularly appealing because they offer high atom-economy, minimize separation and purification operations, and can yield complex scaffolds that are often less prone to follow-up or side reactions than non-MCR reactions. Indeed, in ref. we described how such analyses enable systematic discovery of plausible MCRs candidates, of which multiple we validated by experiment. An essential part of this effort has been the ability to estimate the yields of these MCRs – would multicomponent substrate mixtures result in a mixture of low-yielding products, or would they lead to a major product in good yield? Unfortunately, given the number and diversity of mechanistic steps in the 8000 set, QM calculations of kinetic barriers have proven prohibitive – instead, we pursued and describe here a physical-organic approach in which kinetics of mechanistic steps is approximated by using nucleophilicity and electrophilicity indices and linear free-energy relationships. We train this model on the mechanistic networks of 20 known MCRs (chosen to span a wide range of yields, Fig. 1a, c) and then apply it to predict the yields of our newly-discovered MCRs (Fig. 1b, d) that not only use different substrates but are also based on unprecedented mechanisms. Despite such fundamental mechanistical differences, the model transfers between the training and testing MCRs, achieving similar– and in the light of previous effort, quite satisfactory – performance metrics (e.g. mean absolute errors, MAE = 10.5% and 7.3%, respectively). These results suggest that mechanistic-level approach to yield estimation may be a useful alternative to models derived from full reaction data, although – as we also emphasize in our discussion – it is certainly pending future extensions of the 8000 rule set and validation on larger sets of mechanistic networks.

### Designed improvement to T-cell immunotherapy by multidimensional single cell profiling [^e92c11ec]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

The inability to sustain granule polarization underlies CAR T cell failure to kill tumor cells

Since we established that non-killer T cells are defective in cytotoxicity, we utilized kinetic modeling to understand the origin of the failed killing events. The interaction between T cells and the target cells can be conceptualized as a series of sequential intermediates: receptor ligation and activation, polarization of the granules towards the microtubule organizing center, degranulation, and target cell apoptosis (figure 3A). We hypothesized that the nature in which effector-target associations transition from conjugation to detachment occurs in a gamma-distributed fashion (online supplemental figure 6). This implies that effector-target conjugation times are a multistep reaction consisting of N app intermediate steps with identical rate constants k app. Effector-target conjugation behaviors that possess the same kinetic profile are hypothesized to have a single defined rate-limiting step whereas inconsistent failure/stalling at any intermediate step will lead to an incongruent solution for the model. For kill events (E:T 1:1 to 1:3), we find estimated values of N app ≥ 1, suggesting that the kinetics for kill events is dominated by a rate-determining step (figure 3B). By contrast, no-kill events have N app < 1, which is physically impossible for the kinetic system described by the gamma distribution. Consistently across all of the E:T ratios, the non-killers are dominated by T cells with persistent contact with tumor cells indicative of stalling at a kinetic step before detachment. In aggregate, killing events appear to be kinetically homogeneous, whereas no-kill events seem to stratify into kinetically distinct subpopulations indicative of failure at one of the many sequential steps associated with killing.

### Additional sampling directions improve detection range of wireless radiofrequency probes [^df2ccd39]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Coordinate Correspondence

We determined the marker locations choosing the first three noncollinear readout directions d i (i = 1,2,3) along which we detected three peaks p ij (j = 1,2,3). Each peak defines a plane E ij orthogonal to d i. We computed the points of intersection m n (n = 1,2, …,27) between all combinations of E ij. To find the marker locations, we used the remaining directions d k (k = 4,5, …, N) and orthogonal planes E kj. The distance of each point m n to each of these planes was transformed into a score using a Gaussian function of unit height and 2.3 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) (FWHM of the peaks in the projections); the values were summed over j and k to give a metric that ranked the points m n in terms of their likelihood of being the marker positions.

A 2D example of how the additional navigators are used is shown in Figure 1. Because the marker locations must be consistent with each acquired signal, increasing the number of navigators reduces ambiguities that may result.

Figure 1
Two‐dimensional schematic showing how more sampling directions reduce the ambiguity in the back projection. A: Two directions with three markers could represent nine locations. B: A third direction removes the ambiguity and uniquely identifies the probes. C: A slightly different configuration, however, is still ambiguous. D: A fourth direction resolves the issue. In practice, a statistical approach is needed, as described in the text. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at.]

When three peaks were detected along fewer than six of the 21 directions, it was not possible to determine the marker locations, and tracking data were interpolated by copying estimates from the previous acquisition

### Quantum simulation of exact electron dynamics can be more efficient than classical mean-field methods [^6cc12fd0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Quantum algorithms for simulating electronic ground states are slower than popular classical mean-field algorithms such as Hartree–Fock and density functional theory but offer higher accuracy. Accordingly, quantum computers have been predominantly regarded as competitors to only the most accurate and costly classical methods for treating electron correlation. However, here we tighten bounds showing that certain first-quantized quantum algorithms enable exact time evolution of electronic systems with exponentially less space and polynomially fewer operations in basis set size than conventional real-time time-dependent Hartree–Fock and density functional theory. Although the need to sample observables in the quantum algorithm reduces the speedup, we show that one can estimate all elements of the k -particle reduced density matrix with a number of samples scaling only polylogarithmically in basis set size. We also introduce a more efficient quantum algorithm for first-quantized mean-field state preparation that is likely cheaper than the cost of time evolution. We conclude that quantum speedup is most pronounced for finite-temperature simulations and suggest several practically important electron dynamics problems with potential quantum advantage.

CHEST guideline development — evidence threshold for evidence-based vs consensus-based approaches is described as follows: GOC has set the threshold for a guideline at "two RCTs, two observational studies, or one of each" that address comparable interventions and outcomes "with a quality level assessed as fair or good", and "This minimum permits pooling of the data for meta-analysis". An exception allows that "one exceptional study of very high quality might accommodate the evidence-based guideline approach, but only with approval of the GOC Guidelines Subcommittee".

### Power of data in quantum machine learning [^03099894]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Given some set of data, if s K (N) is found to be small relative to N after training for a classical ML model, this quantum model f (x) can be predicted accurately even if f (x) is hard to compute classically for any given x. In order to formally evaluate the potential for quantum prediction advantage generally, one must take s K (N) to be the minimal over efficient classical models. However, we will be more focused on minimally attainable values over a reasonable set of classical methods with tuned hyperparameters. This prescribes an effective method for evaluating potential quantum advantage in practice, and already rules out a considerable number of examples from the literature.

From the bound, we can see that the potential advantage for one ML algorithm defined by K 1 to predict better than another ML algorithm defined by K 2 depends on the largest possible separation betweenandfor a dataset. The separation can be characterized by defining an asymmetric geometric difference that depends on the dataset, but is independent of the function values or labels. Hence evaluating this quantity is a good first step in understanding if there is a potential for quantum advantage, as shown in Fig. 1. This quantity is defined bywhere ∣∣. ∣∣ ∞ is the spectral norm of the resulting matrix and we assume Tr(K 1) = Tr(K 2) = N. One can show that, which implies the prediction error bound. A detailed derivation is given in Supplementary Section C and an illustration of g 12 can be found in Fig. 2. The geometric difference g (K 1 ∣∣ K 2) can be computed on a classical computer by performing a singular value decomposition of the N × N matrices K 1 and K 2. Standard numerical analysis packagesprovide highly efficient computation of a singular value decomposition in time at most order N 3. Intuitively, if K 1 (x i, x j) is small/large when K 2 (x i, x j) is small/large, then the geometric difference g 12 is a small value ~1, where g 12 grows as the kernels deviate.

### Experimental designs for phase I and phase I / II dose-finding studies [^9715d3f5]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND

For cytotoxic anticancer drugs, it is assumed that there exists a dose–toxicity effect whereby the higher the dose, the greater the risk of observing dose-limiting toxicity. The goal of dose-finding studies is to find the highest tolerable dosage: the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that corresponds to some given acceptable toxicity rate. In studies of treatment efficacy, similar methodology is employed aiming to identify a dose capable of producing a given rate of success. A model that is widely assumed for cytotoxics, although (as for any model) open to debate, is a model that assumes monotonicity. This means that when a patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity at a specific level, then, had this same patient been treated at any higher level he would also have suffered dose-limiting toxicity. Conversely, were the patient to tolerate the treatment at a specific dosage, then, for all lower levels, the patient would also have tolerated treatment. This is reasonable in most cases but might need to be questioned in certain situations, for example, for immunological therapies. Figure 1 illustrates three such dose toxicity curves for three hypothetical patients. Owing to patient variability, each patient responds at a different level. Some patients are able to tolerate higher levels of treatment than others. Most often we will not be able to know for any individual just what their particular dose toxicity (0, 1) step function might be; in other words, the lowest level at which the patient would encounter a dose-limiting toxicity. However, we can learn this for a group of subjects. In the light of patient variability, the lowest level for one patient may differ from that for another. Were we to take an average over the three patients, we would have a step function with steps of size 1/3 at the observed change points. Were we to target a level where 33% of subjects encounter a DLT, then we could estimate a point above dose d 3 and below dose d 4. This would of course be a rough estimate, since three patients may not be enough to capture the effects of a much larger group. However, as we include bigger samples, we can conceive of the simple step function for three patients becoming more refined and eventually looking something like Figure 2. In practice, we will not know such a curve and the problem is to find the dose d i such that some given percentage of patients will encounter a DLT at this dose and higher doses. Technically, our problem is to inverse the curve in Figure 2. This inversion would tell us which dose corresponds to some given rate of toxicity.

### Reconstruction of stochastic temporal networks through diffusive arrival times [^3c835452]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Temporal networks have opened a new dimension in defining and quantification of complex interacting systems. Our ability to identify and reproduce time-resolved interaction patterns is, however, limited by the restricted access to empirical individual-level data. Here we propose an inverse modelling method based on first-arrival observations of the diffusion process taking place on temporal networks. We describe an efficient coordinate-ascent implementation for inferring stochastic temporal networks that builds in particular but not exclusively on the null model assumption of mutually independent interaction sequences at the dyadic level. The results of benchmark tests applied on both synthesized and empirical network data sets confirm the validity of our algorithm, showing the feasibility of statistically accurate inference of temporal networks only from moderate-sized samples of diffusion cascades. Our approach provides an effective and flexible scheme for the temporally augmented inverse problems of network reconstruction and has potential in a broad variety of applications.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Understanding variation: part1-the run chart [^45372380]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

This paper briefly describes different types of data, how to collect data, the rationale for organizing data in a time-ordered fashion, and how to use a simple tool called a run chart to present and analyze data. The run chart is simple to construct and equally as simple to analyze. Run charts make variation visible and determine whether a change has made an improvement and if the improvement is being sustained. Two probability rules accompany run charts to help answer the question "How will we know that a change is an improvement?". These rules provide an objective statistical threshold to determine whether changes from quality improvement efforts are having an impact. Quality improvement and data go hand-in-hand. To qualify as quality improvement, projects should have a well-developed data collection and analysis strategy. A run chart and the rules presented in the following paper are simple, statistically valid tools used to answer the question "How will we know that a change is an improvement?".

### Extensive benchmarking of a method that estimates external model performance from limited statistical characteristics [^cae2d43b]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficient approximate weighting

As in this benchmark we deal with larger scale problems than those tested in ref. we developed a more efficient algorithm by approximating the problem represented in Equation (5). First, to satisfy equality constraints, we formulate the following optimization problem:Second, to maintain weights that are as close to uniform as possible, we use an exponentiated gradient algorithmand initialize the algorithm with uniform weights. At every iteration t of the gradient descent algorithm, it attempts to decrease the objective while maintaining the normalization constraints using the following updates:where ∇ f (w) is the gradient of f, specifically, ∇ f (w) = Φ (Φ ⊤ w t − μ ext), and α is a pre-specified optimization rate. As every iteration locally minimizes f (w t +1) + α ⋅ K L (w t +1 ∥ w t), it tends to reduce the objective while attempting to maintain proximity between the weights in consecutive steps. Therefore, we use the heuristic of initializing the search with uniform weights.

Assumptions and conditions for running the algorithm

We pose two assumptions about the underlying data distributions of the internal and external cohorts that should be satisfied to give accurate estimations. First, for all the features contributing to the prediction model, whenever the external joint probability of a given feature and outcome values is greater than zero, so is their internal one. We call this assumption one-sided positivity, as it is analogous to the positivity, also known as overlap, assumption in causal inference. Second, we assume that the external distribution is relatively close to the internal one among the set of distributions that have expectations μ ext. Intuitively, the plausibility of this assumption increases with the richness of the transformation ϕ of which we share external statistics. In other words, the assumption states that the statistics shared between the external and internal systems are sufficient to give a good approximation of the data shift between them.

Estimation pipeline

We implemented an estimation pipeline that combines the weighting algorithm and various tests to assess the feasibility of accurate estimations. Specifically, it includes the following steps:
Assess one-sided positivity for each element in the external statistics
If one-sided positivity holds: run the optimization algorithm to solve the problem represented in Equation (6) and obtain weights.
If external statistics are reproduced: estimate external performance using the weighted dataset.

Confidence intervals can be computed using repeated re-sampling and weighting of the internal cohort.

### Modeling physical activity outcomes from wearable monitors [^17f1ff44]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2012). Low credibility.

Although the measurement of physical activity with wearable monitors may be considered objective, consensus guidelines for collecting and processing these objective data are lacking. This article presents an algorithm embodying best practice recommendations for collecting, processing, and reporting physical activity data routinely collected with accelerometry-based activity monitors. This algorithm is proposed as a linear series of seven steps within three successive phases. The Precollection Phase includes two steps. Step 1 defines the population of interest, the type and intensity of physical activity behaviors to be targeted, and the preferred outcome variables, and identifies the epoch duration. In Step 2, the activity monitor is selected, and decisions about how long and where on the body the monitor is to be worn are made. The Data Collection Phase, Step 3, consists of collecting and processing activity monitor data and is dependent on decisions made previously. The Postcollection Phase consists of four steps. Step 4 involves quality and quantity control checks of the activity monitor data. In Step 5, the raw data are transformed into physiologically meaningful units using a calibration algorithm. Step 6 involves summarizing these data according to the target behavior. In Step 7, physical activity outcome variables based on time, energy expenditure, or movement type are generated. Best practice recommendations include the full disclosure of each step within the algorithm when reporting monitor-derived physical activity outcome variables in the research literature. As such, those reading and publishing within the research literature, as well as future users, will have the best chance for understanding the interactions between study methodology and activity monitor selection, as well as the best possibility for relating their own monitor-derived physical activity outcome variables to the research literature.

### Quantum simulation of exact electron dynamics can be more efficient than classical mean-field methods [^ed2f5196]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Finally, we note that quantum algorithms can also perform finite-temperature simulation by sampling initial states from a thermal density matrix in each realization of the circuit. For example, if the system is in a regime that is well treated by mean-field theory, one can initialize the system in a Slater determinant that is sampled from the thermal Hartree–Fock state. Since the output of quantum simulations already needs to be sampled this does not meaningfully increase the number of quantum repetitions required. Such an approach would also be viable classically (and would allow one to perform simulations that only ever treat η occupied orbitals despite having finite temperature) but would introduce a multiplicativesampling cost. For either processor, there is the cost of classically computing the thermal Hartree–Fock state, but this is a one-time cost not multiplied by the duration of time-evolution or.

### Statistical analysis and optimality of neural systems [^bf829ef6]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

Normative theories and statistical inference provide complementary approaches for the study of biological systems. A normative theory postulates that organisms have adapted to efficiently solve essential tasks and proceeds to mathematically work out testable consequences of such optimality; parameters that maximize the hypothesized organismal function can be derived ab initio, without reference to experimental data. In contrast, statistical inference focuses on the efficient utilization of data to learn model parameters, without reference to any a priori notion of biological function. Traditionally, these two approaches were developed independently and applied separately. Here, we unify them in a coherent Bayesian framework that embeds a normative theory into a family of maximum-entropy "optimization priors". This family defines a smooth interpolation between a data-rich inference regime and a data-limited prediction regime. Using three neuroscience datasets, we demonstrate that our framework allows one to address fundamental challenges relating to inference in high-dimensional, biological problems.

### Is a one-size-fits-all'12-month rule' appropriate when it comes to the last search date in systematic reviews? [^71179c4e]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

SRs are a recognised research approach for identifying, synthesising and analysing published evidence on topics of interest. Their aim is to provide a comprehensive, unbiased and trustworthy assessment of available evidence to support decision-makers in adopting policies that 'do more good than harm'. Indeed, policy makers, researchers, practitioners and public stakeholders from within and outside of healthcare, place increased emphasis on the importance of conducting SRs. Although the rationale for conducting SRs remains the same, the process of systematic reviewing has changed significantly in recent years. Technological advances and automation have helped to speed up processes such as study identification. However, additional steps in the review process, reflecting new understandings about how to ensure SR findings are robust and relevant to policy decision-makers' questions, have increased the work required. Continued increases in available published evidence have also increased the volume of research included and analysed in SRs. We suggest that there are two key factors that have significant time implications for reviewers today.

Breadth and depth of review questions impacts on the extent of work required

While historically SR questions were designed to be narrow, the Cochrane Handbook recognises that 'Increasingly, reviews are becoming broader, aiming, for example, to identify which intervention — out of a range of treatment options — is most effective, or to investigate how an intervention varies depending on implementation and participant characteristics'. Review methods have evolved, resulting in a rich diversity of SRs in relation to the types of questions, review approaches and research methods. In figure 1, we provide examples to characterise different types of reviews that explore intervention effectiveness and the questions they seek to answer. Although we focus on reviews addressing intervention effectiveness, the breadth and complexity of reviews addressing other types of question is also likely to vary.

Variation in the breadth and complexity of reviews addressing intervention effectiveness.

There are numerous factors that may impact on the time required to complete broad, complex or multicomponent reviews and thus increase their risk of remaining unpublished. Below we discuss six key factors.

### Understanding variation-part 2: the control chart [^509e23e6]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Both run and control charts can be used to answer the question "How will we know that a change is an improvement?". Run charts are advantageous at the start of an improvement effort, when little is known about the system and how it performs. Over time, transitioning to a control chart may provide more specific information and insight into the data being measured. The type of numeric data being collected helps guide the most appropriate choice of control chart. Control chart rules exist and should be used to determine if a change in the data represents common cause or special cause variation. Similar to run charts, it is important not to over- or under-react to a single point on a control chart. Control chart rules help quality improvers determine whether interventions being tested are having a meaningful impact on the system.

### Writing it up: a step-by-step guide to publication for beginning investigators [^59851f97]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Writing scientific manuscripts can be unnecessarily daunting, if not paralyzing. This paralysis is usually the result of one of two reasons: either researchers do not know how to start, or they do not know what to put where. However, most radiology manuscripts follow a definable blueprint. In this article, I attempt to lay out the paragraph-by-paragraph development of a typical radiology paper.

Conclusion

If authors can accomplish the writing of the 18 paragraphs of text described in this article, they will produce a manuscript that is properly organized, correct in its essentials, and ready for the finishing hand of a seasoned writer and mentor.

### Survival probability of stochastic processes beyond persistence exponents [^12e77d9f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

For many stochastic processes, the probability [Formula: see text] of not-having reached a target in unbounded space up to time [Formula: see text] follows a slow algebraic decay at long times, [Formula: see text]. This is typically the case of symmetric compact (i.e. recurrent) random walks. While the persistence exponent [Formula: see text] has been studied at length, the prefactor [Formula: see text], which is quantitatively essential, remains poorly characterized, especially for non-Markovian processes. Here we derive explicit expressions for [Formula: see text] for a compact random walk in unbounded space by establishing an analytic relation with the mean first-passage time of the same random walk in a large confining volume. Our analytical results for [Formula: see text] are in good agreement with numerical simulations, even for strongly correlated processes such as Fractional Brownian Motion, and thus provide a refined understanding of the statistics of longest first-passage events in unbounded space.

### A computational toolbox for the assembly yield of complex and heterogeneous structures [^827ee6b2]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Many structural and functional properties of biological systems rely on heterogeneous self assembly. Increasingly, building blocks with highly tuned geometries and interactions can be made experimentally, presenting an opportunity to design complex self-assembling systems with properties of living matter –. However, for increasing numbers of individual components, the yield of the desired product is diluted by an exponential number of off-target assemblies. Even if each of the off-target assemblies forms with a lower probability than the desired product, the multiplicity of these off-target assemblies can cause a yield catastrophe in which the desired product forms with negligible yield. An efficient method for predicting assembly yield would enable practitioners to design self-assembling systems of increasing complexity while mitigating this yield catastrophe.

In this work, we have developed a combined analytical/computational approach to calculate the equilibrium assembly yields of complexes comprised of heterogeneous building blocks with arbitrary geometries. Our approach involves two novel calculations: (i) computing the partition function of each (predefined) candidate complex (see Eq. (9)) and (ii) given these partition functions, calculating equilibrium assembly yields (see Eqs. (10) and (11)). The classical statistical mechanics methodology we put forth can be realized by modern automatic differentiation techniques enabled by advances in machine learning. While previously, the efficient calculation of the entropic parts of the partition function has been intractable except for simple cases, these advances make this calculation possible even for structures with complicated building blocks or with a large number of different components.

Our theoretical framework provides significant conceptual and practical improvements over simulation-based methods, the only other general-purpose method for yield prediction. Calculations via our approach require a drastically reduced computational cost compared to simulations (i.e. seconds or minutes vs. hours, weeks, or months). Moreover, simulation-based methods can be fraught with additional difficulties such as issues in simulating finite concentrations or efficiently sampling from equilibrium distributions. Lastly, since our method involves the direct calculation of the partition function, our approach can also be used to compute other statistical properties of an equilibrium thermodynamic system (e.g. heat capacity, energy fluctuations) without complicated modifications to the calculation. Indeed, since the gradient of a solution to Eqs. (10) and (11) can be computed implicitly, our method could enable inverse design with respect to related thermodynamic equilibrium properties.

### Improving scalability in systems neuroscience [^da582d5f]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging technologies to acquire data at increasingly greater scales promise to transform discovery in systems neuroscience. However, current exponential growth in the scale of data acquisition is a double-edged sword. Scaling up data acquisition can speed up the cycle of discovery but can also misinterpret the results or possibly slow down the cycle because of challenges presented by the curse of high-dimensional data. Active, adaptive, closed-loop experimental paradigms use hardware and algorithms optimized to enable time-critical computation to provide feedback that interprets the observations and tests hypotheses to actively update the stimulus or stimulation parameters. In this perspective, we review important concepts of active and adaptive experiments and discuss how selectively constraining the dimensionality and optimizing strategies at different stages of discovery loop can help mitigate the curse of high-dimensional data. Active and adaptive closed-loop experimental paradigms can speed up discovery despite an exponentially increasing data scale, offering a road map to timely and iterative hypothesis revision and discovery in an era of exponential growth in neuroscience.

### Cells recognize osmotic stress through liquid-liquid phase separation lubricated with poly (ADP-ribose) [^01b98a12]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In the simulation, we regarded k 4, k 6 and k 7 as dummy constants, and we ignored their calculations for the reflection processes because the target molecule remained at its original position in all cases. Since the goal of the computational simulation in this study was not to understand the phase of condensates but to understand the driving force of ASK3 condensation, we also regarded k 2 as a dummy constant and ignored its calculation for the exchange/vibration process. We set k 1 = 1; therefore, free diffusion of ASK3 was always accepted. In contrast, we set k 5 = 0.01; therefore, the diffusion of an obstacle was slower than diffusion of ASK3 unit. This assumption is not unusual because each virtually integrated obstacle is considered the average movement of the constituent molecules, whose movement vectors mostly cancel each other out. For the penalty-defining constant k 3, we set A = 1 to adjust k 3 = 1 under the condition where n lost = 0 and fixed Δ E / θ = 1 for simplicity; hence, the maximum speed of ASK3 for moving within the condensate was identical to k 1 (= 1), the free diffusion of ASK3 out of condensate. Of note, the sampling distribution of k 3 in our simulation satisfied exponential decay curve, that is, rejection sampling was confirmed. We prepared 500 ASK3 units with or without 1500 obstacles in the grid space. To create the condition under osmotic stress, we changed only the grid space, ranging from 50 × 50 to 120 × 120 squares.

For figure presentation, our Python script saved the coordinates of each molecules, which was rendered using RStudio software. For movie presentation, our Python script saved representative images at every 10,000 or 100,000 iteration steps, defined as the unit of time t. To make a time-lapse video, a series of images with added captions were converted to a movie file using Fiji/ImageJ software. For quantification, our Python script calculated the count and size of the ASK3 clusters at every iteration step. To mimic confocal microscopy observations, a cluster of condensates was defined as a cluster of ≥ 6 consecutive ASK3 units. The exported data table was summarized in RStudio software.

### State estimation of a physical system with unknown governing equations [^794152e0]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

State estimation is concerned with reconciling noisy observations of a physical system with the mathematical model believed to predict its behaviour for the purpose of inferring unmeasurable states and denoising measurable ones 1,2. Traditional state-estimation techniques rely on strong assumptions about the form of uncertainty in mathematical models, typically that it manifests as an additive stochastic perturbation or is parametric in nature 3. Here we present a reparametrization trick for stochastic variational inference with Markov Gaussian processes that enables an approximate Bayesian approach for state estimation in which the equations governing how the system evolves over time are partially or completely unknown. In contrast to classical state-estimation techniques, our method learns the missing terms in the mathematical model and a state estimate simultaneously from an approximate Bayesian perspective. This development enables the application of state-estimation methods to problems that have so far proved to be beyond reach. Finally, although we focus on state estimation, the advancements to stochastic variational inference made here are applicable to a broader class of problems in machine learning.

### Machine learning-based differentiation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using multiscale fuzzy entropy and relative power from resting-state EEG [^5c00c594]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiscale fuzzy entropy analysis

MFE analysis is used to assess the complexity of EEG time series. The procedure is composed of the following steps:

Step 1: Coarse-graining the time series

This step generates coarse-grained representations from the original time series x n at various scales determined by a scale factor τ. Specifically, the original time series is divided into non-overlapping windows of length τ. The data points in each window are then averaged to form a new, shorter time series, referred to as the coarse-grained time series. This process is described by:where N denotes the length of the original time series, L indicates the length of the coarse-grained time series, and i denotes the index of the coarse-grained time series. When τ = 1, the sequenceis identical tofor all i.

Step 2: Forming vectors from the coarse-grained series

For each scale factor τ, vectors of length m are formed fromwith elements spaced by a time delay d. Each vector is defined aswhere d determines the spacing between elements in each vector.

Step 3: Calculating distances between vectors

The maximum distance between corresponding elements of two vectorsandis computed as follows:

Step 4: Calculating the average probability of similarity

Once thesehave been computed for every pair of vectors, the degree of similarity between a given vectorand all other vectors(, and) is determined using an exponential fuzzy membership function.where r represents the threshold parameter determining the similarity tolerance.

Step 5: Calculating FuzzyEn

For each scale factor τ, FuzzyEn is obtained by comparing the average similarity probability for vectors of length m and m + 1. In a manner analogous to Step 2, vectors of dimension m + 1 are constructed, and their similarity measure is evaluated in the same way. The FuzzyEn value is then computed as:

### Identifying the caenorhabditis elegans vulval transcriptome [^39434870]. G3 (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Organogenesis involves an elaborate series of developmental events that encompass much of the spectrum of developmental biology. This process is presumed to be accompanied by multiple incidences of dynamic spatiotemporal changes in gene expression. Because of sequential developmental decisions, the mechanisms of many later steps can be masked by experimental perturbation of earlier steps, making developmental genetic analysis of the entirety challenging to analyze.

The Caenorhabditis elegans vulva is a classic system for the genetic investigation of organogenesis. Thus far, most analysis has focused on the initial patterning of the 6 vulval precursor cells (VPCs). These roughly equipotent cells are located in an anterior-to-posterior line along the ventral midline of the animal (Fig. 1a). Vulval fates are induced in VPCs by an EGF-like signal emanating from the anchor cell (AC), in the nearby ventral gonad, to form a pattern of 3˚-3˚-2˚-1˚-2˚-3˚ cell fates, with EGFR and Notch receptors functioning centrally in the developmental process. Each cell type undergoes a stereotyped series of cell divisions and subsequent lineal cell behaviors. Understanding of mechanisms of VPC fate specification mostly ends at the level of transcription factors downstream of these EGFR and Notch signals. An exception to this trend is the chance identification of genes whose expression occurs in various sublineages of the vulva and defined a gene regulatory network of transcription factors. Despite the extensive study of initial cell fate patterning in the vulva, a mechanistic understanding of development after this point, including proliferation and morphogenesis, remains to be characterized.

### A step-by-step guide to writing a scientific review article [^67995ba4]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Scientific review articles are comprehensive, focused reviews of the scientific literature written by subject matter experts. The task of writing a scientific review article can seem overwhelming; however, it can be managed by using an organized approach and devoting sufficient time to the process. The process involves selecting a topic about which the authors are knowledgeable and enthusiastic, conducting a literature search and critical analysis of the literature, and writing the article, which is composed of an abstract, introduction, body, and conclusion, with accompanying tables and figures. This article, which focuses on the narrative or traditional literature review, is intended to serve as a guide with practical steps for new writers. Tips for success are also discussed, including selecting a focused topic, maintaining objectivity and balance while writing, avoiding tedious data presentation in a laundry list format, moving from descriptions of the literature to critical analysis, avoiding simplistic conclusions, and budgeting time for the overall process.

### How-to create an orthopaedic systematic review: a step-by-step guide part I: study design [^0b4f02bf]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Medium credibility.

Systematic reviews are conducted through a consistent and reproducible method to search, appraise, and summarize information. Within the evidence-based pyramid, systematic reviews can be at the apex when incorporating high-quality studies, presenting the strongest form of evidence given their synthesis of results from multiple primary studies to level IV evidence, depending on the studies they incorporate. When combined and supplemented with a meta-analysis using statistical methods to pool the results of 3 or more studies, systematic reviews are powerful tools to help answer research questions. The aim of this review is to serve as a guide on how to: (1) design; (2) execute; and (3) publish an orthopaedic arthroplasty systematic review and meta-analysis. In Part I, we discuss how to develop an appropriate research question as well as source and screen databases. To date, commonly used databases to source studies include PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science. Although not all-encompassing, this paper serves as a starting point for those interested in performing and/or critically reviewing lower extremity arthroplasty systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

### Fundamental limitations on distillation of quantum channel resources [^6563f408]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Asymptotic bounds (Theorem 3)

Both of our asymptotic bound in Theorem 3 are consequences of the results of Theorem 1 and 2 coupled with the assumption that. This means in particular that they apply to general manipulation protocols ϒ without making assumptions about their structure, in contrast to most previous asymptotic bounds in the literature which explicitly considered sequential manipulation protocols with a fixed causal order.

We note that the second, regularised bound for parallel channel transformations (Eq. (12)) requires a more careful approach, relying also on some technical bounds on the fidelity distance between channels. In particular, the 'smoothing' parameter δ encountered here is the reason why the result applies to parallel manipulation protocols only — an extension to more general transformations would entail an optimisation in the space of quantum combs (or quantum processes), and a straightforward application of our methods to this case does not appear to be possible. Whether this can be circumvented with a different approach remains an open question.

Extension to probabilistic protocols

We have so far focused our discussion on deterministic channel transformations where superchannels (and quantum processes) transform channels to channels. To investigate a probabilistic version of such protocols, we need to consider 'sub-superchannels': the linear maps which transform quantum channels to probabilistic implementations of channels in the form of completely positive, trace–non-increasing maps (subchannels), even when acting only on a part of a larger system. The operational meaning of these maps becomes clear by considering them as constituents of superinstruments, i.e. collections of sub-superchannelseach representing a single outcome of a probabilistic transformation such that the overall transformationis a superchannel. Just as the usual quantum instrument, a superinstrument can be assumed to come with a classical register recording which sub-superchannel was applied. Then, probabilistic protocols are declared successful when we learn thatwas realised and are judged to have failed otherwise. To introduce the notion of free transformation in this context, let us first define the set of free subchannels. If we think of free subchannels as a probabilistic version of free channels, it is natural to impose that every free subchannel probabilistically realises a transformation implemented by some free channel. This observation motivates us to define the set of free subchannelswith respect to the given set of free channelsasand we correspondingly define the set of free sub-superchannels as.

### Evaluation of thresholding methods for activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis via large-scale simulations [^e796624d]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 Outcome measures

We first compared the thresholding methods based on their sensitivity, which describes the method's power to find convergence when more than one study activates the target location. Sensitivity was quantified by the average rate of significant findings in a 4 mm radius around the "true location" over the 500 iterations of each parameter combination and should be high. The opposite outcome measure to sensitivity is the susceptibility to spurious convergence, which is measured by the average rate of significant clusters outside of a 4 mm radius around the "true location" over the 500 iterations of each parameter combination. Such clusters reflect the chance of incidental convergence under the known spatial independence of results, which should be as low as possible. The next outcome measure was cluster size, which is quantified by the average size of significant clusters that includes the location of true activation. Lastly, we looked at computational efficiency, measured by the time it takes for a single null permutation to be calculated for each thresholding methods, averaged over 50 permutations for each of the 30 dataset sizes we looked at.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE METHODOLOGY: methodology [^1ca4ad94]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline development — topic selection, timeline, team composition, and grading indicate that each committee selects 2–3 new topics annually and the development process typically spans 24–36 months from initial topic selection to final publication. The process is led by a document writing team composed of committee members and subject matter experts, and Two committee members are selected to serve on the document writing team with the subject matter expert to develop the outline, synthesize evidence, propose recommendations, and author the manuscript. ACOG's guideline development process incorporates a modified GRADE framework, with recommendations classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, and ungraded Good Practice Statements may be incorporated when evidence is extremely limited or nonexistent.
