## Question

When should fevers stop after initiation of antibiotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when fevers should stop after starting antibiotics and what to do if fever persists beyond that window. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context because fever kinetics differ by syndrome and host. Then, I should verify expected time-to-defervescence for common infections. Next, I will examine special populations where the rules change, like neutropenia, ICU, and pediatrics. After that, I need to check how to define "nonresponse" and when to escalate or broaden therapy. Finally, I will integrate biomarkers and outline a practical decision framework with clear thresholds and actions, making sure I cite the best available guidance and trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context matters most, because fever resolution is not a one-size-fits-all metric. It depends on the infection site, pathogen, host factors, and whether source control was achieved, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring expectations to the specific syndrome rather than a generic timeline [^113heVKw] [^112M29By].

> For community-acquired pneumonia, I should double-check the expected response window. Most patients improve within 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy, with fever typically abating in that interval; nonresponse rates around 6–15% are reported, and persistent fever beyond 72 hours should trigger reassessment for resistant or atypical pathogens, complications, or alternative diagnoses [^113heVKw] [^114yJGaW].

> For enteric fever, wait, let me verify the fever trajectory. Patients often continue to have fever for 3–5 days after starting antibiotics, but the maximum temperature should decline each day; if fever has not subsided by day 5, I should reconsider alternative antibiotics or look for a persistent focus of infection, and I should remember that total treatment can be shortened to 3–5 days in uncomplicated cases once clinically improved [^112DPiRP] [^113bQGJj].

> In febrile neutropenia, I need to check the median time to defervescence. High-quality surveys and guidelines indicate a median of about 5 days even with appropriate therapy, and importantly, persistent fever alone in a stable patient should not prompt automatic escalation; instead, I should avoid changing the regimen solely for ongoing fever and only modify if the patient becomes unstable or new data emerge [^116zqUYk] [^113sas1d] [^114Y6k1S].

> For intra-abdominal infection with adequate source control, hold on, I should verify the STOP-IT signal. The landmark RCT showed that fixed 4-day therapy was noninferior to therapy continued until 2 days after resolution of fever, leukocytosis, and ileus, meaning fever may persist beyond 4 days and still be acceptable if the patient is otherwise improving; prolonged antibiotics solely for lingering fever or leukocytosis is not beneficial [^112M29By] [^1113a2Ra].

> In ventilator-associated pneumonia, I should confirm the 7-day target. Contemporary guidance supports 7 days of therapy for most patients, with de-escalation when cultures return; fever may take 48–72 hours to resolve, and extending therapy beyond 7 days rarely helps unless there are special circumstances like severe immunosuppression or ARDS [^116hX9Lw].

> For pediatric osteoarticular infections, let me think about the inflammatory kinetics. Gradual clinical improvement with resolution of fever over 2–4 days is expected, and CRP typically peaks at day 2–3 and normalizes in 9–12 days; if CRP fails to trend down or fever recurs, I should evaluate for persistent infection or adjacent osteomyelitis and consider advanced imaging [^112BhY4m].

> In the ICU, I should confirm that fever is common and often noninfectious. Up to 26–88% of ICU patients develop fever, and about half of febrile episodes are noninfectious; therefore, I need to avoid reflexive antibiotic escalation for persistent fever and instead pursue targeted evaluation, reserving changes for new evidence of infection or clinical deterioration [^114guWyh] [^114WbBZd].

> For infants 8–60 days, I need to ensure I don't overinterpret fever persistence. Guidelines emphasize discontinuing antibiotics when cultures are negative at 24–36 hours, the infant is clinically well or improving, and there is no other infection requiring treatment; fever alone does not dictate continued therapy in this group [^116qox63] [^116fRUwc].

> Next, I should review how to define nonresponse and when to act. For most bacterial infections, persistent fever beyond 48–72 hours without any clinical improvement should prompt reassessment of the diagnosis, antibiotic spectrum, dosing, and source control; in pneumonia, nonresponse at day 3 should trigger evaluation for resistant pathogens, complications like empyema, or alternative diagnoses, and in intra-abdominal infection, early failure within 48 hours usually reflects inadequate source control rather than antibiotic failure [^113heVKw] [^112M29By].

> I will now examine the role of biomarkers, but wait, I should verify their limitations. PCT and CRP can support decisions in stable patients with low-to-intermediate probability of bacterial infection, and PCT-guided algorithms can reduce antibiotic exposure without harming outcomes in ICU and respiratory infections; however, I should not rely on biomarkers alone in unstable patients or in contexts where baseline PCT is elevated, and I must interpret trends in clinical context [^117SdwAz] [^112HqvGw] [^112YoH1B].

> But wait, what if the fever is drug-induced rather than infection-related. I should double-check medication timelines and consider drug fever, particularly with agents like ciprofloxacin; recognizing and stopping the culprit drug can promptly resolve fever and prevent unnecessary escalation or prolongation of antibiotics [^117MfkRg].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. If fever persists beyond 72 hours, I should confirm the diagnosis, verify adequate source control, review cultures and sensitivities, assess for resistant or atypical pathogens, and consider complications; if the patient is clinically improving, I should generally continue the current regimen, whereas if the patient is deteriorating or new risk factors emerge, I should broaden or modify therapy and pursue targeted imaging or procedures as indicated [^113heVKw] [^112M29By].

> In summary, I need to ensure my expectations are context-specific: fever often resolves within 48–72 hours for CAP, 3–5 days for enteric fever, around 5 days for febrile neutropenia, and may persist beyond 4–7 days in intra-abdominal infection or VAP yet still be acceptable if the clinical trajectory is favorable; persistent fever beyond these windows without improvement should trigger a structured reassessment rather than automatic escalation, with biomarkers and source control evaluation guiding next steps [^113heVKw] [^112DPiRP] [^116zqUYk] [^112M29By] [^116hX9Lw].

Fever should generally resolve within **48–72 hours** after starting appropriate antibiotics, depending on the infection type, severity, and host factors [^113heVKw]. If fever persists beyond 72 hours, reassess for **resistant organisms**, **inadequate source control**, or **alternative diagnoses** [^113heVKw]. In febrile neutropenia, defervescence often takes 3–5 days, and antibiotics should not be changed solely for persistent fever if the patient is stable [^116zqUYk] [^113sas1d]. For enteric fever, fever may continue for 3–5 days after antibiotics, but should trend downward; if not, consider treatment failure or complications [^112DPiRP]. Always interpret fever in clinical context and avoid premature antibiotic changes [^117SdwAz].

---

## General timeline for fever resolution

- **Typical resolution**: Fever usually resolves within 48–72 hours after starting appropriate antibiotics, depending on infection type, severity, and host factors [^notfound].

- **Early improvement**: Many patients show a downward trend in temperature within 24–48 hours, even if not fully afebrile.

- **Persistent fever**: Fever beyond 72 hours warrants reassessment of the diagnosis, antibiotic choice, dosing, or source control [^113heVKw].

---

## Factors influencing fever resolution

Several factors influence **how quickly fever resolves** with antibiotics:

| **Factor** | **Impact on fever resolution** |
|-|-|
| Infection type and severity | Severe infections (e.g. pneumonia, sepsis) may take longer to resolve, often 3–5 days or more [^113heVKw] [^116zqUYk] |
| Pathogen susceptibility | Resistant organisms or inappropriate antibiotics delay defervescence [^113heVKw] |
| Host immune status | Immunocompromised patients (e.g. neutropenia, HIV) may have prolonged fever despite appropriate therapy [^116zqUYk] |
| Source control | Inadequate drainage or removal of infected material delays fever resolution [^112M29By] |
| Age and comorbidities | Elderly or patients with chronic diseases may have slower fever resolution |

## Specific clinical scenarios

### Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

In CAP, **expected resolution** is within 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy; persistent fever beyond this should prompt evaluation for complications (e.g. empyema, abscess) or resistant pathogens [^113heVKw]. Nonresponse is defined by sustained fever, lack of clinical improvement, or radiographic deterioration at 48–72 hours [^116BS1R4].

---

### Febrile neutropenia

In febrile neutropenia, **median time to defervescence** is 3–5 days, even with appropriate therapy [^116zqUYk]. Antibiotics should not be changed solely for persistent fever if the patient is clinically stable; modifications should be based on microbiologic data or clinical deterioration [^113sas1d] [^114Y6k1S].

---

### Enteric fever (typhoid fever)

In enteric fever, **expected resolution** is 3–5 days after starting appropriate antibiotics, with a downward trend in temperature; persistent fever beyond 5 days suggests treatment failure or complications [^112DPiRP].

---

### Intra-abdominal infections

For intra-abdominal infections, **source control** is critical; fever may persist until adequate drainage or debridement is achieved. Once source control is adequate, fever typically resolves within 3–5 days [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of persistent fever

Persistent fever beyond 72 hours despite appropriate antibiotics should trigger:

- **Re-evaluation**: Confirm the diagnosis, assess for complications, or alternative diagnoses (e.g. drug fever, viral infections, autoimmune conditions) [^113heVKw].

- **Microbiologic review**: Repeat cultures, check for resistant organisms, or atypical pathogens [^113heVKw].

- **Imaging**: Consider new or repeat imaging to identify undrained collections or new foci of infection [^113heVKw].

- **Source control**: Ensure adequate drainage, removal of infected devices, or surgical intervention if indicated [^112M29By].

---

## Role of biomarkers

Biomarkers such as **procalcitonin (PCT)** and **C-reactive protein (CRP)** can help assess treatment response and guide antibiotic discontinuation, but they should not replace clinical judgment [^117SdwAz]. PCT-guided algorithms can reduce antibiotic exposure without increasing adverse outcomes in certain settings [^117SdwAz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines emphasize **individualized assessment** of fever resolution, considering infection type, severity, host factors, and clinical stability [^notfound]. They advise against changing antibiotics solely for persistent fever without new clinical or microbiologic evidence [^113sas1d] [^114Y6k1S].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Expect improvement**: Fever should trend down within 48–72 hours of appropriate antibiotics.

- **Reassess if persistent**: Fever beyond 72 hours warrants reassessment of diagnosis, antibiotics, and source control [^113heVKw].

- **Individualize decisions**: Base antibiotic changes on clinical stability, microbiologic data, and host factors, not fever alone [^113sas1d].

- **Use biomarkers judiciously**: PCT and CRP can assist but should not replace clinical judgment [^117SdwAz].

---

Fever typically resolves within **48–72 hours** after starting appropriate antibiotics, but this varies by infection, host, and source control. Persistent fever beyond 72 hours should prompt a structured reassessment rather than automatic antibiotic escalation.

## References

### Enteric fever [^113bQGJj]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Follow-up

Fever resolves in five to 10 days, but patients often feel better sooner as fever intervals and intensity improve. Antibiotic treatment durations of 7–14 days or five days after fever resolution, whichever is longer, have traditionally been used. In clinical trials, shorter durations of between three and five days of ceftriaxone and ofloxacin have proved effective in uncomplicated disease. Patients commenced on parenteral antimicrobials can be switched to oral medications once they are clinically stable. If the susceptibility pattern is known, de-escalate from a broad spectrum to a narrow spectrum drug.

Re-evaluate patients with persistent high fever and symptoms after 7–10 days of treatment. Blood culture can be repeated to detect antimicrobial resistance or another diagnosis.

### Best practice considerations by the American society of transplant and cellular therapy: infection prevention and management after chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy for hematological malignancies [^116qXt8Z]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Fever management after CAR T-cell therapy — early broad-spectrum coverage, source-specific care, and cautious de-escalation are advised. Given the predominance of bacterial infections early after CAR T-cell therapy, there should be a low threshold for rapidly initiating broad-spectrum, bactericidal antibiotics per institutional guidelines for the management of fever and neutropenia. Antimicrobial therapy can be modified if there is clinical and/or microbiological evidence of infection, and if respiratory viral infections are identified as the source, their management should follow the guidelines for patients with hematological malignancies and TCT. An antibiotic de-escalation strategy, followed by close monitoring, may be safe and can be considered if there is no clinical suspicion of infection and the fever resolves. Fevers after CAR T-cell infusion should warrant prompt infectious workup and initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and because CRS treatment can mask fever, clinical suspicion for infection should be high, and early ID consultation should be considered.

Enteric fever clinical course when unresponsive to therapy — expected fever duration and next steps: Patients treated with antimicrobial agents can continue to have fever for 3–5 days, but the maximum temperature generally decreases each day, and patients sometimes feel worse during the first few days after commencing antibiotic treatment. If fever in a person with typhoid or paratyphoid infection does not subside within 5 days of initiating antibiotic therapy, consider treatment with alternative antibiotics or begin looking for a persistent focus of infection.

### Fever and the rational use of antimicrobials in the emergency department [^114d2K7Z]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Any patient presenting to the emergency department (ED) with fever triggers consideration of the administration of an antimicrobial. Empiric antimicrobial therapy has become a cornerstone of treatment. Frequently, the decision to initiate empiric treatment needs to be made before the definitive diagnosis is known. In such cases, an organized approach is helpful. This article aims to provide a systems-based approach to prescribing antimicrobials to patients presenting to the ED with fever, while understanding the risk associated with overutilization. An understanding of the key considerations is needed to ensure that decisions are made well and appropriate treatment begins promptly.

### Early discontinuation of antibiotics for febrile neutropenia versus continuation until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer [^115K8gf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with cancer with febrile neutropenia are at risk of severe infections and mortality and are thus treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy differs across guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the safety of protocol-guided discontinuation of antibiotics regardless of neutrophil count, compared to continuation of antibiotics until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with fever and neutropenia, in terms of mortality and morbidity. To assess the emergence of resistant bacteria in people with cancer treated with short courses of antibiotic therapy compared with people with cancer treated until resolution of neutropenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to 1 October 2018. We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished trials. We reviewed the references of all identified studies for additional trials and handsearched conference proceedings of international infectious diseases and oncology and haematology conferences.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a short antibiotic therapy course in which discontinuation of antibiotics was guided by protocols regardless of the neutrophil count to a long course in which antibiotics were continued until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with febrile neutropenia. The primary outcome was 30-day or end of follow-up all-cause mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed all studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for all included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) whenever possible. For dichotomous outcomes with zero events in both arms of the trials, we conducted meta-analysis of risk differences (RDs) as well. For continuous outcomes, we extracted means with standard deviations (SD) from the studies and computed mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. If no substantial clinical heterogeneity was found, trials were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs comprising a total of 662 distinct febrile neutropenia episodes. The studies included adults and children, and had variable design and criteria for discontinuation of antibiotics in both study arms. All included studies but two were performed before the year 2000. All studies included people with cancer with fever of unknown origin and excluded people with microbiological documented infections. We found no significant difference between the short-antibiotic therapy arm and the long-antibiotic therapy arm for all-cause mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.62; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low due to imprecision and high risk of selection bias. The number of fever days was significantly lower for people in the short-antibiotic treatment arm compared to the long-antibiotic treatment arm (mean difference -0.64, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.32; I² = 30%). In all studies, total antibiotic days were fewer in the intervention arm by three to seven days compared to the long antibiotic therapy. We found no significant differences in the rates of clinical failure (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.77; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for clinical failure due to variable and inconsistent definitions of clinical failure across studies, possible selection bias, and wide confidence intervals. There was no significant difference in the incidence of bacteraemia occurring after randomisation (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.66; very low-certainty evidence), while the incidence of any documented infections was significantly higher in the short-antibiotic therapy arm (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.57). There was no significant difference in the incidence of invasive fungal infections (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.31) and development of antibiotic resistance (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.61). The data on hospital stay were too sparse to permit any meaningful conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We could make no strong conclusions on the safety of antibiotic discontinuation before neutropenia resolution among people with cancer with febrile neutropenia based on the existing evidence and its low certainty. Results of microbiological outcomes favouring long antibiotic therapy may be misleading due to lower culture positivity rates under antibiotic therapy and not true differences in infection rates. Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required that address this issue in the era of rising antibiotic resistance.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^114TknMe]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Q fever treatment and management — summary recommendations state that because of the delay in seroconversion often necessary to confirm diagnosis, antibiotic treatment should never be withheld pending laboratory test results or discontinued on the basis of a negative acute specimen, and in contrast, treatment of chronic Q fever should be initiated only after diagnostic confirmation. Treatment for acute or chronic Q fever should only be provided for patients with clinically compatible cases and not based on elevated serologic titers alone. Doxycycline is the drug of choice, and 2 weeks of treatment is recommended for adults, children aged ≥ 8 years, and for severe infections in patients of any age. Children aged < 8 years with uncomplicated illness may be treated with trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole or a shorter duration (5 days) of doxycycline. Women who are pregnant when acute Q fever is diagnosed should be treated with trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole throughout the duration of pregnancy. Serologic monitoring is recommended after an acute Q fever infection to assess possible progression to chronic infection, and the recommended schedule for monitoring is based on the patient's risk for chronic infection.

### Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113sas1d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy (modifications), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to avoid making empirical changes to the initial antibiotic regimen in patients with unexplained persistent fever with otherwise stable condition. Adjust antibiotics accordingly when an infection is identified.

### Management of patients with fever and neutropenia through the arc of time: a narrative review [^115CkQGM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The association between fever and neutropenia and the risk for life-threatening infections in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy has been known for 50 years. Indeed, infectious complications have been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. This review chronicles the progress in defining and developing approaches to the management of fever and neutropenia through observational and controlled clinical trials done by single institutions, as well as by national and international collaborative groups. The resultant data have led to recommendations and guidelines from professional societies and frame the current principles of management. Recommendations include those guiding new treatment options (from monotherapy to oral antibiotic therapy) and use of prophylactic antimicrobial regimens in high-risk patients. Of note, risk factors have changed with the advent of hematopoietic cytokines (especially granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) in shortening the duration of neutropenia, as well as with the discovery of more targeted cancer treatments that do not result in cytotoxicity, although these are still the exception. Most guiding principles that were developed decades ago-about when to begin empirical treatment after a neutropenic patient becomes febrile, whether and how to modify the initial treatment regimen (especially in patients with protracted neutropenia), and how long to continue antimicrobial therapy-are still used today. This review describes how the treatment principles related to the management of fever and neutropenia have responded to changes in the patients at risk, the microbes responsible, and the tools for their treatment, while still being sustained over the arc of time.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^111e24QK]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic duration for respiratory tract infections should be tailored to the patient's needs

It is evident that there is substantial interindividual variability in how drugs are handled, and it seems unlikely that the optimal duration of therapy is precisely the same for all patients. Factors such as age, comorbidities, underlying health conditions, frailty, and immune status vary among individuals, making it unlikely that a one-size-fits-all approach would be effective. This highlights the importance of individualised and patient-centred medical care, considering the unique characteristics and needs of each patient when determining the duration of therapy for RTIs. Llewelyn et al. emphasized that the traditional idea of completing a fixed antibiotic course overlooks the reality that patients can react differently to the same antibiotic. In hospital settings, several studies indicate that biomarkers like procalcitonin can help determine when to discontinue antibiotic treatment. However, outside of hospitals, where frequent testing is not feasible, patients might be advised to stop treatment once they start feeling better. A clinical trial found that using fever resolution as a guide for stopping antibiotics in cases of community-acquired pneumonia reduced the average duration of antibiotic treatment by half without compromising clinical success. In a landmark study, a three-day antibiotic course with intravenous amoxicillin was as efficacious as 8 days of treatment in adults admitted to hospital with mild to moderate-severe community-acquired pneumonia who substantially improved after an initial three days of therapy, which accounted for 78.5% of the participants. It would not be unreasonable to think that the percentage of patients with pneumonia who feel better after three days would be even higher in primary care. However, studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of discontinuing antibiotic therapy upon the resolution of symptoms have not yet been conducted in the primary care setting.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^112BhY4m]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) response monitoring — In children with presumed or confirmed ABA receiving antimicrobial therapy with or without surgical intervention, in addition to serial clinical evaluation, we suggest performing C-reactive protein (CRP) at initial evaluation followed by sequential monitoring of CRP to assess response to therapy, rather than relying solely on clinical evaluation (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence); Serial clinical examination that assess the febrile response, pain and musculoskeletal function remain the primary means of monitoring response to treatment. Gradual clinical improvement including resolution of fever over 2 to 4 days is generally expected; CRP typically has a peak on day 2–3 in uncomplicated infection and returns to the normal range in about 9 to 12 days. The consensus of the Guideline Panel is that CRP may be evaluated every 2 or 3 days until the concentration begins to drop consistently, and once the CRP concentration has decreased substantially in the context of ongoing clinical improvement, further measurement is not necessary. A declining CRP concentration can be used to provide information supplementary to the clinical course for determining when a child may be transitioned to oral antimicrobial therapy and/or discharged home, and successful transition to oral therapy after good clinical response plus CRP decline by 50% or more has been described. If serial CRPs fail to trend downward or resume an upward trend, particularly with recurrent symptoms, children should be carefully evaluated for persistent ABA or adjacent osteomyelitis and may require advanced imaging such as MRI. The role of other inflammatory markers, such as serum procalcitonin (PCT), has not been established; the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has limited utility and in one study took a mean of 18 days to normalize; normalization or substantial decline in the blood white blood cell (WBC) count over the first few days is consistent with response but has not been prospectively evaluated adequately as a biomarker of recovery.

### The foundation for the National Institutes of Health biomarkers consortium: past accomplishments and new strategic direction [^113KG9KJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Considering the FDA's standards for drug approval, the project team evaluated historical evidence for treatment effects from the established literature, outlined research gaps, evaluated outcomes from recent biopharmaceutical clinical trials, and proposed recommendations for improved FDA Guidance for outcome assessments in antibacterial trials. Through parallel discussions around each disease, the team focused on standardized assessments of patient response (symptoms) in the first few days after initiation of antibiotic therapy, which might provide key insights into drug effect and options for trial design. These symptoms may then be used as early clinical response end points and provide a scientific basis for NI hypotheses in antimicrobial registrational trials. 15, 16, 17 For CABP, progressive improvement in four symptoms (cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and sputum production), reported during the first 4 days of therapy was sufficiently well‐documented that an early response end point measure was recommended. 14 For ABSSSI, recommendations focused on the need for clear definitions in the types of skin infections (abscesses vs. cellulitis vs. wound infections) while supporting a primary end point focused on ≥ 20% reduction in lesion size from baseline at 48 hours. In addition, initial FDA ABSSSI Guidance noted data demonstrating treatment effects at 48–72 hours after initiation of antibiotics, including body temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and other measures that are biomarkers (i.e. not direct measures of how a patient feels, functions, or survives). 14, 18 However, these biomarkers are not on the causal pathway of the disease (i.e. temperature), cannot be obtained reliably in outpatients, and the team recommended that these biomarkers may have a secondary role in long‐term assessment of disease resolution during patient care but are insufficient as early end points for regulatory decision making. 12, 14

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^111eKvUZ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenic fever is a significant source of mortality, morbidity, hospitalizations, and healthcare costs. Management of neutropenic fever results in prolonged periods of intravenous (IV) broad-spectrum antibiotics, often for the duration of neutropenia. Although multidisciplinary guidelines – agree that appropriate prompt treatment of neutropenic fever is critical, the management decisions after initiation of antibiotic therapy are more complex, and guideline recommendations for these decisions have been less clear. This is in the context of increasing recognized harms of unnecessary antimicrobial use, including medication toxicity, healthcare utilization (including cost and length of stay), antimicrobial resistance, and risk of hospital-acquired infections (such as Clostridioides difficile).

Specifically, the decision to de-escalate from IV antimicrobial therapy in stable patients with neutropenic fever is of importance. Guidelines generally use an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) goal of 500 cells/uL as a target for stopping IV antibiotics based on a landmark study published in 1979, though some studies have found no difference in outcomes with lower ANC thresholds for antibiotic cessation. A growing set of literature has also suggested the safety of de-escalation prior to a dedicated ANC recovery threshold, described in many single- and multi-center retrospective analyses. – Indeed, 2023 International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline now reflect a recommendation for de-escalation prior to ANC recovery in clinically well and afebrile patients, based a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this population.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline — scope and general principles for new-onset fever in adult ICU patients: the guideline addresses the use of microbiologic studies, imaging procedures, and biomarkers in the initial diagnostic evaluation of new-onset fever with a focus on infectious etiologies, notes that severely immunocompromised populations are not directly addressed although much of the content is applicable, recognizes that infection may be present in the absence of fever, and states that fever should not be a routine target for antipyretic administration.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^114GtLAC]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Q fever empiric therapy timing — doxycycline initiation should not be delayed while awaiting tests. "Because early doxycycline treatment (within the first 3 days of symptoms) is most effective, treatment of a patient suspected of having Q fever should be based on clinical findings and should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation (16)". Additionally, "No evidence indicates that early administration of doxycycline blunts the antibody response or prevents seroconversion (130,131)".

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^116BS1R4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory pathogen clearance rates vary by organism. Endotracheal cultures typically turn negative after the first doses of antibiotic in patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cultures can stay positive for days to weeks, however, in patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, despite clinical improvement. This indicates that the patient is chronically colonized rather than persistently infected and makes culture clearance a poor guide to gauging clinical response, that is potentiated with biofilm formation on endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has specifically evaluated whether sCAP and VAP differ in the speed at which clinical, biological and microbiological signs of infection resolve. However, from a pathophysiological perspective, the definition of resolution could differ between the two groups. First, the microorganisms responsible for these types of pneumonia are different. sCAP is often caused by microorganisms susceptible to first-line antibiotics; patients should respond rapidly to narrow-spectrum antimicrobials. As a result, the probability of receiving appropriate antimicrobial treatment is higher. Second the resolution of pneumonia is related to the severity of local pulmonary lesions, the presence of sepsis or septic shock, and in some cases multiorgan failure. These features may also differ in patients with sCAP vs. VAP.

In a recent multicenter study in critically ill patients with sCAP, the incidence of appropriate antimicrobial treatment was 97%. On the other hand, a lower incidence of appropriate antimicrobial treatment was reported in a recent European study of VAP patients, 68%. The ENIRRIs study, including different types of hospital- and ICU-acquired lower respiratory tract infections, reported higher 90-day mortality when pneumonia was caused by multi-drug-resistant (MRD) pathogens.

It seems reasonable to suggest a common definition for non-response in sCAP and HAP/VAP including sustained fever, lack of improvement or deterioration in oxygenation, radiologic deterioration, and persistently elevated or rising biomarkers, as CRP or PCT, at day 3 compared to baseline (Fig. 2).

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^113nZLm4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Q fever — Treatment and management recommendations specify that because of the delay in seroconversion often necessary to confirm diagnosis, antibiotic treatment should never be withheld pending laboratory tests or discontinued on the basis of a negative acute specimen, whereas treatment of chronic Q fever should be initiated only after diagnostic confirmation. Treatment for acute or chronic Q fever should only be given in clinically compatible cases and not based on elevated serologic titers alone. Doxycycline is the drug of choice, and 2 weeks of treatment is recommended for adults, children aged ≥ 8 years, and for severe infections in patients of any age. Children aged < 8 years with uncomplicated illness may be treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or a shorter duration (5 days) of doxycycline. Women who are pregnant when acute Q fever is diagnosed should be treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole throughout the duration of pregnancy. Serologic monitoring is recommended following acute Q fever infection to assess possible progression to chronic infection, and the recommended schedule for monitoring is based on the patient's risk for chronic infection.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^114omyoi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis — immunocompetent hosts monitoring and PCR interpretation: In otherwise healthy individuals, symptoms generally abate within a few days after initiation of treatment, and fever and parasites on blood smear usually clear within a week. Fatigue may persist for months after a standard antibiotic course and by itself is not an indication for continued monitoring. Once symptoms have resolved in immunocompetent patients, blood smears typically are negative, but B. microti PCR may remain positive for months to more than a year after completion of standard treatment or for months to more than 2 years if untreated; persistence of B. microti DNA after resolution of symptoms and completion of standard treatment usually does not indicate treatment failure. Relapse of symptoms rarely is observed in immunocompetent patients, so continuing antimicrobial therapy until Babesia PCR becomes negative in immunocompetent patients will often result in unnecessarily prolonged therapy and is not warranted. Immunocompetent patients usually resolve most symptoms and blood smears become negative during the 7 to 10-day course of standard antimicrobial therapy. Monitoring parasitemia using PCR is not indicated in asymptomatic immunocompetent hosts.

### Developing consensus on clinical outcomes for children with mild pneumonia: a Delphi study [^115yA1cX]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The absence of consensus for outcomes in pediatric antibiotic trials is a major barrier to research harmonization and clinical translation. We sought to develop expert consensus on study outcomes for clinical trials of children with mild community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

Applying the Delphi method, a multispecialty expert panel ranked the importance of various components of clinical response and treatment failure outcomes in children with mild CAP for use in research. During Round 1, panelists suggested additional outcomes in open-ended responses that were added to subsequent rounds of consensus building. For Rounds 2 and 3, panelists were provided their own prior responses and summary statistics for each item in the previous round. The consensus was defined by > 70% agreement.

Results

The expert panel determined that response to and failure of treatment should be addressed at a median of 3 days after initiation. Complete or substantial improvement in fever, work of breathing, dyspnea, tachypnea when afebrile, oral intake, and activity should be included as components of adequate clinical response outcomes. Clinical signs and symptoms including persistent or worsening fever, work of breathing, and reduced oral intake should be included in treatment failure outcomes. Interventions including receipt of parenteral fluids, supplemental oxygen, need for high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and change in prescription of antibiotics should also be considered in treatment failure outcomes.

Conclusions

Clinical response and treatment failure outcomes determined by the consensus of this multidisciplinary expert panel can be used for pediatric CAP studies to provide objective data translatable to clinical practice.

### Saturday night fever: finding and controlling the source of sepsis in critical illness [^114WbBZd]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

Fever is a daily concern in the intensive care unit. Although about half of all febrile cases are due to non-infectious causes, fear of sepsis frequently leads to diagnostic tests and escalation of therapy, including broadening antibiotic therapy. Using a case to illustrate this dilemma, we discuss the commonest non-infectious and infectious causes of fever, and suggests approaches to their management. Any unexplained fever in intensive care unit patients warrants investigation, which includes complete clinical assessment and blood cultures. When the source of fever is not immediately apparent, non-infectious and infectious causes should be considered. If stable, non-neutropenic patients should be monitored before further tests or empiric antibiotics are started. In an era of rapid emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and intense scrutiny of resources, optimal diagnosis and management of patients with suspected infection entails much more than the escalation of antimicrobial therapy.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112M29By]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society — antimicrobial therapy for treatment failure in intra-abdominal infection (IAI): Early treatment failure in patients with IAI, occurring within 48 hours of source control, is typically the result of an unsuccessful initial intervention and not a failure of antimicrobial therapy, and the consensus of the task force is that continuation of previous antimicrobial therapy is appropriate in most patients with IAI who experience early treatment failure. In contrast, patients with late treatment failure, occurring after 48 hours, are likely to have a somewhat more resistant microbial flora because of longer-duration antimicrobial therapy, and broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy, tailored to the expected risk of resistant pathogens, should be provided to patients with late treatment failure; if feasible, a switch in the class of antibiotic agents being administered should be considered. If diagnostic studies have negative results, further antimicrobial therapy for IAI is not generally warranted, and retrospective analyses have indicated that use of prolonged antibiotic courses, even in patients with ongoing fever or leukocytosis, does not provide any benefit. Moreover, the recent STOP-IT trial found that patients with IAI randomized to antimicrobial therapy continued two days beyond resolution of fever, leukocytosis, and ileus fared no better than patients randomized to having antibiotic agents stopped at four days, when two of the three signs were still present; this finding applied even to patients with higher APACHE II scores.

### Diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1155ipN1]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with community-acquired pneumonia often present with cough, fever, chills, fatigue, dyspnea, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain. When a patient presents with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, the physician should first assess the need for hospitalization using a mortality prediction tool, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index, combined with clinical judgment. Consensus guidelines from several organizations recommend empiric therapy with macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline. Patients who are hospitalized should be switched from parenteral antibiotics to oral antibiotics after their symptoms improve, they are afebrile, and they are able to tolerate oral medications. Clinical pathways are important tools to improve care and maximize cost-effectiveness in hospitalized patients.

### Outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy: American Society of Clinical Oncology and Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline update [^112t4QcX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) guideline on outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in patients with cancer. Methods ASCO and IDSA convened an Update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel. Results Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated systematic review. Recommendation Clinical judgment is recommended when determining which patients are candidates for outpatient management, using clinical criteria or a validated tool such as the Multinational Association of Support Care in Cancer risk index. In addition, psychosocial and logistic considerations are outlined within the guideline. The panel continued to endorse consensus recommendations from the previous version of this guideline that patients with febrile neutropenia receive initial doses of empirical antibacterial therapy within 1 hour of triage and be monitored for ≥ 4 hours before discharge. An oral fluoroquinolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or clindamycin, if penicillin allergic) is recommended as empirical outpatient therapy, unless fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was used before fever developed. Patients who do not defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen should be re-evaluated and considered as candidates for inpatient treatment.

### Lincomycin hydrochloride (Lincomycin) [^116JeXNn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Lincomycin should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 60 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Section.

Prescribing Lincomycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Lincomycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Lincomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Lincomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible

### Ciprofloxacin-induced drug fever [^117MfkRg]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Drug-induced fever is an uncommon but important differential in patients with unexplained fever. We present a case of a woman in her 60s with advanced renal disease and recent total hip arthroplasty who developed fever after an extended course of ciprofloxacin treatment. Extensive investigations, including cultures, imaging and orthopaedic review, failed to identify an infectious source. Although her fever initially resolved by day 2, it recurred on day 19 of treatment. Repeat assessments remained inconclusive. Ciprofloxacin-induced drug fever was suspected, and defervescence occurred within 48 hours of discontinuation, with no recurrence thereafter. This case highlights the importance of considering drug fever once other causes have been excluded. Early recognition can prevent unnecessary antibiotic escalation, reduce hospital stay and improve patient outcomes. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis, particularly when new medications coincide with unexplained fever in the absence of clear infection.

### Follow-up blood cultures in Gram-Negative bacteremia: are they needed? [^111bbYcP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) bacteremia is typically transient and usually resolves rapidly after the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control. The optimal duration of treatment and utility of follow-up blood cultures (FUBC) have not been studied in detail. Currently, the management of gram-negative bacteremia is determined by clinical judgment. To investigate the value of repeat blood cultures, we analyzed 500 episodes of bacteremia to determine frequency of FUBC and identify risk factors for persistent bacteremia.

Methods

Of 500 episodes of bacteremia, we retrospectively analyzed 383 (77%) that had at least 1 FUBC. We sought information regarding presumed source of bacteremia, antibiotic status at the time of FUBC, antibiotic susceptibility, presence of fever, comorbidities (intravenous central lines, urinary catheters, diabetes mellitus, AIDS, end-stage renal disease, and cirrhosis), need for intensive care, and mortality.

Results

Antibiotic use did not affect the rate of positivity of FUBC, unless bacteria were not sensitive to empiric antibiotic. Fever on the day of FUBC was associated with higher rates of positive FUBC for gram-positive cocci (GPC) but not GNB. Mortality and care in the intensive care unit were not associated with positive FUBC. Seventeen FUBC and 5 FUBC were drawn for GNB and GPC to yield 1 positive result.

Conclusions

FUBC added little value in the management of GNB bacteremia. Unrestrained use of blood cultures has serious implications for patients including increased healthcare costs, longer hospital stays, unnecessary consultations, and inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^1143cL2Y]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^117SdwAz]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients are discussed for diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic stewardship. The diagnostic accuracy and specificity of PCT are higher than those of CRP, although further studies are needed to define the optimal cutoff points for PCT and CRP and the diagnostic indexes in different disease stages. Several RCTs have demonstrated that PCT-based algorithms safely reduce antibiotic use in stable, low-risk patients with respiratory infections, and in ICU patients with suspected sepsis, clinicians should not initially withhold antibiotics, but PCT levels of less than 0.5 μg/L or levels that decrease by greater than or equal to 80% from peak levels may guide antibiotic discontinuation once patients stabilize. The Stop Antibiotics on Procalcitonin Guidance Study demonstrated a reduction in both antibiotic exposure and mortality in critically ill patients, and a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs involving 4,482 patients reported that PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection and sepsis patients resulted in improved survival and lower antibiotic treatment duration. The latest and largest systematic review and meta-analysis to date of 16 studies and greater than5000 patients showed that PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation appeared to decrease antibiotic utilization by 1 day and improve mortality, but support for their findings was tempered by low-certainty evidence and the majority of the PCT trials excluded severely immunocompromised patients. In summary, PCT and CRP provide only supportive and complementary information to clinical assessment, and decisions on initiating, altering, or discontinuing antimicrobial therapy should not be made solely based on changes in PCT or CRP levels.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's specialised register (November 2007), Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL, issue 4, 2007), Medline (1966 to November 2007), Embase (1974 to November 2007), and LILACS (1982 to November 2007) using text words and medical subject headings (MeSH) "typhoid fever", "enteric fever", "paratyphoid fever", " Salmonella Typhi", " Salmonella Paratyphi" combined with the Cochrane Collaboration's search strategy. A complete list of search terms used is available. We identified relevant trials in all languages, searched selected conference proceedings, authors' files, reference lists, and the meta-Register of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and contacted experts for relevant ongoing or unpublished trials.

One reviewer screened titles and abstracts, and potentially relevant trials were further evaluated independently by two reviewers using pre-designed eligibility forms. Trials were included if they were randomised and compared fluoroquinolone with another antibiotic in enteric fever confirmed with blood or bone marrow culture.

Data abstraction and methodological assessment

Two reviewers independently extracted data using piloted data extraction forms, compared data, and resolved disagreements. Primary outcomes (measured at time points described by investigators) were clinical failure (presence of symptoms or development of complications necessitating change in or prolongation of antibiotic therapy), microbiological failure (positive culture from blood, bone marrow, or any sterile anatomical site), and relapse (recurrence of symptoms with a positive culture from blood, bone marrow, or any sterile anatomical site). Secondary outcomes included fever clearance time (time taken in hours from the start of therapy to defervescence, as defined by authors), convalescent faecal carriage (positive faecal culture detected at any time after end of treatment up to one year of follow-up), cost of therapy, length of hospitalisation, complications, and adverse events. We contacted study authors for additional data or to clarify data.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^116uXxxS]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute Q fever in adults — The majority of acute Q fever cases resolve spontaneously within 2–3 weeks, even without treatment, but symptomatic patients with confirmed or suspected acute Q fever, including children with severe illness, should be treated with doxycycline. Doxycycline is the most effective treatment for Q fever, and treatment is most effective when given in the first 3 days of symptoms, shortens the illness, and reduces the risk for severe complications. If doxycycline is contraindicated because of allergies, other antibiotic regimens that can be used include moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and rifampin. Treatment for acute Q fever is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic persons or for those whose symptoms have resolved, although it might be considered in those at high risk for developing chronic Q fever; in one study, those who eventually had chronic Q fever were more likely to have not received appropriate doxycycline treatment during their acute illness. Patients with acute Q fever should undergo a careful clinical assessment to determine whether they might be at risk for progression to chronic Q fever, including review of possible immunosuppressive conditions, pregnancy testing when appropriate, and assessment for vascular and heart valve defects because certain valvular lesions might not be detectable by auscultation.

### Early stoppage of empirical antibiotic therapy in paediatric acute leukaemia with high-risk febrile neutropenia: a randomized, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^114J8NQY]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Febrile neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication seen in paediatric patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. The immunocompromised state caused by intensive chemotherapy blunts the typical inflammatory responses, making early fever often the only clinical clue of a serious underlying infection. Consequently, prompt initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) is the cornerstone of management to reduce mortality due to febrile neutropenia.

The latest Clinical Practice Guidelines conditionally recommend cessation of EAT in patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia who are clinically stable and have been afebrile for at least 24 h, even in the absence of evidence of bone marrow recovery, provided blood cultures remain negative at 48 h. However, the guidelines currently recommend continuing EAT in afebrile patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia until bone marrow recovery. Reflecting on this recommendation, a recent survey of clinicians managing paediatric febrile neutropenia found that the majority recommend continuing EAT until marrow recovery in afebrile patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia. Although continuing EAT until bone marrow recovery is recommended based on the assumption that it may reduce the risk of untreated infections during prolonged neutropenia, conversely, there are concerns that this approach may lead to unnecessarily prolonged antibiotic use in the absence of documented infection or persistent symptoms. Prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and longer hospital stays, both of which contribute to the financial and time toxicity of cancer treatment.

Multiple randomized trials in adult patients with haematological malignancies have demonstrated that early discontinuation of EAT during febrile neutropenia is a viable strategy that increases antibiotic-free days without elevating the risk of adverse events or mortality. While previous paediatric studies have shown that early discontinuation of EAT is non-inferior to continuation until bone marrow recovery in children with low-risk febrile neutropenia, evidence in high-risk febrile neutropenia among children remains limited. A multicentre randomized trial involving children with low and high-risk febrile neutropenia, who tested positive for respiratory viral pathogens and became afebrile after 48 h of EAT, compared early antibiotic discontinuation versus continuation until bone marrow recovery. Although this study demonstrated the non-inferiority of the early discontinuation strategy, factors such as persistent viral detection after clinical recovery and asymptomatic colonization raised concerns regarding routine viral testing to guide early antibiotic discontinuation.

To address this important evidence gap, we conducted a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial among children with acute leukaemia with high-risk febrile neutropenia during induction to evaluate whether early discontinuation of EAT among children with sustained clinical improvement before bone marrow recovery is non-inferior to continuation of EAT until bone marrow recovery.

### Early versus late stopping of antibiotics in adults with high-risk… [^113XTnYW]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview This study is designed to assess the safety, benefits and impacts of early cessation of empiric antibiotics in all fever and neutropenic) that develops post conditioning or chemotherapy until count recovery in high-risk hematology patients who meet clear inclusion criteria. This is in recognition of the fact that both PNF and NF are often not infective in nature, and that cessation is likely an important and safe approach in both scenarios. Secondly, the patient's pre-neutropenic and neutropenic status is highly fluid and can rapidly change from one to the other, making strict definitions of neutropenia arbitrary and not particularly useful for implementation in the clinical setting. Furthermore, as a programmatic-type intervention that is embedded in clinical workflow, approaching high-risk patients with fever in a standardized way would enable consistency and inform clear and concise management protocols.

Stratification will allow for assessment of each patient sub-group to provide more granular data. The study hypothesizes that early cessation of antibiotics in adult patients with high risk fever is safe, acceptable, cost-effective and will minimize an unnecessarily prolonged health care intervention Drug: Early antibiotic cessation alert

### Clindamycin phosphate (clindamycin) [^112mxZPC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prescribing clindamycin injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^113heVKw]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48-72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs-such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities-with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g., empyema) or not (e.g., acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g., pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

Infective endocarditis — blood cultures and fever management note that blood culture samples will typically become negative after 48 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, although methicillin-resistant S. aureus or other resistant organisms may require up to a week for cultures to become negative; caution is advised when recurrent fever occurs after an initially successful response because it may reflect reasons other than the endocarditic valve, and ongoing infection despite antibiotics is common with aggressive microorganisms resulting in abscess formation, valve destruction, fistulas, or large vegetations.

### Antibiotics for fever among children: findings from the surveillance for enteric fever in India cohorts [^111hK39x]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Antibiotic use in febrile illness is commonplace in these cohorts, with children receiving 57.9 (95% CI, 57.2–58.6) fever-related antibiotic courses per 100 CYO. More than half of the children (55.9%) had at least 1 fever-related antibiotic course during the study. While other studies have extrapolated antibiotic data from Demographic and Health Surveys or examined antibiotic prescriptions in younger cohorts, this study documented prospectively, using standardized tools and common protocols, antibiotic use in febrile illness in children of a wider pediatric age group from 4 geographically distinct parts of India.

Of those who received antibiotics, 64% had antibiotics initiated before the third day of fever. Very early initiation may reflect the lack of diagnostic tests and the demand from families paying out of pocket for healthcare for prompt resolution of symptoms. Based on the provisional diagnosis assigned by the treating physician, we note that the antibiotic usage was unlikely to have been warranted in 65.4% of the episodes where antibiotics were initiated. Fink et al, from a study on 8 LMICs, predominantly in Africa, reported unnecessary antibiotic usage rates ranging between 49% and 81%. Our study documented that 24.3% episodes of antibiotics were discontinued within 3 days of initiation, suggesting that many of these episodes might have been self-limiting viral illnesses. On the other hand, early antibiotics could also prevent a more extensive bacterial illness and therefore may be lifesaving in resource-poor settings with inadequate health access.

### Consensus report on Shigella controlled human infection model: conduct of studies [^114FFT9f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic and Antipyretic Therapy Following Challenge

All challenge strains are documented to be susceptible to the antibiotics used to treat volunteers. If volunteers do not meet early treatment criteria, 5 days (~120 hours postinoculation) after challenge all volunteers receive a 3- to 5-day antibiotic course. Generally, ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth twice a day is started. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg) every 12 hours or ampicillin 500 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 5 days can be substituted in the event of an allergy or adverse reaction to ciprofloxacin. Given increasing concerns about the safety of fluoroquinolones, investigators may wish to consider an alternative first-line antibiotic. Also, as loperamide has been shown to decrease time to diarrhea resolution, consideration should be given as to whether concomitant treatment together with antibiotic should be routinely used.

Early antibiotic therapy is initiated if the volunteer meets the primary endpoint of shigellosis and continues to feel ill or has a fever ≥ 39.0°C, or for other indications as deemed appropriate by the investigator. In theory, infection could relapse after antibiotic treatment is complete, as has occurred with Campylobacter jejuni. However, this has never been observed with either wild-type Shigella or with live attenuated Shigella vaccines treated with ciprofloxacin. If retreatment with antibiotics is needed because the first course did not eradicate the vaccine strain, susceptibility testing should be performed, and a second course of antibiotics administered.

Criteria for Discharge

As a precaution against spread of Shigella from volunteers on the inpatient unit to the community, investigators require that all volunteers eradicate Shigella prior to discharge from the inpatient unit. Volunteers are treated regardless of whether they are found to be excreting Shigella after challenge. A volunteer is eligible for discharge from the inpatient facility once he or she has ingested at least 2 doses of antibiotics and has had at least 2 stools with consecutive negative cultures for the challenge organism with clinical symptoms resolved or resolving. Generally, volunteers are eligible for discharge 7–8 days after challenge (2–3 days after commencement of antibiotics). Volunteers who meet early treatment criteria can be discharged early.

SCCM/IDSA guidelines for adult ICU new-onset fever describe an update using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and apply to adult ICU patients without severe immunocompromise; the document addresses microbiologic studies, imaging procedures, and the use of biomarkers for fever with initial onset after ICU admission, focusing on detection of potential infectious etiologies. It states that not all febrile episodes dictate a need for investigation when a noninfectious etiology is obvious such as postoperative fever, and that for fevers requiring investigation a good history and physical examination will often reveal potential sources of infection. It directs that diagnostic studies should then be sent with those potential sources in focus rather than reflexively sending cultures for all possible sources, notes that any recommendation from the 2008 guideline not specifically addressed in this update remains in place, and clarifies that although recommendations may be applicable to severely immunocompromised patients such as organ transplant recipients and those with severe neutropenia, these populations are not directly addressed here.

For a child with a suspected bone or joint infection, knowledge of the workup and initial therapy is important to provide quality care. Fever and pain are hallmarks of a pediatric osteoarticular infection, although occasionally the signs and symptoms can be more subtle. The use of C-reactive protein to diagnose and validate effective management of treatment has become standard. Multiple reports confirm the success of much shorter intravenous (IV) courses than traditionally taught.

### New approaches to management of fever and neutropenia in high-risk patients [^113oYwxr]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients receiving treatment for acute leukaemia and haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have prolonged neutropenia and are at high risk of neutropenic fever, with bacterial and particularly invasive fungal infections as feared complications, possessing potentially serious consequences including intensive care admission and mortality. Concerns for these serious complications often lead to long durations of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and escalation to even broader therapy if fever persists. Further, the default approach is to continue neutropenic fever therapy until count recovery, leaving many patients who have long defervesced on prolonged antibiotics.

Recent Findings

This article details recent progress in this field with particular emphasis on early discontinuation studies in resolved neutropenic fever and improved imaging techniques for the investigation of those with persistent neutropenic fever. Recent randomized controlled trials have shown that early cessation of empiric neutropenic fever therapy is well tolerated in acute leukaemia and autologous HCT patients who are clinically stable and afebrile for 72h. Delineation of the best approach to cessation (timing and/or use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis) and whether this approach is well tolerated in the higher risk allogeneic HCT setting is still required. Recent RCT data demonstrate utility of FDG-PET/CT to guide management and rationalize antimicrobial therapy in high-risk patient groups with persistent neutropenic fever.

Summary

Acute leukaemic and autologous HCT patients with resolved neutropenic fever prior to count recovery can have empiric therapy safely discontinued or de-escalated. There is an emerging role of FDG-PET/CT to support decision-making about antibiotic and antifungal use in high-risk persistent/recurrent neutropenic fever patients.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^1139biUs]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

We explored comparison of four (12%) outlier studies with initial antibiotic response rates in the 60% to 70% range, to 30 trials (88%) with rates 80% or greater. with regard to components of conservative management that might affect outcomes: inclusion of patients with abscess or unspecified, 50% versus 27%; inclusion of patients with appendicolith or unspecified, 75% versus 60%; use of a guideline nonrecommended intravenous and oral antibiotic or unspecified, 25% versus 17%; total antibiotic duration of less than 7 days or unspecified, 25% versus 23%; and allowed time for clinical response less than or equal to 24 hours or unspecified, 75% versus 62%, respectively.

Discharge Criteria and Short-term Follow-up

Seventeen trials (50%) described hospital discharge criteria. Studies generally required improvement, control of pain with oral analgesics, and some, resolution of fever. Most studies mandated that antibiotic-treated participants be hospitalized for a minimum 1 to 3 days. One pediatric pilot trial allowed hospital discharge if the participant was afebrile and tolerated a diet after 8 hours of treatmentand one adult trial if there was improvement by the next morning. In one adult pilot RCT, 14 of 15 consecutive antibiotic-randomized adults achieved hemodynamic stability, temperature less than 38.5°C, pain control with oral analgesics, and tolerance for oral fluids and medications and were discharged from the emergency department; all were successfully managed as outpatients and had symptom resolution. These patients were initially treated with a long-acting parenteral antibiotic, analgesics and antiemetics as needed, and then observed for at least 6 hours before discharge. Among all studies, follow-up, when specified, occurred as a visit and/or by telephone or email, with contact usually within the first week and additional visits up to 30 days following hospital discharge.

### Early antibiotic therapy discontinuation in patients with… [^116JthkF]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

This phase III trial compares the effects of early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy versus standard of care on clinical outcomes in patients with hematologic conditions and neutropenic fever in which no bacterial infection has been identified. When individuals have a compromised immune system with a low white blood cell count, specifically with a low neutrophil count, they are at higher risk of developing infections. Currently, when individuals with a low neutrophil count develop a fever, they are treated with long courses of antibiotics in case of a bacterial infection, even if no bacterial infection is found. This trial evaluates whether a shortened period of antibiotic treatment after the development of a fever where no bacterial infection is identified is safe and still provides the same benefit as having the standard duration of antibiotics.

Exclusion Criteria
- Microbiologically or clinically suspected bacterial infection after index fever, excluding CDI
- Exposure to antibacterial therapy within 72 hours before first fever occurrence other than antibiotics deemed as prophylaxis Additional locations may be listed on ClinicalTrials. gov for NCT06278896.

To compare the rates of acquisition of multidrug resistant gram-negative bacilli and vancomycin-resistant enterococci within 60 days after first neutropenic fever in each arm. VI. To compare the rates of allergic reactions or side effects attributed to antibiotics that required antibiotic cessation or change within 60 days after first neutropenic fever. VII. To compare the rates of bacteremia within 60 days after randomization. VIII.

To compare the rates of neutropenia at antibiotic stop date. IX. To compare the length of hospital stay in each arm. X. To compare the rates of non-elective hospital readmission within 60 days in each arm. XI. To compare the rates of new fever after index fever in each arm. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM A: Patients undergo early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy once afebrile for at least 48 hours, no clinically documented source of bacterial infection, and no hemodynamic or respiratory decompensation. ARM B: Patients continue antibiotic therapy until count recovery and/or for the standard duration, per standard of care. Patients are followed up for 60 days after enrollment on study.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America adult ICU new fever biomarkers guidance states that in critically ill patients with a new fever and no clear focus of infection, when the probability of bacterial infection is low to intermediate, we suggest measuring procalcitonin (PCT) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When the probability is high, we suggest not measuring PCT to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest not measuring CRP to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For low to intermediate probability, we suggest measuring either serum PCT or CRP to rule out bacterial infection (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Biomarkers such as PCT and CRP deployed with rapid turnaround times, have been used as adjuncts in the early diagnosis of sepsis while awaiting microbiologic culture results, major guidelines recommend against routine use of biomarkers in the setting of sepsis and septic shock, out of respect for uncertain benefit and cost and availability issues, and in the setting of fever and lower likelihood of infection, however, there may be a role in obtaining a baseline value to assist in the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^114t5iXv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessing the severity of infection is a crucial step in evaluating patients for antimicrobial therapy. Early implementation of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy has a significant favorable impact on outcomes of septic shock, independent of infection site. Whereas critically ill patients benefit from early antibiotic therapy, clinicians managing less severely ill patients may have time to consider carefully and determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment before initiating therapy. Delayed antibiotic prescription, using a wait-and-see approach with reevaluation of the patient, has been reported as a useful tactic to help reduce antibiotic use, particularly for respiratory tract infections. However, some data suggest that hasty antibiotic therapy may be harmful for critically ill surgical patients, where the adequacy of source control is the crucial determinant of survival. A before-after trial compared universal early antibiotic therapy (aggressive approach) to a second period where immediate antibiotic therapy was given only in hypotensive patients. At the same time, other patients underwent therapy only after microbiological confirmation of infection (conservative approach). The aggressive approach was associated with a lower time interval from fever onset and blood culture collection to the start of treatment. The conservative approach was associated with more likely initial appropriate therapy, a shorter duration of therapy, and lower mortality. This differentiation of infection from inflammation can be challenging, especially in critically ill patients, wherein only about one-half of suspected infections are proven. Delaying antibiotics to investigate the cause of sepsis may be of benefit to patients without shock.

Delayed antibiotic prescription is especially useful to help reduce antibiotic use, especially for community-acquired respiratory tract infections, many of which have a viral etiology. In a meta-analysis, delayed prescription compared with no antibiotics was associated with similar symptom duration; withholding antibiotics pending pathogen identification and susceptibility testing may be acceptable to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for viral respiratory tract infections.

By contrast, for patients (both adults and children) with sepsis-related shock and organ dysfunction, delay of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy can be deleterious; early initiation of antibiotics is crucial for good outcomes. There is a strong correlation between each hour of delay in antibiotic initiation and mortality rates for patients with septic shock. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend that adults with possible septic shock or probable sepsis should receive antibiotics as soon as possible, ideally within 1 h from symptom onset. For adults with possible sepsis without shock, a rapid assessment for the likelihood of infectious vs. non-infectious causes of acute illness should be conducted, and antimicrobial agents should be administered within 3 h from the time sepsis was first recognized.

### Fever therapy revisited [^116Xf7s8]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The rate of fever concurrent with regression was most likely biased by the awareness of the authors, both of original reports and reviews. Fever, in particular during the second half of the 20th century, which is characterised by heavy use of antibiotics, was regarded unequivocally by main-stream medicine as an unnecessary, weakening state which should be avoided or prevented. The situation has not changed much today. For this reason, if one wants to estimate the rate of fever preceding regressions and remission, one must assume a rate higher than the approximately 30% rate indicated by the Stephenson review, or even much higher for cancers of haematopoetic origin (80%) as indicated by the review of Diamond and Luby, because preceding fever most likely often was not reported. If fever often precedes regressions, there might be a causative connection. This hypothesis can be substantiated by evidence from studies unrelated to spontaneous regression and remission.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^115QizzE]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The benefits and detriments of antibiotic use, especially in patients without an infection, are not clearly understood; however, antibiotic exposure has been associated with an increased risk of subsequent infections, increased length of stay, and increased mortality. It is therefore imperative to closely examine the likelihood of infection in a patient prior to antibiotic initiation taking into context the entire clinical presentation and clinical trajectory.

Prompt re-evaluation and discontinuation of ineffective therapies is important. Intentionally withholding antibiotics may have a benefit when appropriate care is otherwise provided. De-escalation, or stopping antibiotics altogether, should be done once cultures are finalized because this practice both decreases bacterial resistance and lowers 90-day mortality.

Procalcitonin has been shown to significantly reduce antibiotic use for lower respiratory infections without adversely impacting outcome. It has a high negative predictive value of 91%and follow-up levels have been shown useful for antibiotic discontinuation, however, caution is advised in circumstances that raise procalcitonin at baseline such as trauma including surgical trauma, and inflammatory conditions, like pancreatitis. There is no standard recommended use of procalcitonin in the critically ill trauma population.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^112AUogF]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Fever is frequently an early indicator of infection and often requires rigorous diagnostic evaluation.

Objectives

This is an update of the 2008 Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society (IDSA) and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guideline for the evaluation of new-onset fever in adult ICU patients without severe immunocompromise, now using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

Panel Design

The SCCM and IDSA convened a taskforce to update the 2008 version of the guideline for the evaluation of new fever in critically ill adult patients, which included expert clinicians as well as methodologists from the Guidelines in Intensive Care, Development and Evaluation Group. The guidelines committee consisted of 12 experts in critical care, infectious diseases, clinical microbiology, organ transplantation, public health, clinical research, and health policy and administration. All task force members followed all conflict-of-interest procedures as documented in the American College of Critical Care Medicine/SCCM Standard Operating Procedures Manual and the IDSA. There was no industry input or funding to produce this guideline.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review for each population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak or as best-practice statements.

Results

The panel issued 12 recommendations and 9 best practice statements. The panel recommended using central temperature monitoring methods, including thermistors for pulmonary artery catheters, bladder catheters, or esophageal balloon thermistors when these devices are in place or accurate temperature measurements are critical for diagnosis and management. For patients without these devices in place, oral or rectal temperatures over other temperature measurement methods that are less reliable such as axillary or tympanic membrane temperatures, noninvasive temporal artery thermometers, or chemical dot thermometers were recommended. Imaging studies including ultrasonography were recommended in addition to microbiological evaluation using rapid diagnostic testing strategies. Biomarkers were recommended to assist in guiding the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. All recommendations issued were weak based on the quality of data.

Conclusions

The guidelines panel was able to formulate several recommendations for the evaluation of new fever in a critically ill adult patient, acknowledging that most recommendations were based on weak evidence. This highlights the need for the rapid advancement of research in all aspects of this issue-including better noninvasive methods to measure core body temperature, the use of diagnostic imaging, advances in microbiology including molecular testing, and the use of biomarkers.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^114aTYCM]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

This guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants, 8 to 60 days of age, with fever ≥ 38.0°C. Exclusions are noted. After a commissioned evidence-based review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an additional extensive and ongoing review of the literature, and supplemental data from published, peer-reviewed studies provided by active investigators, 21 key action statements were derived. For each key action statement, the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationship were assessed and graded to determine the strength of recommendations. When appropriate, parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making. For diagnostic testing, the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test, and for antimicrobial administration, the committee provided numbers needed to treat. Three algorithms summarize the recommendations for infants 8 to 21 days of age, 22 to 28 days of age, and 29 to 60 days of age. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.

C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients — test characteristics and kinetics: Plasma CRP levels start to rise 12 — 24 hours after an acute inflammatory or infectious insult, reaching a maximum value after 48 hours. Levels of CRP are typically below 5 mg/L and the typical cutoff for CRP is 10 mg/L. Like PCT, results are available within minutes with point-of-care assays or within an hour with laboratory-based assays; laboratory assays are quantitative and suitable for serial monitoring. Unlike PCT, CRP concentrations can be affected by neutropenia, immunodeficiency, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Q fever — postexposure monitoring and early management: A daily fever monitoring log should be kept for a minimum of 3 weeks after exposure to C. burnetii, and the majority of infected persons have symptom onset 2–3 weeks after exposure, although onset can occur up to 6 weeks after exposure. If fever occurs during monitoring, immediate treatment with doxycycline should be administered and testing should be performed; treatment within 24 hours of fever onset is extremely effective in shortening illness duration and symptom severity. Baseline serologic testing can be performed with a convalescent sample drawn 6 weeks later to evaluate for asymptomatic seroconversion. Although asymptomatic infections do not routinely require treatment, treatment for asymptomatic infection might be considered in groups at high risk. The benefit of prophylactic antimicrobial agents is questionable and therefore not recommended, and the incubation period for Q fever is dose dependent.

### Current approaches for risk stratification of infectious complications in pediatric oncology [^114d3BtS]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Infections are serious complications of cytoreductive therapy in pediatric cancer patients presenting with febrile neutropenia. It is standard of care to initiate empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics until the fever and neutropenia resolve. However, it might be effective and safe to allow for early hospital discharge in certain subgroups of patients. Two strategies for risk stratification of pediatric cancer patients with regard to infectious complications are discussed in this review: (1) clinical risk parameters and laboratory measures to assist therapeutic management at presentation with fever in neutropenia, and (2) investigations of individual genetic susceptibility factors to tailor potential prophylactic approaches. Given the data available from a significant number of small studies, a large prospective non-inferiority trial is essential to assess low-risk clinical factors and additional laboratory or genetic markers for their predictive value.

### Current antimicrobial practice in febrile neutropenia across Europe and Asia: the EBMT infectious disease working party survey [^116zqUYk]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

ECIL guidelines emphasize that there is no need to escalate treatment in stable patients with persisting fever. This recommendation is supported by previous clinical trials which noted that the median time to defervescence in high risk neutropenic patients is 5 days. Nevertheless, more than half of centers add a glycopeptide (60.8%) and/or escalate to a broader spectrum agent (71.4%) empirically and the minority of these centers de-escalate later on. These empirical additions/escalations are performed significantly more frequently in centers from SE Europe and Asia, centers using FP and centers without IDM involvement.

The duration of empirical treatment is a debatable issue. IDSA and ESMO guidelines recommend continuing antibiotic therapy until neutrophil recovery. ECIL guidelines recommend considering treatment discontinuation after 72 h or later in hemodynamically stable patients with FUO who are afebrile for at least 48 h, irrespective of neutrophil count or expected duration of neutropenia. However, results of this survey show that in case of FUO, discontinuation of antibiotic therapy within 7 days is only performed in 17.6% and one-third of centers continue treatment until neutrophil recovery. Centers from SE Europe and Asia are less likely to discontinue antibiotic therapy before neutrophil recovery.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^1113a2Ra]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2015, an important prospective study on the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with complicated IAIs was published. The study randomized 518 patients with complicated IAIs and adequate source control to receive antibiotics until 2 days after the resolution of fever, leukocytosis, and ileus, with a maximum of 10 days of therapy (control group), or to receive a fixed course of antibiotics (experimental group) for 4 ± 1 calendar days. In patients with complicated IAIs who had undergone an adequate source control procedure, the outcomes after fixed-duration antibiotic therapy (approximately 4 days) were similar to those after a long course of antibiotics (approximately 8 days) that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. In this study, most patients were not severely ill.

The high mortality associated with abdominal sepsis requires clinicians to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion of treatment failure and the early diagnosis of ongoing infections. These patients should always be monitored carefully including the potential use of inflammatory response markers.

Guideline methodology — consensus and best-practice statements: Best-practice statements were made only when suggested GRADE criteria for best-practice statements were met. Best practice statements had to be clear, answer an important actionable question where the benefit would be unequivocally large, and evidence would be difficult to collect or summarize, and an explicit rationale for the benefit was provided. After finalizing a preliminary recommendation, members of the taskforce received electronic links to indicate their agreement or disagreement, and consensus required 80% agreement by at least 75% of the voting panel.

Table 2 — Initial antibiotic use for acute bacterial sinusitis in children delineates therapy by presentation: for uncomplicated disease, the table lists Antibiotic therapy for severe and worsening illness and Antibiotic therapy or additional observation for 3 days for persistent illness, and for acute bacterial sinusitis with orbital or intracranial complications it lists Antibiotic therapy. Severe acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as temperature ≥ 39°C with purulent nasal discharge present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days; worsening illness is defined by sudden worsening with new-onset fever ≥ 38° C/100.4° F or substantial increase in nasal discharge or cough after transient improvement; persistent illness is defined by nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement. A footnote notes an "Opportunity for shared decision-making" and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens at any time or fails to improve within 3 days of observation.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^112RLEBD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Evaluating fever and determining the likelihood of an underlying infection can be challenging. It is important for the surgical intensivist to remain vigilant to identify sepsis and septic shock and also to exercise clinical judgment and forethought when ordering antibiotics. In the absence of sepsis (as defined by sepsis-3 guidelines) and septic shock, the data support selective utilization of cultures and antibiotic use. In most infections, the evidence is accumulating in favor of the safety and efficacy of shorter courses of treatment. Table 3 provides a summary of the recommendations for antibiotic durations for common ICU infections. We present here a consensus summary from the AAST Critical Care Committee for our approach to fever in the ICU and for the treatment of common surgical intensive care infections, namely VAP, UTI, CRBSI, bacteremia, intra-abdominal abscess, SSI, ventriculitis, and necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections.

### Guidance statement for the management of febrile neutropenia in pediatric patients receiving cancer-directed therapy in central America and the caribbean [^114668cn]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Panel deliberations.

The evidence indicates no significant difference in clinical outcomes with oral versus intravenous therapy. The route should be selected by considering patient and family preferences, along with the feasibility of oral antibiotic administration.

10. The panel RECOMMENDS escalating the initial empirical antibacterial regimen in persistently febrile patients to include coverage for resistant gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria in pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia who become clinically unstable (Quality of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak).

For evidence and panel deliberations, please refer to recommendations 5–7.

11. The panel RECOMMENDS de-escalation to monotherapy after 48 to 72 hours for stable pediatric patients who are responding to initial empirical antibiotic therapy in the absence of a clinical or microbiologic indication to continue a second agent (Quality of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak).

A literature review found no randomized controlled trials to inform this recommendation.

Panel deliberations.

The panel prioritized the prevention of antibiotic-associated toxicities and the development of resistance and therefore recommends stopping glycopeptides or the second of 2 gram-negative–directed agents (usually an aminoglycoside) without a clear indication to continue therapy. The panel could not determine the optimal duration of combination therapy and recommends following institutional practices.

12. The panel RECOMMENDS no change to the initial empirical antibacterial regimen in pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia who are clinically stable except for persistent fever (Quality of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak).

A literature review found no randomized controlled trials to inform this recommendation.

### Dicloxacillin sodium [^1125ShBB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Information for the Patient

Patients should be counselled that antibacterial drugs including dicloxacillin sodium capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When dicloxacillin sodium capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by dicloxacillin sodium capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Patients receiving penicillins should be given the following information and instructions by the physician:

Patients should be told that penicillin is an antibacterial agent which will work with the body's natural defenses to control certain types of infections. They should be told that the drug should not be taken if they have had an allergic reaction to any form of penicillin previously, and to inform the physician of any allergies or previous allergic reactions to any drugs they may have had (see WARNINGS).
Patients who have previously experienced an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin should be instructed to wear a medical identification tag or bracelet.
Because most antibacterial drugs taken by mouth are best absorbed on an empty stomach, patients should be directed, unless circumstances warrant otherwise, to take penicillin one hour before meals or two hours after eating (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Pharmacokinetics).
Patients should be told to take the entire course of therapy prescribed, even if fever and other symptoms have stopped (see PRECAUTIONS - General).
If any of the following reactions occur, stop taking your prescription and notify the physician: shortness of breath, wheezing, skin rash, mouth irritation, black tongue, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, swollen joints or any unusual bleeding or bruising (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).
Do not take any additional medications without physician approval, including nonprescription drugs such as antacids, laxatives or vitamins.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^116hX9Lw]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

ICU infections

Ventilator-associated pneumonia

Question

What is the appropriate treatment approach for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)?

Recommendation

Initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP requires consideration of patient-specific culture data, recent antibiotic exposure, the local antibiogram, and timing of when infection developed. Common regimens for hospital-acquired infections are vancomycin plus either cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam or in cases of severe penicillin allergy, aztreonam, although no specific regimen is generally superior. Empiric anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended. We recommend de-escalation of antibiotic treatment when culture data are available. Seven days of treatment is sufficient for most patients. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) nasal swab testing should be used to determine the need for empiric coverage.

Discussion

Evidence suggests mortality is lower when the initial antibiotic therapy is effective, even when switched to adequate therapy after culture data become available. Therefore, it is important to initiate appropriate antibiotics when there is strong clinical suspicion of VAP. There is no evidence of superiority of one specific empiric regimen over another and appropriateness is targeted in context of the hospital antibiogram and specific patient risk factors.

Trauma is a risk factor for staphylococcal infections, specifically traumatic head injury and road traffic injuries.MRSA nasal swab testing is useful because of its high negative predictive value for MRSA carrier status and if negative can obviate the need for MRSA coverage, as evidenced by recent data in the trauma population. Anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended due to lack of evidence of benefit and some evidence of harm. Empiric coverage is specifically tailored to S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and Gram-negative bacilli.

High-level evidence shows no benefit with treating longer than 7 days in most patients with exceptions limited to severe lung disease, severe immunosuppression, concomitant ARDS, and multidrug resistance. To de-escalate an antibiotic regimen, it is important that culture data be obtained at the time of diagnosis. Duration of therapy of 7 days and antibiotic de-escalation recommendations are consistent with the ATS/IDSA guidelines of 2016.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111FLWvf]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD COPD guideline — antibiotics for outpatient exacerbations states: "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of antibiotics for outpatient COPD exacerbations (C-reactive protein guided or not). (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-replaced)". An SR suggested decreased risk for treatment failures "up to one month following the initiation of treatment", but also "found no significant difference between antibiotic treatment and placebo in re-exacerbations in 2–6 weeks, median time to next exacerbation up to 12 months, and all-cause mortality up to two years after starting antibiotic treatment". Safety signals include that "one SR and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests an increase in diarrhea with antibiotic therapy compared with placebo from four weeks to two years post commencement of antibiotics", and "No significant difference was found in harms between shorter and longer durations of broad spectrum antibiotics". For biomarker-guided prescribing, "the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing guided antibiotic prescription compared to usual care, had no clinically important difference in adverse effects… at six months", and "The Work Group did not review evidence on other specific biomarkers, such as procalcitonin". Clinically, "Based on clinical judgment, antibiotic therapy may be warranted and beneficial on a case-by-case basis", with examples including "a moderate exacerbation, increased dyspnea and increased sputum volume/purulence, fever/chills, and leukocytosis with radiographic evidence of pneumonia". The Work Group's confidence in the evidence was stated as low.

### STOP signs: a population-based interrupted time series analysis of antibiotic duration for complicated intraabdominal infection before and after the publication of a landmark RCT [^114Rxi1y]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics were discontinued in the control arm of STOP-IT two days after cessation of fever, leukocytosis, and ileus (previously considered standard practice). We examined temperature and leukocyte count among those who remained on antibiotics on Day 5 and beyond (Table 3). We did not have data on resolution of ileus. On each additional day of antibiotics, fever and in particular leukocytosis were more common in those who continued versus those whose antibiotics were stopped. However, on each day, fewer than half of those who continued antimicrobials had fever or leukocytosis, suggesting that additional unmeasured factors may be driving prolonged antibiotic administration.

The results suggest there is opportunity for antimicrobial stewardship to reduce antibiotic duration. In Calgary, these efforts will include disseminating the results of this study and incorporating the STOP-IT trial into resident and staff education as the first steps in an iterative implementation science process. This is important due to the potential harms of unnecessarily prolonged antibiotic administration such as delayed identification of recurrent infection, development of an extra-abdominal infection, C. difficile-associated diarrhea, and unnecessary healthcare spending.– Even before STOP-IT was published, the 2010 Surgical Infection Society & Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines recommend that total duration of antibiotics among patients with CIAI should "rarely exceed 5–7 days". Despite an RCT confirming the safety of this recommendation, the current study suggests that patients with CIAI continue to receive long courses of antibiotics, and that even among patients with acute appendicitis or cholecystitis where antibiotic duration seems to be short there is likely additional opportunity to shorten prescription durations. This study also suggests there may be factors outside the traditional markers of infection progress (i.e. fever and leukocytosis) that inform antibiotic duration. Therefore, aligning clinical practice with contemporary evidence will require active methods of IS that engages all stakeholders. Qualitative investigation of the determinants of antibiotic duration among prescribers can improve the design of tailored IS interventions. Interventions might include introducing point of care decision support or automatic stop dates through computerized physician order entry, implementing clinical pathways, or involving additional consultants. Effective IS will be particularly important given that adopting the results of STOP-IT requires reducing use of care that is low-value, a direction of practice change that is frequently more difficult to achieve than increasing use of high-value care. –

### Prediction model for prolonged fever in patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia: a retrospective study of 716 pediatric patients [^1164J3N7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, patients of every age can develop a severe and progressive course during treatment with appropriate antibiotic therapy. The underlying mechanisms are unclear, but a direct microbe effect, macrolide resistance, and excessive immunological response of the host are commonly suggested. Macrolide antibiotics have been generally preferred as the first-choice agents for MP infections because secondary antibiotics such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones are not recommended because of the risk of severe adverse events, especially in pediatric patients.

Macrolide resistance rates have risen throughout the world and vary across countries. Although macrolides could be continued in cases of mild to moderate infections irrespective of their resistance, replacement by alternative antibiotics or additional corticosteroids have been shown to improve radiological abnormalities and clinical symptoms. Additionally, the severity of the disease is partially related to the degree to which the host immune response reacts to infection. The concept of immune-mediated lung disease provides a basis for consideration of immunomodulatory therapy in addition to conventional antimicrobial therapies for the management of MP infections.

The appropriate time for alternative treatment is not clarified, but it still depends on the physician's decision. Alternative treatments are delayed on some occasions owing to concerns regarding toxicities and adverse effects of secondary antibiotics or the possibility of blurred diagnosis caused by corticosteroids, leading to aggravation of the clinical course. Protracted courses of fever or worsening respiratory exertion despite treatment with macrolides are reported to complicate atelectasis, parapneumonic effusion, bronchiolitis obliterans, necrotizing pneumonitis, pulmonary abscess, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. At the initiation phase of macrolide therapy, physicians find it difficult to predict patients with a prolonged or severe clinical course. Previous studies have suggested individual cut-off values for inflammatory markers to differentiate between the patients with or without clinical and radiological progression after macrolide therapy for 7 days or longer. Identifying patients who are expected to undergo a prolonged or severe clinical course would help in providing them with timely secondary treatment and mitigating their clinical course.

This study aims to identify the predictive factors for prolonged fever in patients with MP pneumonia with readily accessible clinical, laboratory, and radiological data and to develop a predictive model for these patients in whom timely initiation of secondary treatment options should be considered.

### What is the best approach to the nonresponding patient with community-acquired pneumonia? [^114yJGaW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment failure in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the failure to normalize the clinical features (eg, fever, cough, sputum production), or nonresolving image in chest radiograph, despite antimicrobial therapy. The incidence of treatment failure in CAP has not been clearly established; according to several studies it ranges between 6% and 15%. The rate of mortality increases significantly, especially in those patients with severe CAP. It is important to be able to identify what patients are at risk for progressive or treatment failure pneumonia that may make them candidates for a more careful monitoring.

### Streptomycin [^115Un1hS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including streptomycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When streptomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by streptomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Drug Interactions

The ototoxic effects of the aminoglycosides, including streptomycin, are potentiated by the coadministration of ethacrynic acid, furosemide, mannitol and possibly other diuretics.

Nursing Mothers

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from streptomycin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

### Neutropenic fever [^116pKz2X]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Fever is a common presenting complaint among adult or pediatric patients in the emergency department setting. Although fever in healthy individuals does not necessarily indicate severe illness, fever in patients with neutropenia may herald a life-threatening infection. Therefore, prompt recognition of patients with neutropenic fever is imperative. Serious bacterial illness is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for neutropenic patients. Neutropenic fever should trigger the initiation of a rapid work-up and the administration of empiric systemic antibiotic therapy to attenuate or avoid the progression along the spectrum of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock syndrome, and death.

### Fever therapy revisited [^1114wru2]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

A large fraction of spontaneous regressions and remissions described in the literature was preceded by a hefty feverish infection. The hypothesis that fever can have therapeutic value can be brought in line both with successful historical attempts to apply fever using bacterial extracts and with immunological evidence. Putative beneficial effects of fever should as well act preventive, and indeed epidemiological studies show that a personal history of feverish infections reduces the likelihood to develop cancer later.

Immunological strategies to break cancer cell tolerance should be individualised rather than generic. Fever induction will necessarily induce an individual response, which even addresses the problem of antigenic drift in time. Today we should be able to induce and control fever much better than 100 years ago. The discussion should be re-opened if and how to best scrutinise fever therapy in the future (seefor online discussion).

### Enteric fever [^112CtaNk]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

What are the complications?

Severe disease usually manifests in the second or third week of illness with continuing fever, increasing weakness, anaemia, weight loss, persistent vomiting, or a clouded mental state. Delayed treatment, the virulence of the bacterial strain, and host factors contribute to disease severity. In a pooled analysis (13 studies, 2554 patients), 27% (95% CI 21% to 32%) of patients with enteric fever experienced complications. Encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, nephritis, and hepatitis are common complications seen in 5–7% of hospitalised patients(see supplementary table 3). Intestinal haemorrhage or colitis and intestinal perforation can occur. These present with signs of acute peritonitis or more insidiously with increasing restlessness, a diffusely tender abdomen, hypotension, tachycardia, and shock.

The mean case fatality rate with enteric fever is 2.49% (95% CI 1.65% to 3.75%), and 4.45% (2.85% to 6.88%) in hospitalised patients as per a recent systematic review (44 studies, 41 723 patients). Between 5% and 10% of patients experience a relapse with a second episode of fever two to three weeks after initial recovery. This usually responds to the original treatment.
