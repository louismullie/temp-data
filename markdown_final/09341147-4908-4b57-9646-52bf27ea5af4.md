## Question

How should kleinfelter syndrome be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Klinefelter syndrome should be managed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnosis timing and confirmation strategy. Then, I should address early developmental interventions. Next, I will evaluate puberty management and the role of testosterone in adolescents. After that, I must weigh fertility preservation options and timing of TESE. Subsequently, I will cover adult endocrine and reproductive care. I also need to outline comorbidity surveillance, mental health and quality-of-life needs, special populations such as transgender individuals, and lifelong multidisciplinary coordination, while highlighting controversies and evidence gaps with appropriate citations throughout [^117FthPZ] [^1152eFq1].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic pathway and why early identification matters, because I need to ensure we anchor subsequent decisions to a verified karyotype. NIPT has driven a marked rise in prenatal detection of 47, XXY since around 2016, but confirmatory testing with karyotype or microarray remains the gold standard, and underdiagnosis persists into adulthood, often at infertility workups, so early identification enables timely neurodevelopmental and endocrine surveillance and anticipatory guidance [^117FthPZ] [^111PUMhC] [^113UPooE] [^1152eFq1].

> Wait, let me verify the early developmental course and recommended screening cadence, because that sets the trajectory for childhood services. Prospective cohorts indicate frequent early speech-language and motor delays, with suggested comprehensive developmental assessments at 9–15, 18–24, and 30–36 months to trigger early speech-language, occupational, and educational interventions, while broader pediatric data confirm elevated risks for language disorders, ADHD, and autism spectrum features, warranting proactive school-based supports and behavioral screening [^117FthPZ] [^1129QmRY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adolescent hypogonadism, because I need to check whether routine testosterone in early puberty is justified. I initially thought KS in adolescence typically reflects hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but that is not correct; classic KS is primary testicular failure with elevated gonadotropins, and longitudinal data show most boys progress through puberty with normal testosterone in early to mid-adolescence, supporting watchful monitoring rather than reflex TRT, while acknowledging compensated hypogonadism physiology with high FSH/LH and normal T in many cases [^1147PJWg] [^1152eFq1].

> I should confirm how to operationalize adolescent endocrine follow-up, because management hinges on objective trends and symptoms. A sensible approach is to monitor every 6–12 months for testosterone, LH, FSH, SHBG, and clinical features of androgen deficiency, starting TRT only for symptomatic hypogonadism or clearly subnormal testosterone, and to be cautious with prepubertal and peripubertal androgens given data that oxandrolone can precipitate earlier gonadarche without demonstrable long-term gonadal benefit, which argues for restraint and individualized risk–benefit discussions [^1152eFq1] [^1137o346].

> Next, I should review fertility preservation strategy, but wait, I need to double-check how adolescent versus adult TESE outcomes compare and how exogenous testosterone affects spermatogenesis. Sperm appears in the ejaculate in a small minority, and micro-TESE retrieves testicular sperm in roughly half of late adolescents and adults, with no definitive evidence that routine adolescent TESE improves ultimate outcomes over deferring to adulthood; importantly, if TRT is planned or ongoing, harvest and cryopreserve sperm before initiation or consider holding TRT because exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis, so a stepwise pathway of semen analysis first, then TESE if azoospermic, is reasonable [^113PPr7Q] [^112pNFQF] [^111uzetK] [^115hPxgz].

> Let me think about adult endocrine and reproductive care, because I need to ensure safe TRT and fertility sequencing. In adults with symptomatic hypogonadism and low T, initiate evidence-based TRT and monitor hematocrit, lipids, blood pressure, and bone health, recognizing KS-associated metabolic and thrombotic risk; when planning conception, discontinue exogenous testosterone several months prior, attempt ejaculated sperm retrieval, proceed to micro-TESE if azoospermic, use ICSI for fertilization, and provide genetic counseling including discussion of aneuploidy risks and consideration of preimplantation testing [^1152eFq1] [^117XePcA] [^115hPxgz].

> I will now examine comorbidity surveillance across systems, and I need to ensure we do not miss preventable risks. KS confers excess cardiometabolic burden and venous thromboembolism risk, which warrants annual screening for glucose, lipids, blood pressure, and anthropometrics, aggressive lifestyle counseling, vigilance for polycythemia on TRT, and a bone health plan with baseline and periodic DEXA plus calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise; breast and mediastinal germ cell tumor risks justify breast awareness and clinical exams and attention to chest or pubertal-red-flag symptoms, while autoimmune conditions should be considered in differential diagnoses of rheumatic complaints [^1152eFq1] [^117XePcA] [^111eTvWb] [^116b1cvd].

> But wait, what if the main driver of poor outcomes is psychosocial rather than endocrine alone; I should review mental health and quality-of-life data. High rates of depressive symptoms and HR-QoL impairment are reported, supporting routine, validated screening and ready referral to psychological care, while qualitative and mixed-methods studies highlight the value of supported disclosure, family and partner engagement, and structured coping resources, which should be integrated into multidisciplinary care plans and revisited during key transitions [^116uTBQm] [^1152eFq1] [^117Hkody] [^1152s38L].

> I need to check considerations for transgender and gender diverse individuals with KS, because hormone therapy decisions intersect with KS-specific risks. A higher-than-expected prevalence of KS has been reported among trans individuals presumed male at birth, and fertility discussions should precede feminizing hormone therapy analogous to TRT timing, with added vigilance for thromboembolic risk and breast cancer screening tailored to tissue exposure and individual risk profiles during gender-affirming care [^113E1bNQ] [^117DamJp].

> Hold on, I should verify how mosaic KS alters the plan, since phenotype can be milder and fertility potential may differ. Mosaic 46, XY/47, XXY individuals may have higher endogenous testosterone and, in some cases, spontaneous sperm in ejaculate, so management should be individualized by phenotype and goals, while adhering to the same principles of shared decision-making around fertility and symptom-driven endocrine therapy [^114ZAPeG] [^115hPxgz].

> Next, I should review prevalence and underdiagnosis to contextualize screening efforts, because this influences public health and anticipatory guidance. The global prevalence is on the order of 10–20 per 100,000 with substantial underrecognition, and as NIPT expands, prenatal detection may allow implementation of standardized early developmental screening schedules and longitudinal endocrine surveillance to mitigate long-term morbidity [^112crcgU] [^117FthPZ] [^1152eFq1].

> I will now outline multidisciplinary coordination and transitions, but let me first confirm the guideline landscape. Only one endorsed guideline framework is identified, and consensus statements remain limited, so care should deliberately integrate genetics for counseling, endocrinology for hormone and metabolic management, urology/andrology for fertility procedures, psychology and allied therapies for neurodevelopmental and mental health, and primary care for prevention, with structured handoffs from pediatric to adult teams to preserve continuity [^117XePcA] [^1152eFq1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, before summarizing, I should double-check the chief controversies and evidence gaps to ensure balanced counseling. There is persistent uncertainty regarding the optimal timing of TESE and the net benefit of adolescent TRT absent clear biochemical or clinical hypogonadism, and high-quality comparative trials are lacking, which necessitates shared decision-making that addresses values, psychosocial readiness, and evolving evidence while prioritizing registries and prospective studies to refine future guidance [^111uzetK] [^1152eFq1] [^1157yU5i].

> Finally, translating this into a practical sequence, let me reconsider the flow to avoid omissions. Confirm KS by karyotype or microarray, initiate early developmental surveillance and interventions if diagnosed in infancy, monitor pubertal progression with periodic hormones and defer TRT unless symptomatic or biochemically indicated, address fertility proactively with semen analysis and counsel on TESE timing with a plan to cryopreserve prior to starting TRT, manage adult hypogonadism with guideline-based TRT and metabolic and bone monitoring, coordinate assisted reproduction with ICSI and genetic counseling, and maintain lifelong cardiometabolic, thrombotic, bone, oncologic, and mental health surveillance within a multidisciplinary framework, remembering to evaluate coexisting conditions such as cryptorchidism when present and to plan structured transitions to adult care [^113UPooE] [^117FthPZ] [^1147PJWg] [^112pNFQF] [^1152eFq1] [^117ToYq5].

Management of Klinefelter syndrome centers on **testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)** to address hypogonadism [^114ZAPeG], typically initiated in mid-to-late puberty [^112t1acp] and continued lifelong [^1152eFq1] to maintain adult male testosterone levels. Fertility preservation should be discussed early [^112pNFQF]; if sperm are present, **cryopreservation** is considered [^113PPr7Q], and **testicular sperm extraction (TESE)** with **intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)** is offered when needed [^115hPxgz] [^111qDeUi]. Management also includes regular monitoring and treatment of metabolic, cardiovascular, and bone health risks [^1152eFq1], as well as psychological and neurocognitive support [^1129QmRY]. A multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinology, urology, fertility, psychology, and primary care [^117XePcA] is essential for comprehensive care [^117Hkody].

## Hormonal management

### Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)

- **Indication**: TRT is indicated for hypogonadism [^114ZAPeG], typically initiated in mid-to-late puberty (Tanner stage 3–4) [^112t1acp] and continued lifelong to maintain adult male testosterone levels [^1152eFq1].

- **Benefits**: TRT improves secondary sexual characteristics [^114ZAPeG], muscle mass [^115hPxgz], bone density [^1152eFq1], mood, energy, and sexual function.

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of testosterone levels, hematocrit, lipid profile, liver function, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is recommended [^1152eFq1].

---

## Fertility management

### Fertility preservation and assisted reproductive techniques

- **Early counseling**: Early discussion of fertility preservation is essential [^113PPr7Q] [^111uzetK], as spermatogenesis declines rapidly after puberty.

- **Sperm cryopreservation**: If sperm are present in ejaculate [^113PPr7Q], cryopreservation is recommended before initiating TRT [^117GVK44].

- **Testicular sperm extraction (TESE)**: TESE combined with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) [^115hPxgz] is the standard approach for azoospermic patients [^113PPr7Q], with sperm retrieval rates of 40–70% [^112vF4g9].

- **Timing**: TESE can be performed in adolescence or adulthood [^111uzetK], with no clear advantage to early adolescence [^112pNFQF] [^111qDeUi].

---

## Management of comorbidities

### Metabolic and cardiovascular health

Metabolic and cardiovascular health should be addressed through **regular screening** for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [^1152eFq1]. Management emphasizes **lifestyle measures** — including diet, exercise, and weight management — and pharmacological treatment of identified metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors as indicated [^1178BApW].

---

### Bone health

Bone health management includes periodic dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (**DEXA**) to assess bone mineral density [^1152eFq1]. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended to prevent **osteoporosis**; **bisphosphonates** are considered for significant osteoporosis [^117XePcA].

---

### Psychological and neurocognitive support

Psychological and neurocognitive support involves regular **neuropsychological assessment** for cognitive, language, and learning difficulties [^1129QmRY]. Counseling and **support groups** address anxiety, depression, and social challenges [^116uTBQm]; individualized educational plans and speech therapy are provided as needed [^111jTgM7].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

- **Endocrinologist**: Hormonal management and monitoring [^1152eFq1].

- **Urologist/andrologist**: Fertility preservation and reproductive health [^112pNFQF].

- **Fertility specialist**: Assisted reproductive techniques [^115hPxgz].

- **Psychologist/psychiatrist**: Mental health support [^116uTBQm].

- **Primary care physician**: Coordination of care and management of comorbidities [^117XePcA].

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging therapies and research directions include **investigational gene therapy** approaches targeting the genetic mechanisms underlying Klinefelter syndrome. Studies are evaluating novel hormonal strategies, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors [^113PPr7Q], and **personalized medicine** efforts to tailor treatment to individual genetic and phenotypic profiles [^114cdezf].

---

## Patient education and support

Patient education and support prioritize providing comprehensive information on Klinefelter syndrome, available treatment options, and potential complications [^117Hkody]. Participation in **support groups** is encouraged for emotional and social support [^1152s38L], and **genetic counseling** is essential for patients and families to understand genetic implications and reproductive options [^117FthPZ].

---

Management of Klinefelter syndrome requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach [^1152eFq1] that incorporates **TRT as the cornerstone** [^115hPxgz] of hormonal management, early fertility preservation, and regular monitoring of comorbidities [^117XePcA]. Psychological support [^116uTBQm] and patient education are essential for improving quality of life [^117Hkody].

### Fertility considerations in adolescent Klinefelter syndrome: Current practice patterns [^111qDeUi]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Damani et al. demonstrated the feasibility of TESE in adolescent males with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) and wondered whether TESE should be considered in adolescent KS as a means to optimize success rates and preserve biological paternity potential. However, since then, many studies have shown that sperm retrieval rates in early adolescents are not as high as in older adolescents, which are, in turn, equivalent to those in adults (~50%). Therefore, the literature does not support the mandatory need for TESE in adolescents compared to simply waiting until the patient and his partner are desirous of conception. However, as can be seen by the survey results, this strategy is still seen as advantageous by some providers.

The clinical value the KS adolescent derives from testosterone treatment and the need for such therapy is based upon the notion that testosterone levels, which are typically normal or low normal in late puberty, decrease rapidly after puberty, and that the KS male will eventually need testosterone replacement. However, the testosterone levels in the majority of adolescents with KS remain relatively stable into early adulthood. Therefore, there is no need for reflex replacement in all men with KS. Since testosterone treatment would be expected to suppress whatever endogenous testosterone production and minimal level of spermatogenesis might be present, harvesting and cryopreservation of sperm prior to starting testosterone replacement is indicated. However, there may be no need for TESE if there is no need for testosterone therapy, as seen by the survey results.

### A clinical algorithm for management of fertility in adolescents with the Klinefelter syndrome [^113PPr7Q]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to present a clinical algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of adolescents with Klinefelter's syndrome who desire fertility preservation.

Recent findings indicate that sperm is present in the ejaculate in about 8% of men with Klinefelter's syndrome. Although most are severely oligospermic or azoospermic, 43–45% of men will have sperm found during a testicular sperm extraction, reaching up to 70% in adolescents.

Klinefelter's syndrome (47, XXY) causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and severe oligospermia or azoospermia, rendering natural conception rare. During puberty, boys often require testosterone replacement therapy to develop secondary sexual characteristics, which can further decrease spermatogenesis. There is a progressive decrease in testicular germ cells after the onset of puberty, suggesting that fertility evaluation and preservation should begin shortly thereafter.

In adolescents desiring fertility evaluation, any testosterone therapy should be discontinued. Hormones and gonadotropins should be measured, and a semen analysis should be obtained. Adolescents with low testosterone are administered aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and/or human chorionic gonadotropin to increase endogenous testosterone production. After testosterone levels are normalized, semen analysis is performed, and cryopreservation is encouraged if sperm is present. For those without sperm in the ejaculate, a testicular sperm extraction is offered.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^114ZAPeG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy

KS is the most common congenital cause of primary male hypogonadism. Individuals with the classical phenotype (XXY) typically exhibit diminished testicular size, function, and impaired spermatogenesis, though this presentation varies, especially in cases of mosaicism. Testicular dysfunction results from progressive gonadal failure, characterized by tubular atrophy, sclerosis, and maturation arrest, leading to fibrosis and hyalinized tissue due to germ and Sertoli cell loss. Histological examination reveals apparent Leydig cell hyperplasia due to the loss of virtually all Sertoli cells, as well as interstitial tissue proliferation. Testicular volume in KS patients rarely exceeds 5 to 6 mL, with degeneration becoming most apparent at the cusp of puberty, when testicular function and architecture begin to decline.

T levels vary considerably, particularly in younger individuals and those with mosaicism (46, XY/47, XXY). While most men with KS have subnormal total T levels, approximately 20% to 30% maintain total T within the low-normal range, particularly in milder cases or mosaic forms. Elevated luteinizing hormone is observed in more than 80% of adult KS patients, even in patients with normal or low total T levels, indicating compensated hypogonadism. One study investigating different forms of hypogonadism in men with KS found 15.6% had normal total T values at presentation, 51.4% had compensated hypogonadism, and 33% had primary hypogonadism.

### Safety and efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy in adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome [^112t1acp]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

We investigated the safety and tolerability of testosterone replacement therapy in adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome.

- **Materials and methods**: We reviewed the medical records of all consecutive adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome evaluated between 2007 and 2012. Patients receiving testosterone replacement and aromatase inhibitor therapy were identified. Data on demographics, physical characteristics, medical history, and serum hormone concentrations were collected for each patient. We evaluated longitudinal changes in serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone, as well as changes in body mass index after the initiation of testosterone replacement therapy.

- **Results**: We identified 151 adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome. The mean age at presentation was 11.6 years. Testosterone replacement therapy and aromatase inhibitors were initiated in 110 and 75 patients, respectively, at an average age of 13 to 14 years. Topical testosterone replacement therapy was used in 95% of patients with good clinical efficacy and compliance based on serial serum testosterone values. After the initiation of testosterone replacement therapy, average serum testosterone improved from 240 to 650 ng/ml. Serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone increased with the progression of puberty from 2.6 to 16.6 and 7 to 42 mIU/ml, respectively. No adverse outcomes related to testosterone replacement therapy were reported.

- **Conclusions**: Hormone supplementation with testosterone and aromatase inhibitors in adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome appears to be effective and well-tolerated.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^117MGCPV]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Transgender (trans) individuals, including those with a binary and/or non-binary gender identity, represent a growing population with unique healthcare needs. Some trans individuals experience gender dysphoria, which refers to the distress that arises from the incongruence between one's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. A complex set of factors determines one's gender identity, and there has been increasing research into the potential genetic basis of gender incongruence. At the time of writing, variations in the estrogen receptor, estrogen receptor coactivators, as well as androgen receptor have been reported in trans individuals. Past studies have also suggested a higher prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome amongst trans individuals presumed male at birth compared to the expected prevalence in the general population.

Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) is the most common sex chromosomal disorder in individuals presumed male at birth, affecting 0.02%−0.22% of the population. Klinefelter syndrome is a significantly underdiagnosed condition with estimates suggesting only 25%−50% of individuals are diagnosed. Diagnosis is frequently made in adulthood during fertility assessment. Individuals with Klinefelter syndrome have a primary testicular failure, with resultant clinical features including small testes, gynaecomastia, sparse male-pattern body hair, and eunuchoid proportions.

Klinefelter syndrome is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, breast cancer, and infertility, which could have treatment implications before and following initiation of feminizing gender-affirming therapies.

### Growth hormone deficiency and central precocious puberty in Klinefelter syndrome: Report of a case and review of KIGS database [^117XSq7Y]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and central precocious puberty (CPP) have individually been described in patients with Klinefelter syndrome. However, the combination of GHD, CPP, and Klinefelter syndrome has never been reported. We described a Klinefelter syndrome patient who developed GHD at age 2 years and 10 months and CPP at 8 years and 6 months. Despite CPP, GnRH agonist therapy was not initiated because of his excellent predicted adult height. At 11 years and 8 months, his height was 164.6 cm, close to his mid-parental target height of 165 cm. We report an additional nine patients with Klinefelter syndrome and GHD from the Pfizer International Growth Study (KIGS) database, none of whom had CPP. We conclude that the combination of GHD and CPP is very rare in Klinefelter syndrome and that CPP is unlikely to compromise final adult height.

### Fertility considerations in adolescent Klinefelter syndrome: Current practice patterns [^111uzetK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

In this issue of the journal, Zganjar et al. report the findings of a survey of the practices of fertility care in adolescent males with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) among members of the Society for the Study of Male Reproduction, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, and the Endocrine Society. The overall response rates were 4.7%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Questions revolved around testosterone replacement, sperm banking, and testis sperm extraction (TESE) in adolescents with KS. Even though numerous publications have determined that testosterone levels in adolescent males with KS are within the low normal range, there continues to be debate about whether such males require testosterone replacement. Likewise, several thoughtful commentaries have discussed the pros and cons of TESE for "fertility preservation" during adolescence versus postponing procreative management until adulthood. In light of the relative paucity of high-quality evidence and a lack of consensus on the optimum timing of TESE in persons with KS (prepubertal, pubertal, adolescent, or adult), it is unsurprising that the survey conducted by Zganjar et al. revealed wide variation in the approach to testosterone treatment and TESE in adolescents with KS.

KS, a group of chromosomal disorders characterized by the presence of one or more extra X chromosomes, is typically associated with hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules, azoospermia, and infertility. The molecular basis of the KS phenotype is incompletely understood. Only some phenotypic features of KS can be explained by testosterone deficiency.

### Oxandrolone treatment results in an increased risk of gonadarche in prepubertal boys with Klinefelter syndrome [^1137o346]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a common genetic condition in which males have an extra X chromosome. KS is associated with testosterone deficiency, neurodevelopmental delays, and cardiometabolic disorders. There has been recent interest in prepubertal androgen treatment; however, the effects on puberty and gonadal function are unknown.

- **Objective**: To compare the onset of puberty and testicular function in prepubertal boys treated with 2 years of oxandrolone (Ox) versus placebo (Pl).

- **Design**: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Single tertiary care referral center.

- **Participants**: Eighty prepubertal boys with KS; mean age: 8.0 ± 2.2 years (range: 4 to 12).

- **Interventions**: Ox 0.05 mg/kg versus identical-appearing Pl capsule given for 2 years.

- **Outcome measures**: Onset of gonadarche (testicular volume ≥ 4 mL) and onset of pubarche (Tanner 2 pubic hair); change in testicular hormone concentrations.

Results showed that the Ox-treated group had 20.5 times higher odds of reaching gonadarche (OR 95% CI: 6.5, 77.8) and 28.1 times higher odds of reaching pubarche (OR 95% CI: 8.8, 110.4) during the 2-year study period after adjusting for baseline age. Gonadarche and pubarche both occurred at a younger age in the Ox group (gonadarche: 9.8 ± 1.5 vs 12.1 ± 1.0 years, P < 0.001; pubarche: 10.2 ± 1.1 vs 11.6 ± 1.3 years, P = 0.02). Serum concentrations of testicular hormones and gonadotropins were not different between groups.

In conclusion, two years of Ox treatment in prepubertal boys with KS result in an increased risk of early gonadarche, on average 2 years earlier than in Pl-treated boys.

### Tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome improved by testosterone administration [^114MN8b8]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome was initially believed to be essential tremor since the publication of "Klinefelter's Syndrome and Essential Tremor" in 1969. However, the authors also stated that tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome might differ from essential tremor. A 71-year-old man with Klinefelter's syndrome who suffered from postural hand tremor is discussed. The electromyogram indicated lower motor neuron disturbance and chronic neurogenic change, while the muscle biopsy showed neurogenic muscle atrophy. Upon testosterone administration, the amplitude of tremor was reduced, and a gradual improvement in handwriting was observed. The tremor in this patient was different from essential tremor. The foresight by Baughman in 1969 proved to be true in this case. This case report offers new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of tremor in Klinefelter's syndrome, benefiting patients who experience this condition.

### Toward a potential association between eosinophilic esophagitis and Klinefelter syndrome: a case series and review of the literature [^113Qg4UA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common disorder of male sex aneuploidy, characterized by the presence of an additional X chromosome, occurring in 1 in every 500–1000 male births. Several disorders and a higher risk of autoimmune diseases have been reported in individuals with KS.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder occurring in 1 in 2000 people. Although antigens play a pivotal role in EoE, a genetic predisposition has been demonstrated. A potential pathogenic contributing role of genes located on the X chromosome has been suggested despite male predominance in this disorder.

We recently identified three subjects with KS among our cohort of 150 male adult EoE patients. The CARE guidelines and checklist were applied in the data collection process and drafting of the article. The aim of this work was to describe these three patients and to review the literature for similar cases, yielding a possible pathophysiological explanation.

### Klinefelter syndrome associated with goniodysgenesis [^117UJf8z]. Journal of Glaucoma (2012). Low credibility.

We report a case of a patient with Klinefelter syndrome and glaucoma.

- **Case presentation**: A 30-year-old patient with karyotype 47, XXY, presented with a known medical history of glaucoma. Besides reduced fertility, no characteristic physical or behavioral symptoms for Klinefelter syndrome were found on clinical examination. While both eyes were treated with topical intraocular pressure-lowering medications, an increased intraocular pressure, visual field losses, and advanced optic disc damage with a cup-disc ratio of 0.9 were assessed only in the right eye. However, gonioscopy revealed goniodysgenesis in both eyes.

- **Discussion**: Klinefelter syndrome is the most common cause of male hypogonadism with a variety of clinical signs and symptoms. The principal effect is hypogonadism predisposing to infertility and requiring testosterone replacement therapy. Several other classical features of the syndrome, including mental retardation, gynecomastia, and breast cancer, are described. However, the association between Klinefelter syndrome and ocular manifestations is rare.

- **Conclusions**: Glaucoma or, in fact, any other ocular manifestations associated with Klinefelter syndrome are rarely described. Here, we report a case of glaucoma and its treatment combining trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome.

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^111iwJa2]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

"Let it out" — lessons learned when disclosing one's diagnosis to others: All 13 participants had disclosed their KS diagnosis to at least one individual; however, the specifics of what was shared and the level of detail provided varied. Some participants do not use the term "Klinefelter syndrome" when disclosing and instead focus on medical aspects of their diagnosis, such as testosterone treatment or infertility. For example, regarding disclosure to friends, one participant stated, "I don't know if this sounds kind of weird but when bodybuilders say they're taking testosterone I say, 'Haha I take this'", but when asked if he had told any friends that he has KS, this participant stated, "no, not specifically Klinefelter".

There was also variability in whether participants shared broad information about KS. For example, one participant stated, "my therapist said just describe it as a rare, I guess, chromosome condition". In contrast, most participants chose to provide more detailed information regarding symptoms they attribute to KS or anticipate experiencing as a result of the condition. For example, when one participant was asked what he recalls telling his friends about KS, he stated, "just like the rundown just basic things that come with it. Like I take testosterone for it, without it I'm really tired and just my English is not that good because of it. Just things along those lines". Another participant stated, "I pretty much told [my girlfriend] everything that the doctor said… like what goes".

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^115ovxZt]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS; 47, XXY) is the most common chromosomal aneuploidy, affecting approximately 1 in 600 male births. Due to recent technological advances, KS is diagnosed more often in young individuals. This emerging population of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with KS makes it increasingly important to understand their unique experiences and perspectives. This qualitative study explored (1) the psychosocial well-being of AYAs with KS and (2) the resources and support systems they utilize to cope with challenges related to their diagnosis.

The study included 13 participants aged 14–23 (mean age 16 years) who completed semi-structured individual interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis was used. Three themes were generated concerning the psychosocial well-being, resources, and support systems of AYAs with KS:

- "I'm a little different: Rejecting stigmatization and integrating a diagnosis of KS into one's identity.
- **Let it out**: Lessons learned when disclosing one's diagnosis of KS to others.
- They accept me for who I am": The building blocks of a support system.

Participants largely viewed KS as part of themselves but not their whole identity, expressing a desire not to be labeled by others as "disabled". They voiced that disclosing KS to trusted others often provides a sense of relief and emphasized the importance of having a varied support system that includes individuals like parents, friends, and romantic partners. This study enhances the understanding of which support resources AYAs with KS are using, or not using, and provides insights into their experiences.

### What should we consider in the case of combined Down- and 47, XY,+i(X)(q10) Klinefelter syndromes? The unique case of a male newborn and review of the literature [^115y4NkE]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Double aneuploidies, especially in combination with structural aberrations, are extremely rare among liveborns. The most frequent co-occurrence is of Down syndrome (DS) and Klinefelter syndrome (KS) with a coincidence of 0.098%, given that they are common and relatively well-tolerated chromosome abnormalities in humans. Although their features are separately well described, their co-occurrence and association with the i(X)(q10) structural abnormality necessitates a specific approach.

### State-wide increase in prenatal diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome on amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling: Impact of non-invasive prenatal testing for sex chromosome conditions [^117FthPZ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). High credibility.

Using population-based data collection with full capture of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) procedures, we demonstrate an unprecedented rise in the prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCA) since 2016, predominantly driven by the detection of 47, XXY via non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). While NIPT became available on a self-funded basis in late 2012, there was no statistically significant increase in the prenatal detection of SCA before 2016. The subsequent increase likely reflects the rapid uptake of NIPT after this time, including screening for SCAs.

Traditionally, only children with SCAs on the more severe end of the spectrum present with clinical features at birth or indeed for medical care at any time across the life course, with up to 75% of males with 47, XXY remaining undetected. Although the clinical phenotype cannot be predicted solely based on chromosomal findings, evidence suggests that early detection is beneficial. Prospective studies of infants with 47, XXY diagnosed by newborn screening have identified speech-language delays in 75% and motor skill delays in 50%; early identification and intervention for these infants result in improved neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is currently recommended that children with a diagnosis of 47, XXY undergo comprehensive developmental assessments at 9–15 months, 18–24 months, and 30–36 months, which can only be facilitated by antenatal or perinatal diagnosis. Antenatal detection also provides the opportunity to actively screen for and address somatic outcomes such as the evolution of hypogonadism (pre- and post-puberty) and osteoporosis.

### Mere coincidence or an association? Case of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome [^112hwewY]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Our case raises several questions regarding JIA in patients with KS. Our knowledge is largely based on studies on autoimmune disorders in adults with KS. While RA is known to be associated with KS, there is limited literature on the concurrence of JIA and KS to reliably infer any association or causal relationship. We have yet to decipher how the biological environment of KS might contribute to the pathogenesis and prognosis of JIA. Testosterone treatment for KS has demonstrated improved outcome in acute RA flares. The effect of hormone replacement therapy remains to be explored in our patient. Given the rarity of its concurrence, additional studies are required to understand any association between KS and JIA.

### Klinefelter syndrome presenting as behavioral problems in a young adult [^111vdbCE]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old Somali man presented to a primary care clinic to investigate a potential pathophysiological reason for behavioral problems at school that had arisen in the past 1–2 years. A previous physical examination at school revealed the patient to have small, firm testicles, which prompted further testing.

- **Investigation**: Thyroid function and levels of prolactin, total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone were determined. Testes were measured. Chromosome analysis testing was performed to determine the patient's karyotype.

- **Diagnosis**: Klinefelter syndrome with a 47, XXY karyotype.

- **Management**: Testosterone replacement therapy was recommended, but the patient declined treatment.

### Klinefelter syndrome: A review [^111frEJ6]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is an uncommonly recognized condition typified by gynecomastia, small testes, and aspermatogenesis. It is caused by a supernumerary X chromosome, resulting in a 47 XXY karyotype. Since its first description, the phenotype of KS has evolved and there is a much greater appreciation of the subtle features of the condition.

- **Method**: In this review, we explore the phenotype of KS with particular consideration of patients with prenatal and early infancy diagnosis, given that this is becoming increasingly common. The understanding of the genetic mechanisms of KS, caused by the supernumerary X chromosome, is explored, and the genotype-phenotype correlation is discussed.

- **Results**: The implications of the condition in both childhood and later development are explored in detail, with particular focus on social and educational implications. Potential treatments, with emphasis on the preservation of fertility, are discussed. We highlight the optimal therapeutic conditions in which fertility preservation is most likely to be achieved compared to those which can be more challenging. Finally, we discuss the other health challenges which can be associated with KS, including poor bone health, diabetes, cardiovascular complications, and malignancy. The challenges in managing these comorbid conditions and the most up-to-date management recommendations are also explored.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^111N9DA3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

This scoping review aims to provide a concise, up-to-date synthesis of the approach to managing Klinefelter syndrome (KS). The review was conducted through an extensive literature search followed by a thematic synthesis, combining management guidelines, recommendations, and recent research across the subdomains of physical health, mental well-being, and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). The literature search was completed using an a priori thematic framework to ensure critical areas of health affected in KS were included. Health domains were chosen from key literature on KS.

The research objectives are as follows:

- **Highlight management and treatment guidelines**: Focus on key health domains described for individuals with KS.

- **Address HR-QoL deficits**: Discover how management guidelines tackle these deficits.

- **Identify future areas for investigation**: Highlight potential areas that could reduce health inequalities and improve HR-QoL outcomes in individuals with KS.

To identify relevant studies, the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, Psychinfo, and EMBASE were searched. A gray literature search followed, which included key paper references and online searches of medical guideline organizations. When available, their publications and proposed guidelines were assessed, including those from the European Society of Endocrinology, the National Institutes of Health (USA), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, UK), and the National Health Service (UK). All databases were searched from their inception until December 2024.

Eligibility criteria included all empirical studies, emerging research, and relevant literature.

### New concepts in Klinefelter syndrome [^117SB7ey]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome, 47, XXY and its variants, represents the most common chromosomal aberration among men, with an estimated frequency of 1 in 500 among newborns. Men with Klinefelter syndrome often present with sequelae of hormonal and spermatogenic testicular failure, such as infertility, low testosterone, erectile dysfunction, and low bone mineral density. This review is intended to provide practicing urologists with a valuable source of clinically relevant information about Klinefelter syndrome.

Recent findings indicate that sperm can be found in over 50% of men with Klinefelter syndrome, challenging the notion that these individuals are sterile. Evidence also suggests that children with Klinefelter syndrome are born with spermatogonia and experience significant loss of germ cells during puberty. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for enhancing the quality of life and overall health of affected men.

Growing interest in Klinefelter syndrome among translational scientists and clinicians is expected to enhance understanding of the pathophysiology of testicular failure. In some states, screening programs for Klinefelter syndrome are already in place, which is likely to increase the number of patients seen by practicing urologists in the near future. The diagnosis and management of these patients fall within the scope and training of urologists. The development of randomized clinical trials comparing various interventions for men and children with Klinefelter syndrome will facilitate the standardization of their care.

### A qualitative exploration of experiences of gender identity and gender questioning among adults with Klinefelter syndrome/XXY [^112gAB78]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS/XXY) affects approximately one in 660 births assigned as male; prevalence estimates range from 0.02% to 0.22%. However, up to 75% of cases remain undetected because the visible characteristics often associated with XXY, including gynecomastia, tall stature, and sparse body and facial hair, are highly variable and many people with KS/XXY are asymptomatic. The term "Klinefelter syndrome" usually refers to people with an XXY "karyotype" (set of chromosomes) who develop characteristics typical of Klinefelter syndrome and identify as male, whereas the term "XXY" usually refers to individuals with that same karyotype who either do not have those characteristics or do not identify as male. Some people view the term Klinefelter syndrome as pathologizing and some do not. In this paper, we use the term "people with KS/XXY" to refer to all those groups of people.

The XXY karyotype is detected most frequently between 30 and 40 years of age, often during investigations for infertility. The advent of cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) testing for sex chromosome aneuploidies has made prenatal detection possible, although cfDNA testing is presently available only among the relatively privileged in certain countries and is not yet common practice in the United Kingdom. However, early diagnosis could become more common as access to cfDNA testing increases and if routine post‐natal screening for KS/XXY is introduced.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^1152eFq1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) most commonly arises from a 47, XXY karyotype. While KS affects approximately 1 in 450 to 600 male births, an estimated 50% to 75% of cases go undiagnosed. Individuals with KS are at increased risk of metabolic, cardiovascular, and reproductive comorbidities. This increases mortality risk, psychological burden, and significantly diminishes health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) compared to healthy controls. This paper provides an updated review of the recent literature on the clinical management for people with KS, associated comorbidities, and the implications on HR-QoL.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using key databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, Psychinfo, and EMBASE. This was followed by a gray search of relevant key papers in KS, with medical guideline organizations being searched online. Where available, their publications and proposed guidelines were assessed. All databases were searched from their inception until December 2024, with English-language restrictions applied.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Evidence highlights the need for early detection, the importance of appropriate medication management, and multidisciplinary care to address infertility, cancer risks, neurocognitive deficits, and adverse mental health. Lifespan-specific interventions remain underexplored, necessitating further research to optimize outcomes and refine clinical guidelines.

- **Conclusion**: KS management is guided by only one endorsed guideline. International and interprofessional collaboration is needed to develop consensus documents.

### Psychiatric characteristics in a self-selected sample of boys with Klinefelter syndrome [^1129QmRY]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome is the most frequent chromosomal aneuploidy, with a prevalence of 1 in 700. It has been widely associated with cognitive impairment and language problems. No previous studies have systematically investigated the association of Klinefelter syndrome with psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents; the only data available are from psychiatric inventories of adults with the syndrome.

- **Objective**: To explore the extent of psychiatric morbidity in children with Klinefelter syndrome.

- **Method**: Fifty-one subjects with Klinefelter syndrome, aged 6 to 19 years, were included through the Dutch Klinefelter association and two university medical centers. The sample was screened using structured and standardized assessment procedures covering the full range of psychiatric problems and disorders. In addition, all boys were formally evaluated for the presence of a language disorder.

- **Results**: A wide range of classifications could be applied, with language disorder (65% [33 of 51]) as the most prevalent disorder, followed by attention-deficit disorders (63% [32 of 51]) and autism spectrum disorder (27% [14 of 51]). Behavioral impairment was most evident among cases classified as autism spectrum disorder and psychotic disorder (12% [6 of 51]).

- **Conclusions**: Children with Klinefelter syndrome seem to be at risk for problems in social and language development, as well as for problems in regulation of emotion and behavior. This is reflected in the broad spectrum of psychiatric classifications applicable in the present study.

### Prevalence and psychosocial correlates of depressive symptoms among adolescents and adults with Klinefelter syndrome [^116uTBQm]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of depressive symptoms among adolescents and adults with Klinefelter syndrome, a study was conducted.

Methods involved recruiting individuals (n = 310), aged 14–75 years, with self-reported Klinefelter syndrome from regional and national support networks to complete a web-based survey. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Other measures included perceived consequences (Illness Perceptions Questionnaire), perceived stigma (Perceived Social Stigmatization Scale), and coping strategies (Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised), all evaluated as correlates of depressive symptoms.

Overall, 68.8% of study participants reported clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms, as indicated by a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score ≥ 16. The use of emotion-focused coping strategies (P < 0.01), perceptions of stigmatization (P < 0.01), perceived negative consequences of Klinefelter syndrome (P < 0.01), and the importance of having children in the future (P < 0.05) were all significantly associated with depressive symptoms.

Individuals with Klinefelter syndrome may be at increased risk for depression. Routine screening for depressive symptoms, along with appropriate referral and evaluation, may be warranted.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^117DamJp]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review to determine the prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in trans and gender-diverse individuals presumed male at birth and to identify the clinical features of Klinefelter syndrome that may result in treatment considerations in trans people undergoing feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy. We found a 0.88% prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome, which is higher than previous analyses in the general population. Expected clinical and biochemical features of Klinefelter syndrome were reported, such as azoospermia and venous thromboembolism, even before the commencement of feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy. These findings represent unique considerations for trans individuals with Klinefelter syndrome.

### Are adolescent boys with Klinefelter syndrome androgen deficient? A longitudinal study of Finnish 47, XXY boys [^1147PJWg]. Pediatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Testosterone (T)-substitution therapy is widely used in adult patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) to prevent symptoms and sequelae of androgen deficiency. However, it is currently unknown if adolescent boys with KS benefit from early T therapy. To evaluate the optimal age to start T substitution, we searched for signs of androgen deficiency in pubertal boys with KS.

The study followed 14 nonmosaic 47, XXY boys, aged 10–13.9 years, for 4–37 months, with staging of puberty and frequent reproductive hormone measurements. Furthermore, indices reflecting androgen action — such as serum SHBG, leptin, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels — were examined. Both the onset and progression of puberty according to Tanner stages were normal in boys with KS. Consistently, serum T concentrations increased as expected and remained normal throughout follow-up.

- **Observed changes**: Changes in the indices of androgen action (i.e. decreases in serum SHBG and leptin, and an increase in serum PSA concentrations) occurred normally. However, average leptin levels were higher in boys with KS compared to controls (KS boys: 11.8 ± 7.0 microg/L; controls: 7.6 ± 4.7 microg/L; p = 0.033). Despite normal T concentrations, the KS boys displayed elevated serum FSH and LH levels from the age of 13 years, along with exaggerated gonadotropin responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

These data do not demonstrate an unequivocal androgen deficiency in adolescent boys with KS that would necessitate androgen supplementation therapy during early puberty.

### Klinefelter's syndrome [^115hPxgz]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Klinefelter's syndrome is the most common genetic cause of human male infertility, but many cases remain undiagnosed due to substantial variation in clinical presentation and insufficient professional awareness of the syndrome itself. Early recognition and hormonal treatment of the disorder can substantially improve quality of life and prevent serious consequences. Testosterone replacement corrects symptoms of androgen deficiency but does not positively affect infertility. However, nowadays patients with Klinefelter's syndrome, including the non-mosaic type, need not be considered irrevocably infertile, as intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers an opportunity for procreation even when there are no spermatozoa in the ejaculate. In a substantial number of azoospermic patients, spermatozoa can be extracted from testicular biopsy samples, leading to successful pregnancies and live births.

The frequency of sex chromosomal hyperploidy and autosomal aneuploidies is higher in spermatozoa from patients with Klinefelter's syndrome than in those from normal men. Thus, chromosomal errors might, in some cases, be transmitted to the offspring of men with this syndrome. The genetic implications of the fertilization procedures, including pre-transfer or prenatal genetic assessment, must be explained to patients and their partners.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^117Hkody]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Our review identifies considerable gaps in managing KS, particularly regarding HR-QoL. Research and clinical guidelines must both evolve to better address the multifaceted needs of individuals with KS, especially concerning early diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, the risk profiles of various cancers, and comprehensive physical and psychological support.

Early diagnosis of KS could benefit from a collaborative approach; the inclusion of noninvasive prenatal screening can detect KS early, followed by confirmatory testing. Pediatricians should monitor developmental progress, especially on the brink of puberty, while further information from educators can provide valuable insights into speech, motor, and social challenges. Combining medical and educational assessments could lead to earlier identification and referrals to genetic testing.

Research in related conditions, such as autism, suggests early detection can significantly enhance long-term HR-QoL. While specific studies in KS are lacking, the potential benefits of early diagnosis and intervention remain largely unexplored. Future investigations should focus on whether early intervention of physiological comorbidities, TRT, and psychological support can bring about improvements across the lifespan.

A considerable gap exists in understanding the psychological phenotype of KS and its resulting effect on HR-QoL. Further questions arise about management strategies, diagnosis, and clinical knowledge of the psychological profile within KS. Clinicians need integrated approaches to effectively address these challenges.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^113UPooE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Thematic synthesis

- **Diagnosis**: The consensus for diagnosing Klinefelter syndrome (KS) in suspected patients is to use microarray or karyotyping analysis. These methods are the gold standard for confirming KS, as they directly detect chromosomal anomalies. More severe chromosomal aneuploidies (XXXY or greater) are typically linked to worse phenotypic outcomes. However, despite the availability of these diagnostic tools, the average age of diagnosis remains notably late, around 25 years. This delay is partly due to the lack of widespread implementation of newborn screening or noninvasive prenatal screening, which could potentially improve early detection rates. The limited early screening methods likely contribute to the lack of timely diagnosis. It is plausible that only the most severely affected boys are diagnosed early, when symptoms related to speech, language, and associated psychosocial challenges prompt further investigation. In approximately 75% of cases, diagnosis does not become evident until later in life, typically due to infertility. Empirical studies have shown adult patients with KS to exhibit significantly greater autism spectrum disease symptoms and various adverse behavioral traits (such as depression, anxiety, social exclusion, communication skills issues, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) when compared to healthy controls. Research completed on a US military veteran population found that clinical diagnosis of KS, even if delayed, was associated with reduced medical morbidity, speculated to be due to increased hospital appointments for managing various comorbidities.

### Birth of a healthy boy using fresh testicular sperm in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener syndrome [^114dK2Dv]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

To report a case of Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener syndrome, a case study was conducted at a private IVF center involving a 35-year-old man suffering from primary infertility due to these syndromes. The intervention included testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

- **Main outcome measures**: Sperm recovery, fertilization, and live birth.

The procedure involved ovulation induction in the female partner and the recovery of spermatozoa from the male partner via TESE. ICSI was performed on nine metaphase II oocytes, resulting in two fertilized oocytes. The successful delivery of a healthy boy with normal anatomy and a 46, XY karyotype was recorded after transferring only one 4-cell grade 1 embryo.

To our knowledge, this case of nonmosaic Klinefelter syndrome combined with Kartagener's syndrome is unique and exemplifies the innovative aspects of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in addressing male infertility.

### Fertility considerations in adolescent Klinefelter syndrome: Current practice patterns [^112pNFQF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) is not without some downsides; it is a surgical procedure that requires anesthesia, imposes financial and emotional burdens, and may be associated with a decrease in circulating testosterone levels that can persist for 12 or more months after the procedure. Furthermore, it is often difficult for an adolescent boy to make an informed decision about future fertility, which may appear abstract at that age. Adults with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) and their partners may be in a substantially better position to take into account the intensity of their desire to have a child, the success rates of TESE and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and the financial and emotional burdens of a surgical procedure on the patient and the treatment cycle to harvest oocytes from his partner.

Thus, there is no compelling reason that TESE has to be performed during adolescence, and no definitive evidence suggests that postponing the procedure to early adulthood worsens outcomes. However, it should be recognized that the choices made by men with KS and their partners and families are influenced by many factors, including important nonmedical considerations, such as the natural longing of men and women to have children, complex social and cultural pressures, and the financial and emotional burdens associated with these procedures. Furthermore, individual patients with KS and their partners may weigh the trade-offs between the probability of a successful treatment outcome (approximately 16%) and the risks and costs associated with TESE and ICSI differently, depending upon their unique life situations. Ultimately, such complex life decisions require careful consideration of these factors.

### Epigenetics in Turner syndrome [^11414QoL]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Both Turner syndrome (TS) and Klinefelter syndrome (KS) are associated with several clinical features that exhibit a broad range of inter-individual expressivity, with poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Understanding the effect of both the loss (45, X) and the gain (47, XXY) of the X chromosome on gene transcription, and their correlation to variable clinical phenotypes, would be beneficial. Systematic studies comparing genome-wide expression and epigenetic modifications of sex chromosome aneuploidies, such as 45, X versus 47, XXY, could provide insight into the pathophysiology mechanisms involved.

Several studies have focused on one or the other condition, but they often analyze a limited number of samples from a single tissue type (e.g. schizophrenic brain, testis, whole blood, fibroblast, or amniotic fluid). At the time of writing, only Sharma et al. addressed this issue in both populations. Their study demonstrated that the loss of an X chromosome has more profound consequences than the gain of an additional X chromosome, with about five times more loci affected in TS than in KS subjects. Additionally, when only autosomal CpG sites were analyzed, approximately 80% of the modifications in TS individuals represented hypomethylation, whereas KS individuals displayed nearly equal numbers of hypo- and hypermethylated CpG sites. Therefore, gene ontology analysis suggests that the etiopathogenesis in both conditions may be completely different.

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^1144yN48]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

The act of disclosing one's diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome (KS) to others in their trusted support system generally provided relief. This finding is consistent with earlier research, which has shown that the versions of disclosure, specifically the amount of details shared, can vary depending on the closeness of the person being disclosed to. The present study found that one factor influencing what information is shared with an individual is the role that individual plays in the participant's support system.

Specifically, participants identified romantic partners as being the most likely to be affected by KS due to the associated infertility and consequently disclosed their diagnosis to romantic partners, thereby integrating them into their support systems for coping with challenges related to KS. While prior research has shown that adolescents and young adults (AYA) with disorders of sex development (DSDs) felt their infertility had a significant impact on their relationships, with some even feeling as though they had already disappointed their future partners, those feelings were not shared by AYA with KS in the present study.

Rather, participants largely did not feel it had a significant impact on their romantic partners, viewing it instead as a potential future scenario, perhaps due to their younger ages. In addition to romantic partners, many participants indicated that their parents play an important role in their support systems, with their main role being assisting with medical aspects.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^117GVK44]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome is one of the most common genetic causes of infertility in azoospermic males. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of testicular architecture into hyalinized tissue and fibrosis, and disruption of spermatogenesis. Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection have been performed in people with Klinefelter syndrome. There are currently no established guidelines regarding the timing of TESE and choice of harvesting technique. It is recommended that sperm harvest should be completed before the initiation of testosterone therapy, or testosterone should be withheld if previously commenced. A similar principle should apply to hormonal treatment for trans individuals, where discussions regarding fertility should be undertaken before the commencement of feminizing gender-affirming hormone therapy.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^111jTgM7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Identifying and effectively using care pathways for psychiatric comorbidities may improve patient outcomes. Martin et al. explored an innovative neurocognitive-behavioral treatment program designed to address specific vulnerabilities associated with KS. The new social management guideline focused on addressing executive dysfunction and tailoring interventions to behavioral and cognitive characteristics specific to KS. When used, this was shown to be a promising and effective approach for enhancing self-control and social adaptation.

The identified guidelines emphasize the importance of psychological intervention when there are clinical concerns, but there is limited guidance on assessing the psychiatric profile of patients with KS. As a result, psychiatric and HR-QoL issues for patients with KS may not be adequately addressed. This could be attributed to a multitude of factors, such as "limited clinical consultation time, lack of awareness about the condition, and a shortage of psychiatric guidelines for treating mental health in KS".

- **Klinefelter syndrome through the lifespan**: KS can negatively affect HR-QoL at all stages of life. Clinicians and guidelines should focus on interventions to minimize impairments. Although there is no apparent phenotype or distinct developmental profile for children with KS, research shows several areas that experience developmental delays, such as "speech, motor skills, language, cognitive function, behaviors (including social behaviors), testicular development/function, and growth".

### Leydig cell tumor found incidentally during microscopic testicular sperm extraction in patient with mosaic Klinefelter syndrome: Case report [^112565XV]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

To report the finding and management of a case of a Leydig cell tumor discovered during the infertility evaluation of a patient with mosaic Klinefelter syndrome, a single case report was conducted in an academic hospital. The patient, seeking assistance with fertility following a diagnosis of mosaic Klinefelter syndrome, underwent microscopic testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) for sperm identification. During mTESE, abnormal testicular tissue was identified and histologically confirmed to be a Leydig cell tumor. The patient was informed of this incidental discovery and later underwent orchiectomy for conservative oncologic control.

Histologic testicular assessment showed that the patient had no viable sperm on mTESE, but achieved oncologic control with bilateral orchiectomy.

This case emphasizes the importance of awareness and expedient appropriate management to achieve oncologic control of a rare tumor with low malignant potential discovered during otherwise routine mTESE. In particular, it highlights the role of the infertility specialist in aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of incidental and rare findings.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^116F85GS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Previous studies have suggested a higher prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome amongst transgender individuals. We undertook a systematic review to determine the prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome amongst transgender individuals presumed male at birth and summarize the clinical features and potential treatment implications for individuals with Klinefelter syndrome commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy.

- **Design**: Using preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines, we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to 31 December 2021. All studies reporting on the prevalence or clinical features of transgender individuals with Klinefelter syndrome were included.

- **Results**: Our search strategy retrieved 11 cohort studies comprising 1,376 transgender individuals. In all, 14 of 1,376 (1.02%) individuals were diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome. Based on the seven studies in which karyotype was undertaken in all individuals, the prevalence is 9/1,013 (0.88%; 95% CI, 0.41%-1.68%). Case reports highlight unique treatment considerations in this population, including azoospermia, venous thromboembolism, and monitoring of breast cancer and bone health.

- **Conclusions**: Compared to the general population, observational studies document a higher prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome amongst transgender individuals, though underdiagnosis in the general population limits conclusions. Routine karyo…

### Evaluation and management of genital anomalies in two patients with Klinefelter syndrome and review of literature [^116HASdx]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

To present the evaluation and management of cryptorchidism and varicocele in patients with Klinefelter syndrome, recent advances in reproductive medicine have resulted in fertility in patients with Klinefelter syndrome. However, cryptorchidism and varicocele can affect the fertility potential on their own.

- **Methods**: We present two cases and review the literature with an emphasis on the fertility potential.

- **Results**: Germ cells were present in the testicular biopsy of an infant with cryptorchidism, but not in the adolescent with a varicocele; the latter biopsy showed tubular sclerosis.

- **Conclusions**: The fertility potential of patients with Klinefelter syndrome and cryptorchidism may be preserved or enhanced by an early orchiopexy. However, the potential benefit of ligation of internal spermatic veins in patients with Klinefelter syndrome and a varicocele warrants further study. Cryopreservation should be considered early in adolescence or adulthood as germ cells become depleted at an accelerated rate after puberty.

### Klinefelter's syndrome and precocious puberty: A harbinger for tumor [^114jj8bM]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Boys with Klinefelter's syndrome are at an increased risk of precocious puberty. Most cases are either idiopathic or due to a mediastinal tumor. Patients with Klinefelter's syndrome are at a high risk of primary, extragonadal germ cell tumors, which are usually nonseminomatous but can be a mixed type with seminomatous elements. The differential diagnosis of precocious puberty includes mediastinal tumors, especially in boys with Klinefelter's syndrome.

### State-wide increase in prenatal diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome on amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling: Impact of non-invasive prenatal testing for sex chromosome conditions [^111PUMhC]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). High credibility.

Until recently, the prenatal diagnosis of a sex chromosome condition was most commonly an incidental finding following a diagnostic procedure performed for another indication. The introduction of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) over the past decade has not only reduced the total number of invasive procedures performed, but also created new opportunities for women to obtain specific prenatal screening information on sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs). NIPT became clinically available in Australia on a self-funded basis in late 2012 and is now utilized by at least 20% of women electing to have screening in Victoria.

The most common SCA, 45, X (Turner syndrome), is the only sex chromosome aneuploidy with the potential for detection via specific fetal ultrasound findings, such as cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, increased nuchal translucency, or cardiac and renal anomalies. The other SCAs include 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), 47, XYY (Jacob syndrome), and 47, XXX (Triple X). Children with these conditions often have a normal phenotype at birth, typically presenting across the life course with issues including developmental delay, reproductive abnormalities, and reduced fertility. Their highly variable presentation and the less accurate performance of NIPT for these conditions have created debate over whether sex chromosomes should be analyzed in NIPT. A joint statement by The Royal Australian and New Zealand College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Human Genetics Society of Australasia recommended that while there is no precedent for screening for SCA at the population level, if it is to be undertaken, it should be guided by appropriate ethical and clinical frameworks.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^114cdezf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Future research using genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data could clarify the molecular basis of this heterogeneity. Polygenic risk scores may also aid in assessing individual risks for KS-related conditions, supporting personalized clinical management.

Strategies to improve clinical decision-making, evaluate intervention effectiveness, and support further research are vital for optimizing patient care. There is a clear need for condition-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), as existing PROMs do not fully address the unique challenges faced by people with KS. Developing PROMs that capture the lived experience of people with KS would advance clinical practice and research.

### Successful thrombolysis of normotensive pulmonary embolism with life-threatening hypoxia in a young man with Klinefelter syndrome [^111eTvWb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Our patient had multiple risk factors for VTE. KS is known to increase the risk of VTE. He had a family history of unprovoked DVT, although the thrombophilia screening for both him and his father could not identify a hereditary cause. His polycythaemia could have predisposed him to VTE and was likely multifactorial from hypoxia, dehydration, and testosterone therapy. The fact that he tolerated an SPO2 down to 74% in the community was remarkable, and we postulate that the secondary polycythaemic response may have allowed him to tolerate such severe hypoxia. Although he was not hypotensive, severe hypoxic respiratory failure with signs of right ventricular strain prompted the decision for thrombolysis.

- **Guidance for PE thrombolysis**: Mostly depends on failed haemodynamics and suggests close monitoring and consideration of rescue thrombolysis for cases like our patient. Several researchers have highlighted the need for thrombolysis in severe hypoxic respiratory failure with preserved haemodynamics. Percutaneous catheter-directed therapy is currently recommended for haemodynamically unstable PE with contraindications for thrombolysis. As our patient did not have any contraindications for thrombolysis, this was not considered.

- **Patient's improvement**: Our patient clearly improved with thrombolysis, with normalization of his oxygenation from SPO2 of 74% to 100% within hours, and his full recovery without any evidence of pulmonary hypertension speaks to the dramatic improvement achieved with this therapy. Polycythaemia is one of the most common side effects of testosterone therapy.

### Clinical features and prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome in transgender individuals: A systematic review [^111yBfLy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

The relationship between Klinefelter syndrome and gender incongruence has been explored in various studies. Some observational studies suggest a potentially higher prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome among transgender individuals presumed male at birth compared to the general population's rates. The connection between these conditions remains ambiguous. Existing literature proposes a twofold explanation behind the predisposition to gender incongruence. Firstly, a fetus with Klinefelter syndrome is exposed to reduced levels of androgens, possibly influencing gender identity development. Secondly, typical features of Klinefelter syndrome, such as gynecomastia and sparse body hair, may be perceived as feminine, leading individuals to question their masculine identity. This aligns with findings from two case reports where gender incongruence improved following testosterone treatment; however, this finding varies by individual and remains speculative.

Another consideration is the prevalence of gender incongruence among individuals with Klinefelter syndrome. A previous analysis examined the Gender Identity/Gender Dysphoria Questionnaire for Adults and Adolescents (GIDYQ-AA) involving 46 individuals with Klinefelter syndrome and 43 eugonadal cisgender male controls. Although individuals with Klinefelter syndrome had lower GIDYQ-AA scores, indicating higher gender dysphoria than the control group, no individual met the GIDYQ-AA cut-off of < 3 for gender dysphoria. Additionally, no participant met the DSM-V criteria for gender dysphoria, indicating a significant distinction between perceived gender dysphoria and clinical diagnosis.

### Klinefelter syndrome: An argument for early aggressive hormonal and fertility management [^112vF4g9]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

To investigate the impact of early hormone replacement therapy (HT) on sperm retrieval rates in patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS), a systematic review of the relevant literature was conducted using the PubMed NLM database.

There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of HT on sperm retrieval or reproductive outcomes in men with KS. On average, surgical sperm retrieval rates in men with KS are around 51%, with a range of 28% to 69%. Young patient age is the most consistent positive predictor of sperm retrieval. Lower retrieval rates have been reported in a small subset of KS adults who previously received exogenous testosterone therapy, although the nature, duration, and reason for such therapy in these patient subsets are unknown.

Early HT is recommended in patients with KS, but its effect on fertility potential has not been definitively studied. Larger studies are needed to better answer this question. Cryopreservation of sperm-containing semen or testicular tissue from a significant proportion of affected adolescents is possible, even when containing very low numbers of spermatozoa, and should be considered to maximize future fertility potential.

### Finding acceptance: How adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome navigate identity, disclosure, and support [^1152s38L]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

- **Procedures and instrumentation**: Data from this study were collected via semi‐structured interviews assessing the following three areas: (1) resources and support systems adolescents and young adults (AYA) with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) utilize to cope with challenges related to their condition, (2) psychosocial well‐being of AYA with KS and how KS is perceived to impact it, and (3) attitudes of AYA with KS about testicular dysfunction, specifically the likely need for testosterone replacement and fertility‐related interventions. The study reports data on the first and second areas.

The authors collaboratively developed an interview guide (Data S1) to assess these content areas based on three primary factors: (1) an interview guide developed by Papadakis et al. exploring fertility‐related healthcare and decision-making needs for AYA with disorders of sex development (DSDs), (2) literature review (Dennis et al; Richardson et al; Turriff et al.), and (3) the authors' expertise caring for children and AYA with KS in a multidisciplinary clinic at a single pediatric institution (AW — genetic counselor, CF — endocrinologist, and JP — pediatric psychologist). Individuals with KS make up a significant portion of the patient population that authors AW, CF, and JP care for, which contributed to their motivation to explore the topics in this study to contribute to the development of comprehensive care for this patient population. Additionally, the research team included individuals with qualitative research expertise along with experience in genetic counseling.

Semi‐structured interviews were completed by one author (AT) with each consented participant.

### The genetic origin of Klinefelter syndrome and its effect on spermatogenesis [^116eguqf]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome is the most prevalent chromosome abnormality and genetic cause of azoospermia in males. The availability of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has allowed men with Klinefelter syndrome to father their own genetic offspring. When providing ART to men with Klinefelter syndrome, it is important to counsel them properly on both the chance of finding sperm and the potential effects on their offspring. The aim of this review is twofold: (1) to describe the genetic etiology of Klinefelter syndrome, and (2) to describe how spermatogenesis occurs in men with Klinefelter syndrome and the consequences this has for children born from men with Klinefelter syndrome.

### Klinefelter syndrome and its variants: An update and review for the primary pediatrician [^113ZZ1uA]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality in humans. Recent prospective, unbiased studies have clarified many of the previous misconceptions associated with Klinefelter syndrome, thereby improving our recognition and management of this condition for affected individuals. The primary-care physician has an important role in caring for these individuals and their families by providing anticipatory guidance regarding issues relating to endocrinology, behavior, development, and preventive medical care. Furthermore, the primary caregiver can serve as a valuable source of support and advocacy for the family of a boy with Klinefelter syndrome. We review the state of knowledge regarding Klinefelter syndrome and its variants, with an emphasis on medical and early developmental interventions.

### A qualitative exploration of experiences of gender identity and gender questioning among adults with Klinefelter syndrome/XXY [^11282qrB]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The study was conducted from a phenomenological perspective, using individual semi‐structured interviews. The data was analyzed through experiential reflexive thematic analysis, focusing on exploring the truth or truths of participants' contextually situated experiences, perspectives, and behaviors [Braun & Clarke]. The Singular Framework for Methodological Integrity [Levitt et al.] and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research [Tong et al.] were adhered to, ensuring the study's fidelity and utility. The University of Derby Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (Reference ETH2122‐1547).

- **Participants**: The study involved adults with Klinefelter syndrome (KS)/XXY. Inclusion criteria consisted of having a confirmed diagnosis of KS/XXY, being 18 years or older, and the ability to provide informed consent. Exclusion was based on any known psychological condition that could lead to psychological distress. Participants were recruited through the Klinefelter's Syndrome Association, the XXY Project, and various KS/XXY Facebook support groups.

### Update on physical, psychological, and quality of life management in Klinefelter syndrome [^115dR2qn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) most commonly arises from a 47, XXY karyotype. While KS affects approximately 1 in 450–600 male births, an estimated 50–75% of cases go undiagnosed. Individuals with KS have an increased risk of metabolic, cardiovascular, and reproductive comorbidities, which elevate mortality risk, psychological burden, and significantly diminish health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) compared to healthy controls. This paper provides an updated review of recent literature on the clinical management of people with KS, associated comorbidities, and the implications for HR-QoL.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in key databases — MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, Psychinfo, and EMBASE — followed by a grey literature search of relevant key papers in KS. Medical guideline organizations were searched online, and their publications and proposed guidelines were assessed where available. All databases were searched from their inception until December 2024, with English language restrictions applied.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Evidence highlights the need for early detection and the importance of appropriate medication management and multidisciplinary care to address infertility, cancer risks, neurocognitive deficits, and adverse mental health. Lifespan-specific interventions remain underexplored, necessitating further research to optimize outcomes and refine clinical guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: KS management is guided by only one endorsed guideline. International and interprofessional collaboration is needed to develop consensus documents.

### From Klinefelter syndrome to high grade aneuploidies: Expanding the gene-dosage effect of supernumerary X chromosomes [^117KJvos]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: We enrolled 23 patients with high-grade aneuploidies (HGAs) followed at the Endo-ERN and Regional Rare Endocrine and Andrological Disease Centre at the Department of Experimental Medicine of Sapienza University of Rome, Italy ("Policlinico Umberto I" Hospital). All HGA patients with available data were included and randomly matched by age (± 1 year), at a 1:2 ratio, with 46 patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) followed in our center. An additional cohort of 46 subjects with KS, matched by pubertal status at a 1:2 ratio, was included for validation of significant findings, as well as gonadal development and function parameters.

- **Diagnosis and examination**: In all patients, the diagnosis was established by postnatal peripheral blood karyotype analysis, conducted on at least 40 metaphases, thus excluding mosaicism. All patients underwent a thorough clinical examination, a hormonal and metabolic evaluation, and a detailed ultrasonographic study of the testes, according to the European Academy of Andrology ultrasound Standard Operating Procedures, and of the heart. Pubertal stage was evaluated according to Tanner's original description for external genitalia appearance (i.e. scrotum, penis, pubic hair). At the time of the evaluation, none of the patients was taking testosterone replacement therapy or any other hormonally or metabolically active drugs.

- **Consent**: Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants of legal age able to do so, whereas in minors it was obtained from the participant's parents [Local Ethics Committee Approval Ref. CE 7155, Protocol no. 0414/23 of March 5, 2023].

### New horizons in Klinefelter syndrome: Current evidence, gaps, and research priorities [^1157yU5i]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) is caused by the presence of a supernumerary X-chromosome, conferring the classical 47, XXY karyotype, and is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in men. The clinical features described in the early characterization of the syndrome include tall stature, small testes, hypogonadism, gynecomastia, and neurodevelopmental deficits. However, the syndrome presents a broad phenotypic spectrum that seems to be evolving, along with environmental and general health changes.

Although a proportion of men with KS are asymptomatic, others experience numerous severe comorbidities, ranging from cardiovascular to autoimmune disorders. Once considered a hallmark of the syndrome, the inability to conceive can now be overcome with assisted reproductive technology. The neuropsychological stigmata, once overstated and thereafter inadvertently dismissed, now demand a more balanced and objective approach.

Significant advances have been made in our understanding of KS over recent years, including the molecular machinery involved in the chromosomal disjunction that gives rise to the syndrome. Our understanding of the risk-benefit of testosterone replacement therapy has greatly improved; however, many gaps persist. Future work should be prioritized according to the needs of people with KS. There are opportunities for new research addressing the fields of fertility, cardiovascular prevention, neurodevelopment, quality of life, and bone health. Above all, solid registries and extensive prospective longitudinal studies are needed to enroll people with KS to determine their evolving health trajectories.

### Klinefelter syndrome comorbidities linked to increased X chromosome gene dosage and altered protein interactome activity [^116b1cvd]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

A potential weakness of this study is the reliance solely on hospital diagnosis data obtained from registry data for each patient. Several factors, such as socio-economic status, lifestyle, and other drug prescriptions, affect the risk of diseases, but it is challenging to obtain such data for an entire country's population. Thorough follow-up studies should include as many of these factors as possible.

As mentioned earlier, a significant fraction of Klinefelter syndrome (KS) patients are never diagnosed. The comorbidity profile of KS described in this study could potentially be used to identify undiagnosed patients. However, employing a disease trajectory approach, similar to the one published earlier where the temporal order of diseases is incorporated, would presumably be more powerful than the comorbidity profile described here. This will be the target of further work.

Although the expression data from different individuals generally showed good agreement, the cohort is admittedly small. Nevertheless, we highlighted the importance and power of data integration approaches, particularly the integration of comorbidities with other biological data types. In future studies, we will increase the number of samples to further confirm the results. This work represents a first attempt at providing relevant results consistent with previous studies while adding novel biological aspects of KS.
