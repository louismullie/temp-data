## Question

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining IIH and its diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will examine pathophysiology. After that, I need to review clinical presentation and diagnostic workup. Then, I should appraise management principles and the strength of evidence, including medical, surgical, and weight-loss strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations, controversies, and future directions, and close with a concise synthesis and practical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework. IIH is a syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure without an identifiable intracranial mass, hydrocephalus, or other secondary cause, typically presenting with papilledema and headache; the modified Friedman criteria require symptoms/signs of raised ICP, papilledema (or IIHWOP with elevated opening pressure), CSF opening pressure > 25 cm H₂O in adults, normal CSF composition, and normal neuroimaging excluding secondary causes, with the caveat that a grey zone of 25–30 cm H₂O warrants clinical judgment and sometimes repeat measurement or monitoring [^ee6ae130] [^04ec1822].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before I overgeneralize. Historically, incidence sat around 1–3 per 100,000 per year in the general population, but recent data show rising rates paralleling obesity, with contemporary estimates up to 2.4–28 per 100,000 per year overall and markedly higher in obese women of reproductive age; prevalence in Europe is estimated at 14 per 100,000, and pediatric incidence is lower, roughly 0.63–0.71 per 100,000 per year, with obesity still a key driver in adolescents [^ee6ae130] [^fb04ae7b] [^8864f32a] [^e16607b7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation; I need to check the pathophysiology. The dominant model links obesity and metabolic dysregulation to impaired CSF outflow and venous hypertension, with frequent transverse sinus stenosis and a pressure gradient seen in many patients; emerging data suggest IIH behaves like a systemic metabolic disease with adipose-tissue dysfunction, androgen excess, and insulin resistance, which helps explain the female predominance and the obesity association, though no single mechanism accounts for all cases [^05a2fa60] [^44c3e83b] [^0116e9d1].

> I will now examine the clinical phenotype, but I should double-check the headache characteristics. Classic teaching described a pressure headache worse in the morning with Valsalva aggravation, yet recent cohorts show most IIH headaches mimic migraine or tension-type, with daily pain in the majority; transient visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus, and horizontal diplopia from sixth nerve palsy are common, and papilledema is the hallmark but can be absent in IIHWOP, which complicates diagnosis and delays care [^5933aa29] [^6a72052c] [^ee6ae130].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup and make sure I don't miss secondary causes. Urgent brain MRI with venography is recommended to exclude mass, hydrocephalus, or venous sinus thrombosis; if MRI is unavailable within 24 hours, obtain CT and follow with MRI; lumbar puncture confirms elevated opening pressure and normal CSF composition; ancillary tests may include OCT for papilledema quantification, perimetry for field defects, and, in select cases, manometry or venography to assess a stenosis gradient; in children, ultrasound of optic nerve sheath diameter can aid screening and follow-up, though it does not replace formal imaging and LP [^7d68094f] [^08f3466e] [^2d1dd823] [^e16607b7].

> Let me think about management principles, and I should confirm the hierarchy. The three consensus pillars are: treat the underlying disease (weight loss), protect vision, and minimize headache morbidity; weight loss is the only disease-modifying therapy, with observational and interventional data suggesting that 15–24% weight loss is often required for remission, though 5–10% can still improve symptoms; bariatric surgery achieves superior and sustained weight loss and remission compared with community programs in RCTs, while lifestyle interventions alone often fail to reach remission thresholds [^0d03c50b] [^a9c32995] [^b1f90acb].

> I should confirm first-line medical therapy and its evidence base. Acetazolamide remains first-line to reduce CSF production, typically titrated from 250–500 mg twice daily; the IIHTT showed modest benefits for visual outcomes and papilledema reduction, though headache outcomes were mixed and adverse effects are common; topiramate is an alternative with weight-loss benefit but cognitive side effects and teratogenic risk require counseling, especially in women of childbearing potential [^3232aed4] [^0c1f1e9b] [^ddf2880b] [^50868945].

> But wait, what if vision is threatened or medical therapy fails? I need to check surgical options and their comparative effectiveness. CSF diversion (LP or VP shunt) and optic nerve sheath fenestration are established rescue therapies; venous sinus stenting has emerged as a promising option in patients with a demonstrable venous pressure gradient, with systematic review data suggesting high rates of papilledema and headache improvement and lower failure than shunting, though prospective randomized data are limited and patient selection is critical [^a7bb7712] [^693d9c3c].

> I should double-check headache management because it drives much of the morbidity. Headache phenotyping is essential, as migraine-like headaches are common and often coexist with medication overuse; treat the predominant phenotype with migraine strategies, avoid opioids, and address medication overuse; indomethacin may be considered short term for its potential ICP-lowering effect, and multidisciplinary headache care is recommended given the chronicity and disability burden [^99f5e3c6] [^d73a2874] [^e6541c9b] [^b26e6714].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy. Management prioritizes maternal vision protection while minimizing fetal risk; acetazolamide is generally avoided in the first trimester and used cautiously thereafter, topiramate is contraindicated, and serial visual monitoring with supportive care is standard; CSF diversion is reserved for rapid visual decline despite conservative measures, and obstetric-neurologic-ophthalmologic coordination is essential [^notfound].

> Next, I should review pediatrics, and I need to ensure I don't over-rely on adult criteria. Children can present without papilledema, and ultrasound of optic nerve sheath diameter can assist screening; weight management remains important, and acetazolamide is first-line medical therapy; surgical options follow adult principles but are individualized given developmental considerations and the lower incidence of venous sinus stenosis in prepubertal patients [^e16607b7] [^812ae7fa].

> Hold on, I should verify the controversies and uncertainties so I don't overstate certainty. Overdiagnosis in obese women with headache and underrecognition of atypical phenotypes coexist; the optimal opening pressure threshold remains debated, especially for IIHWOP; long-term durability of venous stenting and the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists are promising but require prospective trials; and the lack of high-quality RCTs outside acetazolamide and topiramate limits evidence-based pharmacotherapy choices [^ba0ce036] [^5ff44ea6] [^445561e6] [^0c1f1e9b].

> Let me reconsider the practical synthesis to ensure internal consistency. IIH is best framed as a metabolic disorder with neuro-ophthalmic manifestations; diagnosis hinges on excluding secondary causes and confirming elevated CSF pressure with normal composition; management is tiered: weight loss as disease-modifying therapy, acetazolamide or topiramate for symptom control and papilledema reduction, and escalation to surgery when vision is threatened or headaches remain refractory; multidisciplinary care with ophthalmology, neurology, and metabolic/weight specialists improves outcomes, and patient education on chronicity, medication risks, and headache hygiene is essential [^05a2fa60] [^0d03c50b] [^b26e6714].

---

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a **diagnosis of exclusion** characterized by elevated intracranial pressure with normal CSF composition and no identifiable cause, most often affecting obese women of childbearing age [^ee6ae130]. The **core management goals** are to protect vision, reduce intracranial pressure, and minimize headache morbidity, with weight loss as the only disease-modifying therapy [^0d03c50b] [^a9c32995]. Acetazolamide is first-line medical therapy [^3232aed4]; topiramate is an alternative, especially when weight loss is desired [^ddf2880b]. Surgery (CSF shunting, optic nerve sheath fenestration, or venous sinus stenting) is reserved for refractory cases with progressive visual loss or intractable headache [^a7bb7712]. Headache management should follow migraine strategies, and patients require regular ophthalmologic monitoring to detect visual decline early [^99f5e3c6] [^717de92b].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Demographics**: Predominantly affects women of reproductive age, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 8:1 [^ee6ae130].
- **Obesity**: Strongly associated; recent weight gain is a significant risk factor [^ee6ae130].
- **Incidence**: Rising in parallel with the global obesity epidemic; current estimates range from 0.5 to 2 per 100,000 in the general population, with higher rates in obese women [^ee6ae130] [^7a23fc72].

---

## Pathophysiology

The **exact cause remains unknown**; proposed mechanisms include:

- **Venous hypertension**: Increased venous sinus pressure or venous outflow obstruction [^0116e9d1].
- **CSF dynamics**: Altered CSF production or absorption [^f5838af8].
- **Metabolic factors**: Obesity-related metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance and androgen excess [^05a2fa60].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical **symptoms** include:

- **Headache**: Present in ~90% of patients; often daily, diffuse, and worsened by Valsalva or bending forward [^0f3c5376].
- **Visual symptoms**: Transient visual obscurations, blurred vision, diplopia (often VI nerve palsy), and progressive visual loss [^ee6ae130].
- **Pulsatile tinnitus**: Common, often synchronous with heartbeat [^ee6ae130].
- **Papilledema**: Hallmark sign on fundus examination [^ee6ae130].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis is based on the **modified Dandy criteria**, refined by Friedman et al.:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Symptoms | Headache, visual disturbances, or pulsatile tinnitus |
| Signs | Papilledema or VI nerve palsy |
| CSF pressure | Elevated (> 25 cm H₂O in adults) with normal composition |
| Neuroimaging | Normal MRI/MRV excluding secondary causes |
| No other cause | No identifiable cause of intracranial hypertension |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI brain and MR venography to exclude secondary causes (e.g. venous sinus thrombosis, mass lesions) [^7d68094f].
- **Lumbar puncture**: Confirms elevated opening pressure and normal CSF composition [^2d1dd823].
- **Ophthalmologic assessment**: Visual acuity, visual fields, fundus examination, and OCT to monitor papilledema and optic nerve head changes [^171c1fff].

---

## Management

### General principles

Management centers on **three pillars**:

- **Treat the underlying disease**: Weight loss is the only disease-modifying therapy [^0d03c50b].
- **Protect vision**: Regular ophthalmologic monitoring and escalation if visual decline occurs [^717de92b].
- **Minimize headache morbidity**: Tailored headache management strategies [^99f5e3c6].

---

### Medical management

- **Acetazolamide**: First-line therapy; carbonic anhydrase inhibitor reducing CSF production [^3232aed4].
- **Topiramate**: Alternative, particularly when weight loss is desired; also effective for headache control [^ddf2880b].
- **Short-term analgesics**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen for headache control; avoid opioids [^d73a2874] [^e6541c9b].

---

### Surgical management

Reserved for **refractory cases** with progressive visual loss or intractable headache:

- **CSF diversion**: Ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal shunting [^a7bb7712].
- **Optic nerve sheath fenestration**: Effective for visual stabilization [^a7bb7712].
- **Venous sinus stenting**: Emerging option for patients with venous sinus stenosis [^a7bb7712].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Emphasize **weight loss** — 15–24% body weight reduction is often required for remission — and provide structured weight management programs, dietary counseling, and exercise regimens [^a9c32995]. Bariatric surgery may be considered for morbid obesity with refractory IIH [^b1f90acb].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate management; most patients experience symptom resolution and visual stabilization. Chronic headache persists in ~50% despite normalized intracranial pressure, and visual loss can be permanent if untreated [^ee6ae130] [^0f3c5376].

---

## Complications

Untreated IIH can lead to **permanent visual loss** due to optic atrophy, chronic disabling headaches, and significant psychological morbidity, including anxiety and depression [^ee6ae130] [^cfc2fc88].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **GLP-1 receptor agonists**, which show promise for weight loss and symptom control, and ongoing research into novel pharmacologic targets, including 11β-HSD1 inhibitors [^445561e6] [^b4543e8b].

---

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a **chronic condition** characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without identifiable cause, predominantly affecting obese women of reproductive age. Management focuses on weight loss, medical therapy with acetazolamide or topiramate, and surgical interventions for refractory cases. With appropriate treatment, most patients experience symptom resolution and visual stabilization, but chronic headache and visual complications can persist if untreated.

### What is new about idiopathic intracranial hypertension? An updated review of mechanism and treatment [^a0813232]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is the syndrome of raised intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory or radiological evidence of intracranial pathology. IIH is a relatively rare disease but rapidly increasing incidence is reported due to a global increasing incidence of obesity. Disease course is generally said to be self-limiting within a few months. However, some patients experience a disabling condition of chronic severe headache and visual disturbances for years that limit their capacity to work. Permanent visual defects are serious and not infrequent complications. The pathophysiology of IIH is still not fully understood. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have facilitated the exclusion of associated conditions that may mimic IIH. No causal treatment is yet known for IIH and existing treatment is symptomatic and rarely sufficient. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of this potentially disabling disease which may show a future escalating incidence due to obesity. Theories of pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies are discussed.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in children: a review and algorithm [^ee01ded0]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

This updated review of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension focuses on epidemiology, clinical presentations, diagnostic criteria, evaluation, clinical course, and treatment. General guidelines for the clinical management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are discussed. A new algorithm outlines an efficient management strategy for the initial diagnostic evaluation of children with signs or symptoms of intracranial hypertension. This algorithm provides a systematic approach to initial evaluation and management, and identifies important decision-making factors. The risk of permanent visual loss with idiopathic intracranial hypertension necessitates a prompt, thorough collaborative approach in the management of patients. Although idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been recognized for over a century, the need remains for prospectively collected data to promote a better understanding of the etiology, risk factors, evaluative methods, and effective treatments for children with this syndrome.

### Familial idiopathic intracranial hypertension with spinal and radicular pain… [^25105ee1]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Ophthalmologic follow-up in our patients indicates that IIH is a chronic disease. Surgical treatment should be considered an option. IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL hypertension is a clinical entity characterized by symptoms caused by raised intracranial pressure without structural lesions or neurologic localizing signs. Typical features are increased intracranial pressure, papilledema, normal or diminished ventricular size, and normal cerebrospinal fluid composition. Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 350 mm H2O. The composition of the cerebrospinal fluid was normal, and viral and bacteriologic cultures were negative for organisms. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension was diagnosed, and the patient was treated with glycerol and dexamethasone. In February 1993, he was admitted to the Pediatric Department, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy, for evaluation of headache and backache.

His weight was 45700 kg, and height, 170 cm; there was headache, muscle weakness, hyperreflexia, and spontaneous spinal and radicular pain; he had difficulty walking because of backache. Both optic discs were pale and swollen; there was no hemorrhaging. Visual acuity was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and of the spinal cord revealed nothing of note and ruled out venous sinus occlusion. The composition of the cerebrospinal fluid was also normal; viral and bacteriologic cultures were negative for organisms. Complete blood cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, electrolyte quantitation, and immunoglobulin and complement concentrations were in the normal range. Doppler ultrasonography of supra-aortic vessels and transcranical Doppler revealed nothing of note.

Blood pressure was normal and electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities. The patient was discharged after 23 days of hospitalization. No treatment was prescribed and the patient's symptoms progressively regressed so that 3 months later, the headache had disappeared and the patient was able to stand and walk. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension could comprise an assortment of disorders involving abnormalities of the regulation of intracranial pressure. Raised intracranial pressure can result from increased venous pressure, increased resistance of arachnoid villi to resorption of cerebral spinal fluid, or hypersecretion of cerebral spinal fluid perhaps related to endocrine abnormalities. 11.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^379536c9]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review and discuss the clinical presentation and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Discussion

Visual alterations and headache are the two main symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, although additional features including cranial nerve palsies, cognitive deficits, olfactory deficits and tinnitus are not uncommon. The headache associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension frequently has a migrainous phenotype. The underlying cause of the disorder has not yet been elucidated. Several hypotheses have been postulated but none of them can explain the full clinical picture. Therapeutic options remain limited, focusing mainly on reduction in body weight and the reduction of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

Conclusion

The accurate diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is essential as visual deterioration due to papilledema may be irreversible. Given its phenotypic similarity and frequent overlap with chronic migraine it is essential to consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the diagnostic workup of chronic headache; in particular, when considering its increasing prevalence. Understanding in detail the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associated headache would also allow study of current and future therapeutic options in a structured way.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^f5838af8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare but important disease associated with significant morbidity. There is an expected rise in prevalence in line with the escalating global burden of obesity. Modern revisions in the terminology and diagnostic criteria for IIH help guide clinicians in investigations and researchers in standardising recruitment criteria for clinical trials. The pathophysiology of IIH is incompletely characterised; suggested underpinning mechanisms include the role of cerebrospinal fluid regulation as well as metabolic and endocrinological perspectives. Recent treatment trials are providing insights into the management but debate still surrounds key areas in treatment. This review will provide an up-to-date discussion on the potential pathogenic mechanisms and management of IIH.

### A review of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^812ae7fa]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

It is now well recognized that idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) can occur in children. Relative to the adult population, the demographic features and clinical presentation of IIH as well as the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for children are quite different. Although these differences are well established, specific diagnostic and treatment guidelines for pediatric patients have largely been based on the adult literature. Exciting new evidence is now available to assist the clinician in managing pediatric patients with IIH.

### Understanding idiopathic intracranial hypertension: mechanisms, management, and future directions [^44c3e83b]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure that predominantly affects young, obese women. Pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, but several causal factors have been proposed. Symptoms can include headaches, visual loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and back and neck pain, but the clinical presentation is highly variable. Although few studies have been done to support evidence-based management, several recent advances have the potential to enhance understanding of the causes of the disease and to guide treatment decisions. Investigators of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) reported beneficial effects of acetazolamide in patients with mild visual loss. Studies have also established weight loss as an effective disease-modifying treatment, and further clinical trials to investigate new treatments are underway. The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is expected to increase as rates of obesity increase; efforts to reduce diagnostic delays and identify new, effective approaches to treatment will be key to meeting the needs of a growing number of patients.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^061fa94d]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumour cerebri is primarily a disorder of young obese women characterised by symptoms and signs associated with raised intracranial pressure in the absence of a space-occupying lesion or other identifiable cause.

Summary

The overall incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is approximately two per 100,000, but is considerably higher among obese individuals and, given the global obesity epidemic, is likely to rise further. The pathophysiology of this condition is poorly understood, but most theories focus on the presence of intracranial venous hypertension and/or increased cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and how this relates to obesity. A lack of randomised clinical trials has resulted in unsatisfactory treatment guidelines and although weight loss is important, especially when used in conjunction with drugs that reduce cerebrospinal fluid production, resistant cases remain difficult to manage and patients invariably undergo neurosurgical shunting procedures. The use of transverse cerebral sinus stenting remains contentious and long-term benefits are yet to be determined.

Conclusion

An understanding of the clinical features, diagnostic work-up and therapeutic options available for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension is important both for neurologists and ophthalmologists as visual loss maybe permanent if untreated.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^aee75c67]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Scope

This is a consensus document to provide practical information for best practice in uniform investigation and treatment strategies based on current literature and opinion from a specialist interest group (SIG) for adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This should increase awareness of IIH among clinicians and improve outcomes for patients.

The target audience for this statement includes neurologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, emergency medicine specialists, physicians, ear nose and throat specialists and other clinicians who investigate and manage IIH. It also contains information that will be of interest to those in primary care and other healthcare professionals.

The increasing economic burden of IIH has been highlighted by a number of groups. Clear guidance will help educate the attending doctors to manage these patients appropriately. This will help reduce the repeat unsolicited emergency hospital attendances and reduce IIH-related disability. There are a number of ongoing clinical trials in IIH and as evidence for medical and surgical management evolves in IIH this document will require timely updates.

### Interventions for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^6975bccf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension occurs throughout the world with an estimated incidence of one to three per 100,000 population per year. It occurs most commonly in obese young women but the cause is unknown. It presents a significant threat to sight and is associated with severe morbidity, in the form of headaches in most cases. Several different treatments have been proposed ranging from relatively conservative measures such as diuretic therapy to more invasive treatments such as optic nerve sheath fenestration, stenting of cerebral venous sinuses, or lumbo-peritoneal shunting.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of various forms of treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension with a view to producing an evidence-based treatment strategy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register, on The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2005).

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials in which any intervention used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension had been compared to placebo or to another form of treatment in people with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Since no trials met our inclusion criteria, no assessment of quality or meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials were found that met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. There is inadequate information regarding which treatments are truly beneficial and which are potentially harmful. Properly designed and executed trials are needed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^7a23fc72]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is caused by an elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). The condition mainly affects obese young women of childbearing age. Its prevalence ranges between 0.5 and 2 per 100,000 of the general population and is expected to increase further given the worldwide increase in obesity. The underlying cause of the disease, as well as the gender preference and its pathophysiological relation to obesity, remain largely unknown. Several mechanisms have been proposed as the underlying cause of IIH, such as an overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), outflow obstruction, elevated pressure in the venous sinuses and more recently a dysfunction in the glymphatic pathway as well as hormonal alterations. Given that none of these theories can explain the entire clinical picture, therapeutic approaches rely mainly on weight reduction and the decrease of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. As increasing evidence suggests that a CSF overproduction is unlikely to be the driving factor behind IIH, treatment with acetazolamide is likely to target a consequence, rather than the cause of this disorder.

The two most prominent symptoms of IIH are progressive visual deterioration resulting from papilledema and chronic headache, although additional symptoms including cranial nerve palsies, cognitive deficits, tinnitus and olfactory dysfunction are frequently also part of the clinical presentation. While the visual dysfunction is known to largely result from a pressure-induced papilledema, the origin of the IIH-related headache is less clear and therapeutic approaches are less investigated.

IIH-related headache is defined in the Headache Classification of the International Headache Society (ICHD-3). While the ICHD has had an enormous impact on advancing the understanding and treatment options of many headache disorders, as it allowed the creation of homogenous patient groups resulting in improved diagnostic accuracy and more effective clinical trials, ICHD has had less of an impact in IIH-related headache. The reason is a rather unspecific definition of IIH-related headache resulting from its highly variable clinical presentation that may frequently mimic or overlap with primary headaches, in particular migraine. As a result, while the understanding of IIH is advancing, unfortunately this is not so much the case in IIH-related headache.

The aim of this review is to discuss the most prominent visual symptoms and IIH-associated headache as well as the potential therapeutic options that exist to treat these two features of IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a comprehensive overview [^2044fbf4]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also called pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, is a disorder defined as elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause. It is a diagnosis of exclusion in most cases, and all other forms of elevated ICP must be ruled out. With its increasing prevalence, it is much more likely for physicians, otolaryngologists included, to encounter this condition. It is important to have a clear understanding of the typical and atypical presentation of this disease, along with its evaluative workup and management options. This article reviews IIH with a focus on those factors that are specifically relevant to otolaryngologic care.

### Advances in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^5933aa29]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the most relevant developments in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Recent Findings

The phenotype of the typical IIH headache is diverging from the historical thinking of a raised intracranial pressure headache, with the majority being classified as having migraine. A larger proportion of those with IIH have a past medical history of migraine, compared with the general population, highlighting the importance of re-examining those who have a change or escalation in their headache. The mechanisms underlying headache in IIH are not understood. Additionally, factors which confer a poor headache prognosis are not established. It is clear, however, that headache has a detrimental effect on all aspects of the patient's quality of life and is currently ranked highly as a research priority by IIH patients to better understand the pathophysiology of headache in IIH and identification of potential headache specific therapeutic agents.

Summary

Headache remains the predominate morbidity in the majority of those with IIH. Headache management is an unmet need in IIH and future studies are required to investigate the probable complex mechanisms, as well as effective management.

### A randomised controlled trial of treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^3b3064c2]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The cause of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) remains unknown, and no consensus exists on how patients should be monitored and treated. Acetazolamide is a common treatment but has never been examined in a randomised controlled trial. The objectives of this pilot trial are to prospectively evaluate the use of acetazolamide, to explore various outcome measures and to inform the design of a definitive trial in IIH. Fifty patients were recruited from six centres over 23 months and randomised to receive acetazolamide (n = 25) or no acetazolamide (n = 25). Symptoms, body weight, visual function and health-related quality-of-life measures were recorded over a 12-month period. Recruited patients had typical features of mild IIH and most showed improvement, with 44% judged to have IIH in remission at the end of the trial. Difficulties with recruitment were highlighted as well as poor compliance with acetazolamide therapy (12 patients). A composite measure of IIH status was tested, and the strongest concordance with final disease status was seen with perimetry (Somers' D = 0.66) and optic disc appearance (D = 0.59). Based on the study data, a sample size of 320 would be required to demonstrate a 20% treatment effect in a substantive trial. Clinical trials in IIH require pragmatic design to involve sufficiently large numbers of patients. Future studies should incorporate weighted composite scores to reflect the relative importance of common outcome measures in IIH.

Study Overview Idiopathic intracranial hypertension has long been associated with the hallmark clinical triad of headaches, papilledema, and visual loss in the absence of neurologic signs, Hydrocephalus or intracranial masses on CT or MRI. findings without evidence of thrombosis; lumbar puncture opening pressure of > 25 cm H₂O; normal biochemical and cytological composition of the CSF. The overall age-adjusted and gender-adjusted annual incidence is increasing and was reported to be 2. 4 per 100 000 within the last decade. A variety of aetiologies have been suggested to explain the pathophysiology behind IIH, including meningeal inflammation, metabolic disturbances, medication effects, and cerebral venous hypertension.

Imaging of patients with IIH is traditionally performed to exclude lesions that produce intracranial hypertension. MR imaging features of IIH include posterior globe flattening, a protrusion of the subarachnoid space in the cavum sellae, distension of the preoptic subarachnoid space, enhancement of the prelaminar optic nerve, vertical tortuosity of the orbital optic nerve, and intraocular protrusion of the prelaminar optic nerve. The first line of treatment for IIH consists of weight loss and/or medical therapy including diuretics such as acetazolamide. When medical treatment fails, surgical options include cerebrospinal fluid diversion via ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration. Recently, another etiology of cerebral venous hypertension has garnered increasing attention as a putative cause of IIH, cerebral venous Dural sinus stenosis.

In medically refractory IIH patients with a physiologic pressure gradient across venous stenosis, cerebral venous stenting has emerged as an alternative treatment to traditional surgical approaches.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^2463e58c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

IIH is an uncommon disorder characterized by symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension without radiologic or laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology. This condition typically affects young-to-middle-aged females with obesity. Visual impairment and severe headache are the major concerns in this condition; thus, the primary treatment purpose is to prevent visual dysfunction and reduce headache severity. Counseling about weight reduction is the initial treatment approach in all obese patients. LP is a diagnostic tool for evaluation of elevated ICP. Medical management is generally the first line of treatment and is adequate in the majority of patients. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials and showed significant improvement of headache and visual outcomes. Acetazolamide is the first-line medication in most patients. In patients with severe optic neuropathy or those who fail medical therapy, surgical management, either CSF diversion or ONSF, and endovascular venous stenting of transverse sinus stenosis are the next available options which have demonstrated satisfactory outcomes on visual function and headache. Table 5 summarizes the long-term outcome of visual function and headache of each intervention in the treatment of refractory IIH. There are many challenges that need to be explored in future research on the diagnosis and treatment of IIH. Many biomarkers have been demonstrated to relate to IIH pathogenesis and may be the targets in the future research. In addition, more prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish a treatment guideline for IIH.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^bf0c86f3]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a rare disorder of unknown cause characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of underlying structural pathology. IIH typically affects women of reproductive age, with a significant association with obesity and recent weight gain. Although IIH is considered a rare syndrome, the incidence is increasing, and appears to reflect country specific rates of obesity.

The majority of patients with IIH present with headache, visual disturbance (e.g. loss of peripheral vision, transient visual obscurations, horizontal double vision) and pulsatile tinnitus. Some patients also experience back pain, dizziness and cognitive disturbances. Papilloedema (swelling of the optic nerve head) is a hallmark feature of IIH and left untreated could lead to optic atrophy and permanent visual loss. Rarely, patients present with papilloedema in the absence of any other symptoms. Preserving the vision is a key priority in the management of IIH. Commonly, patients with IIH develop chronic headaches, which significantly reduce quality of life and are typically difficult to treat.

In 2018, the first consensus guidelines for the investigation and management of IIH in adults was established. It outlines diagnostic principles and key management strategies, namely to treat underlying disease accomplished by weight loss, preserve vision via emergency surgery (when required) and minimise headache morbidity.

The exact pathology underlying IIH remains unknown. Improved treatment options are an unmet clinical need in this disease area. Recent mechanistic studies have identified therapeutic targets such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which have formed the basis of IIH randomised clinical trials. The aim of this review is to inform the reader of emerging issues and present new key highlights in the therapeutic development for IIH.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of high-pressure and low-pressure headaches, focusing on their pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management. High-pressure headaches, often linked to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, primarily affect young women and can lead to vision loss if untreated. Low-pressure headaches, commonly caused by spontaneous or iatrogenic cerebral spinal fluid leaks, are a significant cause of refractory headaches. The article emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis using advanced imaging and multidisciplinary management, including pharmacologic therapies, procedural interventions, and surgical options. By addressing these challenging headache syndromes, clinicians can achieve better outcomes and improve patients' quality of life.

This paper summarises the first consensus guidelines for idiopathic intracranial hypertension as an infographic. Following a systematic literature review, a multidisciplinary specialist interest group met and established questions relating to population, interventions, controls and outcomes (PICO). A survey was sent to doctors who manage idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) regularly. Statements were reviewed by national professional bodies, specifically the Association of British Neurologists, British Association for the Study of Headache, the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and by international experts. Key areas are represented based on the guideline, namely: (1) investigation of papilloedema and diagnosis of IIH; (2) management strategies; and (3) investigation and management of acute exacerbation of headache in established IIH. We present an infographic as an aide-mémoire of the first consensus guidelines for IIH.

MANAGEMENT OF HEADACHE IN INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

The 2015 Cochrane review concluded that there is a lack of evidence to guide pharmacological treatment in IIH. There are few published randomised clinical trials and a small number of ongoing trials. None of these have focused on management of headache. Managing headache in IIH is an essential aspect of patient care and recent consensus guidelines have provided a practical approach to managing them.

CONCLUSION

Migraine phenotype and prior history of headache before a diagnosis of IIH needs to be recognised by clinicians to avoid misdiagnosis. There is an unmet need to treat headaches in IIH. Future studies should consider core outcome measures for headache, as used in migraine trials, which would optimise meta-analysis. Migraine abortive and preventive therapies can be used, but currently there is no high-class evidence to help guide treatment decisions.

Management principles

For optimal management of patients with IIH, there must be clear communication between clinicians for seamless joint care between the various specialties (figure 3). Weight loss reduces ICP and has been shown to be effective in improving papilloedema and headaches. The main principles of management of IIH are:
to treat the underlying disease
to protect the vision
to minimise the headache morbidity.

Figure 3
Management flow chart of diagnosed IIH. BMI, body mass index; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; IIH, idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Twenty-three questions were formulated to cover the three principle domains of management in IIH (table 1).

Primary principle for IIH management: modify the underlying disease through weight loss

Q2 What is the best way to modify the disease to induce remission?

Weight loss is the only disease-modifying therapy in typical IIH.
Once definite IIH is diagnosed, all patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m² should be counselled about weight management at the earliest opportunity. This should be done with sensitivity.
The amount of weight loss required to put the disease into remission is not known. It is noted that in the year preceding a diagnosis of IIH is associated with 5%–15% wt gain, and up to 15% of weight loss was required to put IIH into remission in one cohort.
Patients should be referred to a community weight management programme or a hospital-based weight programme.

Uncertainty

Maintained weight loss is difficult to achieve, and the optimal approach to achieving long-term weight management has not yet been clearly established. If weight loss cannot be achieved by the patients themselves, the first step would be professional help through a structured diet. There is an increasing role for bariatric surgery for sustained weight loss, and for use in IIH, more prospective controlled evidence is required. For those who are not obese secondary causes should be revisited (box 1), and the role of weight gain/loss remains uncertain.

Second principle for IIH management: protect the vision

### Update on the pathophysiology and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^a45d2231]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disease of unknown aetiology, typically affecting young obese women, producing a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure without identifiable cause. Despite a large number of hypotheses and publications over the past decade, the aetiology is still unknown. Vitamin A metabolism, adipose tissue as an actively secreting endocrine tissue and cerebral venous abnormalities are areas of active study regarding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. There continues to be no evidence based consensus or formal guidelines regarding management and treatment of the disease. Treatment studies show that the diagnostic lumbar puncture is a valuable intervention beyond its diagnostic importance, and that weight management is critical. However, many questions remain regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide, CSF shunting procedures and cerebral transverse venous sinus stenting.

### Interventions for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^0c1f1e9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has an estimated incidence of one to three people per 100,000 people per year, and occurs most commonly in obese, young women. IIH is associated with severe morbidity, notably due to a significant threat to sight and severe headache. Several different management options have been proposed. Conservative measures centre on weight loss. Pharmacological therapy includes use of diuretics. Refractory and sight-threatening cases demand surgical intervention, most often in the form of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion or optic nerve sheath fenestration. Other treatments include venous sinus stenting and bariatric surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of any intervention for IIH in any patient group.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 22 July 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any intervention was compared to placebo, or to another form of treatment, for people with a clinical diagnosis of IIH.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. We resolved any discrepancies by third party decision.

Main Results

We identified two completed RCTs (enrolling a total of 211 participants and conducted in the UK and US) and two ongoing trials that met the inclusion criteria. Both completed trials compared acetazolamide to placebo, in conjunction with a weight loss intervention in both groups. Attrition bias was a problem in both trials with high loss to follow-up, in one study this loss to follow-up occurred particularly in the acetazolamide arm. One trial was unmasked and we judged it to be at risk of performance and detection bias. In these studies, change in visual acuity was similar in the treatment and control groups as measured by logMAR acuity. In one study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in logMAR acuity compared to the placebo group between baseline and 12 months in the right eye (MD 0.04 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.16) and left eye (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.15). In the other study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in vision over six months compared with people in the placebo group (mean difference in change in letters read was 0.01 (95% CI -1.45 to 1.46). One study reported no cases of visual loss in 21 people treated with acetalomazide compared to 2/20 cases in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.01, 3.82). The prespecified outcome for this review was reduction in CSF pressure to normal levels which was not reported by the two trials. One trial reported that, in a subsample of 85 participants who agreed to lumbar puncture at 6 months, people in the acetalomazide group on average had a greater reduction in CSF pressure (MD −59.9 mmH₂O, 95% CI −96.4, −23.4). In one study, people in the acetalozamide group on average experienced a greater reduction in papilloedema as assessed by fundus photographs MD -0.70 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.40) and by clinical grading MD -0.91 (95% CI -1.27 to -0.54) between baseline and six months in the study eye. Headache was recorded as present/absent in one study at 12 months (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12,1.41, 41 participants). Both studies reported headache on visual analogue scales (different ones) but results were inconclusive (MD for change in headache score measured on 10-point visual analogue scale at 12 months was 1.0 (-1.80, 3.70, 41 participants) and MD for change in headache score on a 6 point scale measured at 6 months was -0.45 (-3.5,2.6, number of participants unclear). In one study, a similar proportion of people in the acetalomazide group were in remission (however, the trial authors did not state their definition of this term) at 12 months compared to the placebo group. However, the 95% CIs were wide and there is considerable uncertainty as to the effect (OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.32 to 3.90, 41 participants). In one study of 185 participants, people in the acetalomazide group had an increased risk of decreased CO₂, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, paresthesia, tinnitus and vomiting compared to people in the placebo group. In general, the estimates of effect were uncertain with wide 95% CIs. Adverse effects were not reported in the other study. One study reported that quality of life was better in acetazolamide-treated patients based on the visual quality of life (VFQ-25) (MD 6.35, 95% CI 2.22 to 10.47) and the physical (MD 3.02, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.70) and mental (MD 3.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.55) components of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey tool at six months. Costs were not reported in either study. We judged the evidence to be low certainty (GRADE) downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Although the two included RCTs showed modest benefits for acetazolamide for some outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of this intervention, or any other treatments currently available, for treating people with IIH. Further high-quality RCTs are required in order to adequately assess the effect of acetazolamide therapy in people with IIH.

### Interventions for idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^4f0566f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) occurs throughout the world with an estimated incidence of one to three per 100,000 population per year. It occurs most commonly in obese young women, but the cause is unknown. It presents a significant threat to sight and is associated with severe morbidity in the form of headaches in the majority of cases. Several different treatments have been proposed, ranging from relatively conservative measures such as diuretic therapy to more invasive treatments such as optic nerve sheath fenestration or lumbo-peritoneal shunting.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the evidence from controlled trials looking at the various treatments used for idiopathic intracranial hypertension with a view to producing an evidence-based treatment strategy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register - CENTRAL/CCTR (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group specialised register) on the Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2002, MEDLINE (1966 to March 2002) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2002).

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials in which any intervention used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension had been compared to placebo or to another form of treatment in people with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Since no trials met our inclusion criteria, no assessment of quality or meta-analysis was undertaken.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials were found that met the inclusion criteria.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Of the various treatments available, there is inadequate information regarding which are truly beneficial and which are potentially harmful. Properly designed and executed trials are needed.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: consensus guidelines on management [^ee6ae130]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Background

IIH occurs predominantly in women and although the underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood, it has a striking association with obesity. The combination of raised intracranial pressure, without hydrocephalus or mass lesion, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition and where no underlying aetiology is found are accepted criteria for the diagnosis of IIH. The overall age-adjusted and gender-adjusted annual incidence is increasing and was reported to be 2.4 per 100 000 within the last decade (2002–2014).

The majority of patients presenting with IIH have symptoms that include a headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) (figure 1). The headache phenotype is highly variable and may mimic other primary headache disorders. Other symptoms may include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain and typically horizontal diplopia (figure 1A): none of which are pathognomonic for IIH. Investigation and management depends on symptoms and signs and requires an interdisciplinary team approach.

For the individual patient, some can have permanent visual loss. Chronic headache significantly impacts quality of lifewith over half of patients with IIH reporting ongoing headaches at 12 months.

Clinical uncertainty exists, and IIH can be misdiagnosed. The 2015 Cochrane review has concluded that there is lack of evidence to guide pharmacological treatment in IIH. Randomised clinical trials are currently infrequent in this field due to the rarity of the disease, the lack of understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms and limited disease-modifying therapies.

### Update on idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^fa2ac7af]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide an update on various features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Selected articles on the epidemiology, clinical and imaging features, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension were reviewed and interpreted in the context of the authors' clinical and research experience.

Results

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension primarily is a disease of obese women of childbearing age, but it can affect patients of any weight, sex, and age. Although a relatively rare disorder, idiopathic intracranial hypertension's associated costs in the United States entail hundreds of millions of dollars. Even after treatment, headaches frequently are persistent and may require the continued involvement of a neurologist. Quality-of-life reductions and depression are common among idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients. However, visual dysfunction, especially visual field abnormalities, represents the major morbidity of this disorder, and serial automated perimetry remains the primary method of patient monitoring. Patients who are men, black, very obese, or anemic are at higher risk of visual loss. Vitamin A metabolism, adipose tissue as an actively secreting endocrine tissue, and cerebral venous abnormalities are areas of active study regarding the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Treatment studies show that lumbar puncture is a valuable treatment (in addition to its crucial diagnostic role), and that weight management is critical. However, open questions remain regarding the efficacy of acetazolamide, cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures, and cerebral venous stenting.

Conclusions

Many questions remain unanswered about idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Ongoing studies, especially an ongoing National Institutes of Health-funded clinical trial of acetazolamide, should provide more insight into this important, yet poorly understood, syndrome of isolated intracranial hypertension.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^448373a0]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is an uncommon disorder characterized by increased intracranial pressure without radiological or laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology except empty sella turcica, optic nerve sheath with filled out cerebrospinal fluid spaces, and smooth-walled nonflow-related venous sinus stenosis or collapse. This condition typically affects obese women. The incidence of IIH is increasing with the rising prevalence of obesity. Persistent headache is the most common symptom. Visual impairment is a serious complication that may not be recognized by the patients. This paper reviews clinical manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and current treatments of IIH in adults. Various imaging modalities have been studied on their validity for detection of IIH and papilledema. This review also includes new studies on medical, surgical, and interventional management of this condition. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials about their efficacy in treatment of IIH. In patients who have severe visual impairment or progressive visual deterioration despite medical management, surgical or interventional treatment may be considered. The efficacy and complications of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and endovascular venous stenting reported in the last 3 decades have been summarized in this review. Finally, the prospective aspects of biomarkers and treatments are proposed for future research.

Adult patients who present with papilloedema and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure need urgent multidisciplinary assessment including neuroimaging, to exclude life-threatening causes. Where there is no apparent underlying cause for the raised intracranial pressure, patients are considered to have idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The incidence of IIH is increasing in line with the global epidemic of obesity. There are controversial issues in its diagnosis and management. This paper gives a practical approach to assessing patients with papilloedema, its investigation and the subsequent management of patients with IIH.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is becoming increasingly prevalent in line with the global epidemic of obesity. In the UK, 22.7% of people are obese (Body Mass Index > 30 kg/m²), while obesity throughout the world has doubled since 1980. Clinicians' attitudes to IIH vary: in our experience, only a minority of patients are at high risk of rapid visual loss. The previously quoted figure of 25% developing severe permanent visual loss is probably an overestimate. The reality for patients is that it is a chronic condition characterised by significantly disabling headaches and psychological morbidity.

The nomenclature for IIH has changed over the years: previous names being serous meningitis, pseudotumour cerebri or benign intracranial hypertension. The latter became inappropriate with awareness that this is not a benign condition, given the risk of visual loss and disabling chronic headaches. Pseudotumour cerebri is becoming increasingly popular as a term to encompass primary raised intracranial pressure where there is no identifiable cause — which we term IIH — and secondary causes of raised pressure.

The diagnostic criteria of IIH are well known and have evolved since Dandy's initial description in 1937; they include a CSF opening pressure of ≥ 25 cm H₂O (box 1). However, these criteria recommend imaging only to exclude a venous sinus thrombosis in patients without the typical IIH phenotype (obesity and female sex). We feel, however, that it is essential to exclude venous sinus thrombosis (using MRI or CT with venography) in all patients presenting with pseudotumour cerebri, since being female and obese does not preclude the diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis. The diagnosis can be difficult and the consequences of error can lead either to the neglect of a serious treatable cause of raised intracranial pressure, blindness or inappropriate treatment of patients who do not have IIH. Although there is insufficient literature to generate an evidence-based management strategy for IIH, experienced clinicians can manage it well.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^0f3c5376]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment of headache

Headache is the most common presenting feature in IIH and leads to significant morbidity. Many patients do not have the classical headache phenotype attributed to raised ICP and the International Classification of Headache Disorders, which does not specify a particular headache phenotype (ICHD 3) has poor specificity (53%) in IIH. Many patients with IIH have daily headache (86%) that often resembles migraine or tension-type headache. Other features from the history can be useful, but are not pathognomonic, and can occur in both IIH and headache control subjects (exacerbation with bending 50% and 44%, respectively; morning headache 20% and 29%, respectively; exacerbation with cough or Valsalva 70% and 35%, respectively). IIH headache improves post-LP in 72%, but an improvement also occurs in 25% of those with headache without IIH or a pressure syndrome.

Most headache improvement occurs during the first month following diagnosis and treatment with constant headaches in 64% at diagnosis improving to 13% by 1 month. Yet, 63% continue to have headaches at 12 months, and headaches can remain even after ICP has normalised in 67%. Headaches outcomes are poor even in those with no prior history of headache, with 57% having headaches at 12 months.

There is little evidence to guide the management of headache attributed to IIH. Accurate headache phenotyping is key, and mixed headache types frequently coexist (high pressure, migraine, tension-type, low pressure in those with a shunt). Medication overuse headaches often occur and are underdiagnosed.

Our practice is to treat the predominant headache phenotype, typically using migraine-preventative strategies. It is worthy of note that some of the commonest medications here can cause weight gain. An excellent review in this area covers these options in detail. Shunting is generally ineffective management strategy for raised ICP headaches, as 79% still have headaches at 2 years, low-pressure headaches may develop (28%), and shunt failure is a major issue (> 50% are revised). Weight loss strategies significantly improve headache. In the IIHTT, headache disability improved in both treatment groups with no benefit of acetazolamide compared with placebo. As headaches have such a significant impact on patients, management by a headache medicine specialist is recommended.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with no identifiable cause. IIH, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a syndrome with the major risk factor of recent weight gain, occurring mainly in overweight women of working age. There is a rising incidence in this disease and the incidence appears related to country-specific prevalence of obesity.

In the majority of those presenting with IIH, they will have headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, with a divergence of traditional considerations of a raised ICP headache to a phenotype that is highly variable and commonly mimics migraine. Other reported symptoms include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically lasting seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain, and horizontal diplopia. Prognosis is variable as IIH can either be self-limited or have a lifelong chronic course with significant affects on quality of life.

In 2018, the first consensus IIH guidance was published. The document was reviewed by a committee of international key opinion leaders and a patient group, which established a James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for adult IIH. It sets out key diagnostic and management principles. The diagnostic principles of the investigation of papilloedema are to find any underlying treatable cause in a timely manner, protect the vision and ensure timely re-examination when vision is at risk, and to enable onward care of the patient with the input from the most appropriate experienced clinician. Key considerations are to exclude secondary causes, such as venous sinus thrombosis with appropriate imaging and check blood pressure to exclude malignant hypertension. The Friedman et al. 2013 diagnostic criteria are used, although a key area of uncertainty still exists with the diagnostic cut-off, lumbar puncture opening pressure (LP OP) 25 cm cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as was then recognized. A grey zone between 25 and 30 cm CSF exists with the recommendation that wherever measured LP OP does not fit the clinical picture, consideration should be given to repeat measurement or ICP monitoring.

### Current concepts and strategies in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults [^171c1fff]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Since obesity has become an epidemic in industrialized nations, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is now a more common neuro-ophthalmic disorder that causes visual loss and headaches. This review highlights the new diagnostic criteria for IIH and the new insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of IIH. Key diagnostic and monitoring techniques for papilledema include not only neuroimaging and the measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, but also perimetry, optical coherence tomography, and ocular sonography. The main findings of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) support acetazolamide as the mainstay for medical therapy. CSF diversion procedures, endovascular venous sinus stenting, and optic nerve sheath fenestration are all surgical options when IIH is refractory to medical treatment or when it presents fulminantly. Future clinical trials comparing these procedures will help develop better paradigms in the surgical management of IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^29d0d4a1]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The history, diagnosis, and therapy of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (pseudotumor cerebri) are reviewed. Theories of pathogenesis are considered, the clinical presentation is described, and potential diagnostic and therapeutic challenges are explored.

Methods

An extensive literature review of IIH and related conditions (secondary pseudotumor syndromes) was performed. The history of and rationale for the diagnosis and medical and surgical approaches to treatment are reviewed. Available outcome studies are presented.

Results

Diagnosis of IIH requires that the modified Dandy criteria be satisfied. Multiple potential contributing causes of intracranial hypertension must be identified or excluded. The clinical presentation most often includes headaches and papilledema, but many other findings have been described. The most important goal of therapy is to prevent or arrest progressive visual loss. Medical therapies include alleviation of associated systemic diseases, discontinuation of contributing medications, provision of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and weight loss. Surgical therapies include lumboperitoneal shunting, ventriculoperitoneal shunting, and optic nerve sheath fenestration. On the basis of the advantages and disadvantages of these treatment modalities, a suggested treatment paradigm is presented.

Conclusion

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is the term to be adopted instead of pseudotumor cerebri. IIH remains an enigmatic diagnosis of exclusion. However, prompt diagnosis and thorough evaluation and treatment are crucial for preventing visual loss and improving associated symptoms.

### A systematic review of surgical treatments of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) [^a7bb7712]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension denotes raised intracranial pressure in the absence of an identifiable cause and presents with symptoms relating to elevated ICP, namely headaches and visual deterioration. Treatment of IIH aims at reducing intracranial pressure, relieving headache and salvaging patients' vision. Surgical interventions are recommended for medically refractory IIH and include CSF diversion techniques, optic nerve sheath fenestration, bariatric surgery and venous sinus stenting. Prospective studies on the surgical options for IIH are scant and no evidence-based guidelines for the surgical management of medically refractory IIH have been established. A search in Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1 January 1985 to 19 April 2019 for controlled or observational studies on the surgical treatment of IIH (defined in accordance with the modified Dandy or the modified Friedman criteria) in adults yielded 109 admissible studies. VSS improved papilledema, visual fields and headaches in 87.1%, 72.7% and 72.1% of the patients respectively, with a 2.3% severe complication rate and 11.3% failure rate. CSF diversion techniques diminished papilledema, visual field deterioration and headaches in 78.9%, 66.8% and 69.8% of the cases and are associated with a 9.4 severe complication rate and a 43.4% failure rate. ONSF ameliorated papilledema, visual field defects and headaches in 90.5, 65.2% and 49.3% of patients. Severe complication rate was 2.2% and failure rate was 9.4%. This is currently the largest systematic review for the available operative modalities for IIH. VSS provided the best results in headache resolution and visual outcomes, with low failure rates and a very favourable complication profile. In light of this, VSS ought to be regarded as the first-line surgical modality for the treatment of medically refractory IIH.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^e1aa31a7]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Management

Disease evolution and outcomes in IIH are poorly characterised and are currently being evaluated in the National IIH:LIFE study (centres interested in participating should contact the author, AS). We have noted the following patient types:
Those who rapidly lose vision at diagnosis over days to weeks (rare but vital to identify early).
Those whose disease resolves following diagnosis, over weeks to months, occasionally after a single lumbar puncture (rare).
Those at lower risk of visual loss who develop chronic disease with small fluctuations in disease activity, frequently with weight changes (the majority).
Those in disease remission and off treatment.

For most patients, the clinical priority is to monitor vision and help the disease into remission. The headache symptoms typically comprise the greatest morbidity for these patients (see later). For patients in remission (the fourth cohort) with no papilloedema noted on visits over several years, we will aim to discharge and advise annual optometrist assessments, but return if any symptoms recur.

### Bariatric surgery or non-surgical weight loss for idiopathic intracranial hypertension? A systematic review and comparison of meta-analyses [^a8f3ddd8]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is associated with obesity and weight loss by any means is considered beneficial in this condition.

Objectives

This study aims to appraise bariatric surgery vs. non-surgical weight-loss (medical, behavioural and lifestyle) interventions in IIH management.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analyses of surgical and non-surgical studies.

Results

Bariatric surgery achieved 100% papilloedema resolution and a reduction in headache symptoms in 90.2%. Non-surgical methods offered improvement in papilloedema in 66.7%, visual field defects in 75.4% and headache symptoms in 23.2%. Surgical BMI decrease was 17.5 vs. 4.2 for non-surgical methods.

Conclusions

Whilst both bariatric surgery and non-surgical weight loss offer significant beneficial effects on IIH symptomatology, future studies should address the lack of prospective and randomised trials to establish the optimal role for these interventions.

### Ultrasound-guided initial diagnosis and follow-up of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^e16607b7]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a rare disease in children with an annual incidence of 0.63–0.71 in 100,000. Typical symptoms include headache, vomiting, and visual disturbances. However, such symptoms are often non-specific in children, and may also be associated with more common conditions, such as hydrocephalus. Younger children in particular sometimes appear to have no symptoms at all. According to the diagnostic criteria, idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, essentially detected by invasive lumbar puncture, with normal cerebrospinal fluid composition and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based exclusion of hydrocephalus or space-occupying lesions in the absence of causes of secondary intracranial hypertension, such as venous sinus thrombosis or metabolic/immune diseases. Even with the revised diagnostic criteria, fundoscopically diagnosed papilledema still plays a major role in establishing the diagnosis, although it has been shown that a high percentage of children with a confirmed diagnosis may not develop papilledema. Untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension can lead to severe visual impairment and even blindness. Therapeutic options include medical treatment, especially with acetazolamide and, in severe, therapy-refractory cases, lumbo- or ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Monitoring of efficacy and duration of treatment, apart from change of symptomatology, is usually based on ophthalmologic procedures, showing, for example, a decrease in papilledema, if present, or, in some institutions, even repeated lumbar punctures.

Transorbital ultrasound (US) of the optic nerve sheath diameter is a highly reliable, non-invasive method for estimating intracranial pressure in children and adults, with multiple applications. Small pilot studies have already indicated that US optic nerve sheath diameter might be a helpful diagnostic tool to identify and follow-up children with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Transtemporal US determination of the third ventricle diameter provides an estimate of the lateral ventricular width, and thus can be used to evaluate for hydrocephalus.

The aim of this study was to analyze the combined use of US optic nerve sheath and third ventricle diameters in childhood idiopathic intracranial hypertension as a first-line screening-tool to point towards a possible/likely intracranial pressure increase and exclude hydrocephalus as an underlying cause. We compared baseline optic nerve sheath and third ventricle diameter scores of patients with pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension to a control cohort and defined optimal cut-off values for group allocation. In addition, we serially investigated the development of optic nerve sheath and third ventricle diameters before, during, and after initial therapy, and, in the long-term, before and after relapse.

### The rational management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension… [^717de92b]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a diagnosis most freqently made in young, overweight women. The chief hazard to the patient is permanent visual loss due to chronic papilledema. After the diagnosis has been clearly established using lumbar puncture and imaging techniques, the neurologist is involved in helping to lower the intracranial pressure, control the headaches, and encourage weight loss. Careful vision monitoring is essential and should be done in collaboration with an ophthalmologist. Visual fields, fundus photographs, intraocular pressure measurement, and visual acuity should be performed at each follow-up visit. The use of visual evoked response and repeated measurement of intracranial pressure by lumbar puncture do not provide data that help to guide therapeutic decisions. Indications for surgery are loss of visual field or decline in visual acuity in the fact of medical therapy, persistent headache, or the inability to perform visual-function studies.

Optic nerve sheath fenestration and lumbar peritoneal shunt both appear to be effective surgical means to reduce the pressure on the optic disc. A neurologist and an ophthalmologist working together provide the evidence on which to base rational decisions in the care of the patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema [^54f0c968]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by high cerebrospinal fluid pressure with no underlying structural or systemic cause. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema, although well-described in adults, is rarely reported in the pediatric population. The usual presentation is similar to that of chronic daily headache, with some features of migraine. However, treatment modalities are different, and specific therapy can lead to significant improvement in symptoms. We describe six children with chronic daily headache, who were diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema. The response to medical management was variable. One child required a lumboperitoneal shunt for persistent signs, with good surgical outcome.

### Bariatric surgery or non-surgical weight loss for idiopathic intracranial hypertension? A systematic review and comparison of meta-analyses [^dedbc83f]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The worldwide burden of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) continues to rise with the current annual incidence estimated at up to 21 per 100,000 per year in obese young women. This increase occurs in the context of a concomitant rise in obesity rates; in the USA, more than a third of adults are now obese, compared with around 11% worldwide, with a further third overweight (body mass index (BMI) 25–30 kg/m²). In 2013, the American Medical Association declared obesity as a genuine disease state.

IIH, also known as pseudotumour cerebri, is a clinical diagnosis defined by criteria that comprise symptoms and signs of intracranial pressure (e.g. headache, papilloedema and visual loss), elevated intracranial pressure (e.g. on lumbar puncture) with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition and without any other cause identified on neuroimaging or other evaluations.

Although previously called benign intracranial hypertension, it is not a benign disorder with many patients suffering intractable, disabling headaches with a significant risk of severe and permanent visual loss seen in up to 30%.

The pathogenesis of IIH remains unclear, although several risk factors have been identified. IIH is most prevalent in obese females of reproductive age; at least 90% of patients are female with obesity prevalence ranging from 70.5 to 94% and recent weight gain is a further significant factor for its development.

Weight loss is traditionally advocated for all overweight IIH patients and remains the cornerstone of management as it generally improves symptomology. Although lifestyle weight-loss interventions, comprising exercise promotion and dietary modification are widely advised, long-term weight control and accordingly IIH outcomes remain suboptimal.

### High-pressure headaches: idiopathic intracranial hypertension and its mimics [^0116e9d1]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder that typically affects obese women of childbearing age, but can also occur in paediatric populations. Patients usually present with diffuse, daily headache and visual disturbances, but either symptom can occur in isolation. Patients with IIH often have papilloedema; however, IIH without papilloedema is fairly common in patients with chronic daily headache. The pathogenesis of IIH is unknown; the high incidence of comorbid bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS) in patients with IIH suggests that the two conditions are linked, although no direct causal relationship has been established. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure monitoring or lumbar puncture-which provides immediate symptomatic relief-are important in making a diagnosis of IIH. Current treatments for IIH include weight reduction, medical treatment, CSF diversion surgery, optic nerve sheath fenestration and, potentially, endovascular stenting (in patients with BTSS). Prevention of visual loss (which can be substantial) is the main goal of treatment. Residual headache and IIH recurrence are not uncommon after treatment, and regular follow-up is, therefore, warranted even in patients who achieve remission. This Review provides an update of current knowledge of the aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of IIH.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^3874d7a4]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is an uncommon disorder of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) without radiological and laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology. Even though the clinical presentations of this condition are well-characterized, the pathogenesis remains unclear. Although obese women of childbearing age are typically affected, IIH can affect patients of any age or sex. Incidence of IIH largely varies from 0.03 to 2.36/100,000/year in total population.–As female sex and obesity are the risk factors for IIH, higher incidence was reported in female population (0.65–4.65/100,000/year)–and in obese women (2.7–19.3/100,000/year). In the last decade, its incidence has been rising due to the globally increasing prevalence of obesity. Chronic headache and visual impairment are the main presentation symproms of IIH. Quality of life is also affected by IIH, even in patients with mild visual impairement.

### Novel advances in monitoring and therapeutic approaches in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^693d9c3c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The key management principles are addressing the underlying modifiable risk factor of weight gain; protecting the vision through regular assessment and escalation of treatment when sight is threatened; and reducing headache morbidity through active management. Importantly, considerations included the indication for CSF diversion surgery in declining visual function. However, alternative interventions, such as neurovascular stenting do not yet have evidence to recommend them. It should also be stressed that headache alone is not an indication for CSF diversion with a majority of patients having persistent headache following the procedure.

The major achievement of this document is the interdisciplinary working to provide a framework to standardize care for those with IIH. This standardized approach to care has been subsequently published in the European Headache Federation Guidelines for IIH.

2025. 2019. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder of elevated intracranial pressure of unknown cause that primarily affects young women with obesity. 1–3 Although the symptoms of elevated ICP can range from nonexistent to incapacitating, the principal morbidity is progressive and sometimes profound vision loss secondary to papilledema. In addition, many patients with IIH are disabled by chronic headaches, depression, and impaired quality of life. 1–3 The association of IIH with obesity and recent weight gain has been recognized for years, and the current obesity epidemic, especially in the US, is associated with a parallel rise in the incidence of IIH.

2 Furthermore, a dramatic rise in the incidence of IIH over the past decade has been documented, with preferential involvement of teenaged Black and Hispanic females, likely contributing to worsening disparities in health care. 4 Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^1458ee4e]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neuro-ophthalmological condition characterised by a raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema that causes disabling headaches. The main risk factors of female sex and living with obesity have been known for some time, however the knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology is evolving. Papilloedema can impact the visual function, and the majority of people are offered acetazolamide. Those with sight threatening disease need urgent management, though there is little high quality evidence to recommend any particular surgical intervention. Headache treatment is an unmet clinical need and simple medication overuse advice has the potential to reduce the chronification of migraine-like headaches. IIH is emerging as a systemic metabolic disease distinct from people living with obesity alone. While weight loss is the main stay of disease modifying therapy this is challenging to access and many healthcare professionals that manage the condition have no formal training or accessible pathways for weight management. The aim of this "how to do it" article is to present the latest advances in knowledge of IIH that we pragmatically included in routine clinical care for people living with the condition.

### Expanding the clinical spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^5349d54e]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a disorder of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) that typically affects women of reproductive age. Although the cause of IIH is poorly understood, the condition is inextricably linked with obesity and metabolic dysregulation, evidenced by the increasing prevalence of IIH in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. The classic presentation of IIH with headache and papilledema, remains substantially unchanged from Walter Dandy's original description of the condition in 1937. However, it is increasingly recognized that IIH can manifest with other symptoms and signs. This review will explore the expanding clinical spectrum of IIH, focusing on the insights they provide regarding the pathophysiology of IIH and implications for their management.

The aim was to capture interdisciplinary expertise from a large group of clinicians, reflecting practice from across the UK and further, to inform subsequent development of a national consensus guidance for optimal management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Methods

Between September 2015 and October 2017, a specialist interest group including neurology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, nursing, primary care doctors and patient representatives met. An initial UK survey of attitudes and practice in IIH was sent to a wide group of physicians and surgeons who investigate and manage IIH regularly. A comprehensive systematic literature review was performed to assemble the foundations of the statements. An international panel along with four national professional bodies, namely the Association of British Neurologists, British Association for the Study of Headache, the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists critically reviewed the statements.

Results

Over 20 questions were constructed: one based on the diagnostic principles for optimal investigation of papilloedema and 21 for the management of IIH. Three main principles were identified: (1) to treat the underlying disease; (2) to protect the vision; and (3) to minimise the headache morbidity. Statements presented provide insight to uncertainties in IIH where research opportunities exist.

Conclusions

In collaboration with many different specialists, professions and patient representatives, we have developed guidance statements for the investigation and management of adult IIH.

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^b4543e8b]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure. The underlying pathophysiology is mostly unknown and effective treatment is an unmet clinical need in this disease. This review evaluates key emerging themes regarding disease characteristics, mechanisms contributing to raised intracranial pressure and advances in potential therapeutic targets.

Findings

IIH is becoming more common, with the incidence rising in parallel with the global obesity epidemic. Current medical management remains centred around weight management, which is challenging. Metabolic investigations of patients have identified specific androgen profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggest an endocrine dysfunction impacting CSF secretion in IIH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) have been found to play a role in CSF dynamics in IIH and have formed the basis of the first clinical trials looking at new treatments.

Conclusions

Identification of novel molecular targets thought to underlie IIH pathology is now being translated to clinical trials.

IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION WITHOUT PAPILLEDEMA

A further enigma within the IIH spectrum is IIHWOP, a condition of chronic refractory headaches attributed to raised ICP in the absence of papilledema. It is unclear if IIHWOP is a distinct clinical syndrome or a variant of IIH, where ICP is not sufficiently elevated to develop papilledema or patients have a higher ICP threshold for developing papilledema. Although published diagnostic criteria exist (Table 1), the frequency of IIHWOP among patients with chronic refractory headache varies considerably (2.5–86%) and is a reflection of the condition's diagnostic uncertainty. There is debate regarding the optimal cut-off for CSF opening pressure in order to diagnose IIHWOP, especially because of the technical limitations of lumbar puncture and the fluctuant nature of CSF pressure. Alternative noninvasive methods of measuring ICP include sonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter, and optical coherence tomography to assess spontaneous retinal venous pulsations. These options, though advancing, are not yet deployable as a replacement for conventional methods because of poor accuracy and high intra-observer and interobserver variability. The identification of RAD-IH on neuroimaging have helped to improve the diagnosis of IIHWOP and distinguish the condition from chronic daily headache or migraine headache with an incidentally raised CSF opening pressure.

Accurate diagnosis of IIHWOP remains challenging but has implications for management. Missed diagnoses of IIHWOP may leave patients with significant headache morbidity. Although there is no consensus for the management of IIHWOP, several case series have described resolution or improvement of symptoms with appropriate control of CSF pressures. Surgical CSF diversion procedures are known to be effective when managing symptoms of medically refractive IIH. However, lack of papilledema and long-standing symptoms have been identified as risk factors for treatment failure. There is an opportunity to explore whether other treatments for IIH, such as weight reduction, and treatments under investigation, such glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, may also be applied to the management of IIHWOP.

A comprehensive review of the primary literature was performed from 1990 to 2016 utilizing keywords idiopathic intracranial hypertension, pseudotumor cerebri, benign intracranial hypertension, spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak, and encephalocele. Articles were included at the discretion of the authors based on novel and/or historical contributions to the literature.

Results

The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is increasing along with the obesity epidemic. Undiagnosed patients may present to otolaryngologists with pulsatile tinnitus, dizziness, sleep apnea, and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Although diagnosis is predicated upon imaging findings and lumbar puncture, radiographic signs including empty sella, optic nerve dilation, and globe flattening may suggest the diagnosis. The most effective intervention is weight loss combined with acetazolamide. Surgery is reserved for severe or refractory symptoms and can be highly morbid. Otolaryngologists are increasingly responsible for managing a number of secondary disorders including cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and otorrhea. Failure to manage intracranial hypertension may lead to adverse surgical outcomes.

Conclusions

The knowledge base for idiopathic intracranial hypertension has greatly expanded over the past 25 years. This disease is associated with a number of conditions directly relevant to otolaryngologists. A keen understanding of this disorder and its management may optimize outcomes in a growing number of patients. Laryngoscope, 128:248–256, 2018.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pregnancy: practical advice [^61ed1b27]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterised by raised intracranial pressure that frequently causes chronic headaches and visual loss. It predominately affects women of reproductive age with obesity. Its exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully established. IIH is associated with central adiposityand recent weight gainand IIH adipocytes appear transcriptionally and metabolically primed towards lipogenesis and adipose accumulation. Other features of metabolic dysregulation in IIH include a doubled risk of cardiovascular disease, androgen excess, and insulin resistance. The document 'IIH: the international consensus guideline' is a useful source of information for its management.

Reproductive health in patients with IIH can be complex and there is currently limited guidance to support clinical care. We aim to provide practical guidance for managing women with IIH when approaching and during pregnancy. We discuss its medical and surgical management in relation to pregnancy and suggest limits on gestational weight gain.

### Headache arising from idiopathic changes in CSF pressure [^baee472f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

New onset of sudden or progressive headache can have various causes, including disorders of intracranial pressure (ICP). Headache is the most common-and often the presenting-symptom of both intracranial hypertension and intracranial hypotension syndromes, which can be symptomatic or idiopathic. Despite the widespread availability of diagnostic tests, including ocular ophthalmoscopy, neuroimaging, and measurement of CSF pressure, delays in diagnosis or misdiagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous intracranial hypotension remain common. If left untreated, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous intracranial hypotension produce highly disabling headaches, and threaten vision, hearing, and in rare cases, brain function and life. To improve the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous intracranial hypotension, changes in the overall diagnostic strategy for headaches will be necessary in most care centres. Improved understanding of CSF physiology and the mechanisms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous intracranial hypotension will guide the development of new treatments.

Closing statement

In collaboration with many different experienced clinicians, professions and patient representatives, we have developed guidance statements for the investigation and management of adult IIH. We recognise that we were limited by the lack of high-quality evidence for the majority of the statements made and that a consensus-based approach could give authority to singular opinion. With a view to mitigate this, we have sought international expert review (GTL, RHJ and KD) and review by professional bodies (ABN, BASH, RCOphth and SBNS). Following review, a few points were upheld by the SIG such as the definition of typical IIH being diagnosed as obese and not just overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m²), which differs from current published diagnostic criteria. As this document is aimed at a wide audience including non-IIH specialist, we wished to create criteria whereby the majority of patients with IIH would be correctly diagnosed. Hence, we needed to emphasise those patients in whom uncertainty could exist and referral to an experienced clinician maybe required. It was also highlighted that compared with our European and North American colleagues, there are few centres in the UK that perform ONSF for IIH.

These statements are not mandatory recommendations but are intended to be used as a guide for doctors who investigate and treat IIH. Despite the limitations of consensus-based methods, these statements reflect an up-to-date consensus to guide the clinician and serve our patients. Quality prospective research is required for all areas of uncertainties highlighted in this document to improve clinical outcomes for our patients with IIH.

### The expanding spectrum of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^ba0ce036]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Once considered a rare and often difficult diagnosis in the era predating routine MRI, idiopathic intracranial hypertension has become an everyday concern in ophthalmology and neurology clinics where, especially in the latter, essentially every young overweight woman with headaches is initially presumed to have IIH. Has the diagnosis of IIH become too easy, and are we over-diagnosing IIH in this period of an accelerating obesity crisis? Or are we actually missing cases of IIH because they do not fit the classic clinical profile? We think it is both: at the same time IIH is being diagnosed in excess in obese women without papilledema, often resulting in unnecessary procedures, inappropriate treatment and even iatrogenic complications, the spectrum of this disorder is expanding to include a broad array of clinical presentations that involve multiple specialists beyond just the ophthalmologist and neurologist.

Current management

The primary goal of treatment of IIH is to prevent visual loss and decrease headache and other symptoms associated with intracranial hypertension. Routine follow-up by neuroophthalmologist or ophthalmologist is very essential for reassessing visual status and degree of papilledema. Weight reduction counseling and medical management are generally sufficient in most patients. Surgery is required only in patients who have severe visual loss, progressive visual loss, or intractable headache despite aggressive medical management. Aggressive weight reduction is necessary in obese patients. Gastric bypass surgery has been demonstrated to improve visual outcomes and reduce ICP in IIH cases with morbid obesity.

Although there are many options for the treatment of IIH, the most recent Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management for IIH.

Pharmacotherapy

To date, acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials for their treatment efficacy in adults with IIH. The efficacy of other medications is only supported by case reports or case series. For example, there was a case series reporting the efficacy of combination of acetazolamide and furosemide in eight children in 1994. Corticosteroid was reported to be effective in the short-term in patients who presented with severe papilledema and severe visual loss. However, steroid withdrawal and its side effect on weight gain are precipitating factors for worsening IIH in long-term use. A summary of the trials of acetazolamide and topiramate in treatment of IIH in adults are discussed in the following sections.

### Advances in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^6a72052c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterised by an elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) with no identifiable cause. There is a rising incidence in this disease, and it appears that the incidence is related to country specific prevalence of obesity. It typically affects women of working age and headache is the predominant morbidity in over 90%. Headache is also the key factor driving reduced quality of life in IIH.

Previous characterisation of the typical phenotype of a raised ICP headache was of a nonspecific headache that is worse on waking. The features of IIH-related headache vary substantially and in the context of the recent clinical studies that have characterised them (Table 1), migraine is now the predominant phenotype. Our understanding has changed and, indeed, the international criteria have been modified in which ICP reduction is no longer a requirement as a diagnostic criterion of headache attributable to IIH. Caution does need to be applied before rapid conclusions are drawn as to the relationship between ICP and headache in the context of this rare disease where less than 200 patients have been reported on, in randomised controlled trials.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^862ce68a]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) — risk, symptoms, evaluation, and vigilance in youth with obesity: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (previously known as pseudotumor cerebri) is a neurologic condition with serious long-term morbidity. It occurs most often in females of childbearing age, and obesity is a well-established risk factor. In a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the incidence of IIH among adult females aged 15 to 44 years with obesity was 3.5-fold higher than that of all females in that age group. Typical symptoms are persistent headaches, pulsatile synchronous tinnitus, and visual changes or loss, although the history can be variable. Physical examination includes a fundoscopy for papilledema and a thorough neurologic evaluation for cranial nerve deficits such as sixth nerve palsy. The serious sequelae for IIH is vision loss. Thus, a review of system should be obtained to evaluate any child with obesity who has significant or progressive headaches. There should also be a high index of suspicion for IIH with new-onset headaches and significant weight gain (5% to 15% of body weight), particularly when it occurs in the prior 12 to 18 months. Initial evaluation for IIH involves conducting comprehensive evaluation by the neurologist and ophthalmologist or at an integrated IIH clinic. Consensus recommendation: Maintain a high index of suspicion for IIH with new-onset or progressive headaches in the context of significant weight gain, especially for females.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension; research progress and emerging themes [^e4f5785c]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition characterised by increased intracranial pressure of unknown cause predominantly seen in obese women of childbearing age and associated with a history of recent weight gain. The aetiology is poorly understood and there are no evidence-based guidelines on the management of the disease. We aim to provide a review of the recent literature outlining the latest advances in this field over the past few years. Areas of emerging interest related to the pathophysiology of IIH will be discussed, such as the role of obesity, adipose tissue and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. We consider the latest research on the role of venous sinus stenosis in IIH and ex vivo advances into cerebrospinal fluid drainage via the arachnoid granulation tissue. The latest techniques for optic nerve head evaluation and the role of optical coherence tomography will be summarised. Finally, we will discuss recent advances in the management of IIH, including weight loss, and medical and surgical treatment strategies.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^445561e6]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Current treatment options for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are limited by efficacy, safety, and sustainability concerns. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), known for promoting weight loss and metabolic regulation, may offer a novel therapeutic approach.

Objective

To assess whether GLP-1 RA therapy is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with IIH compared with conventional therapies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network between 2005 and 2024, with a follow-up duration of 1 year. Electronic health records from 67 health care organizations across the United States were examined. Participants were patients 18 years and older who had IIH.

Exposure

Initiation of GLP-1 RA therapy within 6 months of IIH diagnosis. The control group included patients managed with conventional treatments, such as acetazolamide, topiramate, and dietary counseling, without GLP-1 RA exposure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included use of non-GLP-1 RA medication, symptoms and signs, procedures, and mortality over 1 year. Outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CI.

Results

A total of 44 373 patients with IIH were identified. Before propensity score matching, the cohort included 603 GLP-1 RA users and 43 770 nonusers. The GLP-1 RA group was older (mean [SD] age, 43.2 [13.0] vs 35.5 [14.3] years; P < .001) with fewer male patients (n = 60 [10.0%] vs n = 5879 [13.5%]; P = 0.01) and a similar number of female patients (n = 522 [86.6%] vs n = 36 796 [84.3%]; P = 0.13). After matching, 555 GLP-1 RAs users were compared with 555 nonusers. GLP-1 RA use was associated with lower medication use (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.46–0.61; P < .001) and reduced headaches (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35–0.58; P < .001), visual disturbances or blindness (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–0.88; P = 0.007), and papilledema (RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.10–0.34; P < .001). Procedures (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30–0.63; P < .001) and mortality (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18–0.73; P = 0.003) were lower in the GLP-1 RA group, but mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) did not differ at follow-up (40.6 [9.2] vs 39.5 [8.7]; P = 0.10). Sensitivity analysis stratified by BMI (≥ 40 vs < 40) showed similar associations. Bariatric surgery was associated with greater weight loss, but GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with better outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

GLP-1 RA therapy in IIH is associated with significant reductions in medication use, symptoms/signs, and procedural interventions, suggesting its potential as a management strategy. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a step change in understanding the disease mechanisms [^05a2fa60]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The understanding of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has evolved over the past few years. Previously, IIH was considered a disease exclusively affecting the neuro-ophthalmic axis, characterized by raised intracranial pressure, headache and papilloedema, and resulting in the risk of severe and permanent visual loss and life-changing disabling headaches. Recent advances have begun to redefine IIH as a probable metabolic disease involving a range of systemic manifestations. More than 95% of individuals affected by the disease are women of reproductive age with obesity. The incidence is rapidly rising and parallels the escalating worldwide obesity rates. Contemporary insights identify associations with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and a twofold increased risk of cardiovascular disease in excess of that driven by obesity alone. Adipose distribution in people with IIH, like that in other metabolic diseases, is preferentially centripetal and is associated with changes in intracranial pressure. Evidence now demonstrates adipose tissue dysfunction in people with IIH, involving transcriptional and metabolic priming for lipogenesis and weight gain. Hormonal perturbations are also observed, including a unique phenotype of androgen excess that promotes cerebrospinal fluid secretion. Knowledge of these additional disease features is driving research into novel therapeutic targets and altering the approach to multidisciplinary care.

1 Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a neurological disorder characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) manifesting with refractory headache (94%), pulsatile tinnitus (58%), papilledema, progressive visual field cut (VFC) and acuity impairment (68%).

The pathophysiology of IIH is complex, and despite being believed to be primarily associated with impaired cerebrospinal fluid drainage and increased venous pressure, may encompass other factors including hormonal changes i.e. altered testosterone or androsterone levels.

IIH mainly affects overweight women in reproductive life.

Although IIH is considered an idiopathic condition without a known cause, recurrent findings such as chronic stenosis or thrombosis of intracranial (e.g. the transverse‐sigmoid sinuses) and extracranial venous structures (e.g. the jugular veins) are often identifiable.

Historically speaking, the Dandy criteria represented the gold standard for diagnosing and were based on a triad including specific typical neuroradiological signs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressures > 250 mmHg, and exclusion of other potential causes. Since 2024, the Friedman criteria were introduced to refine the diagnosis of IIH, leading to a quintad of the former criteria: symptoms of increased ICP; papilledema; CSF pressure > 250 mmHg; normal neuroimaging; exclusion of secondary causes.

First line management is based on weight reduction for mild cases, whereas severe conditions presenting with significant headaches and visual impairment may require a pharmacological approach with diuretic drugs and steroids. Refractory cases or those presenting with rapid visual deterioration may require surgical interventions of CSF diversion such as ventriculo‐peritoneal shunt (VPS) or lumbo‐peritoneal shunt (LPS) and in some selected cases an optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF).

The concomitant presence of venous sinus stenosis can be managed with angiographic pressure gradient measurements and eventual stenting.

Management of IIH during pregnancy is a unique challenge due to the lack of a protocol and the necessity of a tailored approach. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of drugs and surgical maneuvers need to be carefully considered to preserve both fetal and mother's health.

This paper is a systematic review of the literature focusing on this topic, which aims to collect and discuss all the retrievable findings in order to illustrate the commonly agreed treatment strategies for IIH during pregnancy.

### Weight management interventions for adults with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and practice recommendations [^a9c32995]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Sustained long-term weight loss should be considered as a tool to improve the health and quality of life of patients with IIH. Patients with IIH with overweight or obesity should be counseled sensitively about the role of obesity and weight management in IIH. They should have their weight measured and BMI calculated to assess the weight management options and monitor the intervention efficacy. Although there are no RCTs that evaluated the measurement of overweight and obesity compared with not measuring these outcomes, the panel agreed that this aspect of IIH patient care was essential.

The degree of weight loss required for IIH symptom improvement was less clear as studies reported the amount of weight lost with a variety of outcome measures. There were no studies evaluating the time where the minimum amount of weight lost was correlated with the point of disease remission. Level 2+ evidence demonstrated that a reduction of weight between 15% and 24% was required to achieve disease remission. In the VLED cross-over study, 15% of body weight loss was correlated with reduction in ICP, resolution of papilledema, and favorable headache outcomes, and the IIHWT disease remission was defined as ICP to return to normal levels at 25 cm H₂O. It is therefore important to acknowledge that while some lifestyle interventions delivered in the community setting may be effective for weight loss, they may not deliver the magnitude of weight loss required to induce remission of IIH. The panel considered this evidence and recommended the target weight loss should be 15% for IIH disease remission. However, the panel acknowledged that this goal is unlikely to be achieved through a lifestyle intervention alone, and a realistic goal may be 5%–10% weight loss, which may still offer some improvement in IIH symptoms.

Introduction

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) of unknown cause, when all other causes of raised ICP have been excluded. IIH causes significant morbidity, including permanent visual loss in up to 25% of caseswith reports of 1–2% of new cases being registered blind per yearand disabling headache in the majority. With peak presentation being between ages 20 and 40 years; an overwhelming female predominance and a strong association with obesity; IIH, is well known as a disorder that affects overweight women of reproductive age.

There are a number of indicators that incidence and prevalence of IIH are rising, likely related to increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide; WHO indicates a twofold increase in the UK between 1997 and 2002 and a threefold increase in the USA between 1990 and 2006. A recent epidemiology study reported an incidence of IIH occurring in 28/100 000/year, which is the highest reported rate in the literature so far. In the USA, there was a 320% increase in new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt procedures for IIH between 1998 and 2002. IIH is an expensive condition for society and the individual: in the USA, total economic costs are estimated at greater than US$444 million per annum, and 57% of patients report significant lost earnings with 31% changing occupation.

The aetiology and pathology are not fully established, and the disorder has become the subject of increasing scientific scrutiny over the last decade. With no single cause implicated, uncertainties surround the best therapeutics which have led to differing management strategies. Both adults and children can be affected by IIH, however, paediatric IIH may have different pathogenesis and clinical courseand is not discussed in this article. In this review, we review adult onset IIH with focus on the latest developments in both the pathogenic mechanisms and management.
