## Question

On ultrasound, what could a dilated, non-collapsing inferior vena cava with a blurry area be indicative of?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a dilated, non-collapsing inferior vena cava (IVC) on ultrasound with a described "blurry area" could indicate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a large, poorly collapsible IVC implies about right atrial pressure and venous congestion. Then, I should verify what a "blurry" echogenic appearance in the IVC lumen most likely represents and how to differentiate artifact from thrombus. Next, I will synthesize these findings into a pathophysiologic framework to prioritize the differential diagnosis. Finally, I should confirm technical pitfalls, prognostic implications, and immediate confirmatory tests that would refine management and risk assessment [^114Y2FrU] [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the hemodynamic meaning of a dilated, non-collapsing IVC. A large IVC diameter with less than 50% inspiratory collapse generally reflects elevated right atrial pressure and venous congestion rather than intravascular volume responsiveness, and in heart failure cohorts, larger diameters and reduced collapsibility track with higher natriuretic peptide levels and decompensation severity, as well as worse outcomes when dilation is marked and collapse is absent [^114Y2FrU] [^114fzyps] [^115s7iHC]. I should double-check the commonly used thresholds; I initially thought a larger cutoff might be standard, but the simplified approach uses a diameter around 2.1 cm with reduced collapse to infer high right atrial pressure, though correlation is imperfect and must be contextualized clinically [^114Y2FrU].

> Now, about the "blurry area" noted within the IVC lumen, wait, let me verify what that could represent on focused ultrasound. The most likely benign explanation is spontaneous echo contrast, sometimes described as smoke-like, swirling, hazy echogenicity from low-velocity flow and red cell aggregation in venous stasis, which can mimic thrombus but is non-occlusive and changes with flow dynamics on cine review [^notfound]. I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions; this smoke-like artifact signals severe low-flow conditions and venous stasis, which fits with a distended, non-collapsing IVC and elevated right-sided filling pressures [^112y8vSj].

> Hold on, I should also consider the alternative: a true intraluminal thrombus as a discrete filling defect. Bland thrombus typically appears as echogenic material adherent to the wall without internal vascularity, whereas tumor thrombus often expands the lumen, enhances on cross-sectional imaging, and is contiguous with an upstream mass such as renal cell carcinoma; distinguishing these requires integration with Doppler, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, and clinical context [^111HNEgC] [^117SyY6z]. Let me reconsider: if the "blurry area" is fixed, non-swirling, and persists across views, the pretest probability of a true thrombus rises, especially in hypercoagulable states or with malignancy, and I should confirm with dedicated venous phase imaging [^111HNEgC].

> I will now synthesize the combined findings. A dilated, non-collapsing IVC indicates elevated right-sided pressures; the smoke-like appearance suggests profound low-velocity venous stasis; together, this produces a triad of venous congestion, stasis, and a predisposition to thrombogenesis, which is clinically coherent with advanced right heart dysfunction or obstructive venous pathology [^114Y2FrU] [^112y8vSj] [^111HNEgC]. But wait, what if the "blurry" echogenicity actually represents a small mural thrombus superimposed on stasis? That would not contradict the elevated pressure state but would add an immediate need to confirm extent and embolic risk [^111HNEgC].

> Next, let me consider the most likely etiologies. Severe right-sided heart failure with systemic congestion, significant tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension commonly produce IVC dilation and blunted collapsibility; in decompensated heart failure cohorts, mean IVC diameters exceed those in compensated states and correlate with biochemical congestion and clinical outcomes [^114Y2FrU]. I should also confirm that in acutely dyspneic patients, reduced respiratory variation of the IVC can help identify congestive heart failure, although it is not a stand-alone test and must be integrated with the rest of the exam and lung ultrasound [^114fzyps]. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation can further dampen caval variability and is associated with lower collapsibility in both IVC and subclavian measurements, reinforcing the right-sided pathology signal here [^115vTmpH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pericardial disease; cardiac tamponade can also present with a plethoric, non-collapsing IVC, but I should verify for more specific echocardiographic and hemodynamic signs such as right atrial late-diastolic or right ventricular early-diastolic collapse, exaggerated respiratory inflow variation, pulsus paradoxus, and low-output physiology before labeling tamponade physiology in this scenario [^116EiHei]. I need to ensure I do not conflate central venous pressure surrogates with global volume status or fluid responsiveness; elevated CVP and a plethoric IVC often reflect pressure-related disorders and venous congestion rather than intravascular volume expansion per se, warranting careful integration with right heart performance and organ congestion markers [^115PCCjW] [^114VNKJG].

> I will now examine the possibility of proximal caval obstruction. Proximal IVC thrombosis or external compression can cause upstream dilation and marked flow stasis with or without development of collaterals; if suspected, I should confirm with Doppler interrogation and contrast-enhanced venography by CT or MRI to define extent, chronicity, and to exclude tumor thrombus, given that management and prognosis differ substantially between bland and tumor thrombus [^111HNEgC]. Let me first confirm that the ultrasound appearance is not entirely explained by benign spontaneous echo contrast before pursuing anticoagulation or intervention, as misclassification can occur on focused exams and cross-sectional imaging may be decisive here [^112y8vSj].

> Before I finalize, I should double-check technical factors and pitfalls in IVC assessment. Interrater reliability is acceptable when standardized windows and caliper techniques are used, with the anterior midaxillary longitudinal view via the hepatic window performing well, and reasonable agreement across M-mode and B-mode diameter methods when operators are trained, although visual estimation is less reliable [^117Cgph3] [^111MaAW2]. Patient positioning exerts minimal effect on absolute diameters between supine and semi-upright, but collapsibility agreement can be lower, so I need to document position and breathing conditions [^113Htqb6]. Moreover, the right lateral coronal view tends to underestimate collapsibility versus the standard subcostal sagittal view because the IVC collapses elliptically, so discordance between views should prompt caution in interpretation and, if possible, reliance on the standard subcostal view for decision-making [^117QdcJa].

> Let me think about immediate next steps to resolve ambiguity and guide care. I should confirm right heart structure and function including right ventricular size and systolic function, tricuspid regurgitation severity, and estimate pulmonary pressures, integrate with natriuretic peptides and lung ultrasound for congestion, and consider subclavian vein collapsibility if the IVC window is limited since SCV collapsibility correlates with IVC indices in acute heart failure cohorts and offers an accessible alternative in some patients [^114Y2FrU] [^115vTmpH]. If the intraluminal finding remains suspicious for thrombus rather than smoke, prompt venous-phase CT or MR venography, and targeted Doppler assessment, are warranted to determine bland versus tumor thrombus and plan anticoagulation or oncologic-surgical evaluation accordingly [^111HNEgC] [^112y8vSj].

> Finally, I should review prognosis and follow-up implications. A dilated IVC that fails to collapse is independently associated with worse survival even after adjustment for comorbidities and biventricular function, underscoring the importance of aggressively managing venous congestion and right-sided pressures when feasible [^115s7iHC]. In heart failure populations, larger IVC size and lower collapsibility at or after discharge identify patients at higher risk of rehospitalization, so serial bedside assessment can help risk stratify and tailor follow-up intensity and decongestive therapy, while recognizing that IVC indices complement, rather than duplicate, hemodynamic pressures such as right atrial pressure [^116jYRgt] [^114BqVbz] [^113ygtMB].

---

A dilated IVC that does not collapse on ultrasound [^115s7iHC] most commonly indicates **elevated right atrial pressure** [^114Y2FrU] and **right-sided heart failure** [^114fzyps]. The "blurry thing" is often a thrombus or mass, suggesting **IVC thrombosis or tumor thrombus** [^112y8vSj] [^111HNEgC]. Other causes include pericardial tamponade [^116EiHei], pulmonary embolism, or volume overload [^114BqVbz]; confirm with echocardiography, CT/MRI, and Doppler, and manage the underlying cause [^111HNEgC].

---

## Clinical significance of a dilated, non-collapsing IVC

A dilated IVC with reduced collapsibility typically reflects **elevated right atrial pressure (RAP) and central venous pressure (CVP)** and is commonly seen in:

- **Right-sided heart failure**: Elevated RAP/CVP from right ventricular dysfunction or tricuspid regurgitation [^114Y2FrU] [^114fzyps] [^114BqVbz].

- **Pericardial tamponade**: Pericardial fluid elevates intrapericardial pressure, reducing venous return and increasing RAP [^116EiHei].

- **Pulmonary embolism**: Acute RV pressure overload elevates RAP/CVP.

- **Volume overload**: Hypervolemia or aggressive fluid resuscitation elevates CVP [^116jYRgt].

---

## Interpretation of the "blurry thing" on ultrasound

The "blurry thing" likely represents an **intraluminal structure**, such as:

- **IVC thrombus**: Echogenic material within the IVC, often from DVT extension or hypercoagulable states [^112y8vSj].

- **Tumor thrombus**: Malignant extension into the IVC, commonly from renal cell carcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma [^111HNEgC] [^117SyY6z].

- **Artifact**: Reverberation or motion artifacts can mimic intraluminal structures [^112y8vSj].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The combination of a **dilated, non-collapsing IVC** and an intraluminal structure suggests:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Ultrasound findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Right-sided heart failure | - Elevated RAP <br/> - Peripheral edema <br/> - Jugular venous distension | - Dilated IVC <br/> - Reduced collapsibility <br/> - Possible echogenic thrombus |
| Pericardial tamponade | - Hypotension <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Elevated JVP | - Dilated IVC <br/> - Reduced collapsibility <br/> - Pericardial effusion [^116EiHei] |
| Pulmonary embolism | - Acute dyspnea <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Hypoxia | - Dilated IVC <br/> - Reduced collapsibility <br/> - Possible thrombus |
| IVC thrombosis | - Lower extremity edema <br/> - Pain <br/> - Hypercoagulable state | - Echogenic intraluminal thrombus <br/> - Dilated IVC <br/> - Reduced collapsibility [^112y8vSj] |
| Tumor thrombus | - Known malignancy <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Abdominal mass | - Echogenic intraluminal mass <br/> - Dilated IVC <br/> - Reduced collapsibility [^111HNEgC] [^117SyY6z] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

A dilated, non-collapsing IVC with an intraluminal structure indicates **significant hemodynamic compromise** and requires prompt evaluation and management:

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Use echocardiography, CT, or MRI to characterize the intraluminal structure and assess hemodynamics [^111HNEgC].

- **Treat underlying cause**: Manage heart failure, tamponade, pulmonary embolism, or malignancy as indicated.

- **Anticoagulation**: Initiate if thrombus is confirmed, unless contraindicated [^112y8vSj].

- **Surgical or interventional procedures**: Consider thrombectomy, tumor resection, or IVC filter placement when appropriate [^111HNEgC].

---

## Limitations and considerations

IVC ultrasound is limited by **operator dependency**, with accuracy dependent on skill and experience [^117Cgph3] [^111MaAW2]. Patient factors, such as **obesity, bowel gas, and positioning**, can degrade image quality [^113Htqb6] [^117QdcJa]. Physiological variability from **respiratory effort, intrathoracic pressure, and the cardiac cycle** also affects IVC measurements [^11774Bnf] [^116a2c8m].

---

A dilated, non-collapsing IVC with a "blurry thing" on ultrasound most often reflects elevated RAP/CVP [^114Y2FrU] from right-sided heart failure, tamponade [^116EiHei], pulmonary embolism, or volume overload, with the intraluminal structure likely being thrombus [^112y8vSj] or tumor thrombus [^111HNEgC]. Prompt **imaging confirmation** and targeted management are essential.

### The utility of inferior vena cava diameter and the degree of inspiratory collapse in patients with systolic heart failure [^114Y2FrU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Both inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and the degree of inspiratory collapse are used in the estimation of right atrial pressure.

- **Aim**: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of IVC diameter using echocardiography as a marker of volume overload and the relationship between these parameters and N-terminal pro-B natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with systolic heart failure (HF).

- **Methods**: We included 136 consecutive patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction, < 50%), including 80 patients with acutely decompensated HF and 56 patients with compensated HF, as well as 50 subjects without a diagnosis of HF. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography to assess both their IVC diameters and the degree of inspiratory collapse (≥ 50%, < 50%, and no change [absence] groups); NT-proBNP levels were measured, and these data were compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: Inferior vena cava diameter and NT-proBNP were significantly higher among the patients with HF than among the control subjects (21.7 ± 2.6 vs. 14.5 ± 1.6 mm, P < .001 and 4789 [330–35000] vs. 171 [21–476], P < .001). The mean IVC diameter was higher among the patients with decompensated HF than among the patients with compensated HF (23.2 ± 2.1 vs. 19.7 ± 1.9 mm, P < .001). The values of NT-proBNP were associated with different collapsibility of IVC subgroups among HF patients. The NT-proBNP levels were 2760 (330–27336), 5400 (665–27210), and 16806 (1786–35000) regarding the collapsibility of the IVC subgroups: greater than or equal to 50%, less than 50%, and absent.

### Identification of congestive heart failure via respiratory variation of inferior vena cava diameter [^114fzyps]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnosis of volume overload in patients with suspected congestive heart failure (CHF) is necessary for the timely administration of therapeutic agents. We sought to use the measurement of respiratory variation of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter as a diagnostic tool for the identification of CHF in patients presenting with acute dyspnea.

- **Methods**: The IVC was measured sonographically during a complete respiratory cycle of 46 patients meeting study criteria. The percentage of respiratory variation of IVC diameter was compared to the diagnosis of CHF or an alternative diagnosis.

- **Results**: Respiratory variation of the IVC was smaller in patients with CHF (9.6%) than without CHF (46%) and showed good diagnostic accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an optimum cutoff of 15% variation or less of IVC diameter with 92% sensitivity and 84% specificity for the diagnosis of CHF.

- **Conclusion**: Inferior vena cava ultrasound is a rapid, reliable means for the identification of CHF in the acutely dyspneic patient.

- **Teaching points**:
	- IVC anomalies result from abnormal persistence or regression of embryological veins. Pulmonary embolism following routine infrarenal IVC filter placement should raise suspicion of a duplicated IVC. An absent or interrupted IVC should be suspected in young patients with iliofemoral DVT. IVC variants and dilated collateral veins can be mistaken for malignancy. Tumor thrombus is differentiated from bland thrombus by filling defect enhancement, vessel lumen expansion, and contiguity with the mass. The extent of tumor thrombus is a key determinant of prognosis and surgical management, particularly in renal cell carcinoma.

### Tamponade: Hemodynamic and echocardiographic diagnosis [^116EiHei]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency that can be readily reversed with timely recognition and appropriate intervention. The clinical diagnosis of cardiac tamponade requires synthesis of a constellation of otherwise nonspecific features based on an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological characteristics. Although echocardiographic examination is a central component of diagnosis, it alone is insufficient to establish the physiological diagnosis of hemodynamically significant cardiac tamponade. The hemodynamic diagnosis of cardiac tamponade requires clinical evidence of low cardiac output and stroke volume in the setting of elevated cardiac filling pressures, with evidence of increased sympathetic tone (e.g. tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction), and exclusion of other causes of shock as the primary problem (particularly cardiogenic shock).

The hemodynamic features of tamponade are revealed by considering the effects of pericardial constraint. Pulsus paradoxus and loss of the normal "y" descent of a jugular venous pressure waveform may be appreciated on clinical examination. When a pulmonary artery catheter is placed, equalization of diastolic pressures across all chambers is observed. Echocardiographic examination confirms the size, location, and other characteristics of the causal pericardial collection. Several echocardiographic features support the hemodynamic diagnosis of tamponade, including early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle, late diastolic collapse of the right atrium, and respiratory variation in mitral valve inflow, akin to pulsus paradoxus.

### Comparison of subclavian vein to inferior vena cava collapsibility by ultrasound in acute heart failure: A pilot study [^115vTmpH]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Management of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) requires accurate assessment of relative intravascular volume, which may be technically challenging. Inferior vena cava (IVC) collapsibility with respiration reflects intravascular volume and right atrial pressure (RAP). Subclavian vein (SCV) collapsibility may provide an alternative.

- **Hypothesis**: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between SCV collapsibility index (CI) and IVC CI in ADHF.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective study of non-ventilated patients with ADHF who had paired IVC and SCV ultrasound assessments. As SCV CI is highly position-dependent, measurements were performed supine at 30–45°.

- **Results**: Thirty-three patients were included with 36 encounters. The sample size was adequately powered for receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. SCV CI correlated with IVC CI during relaxed breathing (R = .65, n = 36, p < .001) and predicted intravascular volume with comparable accuracy. SCV CI > 33% corresponded to IVC CI > 50% suggesting hypervolemia (sensitivity/specificity: 72%) and hypovolemia (sensitivity/specificity: 78%), respectively. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) compared to less than moderate TR was associated with lower SCV CI (medians: 12.4% vs. 25.3%, p = .022) and IVC CI (medians: 9.6% vs. 35.6%, p = .0012). SCV CI and IVC CI were not significantly different among chronic kidney disease stages.

- **Conclusion**: In non-ventilated ADHF, SCV CI at 30–45° correlates with paired IVC CI and may provide an alternative to IVC CI for assessment of relative intravascular volume.

### Handcarried ultrasound measurement of the inferior vena cava for assessment of intravascular volume status in the outpatient hemodialysis clinic [^1161K7JF]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Accurate intravascular volume assessment is critical in the treatment of patients who receive chronic hemodialysis (HD) therapy. While clinically assessed dry weight is a poor surrogate of intravascular volume, ultrasound assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is an effective tool for volume management. This study sought to determine the feasibility of using operators with limited ultrasound experience to assess IVC dimensions using hand-carried ultrasounds (HCU) in the outpatient clinical setting.

The IVC was assessed in 89 consecutive patients at two outpatient clinics before and after HD. Intradialytic IVC was recorded during episodes of hypotension, chest pain, or cramping. High-quality IVC images were obtained in 79 of 89 patients. Despite 89% of patients presenting at or above dry weight, 39% were hypovolemic by HCU. Of the 75% of patients who left HD at or below goal weight, 10% were still hypervolemic by HCU standards. Hypovolemic patients experienced more episodes of chest pain and cramping (33% versus 14%, P = 0.06) and more episodes of hypotension (22% versus 3%, P = 0.02).

The clinic with a higher prevalence of predialysis hypovolemia had significantly more intradialytic adverse events (58% versus 27%, P = 0.01). HCU measurement of the IVC is a feasible option for rapid assessment of intravascular volume status in an outpatient dialysis setting by operators with limited formal training in echocardiography. There is a poor relationship between dry weight goals and IVC collapsibility. Practice variation in the maintenance of volume status is correlated with.

### The diagnostic accuracy of inferior vena cava respiratory variation in predicting volume responsiveness in patients under different breathing status following abdominal surgery [^114k9qrf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

In mechanically ventilated patients, at baseline, fluid responders exhibited a smaller inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and a larger ΔIVC and cIVC1 than non-responders. After the volume expansion of 5 ml/kg over 15 minutes, the velocity time integral (VTI), cardiac output (CO), and cardiac index (CI) significantly increased in both groups (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the fluid challenge significantly escalated IVCmax and IVCmin in group R and heart rate (HR) in group NR (P < 0.05).

- **Hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements**:
	- **Table 2**: Comparison of hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters between two groups before and after fluid challenge test in mechanically ventilated patients.
	- T1 refers to 5 minutes of stabilization after patient entering AICU under mechanical ventilation, T2 following the first fluid challenge test. IVC: inferior vena cava, IVCmax: maximum diameter of IVC, IVCmin: minimum diameter of IVC, ΔIVC: the difference between the maximum and minimum IVC diameter, cIVC1: collapsibility of IVC in mechanically ventilated patients, HR: heart rate, VTI: velocity time integral, CI: cardiac index, CVP: central venous pressure, MAP: mean arterial pressure, CO: cardiac output.
	- ✱ p < 0.05 versus group NR
	- †P < 0.05 versus before fluid challenge test

The cIVC1 and ΔIVC at baseline closely correlated with the percentage change in CO after fluid challenge (r = 0.518, P < 0.0001; r = 0.533, P < 0.001).

- **Figure 3**: Relationships of the percentage change in CO with baseline cIVC1 (A) or ΔIVC (B) in mechanically ventilated patients, and baseline cIVC2 (C) or IVCmin (D) in spontaneously breathing patients. Trend lines are presented as dotted lines. CO: cardiac output; IVC: inferior vena cava.

### The caval index: An adequate non-invasive ultrasound parameter to predict fluid responsiveness in the emergency department [^1112DHr2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

This study is the first to investigate the respiratory variation in IVC diameter, known as the caval index, in the emergency department (ED) as a parameter for fluid responsiveness using clinical definitions. We found that a caval index of 36.5% is reflected by the low positive predictive value (48%) and weak correlation between the caval index and fluid responsiveness. An explanation for the absence of a blood pressure response might be that these patients represent a group requiring more volume therapy than 500 ml. In future studies, we will investigate this issue.

- **Key messages**: This is the first study investigating the use of the caval index for assessing fluid responsiveness in the emergency department. In line with physiological expectations and previous studies, a caval index of 36.5% has a low positive predictive value for fluid responsiveness following a 500 mL fluid challenge, which might reflect the need for more aggressive fluid resuscitation.

### Demystifying volume status: An ultrasound-guided physiologic framework [^115PCCjW]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

**Key points for CVP**: CVP is influenced by nonvolume variables, physiologic conditions, and hemodynamic responses to disease states, rather than being a true reflection of whole-body volume or fluid responsiveness. A nonelevated CVP is the normal physiologic state and does not necessarily equate to a need for additional fluids. An elevated CVP may represent volume intolerance, the pathologic features listed in Table 2, or both. When the IJV and IVC findings on POCUS are discordant, careful examination for caveats or confounders should take place (Table 1).

### Comparison of subclavian vein to inferior vena cava collapsibility by ultrasound in acute heart failure: A pilot study [^112SBNdD]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

SCV CI has been studied as an alternative assessment of relative intravascular volume because IVC imaging can be technically challenging. SCV CI measured with the patient reclining at a 30° angle predicted volume responsiveness in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. Furthermore, SCV CI measured in patients reclining at 30–45° correlated well with subcostal IVC CI in patients undergoing echocardiography, in those treated in the surgical intensive care unit, and in patients hospitalized with acute and/or chronic renal failure. However, SCV CI has not previously been compared to IVC CI in patients hospitalized with acute congestive heart failure.

The purpose of this study is to compare point‐of‐care ultrasound of SCV to IVC as an assessment of relative intravascular volume in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of heart failure.

### Comparison of superior and inferior vena cava diameter variation measured with transthoracic echocardiography to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients after abdominal surgery [^111gFQw1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

The volume status of patients after major abdominal surgery constantly varies due to postoperative issues such as fluid loss or capillary leakage secondary to systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome; therefore, precise fluid responsiveness assessment is crucial for these patients. This study aims to validate the transthoracic ultrasonographic measurement of superior and inferior vena cava variation in predicting fluid responsiveness of mechanically ventilated patients post-surgery.

- **Methods**: A total of 70 patients undergoing scheduled major abdominal surgeries in the anesthesia ICU ward were included. The superior vena cava (SVC) collapsibility index (SVCCI), the inferior vena cava distensibility index (dIVC), SVC variation over the cardiac cycle (SVCV), and cardiac output (CO) were measured by transthoracic ultrasonography and recorded before and following a fluid challenge test of 5 ml/kg crystalloid within 15 minutes. Responders were defined as having a 15% or more increment in CO.

- **Results**: Thirty patients (42.9%) responded to the fluid challenge, while the remaining forty patients (57.1%) did not. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for SVCCI, dIVC, and SVCV were 0.885 (95% CI, 0.786–0.949; P < 0.0001), 0.727 (95% CI, 0.608–0.827; P < 0.001), and 0.751 (95% CI, 0.633–0.847; P < 0.0001), respectively. AUC for dIVC and AUC for SVCV were significantly lower compared to AUC for SVCCI (P < 0.05). The optimal cutoff values were 19% for SVCCI, 14% for dIVC, and 15% for SVCV. The gray zone for SVCCI was 20%-25% and included 15.7% of patients, while the gray zone for dIVC was 7%-27%.

### Respiratory changes in inferior vena cava diameter are helpful in predicting fluid responsiveness in ventilated septic patients [^112EURuv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To evaluate the extent to which respiratory changes in inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter can be used to predict fluid responsiveness, a prospective clinical study was conducted in a hospital intensive care unit.

- **Patients**: Twenty-three patients with acute circulatory failure related to sepsis and mechanically ventilated because of an acute lung injury were included in the study.

- **Measurements**: Inferior vena cava diameter (D) at end-expiration (Dmin) and at end-inspiration (Dmax) was measured by echocardiography using a subcostal approach. The distensibility index of the IVC (dIVC) was calculated as the ratio of (Dmax - Dmin) / Dmin and expressed as a percentage. The Doppler technique was applied in the pulmonary artery trunk to determine cardiac index (CI). Measurements were performed at baseline and following a 7 ml/kg volume expansion using a plasma expander. Patients were categorized into responders (increase in CI ≥ 15%) and non-responders (increase in CI < 15%).

- **Results**: Using a threshold dIVC of 18%, responders and non-responders were discriminated with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. A strong relation (r = 0.9) was observed between dIVC at baseline and the CI increase following blood volume expansion. Baseline central venous pressure did not accurately predict fluid responsiveness.

The study suggests that respiratory change in IVC diameter is an accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in septic patients.

### The diagnostic accuracy of inferior vena cava respiratory variation in predicting volume responsiveness in patients under different breathing status following abdominal surgery [^117WrXsV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

The validation of inferior vena cava (IVC) respiratory variation for predicting volume responsiveness is still under debate, especially in spontaneously breathing patients. This study aims to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of IVC variability for volume assessment in patients after abdominal surgery under either artificially or spontaneously breathing.

A total of fifty-six patients after abdominal surgeries in the anesthesia intensive care unit ward were included. All patients received ultrasonographic examinations before and following a fluid challenge of 5 ml/kg crystalloid within 15 minutes. The same measurements were performed when the patients were extubated. The IVC diameter, blood flow velocity-time integral of the left ventricular outflow tract, and cardiac output (CO) were recorded. Responders were defined as having an increment in CO of 15% or more from baseline.

- **Results**: There were 33 (58.9%) mechanically ventilated patients and 22 (39.3%) spontaneously breathing patients responding to fluid resuscitation. The area under the curve was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68–0.90) for the IVC diameter variation (cIVC1) in mechanically ventilated patients, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75–0.94) for the collapsibility of IVC (cIVC2), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73–0.93) for the minimum IVC diameter (IVCmin) in spontaneously breathing patients. The optimal cutoff values were 15.32% for cIVC1, 30.25% for cIVC2, and 1.14 cm for IVCmin. Furthermore, the gray zone for cIVC2 was 30.72 to 38.32% and included 23.2% of spontaneously breathing patients, while 17.01 to 25.93% for cIVC1.

### Inferior vena cava revisited - Real-time flow MRI of respiratory maneuvers [^11774Bnf]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Recent MRI studies of blood flow in the inferior vena cava (IVC) have resulted in findings that are inconsistent with earlier observations by invasive procedures, most likely because ECG-gated MRI techniques are unable to resolve dynamic adjustments due to respiration. The purpose of this work was to apply real-time phase-contrast MRI at a 50 ms resolution to re-evaluate IVC flow in response to normal and deep breathing, as well as breath holding and the Valsalva maneuver, in 11 young healthy subjects. Real-time flow MRI relied on highly undersampled radial gradient-echo sequences and a model-based nonlinear inverse reconstruction. A frequency analysis of the predominant pulsatility classified IVC flow in individual subjects as "cardiac", "respiratory", or "mixed" type.

- **Flow rates and velocities**: Peak flow velocities during free breathing ranged from 30 to 58 cm s⁻¹, while flow rates varied from 15 to 37 mL s⁻¹. The subject-specific IVC flow pattern persists during deep breathing, although the enhanced respiratory influence may shift subjects from "cardiac" to "mixed" or from "mixed" to "respiratory" type. Peak velocities increased relative to normal breathing but led to similar flow rates of 16 to 34 mL s⁻¹. Inspiration during deep breathing elicited brief periods of flow reversal in all subjects with mean peak velocities of -21 cm s⁻¹.

- **Breath holding and Valsalva maneuver effects**: The observation of only mildly flattened parabolic velocity distributions within the IVC indicated mostly laminar flow. Breath holding reduced blood flow velocities and rates by more than 40% on average, while Valsalva maneuvers completely abolished venous return.

### Role of the inferior vena cava collapsibility index in predicting propofol-induced hypotension in patients undergoing colonoscopy [^114SE3YK]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypotension is a common side effect of propofol induction, and when severe, it is associated with adverse outcomes. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a reliable indicator of the intravascular volume. This study investigated whether preoperative IVC ultrasound measurements could predict hypotension after propofol induction in patients undergoing colonoscopies.

- **Methods**: Sixty-two adult patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) I-II scheduled for colonoscopy after propofol induction were recruited. The ultrasound maximum IVC diameter (dIVCmax), minimum IVC diameter (dIVCmin), and collapsibility index (IVC-CI) were assessed in all patients before propofol induction. Mean blood pressure (MBP) was recorded before induction. Propofol was injected intravenously after ultrasound measurements. MBP was recorded 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after propofol induction. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of IVC-CI was compared with that of patients who developed hypotension after propofol induction.

- **Results**: Sixty-two patients completed the study, and their data were considered for statistical analysis. After induction, 30 patients developed hypotension. The area under the curve (95% confidence interval) was 0.72 (0.595 to 0.849) for IVC-CI. The optimal IVC-CI cutoff value was 38.25%, with a sensitivity of 56.7% and specificity of 71.9%. IVC-CI before induction strongly correlated with the maximum percentage of MBP drop after propofol induction (regression coefficient = 0.33, P = 0.008).

- **Conclusion**: Pre-induction IVC ultrasound measurements can help predict the likelihood of propofol-induced hypotension in patients undergoing colonoscopy.

### The inferior vena cava: Anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^114H9xmY]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

A slit-like or flattened inferior vena cava (IVC) may be defined as an IVC with an anteroposterior diameter less than 9 mm or a transverse-to-anteroposterior diameter ratio greater than 3:1, observed at multiple levels. This finding is particularly critical to recognize in the context of trauma, as it can indicate hypovolemia or hypotension. Moreover, in non-trauma cases, this sign can predict the development of shock, the need for aggressive resuscitation, and increased mortality. However, outside the context of trauma, a slit-like IVC may be nonspecific. A retrospective study of approximately 500 patients without a history of trauma demonstrated that up to two-thirds of patients with a 'flat cava' sign, or slit-like IVC, were clinically euvolemic or normotensive.

- **Slit-like IVC from hypovolemia**: Axial-enhanced CT image demonstrates a slit-like IVC or 'flat cava' sign (arrow), consistent with the patient's clinically evident hypovolemia following surgery.

- **Early opacification of the IVC**: This can be seen in several conditions, such as congestive heart failure, aortocaval fistula, arteriovenous shunting, or superior vena cava obstruction. Dilation of the IVC and hepatic veins, in conjunction with early opacification of the IVC and hepatic veins on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, is characteristic of congestive hepatopathy. This condition can result from passive congestion, most commonly secondary to cardiac disease. An aortocaval fistula is an uncommon complication, often attributed to erosion from another nearby structure.

### The caval index: An adequate non-invasive ultrasound parameter to predict fluid responsiveness in the emergency department [^116mBXmT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Although a caval index < 36.5% in emergency department patients with signs of shock was associated with fluid unresponsiveness in our study, we could not reproduce a strong correlation between the respiratory variation in inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and the response to fluid therapy as was previously found in mechanically ventilated intensive care patients.

- **Interpretation of findings**: The pre-infusion caval index in our study population is significantly higher in responders compared to non-responders; however, we found only a weak correlation between the caval index and the increase in systolic blood pressure. This is caused by a relatively large group of non-responders with a high caval index but no increase in systolic blood pressure in response to a 500 mL fluid challenge. These patients are more frequently diagnosed with 'sepsis' and had a higher heart rate after 15 minutes compared to the group of responders with a high caval index. These findings might indicate that this group was more hypovolemic than the group of responders with a high caval index. Considering the large variation in fluid therapy after 60 minutes, it is not possible to make any conclusions about the change in vital parameters after 60 minutes.

### Sonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava as a predictor of shock in trauma patients [^112wrSxu]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Detecting and monitoring blood loss is a challenging dilemma in emergency settings. The diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) in trauma patients may be useful in this context. Traditionally, this has been assessed with computed tomography (CT); however, using ultrasound as a readily available bedside modality is a relatively novel approach. Between January 2006 and March 2006, 88 injured patients referred to our center were investigated. The patients were divided into two groups: a shock group (n = 11, 12.5%) and a control group (n = 77, 87.5%), consisting of trauma patients with normal blood pressure.

The maximum anteroposterior diameter of the IVC was measured ultrasonographically during both inspiration (IVCi) and expiration (IVCe) using M-mode in the subxiphoid area. The difference between the diameters of IVCe and IVCi was regarded as collapsibility, and the collapsibility index was defined as (IVCe - IVCi)/IVCe. Statistical analysis included the Mann-Whitney U test and correlation analysis. The average diameters of IVCe and IVCi in the shock group at arrival were significantly smaller than in the control group (5.6 ± 0.8 mm, 4.0 ± 0.7 mm versus 11.9 ± 2.2 mm, 9.6 ± 2.0 mm; P < 0.0001). The maximum diameter of the IVC in the shock group was observed in a 30-year-old male patient with an IVCe and IVCi of 7.0 and 5.3 mm, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between the diameters of IVCe (r = 0.72) and IVCi (r = 0.73) and the presence of shock. The mean collapsibility index of the IVC was significantly higher in the shock group compared to the control group.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the inferior vena cava collapsibility to predict fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients with sepsis and acute circulatory failure [^117WYA1q]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate whether the collapsibility index of the inferior vena cava, recorded during a deep standardized inspiration, predicts fluid responsiveness in nonintubated patients. The research was designed as a prospective, nonrandomized study conducted in the ICUs at a general and a university hospital. Participants included 90 nonintubated patients, without mechanical ventilation, presenting with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure and considered for volume expansion.

- **Interventions**: Hemodynamic status was assessed at baseline and after volume expansion, which was induced by a 30-minute infusion of 500-mL gelatin 4%.

- **Measurements and main results**: Stroke volume index and the collapsibility index of the inferior vena cava were measured under a deep standardized inspiration using transthoracic echocardiography. Vena cava pertinent diameters were measured 15–20 mm caudal to the hepatic vein junction and recorded by bidimensional imaging on a subcostal long-axis view. The standardized respiratory cycles involved a deep standardized inspiration followed by passive exhalation. The collapsibility index, expressed as a percentage, equaled the ratio of the difference between end-expiratory and minimum-inspiratory diameter over the end-expiratory diameter. After volume expansion, a relevant (≥ 10%) stroke volume index increase was noted in 56% of patients. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under curve for the collapsibility index was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82–0.97). When the index is superior or equal to 48%, fluid responsiveness is predicted with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 90%.

### Role of inferior vena cava and right ventricular diameter in assessment of volume status: a comparative study: ultrasound and hypovolemia [^114ZR8cg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography has been suggested as a useful noninvasive tool for the detection and follow-up of hypovolemia. Two possible sonographic markers, the diameters of the inferior vena cava (dIVC) and the right ventricle (dRV), serve as surrogates for hypovolemia. The goal of this study was to evaluate IVC and RV diameters and diameter changes in patients treated for hypovolemia and compare these findings with healthy volunteers.

Fifty healthy volunteers and 50 consecutive hypovolemic patients were enrolled in the study. The dIVC, both during inspiration (IVCi) and expiration (IVCe), was measured in hypovolemic patients before and after fluid resuscitation and in healthy volunteers during the study period. The dIVC in hypovolemic patients was measured ultrasonographically using M-mode in the subxiphoid area. The dRV was measured ultrasonographically using B-mode in the third and fourth intercostal spaces.

The average diameters of the IVCe, IVCi, and dRV in hypovolemic patients upon arrival were significantly lower compared with healthy volunteers (P = 0.001). After fluid resuscitation, there was a significant increase in the mean diameters of the IVCe, IVCi, and RV in hypovolemic patients (P = 0.001).

The results indicate that the dIVC and dRV are consistently low in hypovolemic subjects when compared with euvolemic subjects. Bedside serial measurements of dIVC and dRV could be a useful noninvasive tool for the detection and follow-up of patients.

### The effect of supine versus upright patient positioning on inferior vena cava metrics [^113Htqb6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Ultrasound of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a noninvasive and rapidly obtainable method of intravascular volume assessment; however, not all patients can lie supine for this procedure. In this study, we assess whether patient positioning affects IVC diameter metrics.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective convenience sample of patients in an in-patient dialysis unit at an urban tertiary care center. IVC metrics were taken in the supine patient, and then at a 45° semi-upright position, pre and post dialysis. Measurements were taken in M-mode in the longitudinal plane roughly 2 cm below the level of the diaphragm. IVC-maximum and IVC-minimum diameter measurements were used to determine the IVC collapse index [(IVC Max − IVC Min)/(IVC Max)]. Statistics such as means, frequencies and percentages, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman summary statistics were calculated.

- **Results**: Forty-five patients were enrolled. The average age was 57 years; 69% were male, 73% were African American, 82% had hypertension, and 42% had diabetes. There was good to excellent agreement between supine and upright IVC measurements. Both the IVC minimum and maximum measurements had similar coefficient correlation (rᵢ) measurements (0.917 and 0.890, respectively), whereas agreement in the collapse index was lower (rᵢ = 0.813). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated excellent agreement and small 95% limits of agreement (± 6 mm) with minimal mean bias for both the minimum and maximum measurements.

- **Conclusion**: IVC metrics do not change significantly based on patient position. For those patients who are unable to…

### A prospective pilot study of pocket-carried ultrasound pre- and postdischarge inferior vena cava assessment for prediction of heart failure rehospitalization [^116jYRgt]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Rehospitalization for heart failure (HF) is common, and subclinical congestion may be present at discharge. Larger inferior vena cava (IVC) size and lower collapsibility at discharge assessed via bedside ultrasound are predictive of rehospitalization. However, the utility of IVC assessment with the use of pocket-carried ultrasound (PCUS) during the transition from discharge to the posthospitalization follow-up visit has not been investigated.

- **Methods and results**: IVC max and IVC min were measured with the use of PCUS, and the collapsibility index (IVCCI = [IVC max - IVC min]/IVC max) was determined. The primary outcome was 90-day rehospitalization or death. We prospectively enrolled 49 adults (71 ± 13 years of age, 51% male, 47% Black, 43% preserved ejection fraction) hospitalized for HF. Nineteen patients (39%) experienced the outcome. Within the rehospitalized group, discharge and follow-up mean IVC max were both > 2.1 cm (2.2 ± 0.5 and 2.2 ± 0.7) and IVCCIs 50% at both time points (55 ± 25% and 62 ± 19%; P = NS). The follow-up IVCCI below an optimal cutoff of 42% had modest discrimination alone (c-statistic = 0.73). Follow-up IVCCI < 42% was associated with a greater hazard of the outcome independent of admission log B-type natriuretic peptide (adjusted hazard ratio = 6.8; 95% confidence interval 2.4–19.0; P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Posthospitalization IVCCI assessment with PCUS predicts HF rehospitalization and may identify patients in need of intensive follow-up.

### Ultrasonographic inferior vena cava measurement is more sensitive than vital SIGN abnormalities for identifying moderate and severe hemorrhage [^1145f6XT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Ultrasound inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter has been shown to decrease in response to hemorrhage. However, IVC diameter cut points to identify moderate and severe blood loss have not been established.

- **Objectives**: This study sought to find ultrasound IVC diameter cut points to identify moderate and severe hemorrhage and assess the performance of these cut points versus vital sign abnormalities.

- **Methods**: This is a secondary analysis of data from a study that described changes in vital signs and sonographic measurements of the IVC during a lower body negative pressure model of hemorrhage. Using receiver operator curve analyses, optimal cut points for identifying moderate and severe hemorrhage were identified. The ability of these cut points to identify hemorrhage in patients with no vital sign abnormalities was then assessed.

- **Results**: In both long- and short-axis views, maximum and minimum IVC diameters (IVC max and IVC min) were significantly lower than baseline in severe blood loss. The optimal cut point for IVC max in both axes was found to be ≤ 0.8 cm. This cut point is able to distinguish between no blood loss versus moderate blood loss, and no blood loss versus severe blood loss. The optimal cut point for IVC min was variable between axes and blood loss severity. IVC diameter cut points obtained were able to identify hemorrhage in patients with no vital sign abnormalities.

- **Conclusion**: An ultrasound IVC max of ≤ 0.8 cm may be useful in identifying moderate and severe hemorrhage before vital sign abnormalities are evident.

**Key points for venous congestion**: (1) Fluid resuscitation endpoints should focus not only on MAP but also consider the impact of venous congestion on tissue perfusion. (2) Abnormalities in venous waveforms suggest that organ impairment, such as congestive nephropathy and hepatopathy, may be secondary to venous congestion.

### Inferior and superior vena cava reconstruction [^1179rfiT]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

- **Superior vena cava obstruction**: The signs and symptoms of superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction depend on factors such as temporal dynamics, degree, and location. They can range from slight discomfort in the upper extremities to a life-threatening complication due to sustained venous congestion of the head and neck. When the progression of an SVC obstruction is slow, collateral pathways may develop, facilitating venous outflow from the upper extremities through compensatory pathways. This results in less severe symptoms such as swelling, discomfort, aching, heaviness, or discoloration of the upper extremities. An acute problem arises when the obstruction develops faster than the natural compensation of venous outflow, which often resembles an acute-on-chronic occlusion, like thrombosis. Symptoms then worsen rapidly, with patients presenting with dyspnea, facial swelling, neck distension, and cough developing over a short period. In severe cases, sudden elevation in venous pressures from a rapidly occluding SVC may lead to cerebral, laryngeal, and pharyngeal edema, requiring immediate intervention. Yu B et al. proposed a classification system to assist in determining the urgency of intervention and tracking symptom progression. The proposed management algorithm for SVC syndrome categorizes treatment recommendations based on symptom severity, emphasizing the importance of matching treatment intensity with symptom severity to optimize patient outcomes while avoiding unnecessary interventions.

### A dilated inferior vena cava is a marker of poor survival [^115s7iHC]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) morphology is often used to estimate right atrial pressure; however, the association of IVC morphology and outcome is poorly described.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 4,383 consecutive outpatients (98% men) undergoing echocardiography at one of three Veterans Affairs laboratories.

- **Results**: Of the 3,729 patients with adequate images, 3,295 (88%) had a normal IVC (< 2 cm), 358 (10%) had a dilated IVC that collapsed at least 50% with inspiration, and 76 (2%) had a dilated IVC that did not collapse. Compared with patients with a normal IVC, those with a dilated IVC were older (66 ± 13 vs. 69 ± 12 years if dilated with collapse and 70 ± 12 years if dilated without collapse, P = 0.0005) and were more likely to have a history of heart failure (11% vs. 18% if dilated with collapse and 38% if dilated without collapse, P < .0001). The 90-day and 1-year survival rates were 99% and 95% for those with a normal IVC, 98% and 91% for those with a dilated IVC with collapse, and 89% and 67% for those with a dilated IVC without collapse (P < .0001). After adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic characteristics, including left and right ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressure, a dilated IVC without collapse remained associated with increased mortality: hazard ratio 1.43 (1.29–1.57 compared with a normal IVC, P < .0001).

- **Conclusion**: A dilated IVC without collapse with inspiration is associated with worse survival in men independent of a history of heart failure, other comorbidities, ventricular function, and pulmonary artery pressure.

### The inferior vena cava: Anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^117SyY6z]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) is an important structure that can be affected by a wide range of congenital anomalies and acquired pathologies. It is essential for radiologists to be familiar with the various appearances of the IVC in both benign and malignant pathologies. Recognition of the anatomical variants of the IVC is crucial, especially prior to intervention. Imaging plays a key role in differentiating tumor extension from bland thrombus and in assessing the extent of tumor thrombus. Such information is essential for patient care and impacts staging, surgical planning, and medical therapy. Evaluation of the IVC should form a fundamental part of a radiologist's search pattern.

### Comparison of superior and inferior vena cava diameter variation measured with transthoracic echocardiography to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients after abdominal surgery [^11248Dt3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

SVCCI by thoracic ultrasonography was a great predictor of fluid responsiveness, with an AUC of 0.885 (95% CI, 0.786–0.949; P < 0.0001). The optimal cut-off value for SVCCI was 19%, with a sensitivity of 93.3% and a specificity of 75%. To avoid the dualism of a single cutoff value, a sensitivity/specificity plot shows the probability interval for SVCCI. The gray zone for SVCCI lay between 20 and 25%, comprising only 11 (15.7%) of patients.

### Inferior vena cava diameter measurement provides distinct and complementary information to right atrial pressure in acute decompensated heart failure [^113ygtMB]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) measurements correlate only modestly with right atrial pressure (RAP). Part of this inaccuracy is due to the high compliance of the venous system, where a large change in blood volume may result in only a small change in pressure. As such, the information provided by the IVC may be different rather than redundant.

- **Methods and results**: We analyzed patients in the ESCAPE (Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness) trial who had both pulmonary artery catheter and IVC measurements at baseline (n = 108). There was only a modest correlation between baseline RAP and IVC diameter (r = 0.41; P < 0.001). Hemoconcentration, defined as an increase in hemoglobin levels between admission and discharge, was correlated with a decrease in IVC diameter (r = 0.35; P = 0.02) but not with a decrease in RAP (r = 0.01; P = 0.95). When patients had both IVC and RAP measurements that were below the median, survival rates were superior to the rates of those who had only one measurement below the median. Conversely, when both rates were above the median, patients fared the worst (P = 0.002).

- **Conclusion**: IVC and RAP have limited correlation with one another, and changes in intravascular volume appear to correlate better with IVC diameter rather than with RAP. Furthermore, complementary information is provided by pressure and volume assessments in acute decompensated heart failure.

### Inter-rater reliability of sonographic measurements of the inferior vena cava [^117Cgph3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Bedside ultrasound is emerging as a useful tool in the assessment of intravascular volume status by examining measurements of the inferior vena cava (IVC). Many previous studies do not fully describe their scanning protocol.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this study was to evaluate which of three commonly reported IVC scanning methods demonstrates the best inter-rater reliability.

- **Methods**: Three physicians visualized the IVC in three common views and utilized M-mode to measure the maximal and minimal diameter during quiet respiration. Pairwise correlation coefficients were determined using Pearson product-moment correlation.

- **Results**: The most reliable pair of measurements (inspiratory and expiratory) was found to be using the anterior midaxillary line longitudinal view with a Kappa value for both at 0.692.

- **Conclusion**: Imaging with the anterior midaxillary longitudinal approach using the liver as an acoustic window provides the best inter-rater reliability when measuring the IVC. Our findings demonstrate that IVC measurements differ based on anatomic location.

### The diagnostic accuracy of inferior vena cava respiratory variation in predicting volume responsiveness in patients under different breathing status following abdominal surgery [^117P67Cm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of fluid therapy is to attain the maximal increase in cardiac output (CO) after fluid replenishment. However, nearly half of patients cannot increase CO following volume expansion, which can eventually lead to cardiopulmonary dysfunction due to fluid overload. Thus, goal-directed fluid therapy based on volume status assessment plays a pivotal role in the enhanced recovery for surgical patients.

Currently, conventional static indicators, such as central venous pressure (CVP) and urine output, are poorly associated with volume status and cannot accurately predict patients' volume responsiveness. Moreover, dynamic indicators like pulse pressure variation (PPV) or stroke volume variation (SVV) are only suitable for a specific population with regular heart rhythm under mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasonography, as a non-invasive, reproducible, real-time examination tool, has gained increasing popularity in appraising volume responsiveness.

A growing number of studies have demonstrated the significance of IVC variation indices for assessing volume responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients suffering from septic shock or circulatory instability in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, a study conducted by de Oliveira suggested that the discriminative properties of individual PPV for predicting volume responsiveness in postoperative mechanically ventilated patients seem superior to those parameters from IVC respiratory variability. Moreover, the consensus on the effectiveness of these indicators is still under debate.

### The respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameter as a guide to fluid therapy [^115Y1rrt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate whether the respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameter (DeltaD(IVC)) could be related to fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients.

- **Design**: Prospective clinical study.

- **Setting**: Medical ICU of a non-university hospital.

- **Patients**: Mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock (n = 39).

- **Interventions**: Volume loading with 8 mL/kg of 6% hydroxyethylstarch over 20 minutes.

- **Measurements and results**: Cardiac output and DeltaD(IVC) were assessed by echography before and immediately after the standardized volume load. Volume loading induced an increase in cardiac output from 5.7 ± 2.0 to 6.4 ± 1.9 L/min (P ≤ 0.001). Patients who exhibited an increase in cardiac output of ≥ 15% were classified as responders. Before volume loading, the DeltaD(IVC) was greater in responders than in non-responders (25 ± 15% vs. 6 ± 4%, P < 0.001). It closely correlated with the increase in cardiac output (r = 0.82, P < 0.001), and a 12% DeltaD(IVC) cut-off value allowed identification of responders with positive and negative predictive values of 93% and 92%, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Analysis of DeltaD(IVC) is a simple and non-invasive method to detect fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock.

### Is the mechanism of re-expansion pulmonary oedema in a heart-lung interaction [^115i9v9H]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Apical four-chamber view video demonstrates a hypokinetic apex, interventricular septum, dilated left atrium and right ventricle, and collapsibility of the inferior vena cava during inspiration. A right pleural tap using a 12F drain with a closed collection system revealed 850 mL of transudate evacuated without active suction.

All parameters were measured with a heart rate (HR) of 90 bpm. (A) A chest X-ray was taken immediately after draining 850 mL from the right pleura. (B) Transmitral pulsed wave Doppler was performed on a patient with atrial fibrillation and significant mitral regurgitation (MR), revealing E wave velocity of 1.61 m/s. (C) The lateral velocity time interval (VTI) with measured e′ velocity was 12–13 cm/s, with E/e′ ratio indicating an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12–14. (D) Systolic continuous wave (CW) Doppler of an MR jet showed a peak systolic gradient of 109 mm Hg. With a systolic blood pressure (BPs) of 136 mm Hg, the patient had a left atrial pressure of 27 mm Hg (BPs−CWmax). (E) Systolic transtricuspid CW Doppler gradient of 45 mm Hg, combined with a central venous pressure of 12 mm Hg, estimated a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 57 mm Hg. TR indicates tricuspid regurgitation. (F) Post drainage, the mean VTI in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) was measured at 13.4 cm.

While on VVI 90/min and identical PSV settings, the patient presented with tachypnea and increasing oxygen requirements (FiO 2 0.80). No signs of a pneumothorax were observed (video 2), but blood pressure and urine output decreased. The control TTE revealed elevated parameters.

### Demystifying volume status: An ultrasound-guided physiologic framework [^114VNKJG]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

Central venous pressure (CVP) can be inferred from (1) the internal jugular vein (IJV) and (2) the inferior vena cava (IVC). CVP is defined as the mean vena caval pressure or right atrial pressure, which, in the absence of tricuspid stenosis, is equal to the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Although widely discussed, several key aspects of the CVP are often poorly understood and bear clarifying.

- **Pocus applications in the volume status assessment**: First, although volume affects pressure, one must not conflate the two. An increase in CVP may be secondary to a primary pressure-related disorder, a volume-related disorder, or both. Elevated CVP may indicate several non-volume-related pathological features. Although CVP is not itself a measure of volume, it provides information about the right side of the heart's compliance and performance, which reflects its ability to accommodate volume.

- **Causes of elevated CVP that do not reflect total body volume overload**: Second, elevated CVP is a precursor to the development of clinically significant venous congestion. Venous return to the right side of the heart is governed by the pressure gradient between the right atrium and peripheral veins and by venous resistance. This pressure gradient is small, with peripheral venous pressure usually of 8 to 10 mm Hg and normal CVP ranging from 0 to 8 mm Hg. Therefore, as CVP increases, a requisite rise in peripheral venous pressures occurs to maintain right-sided heart function.

### Inferior vena cava collapsibility to guide fluid removal in slow continuous ultrafiltration: a pilot study [^117VH6YF]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To investigate whether ultrasound determination of the inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD) and its collapsibility index (IVCCI) could be used to optimize the fluid removal rate while avoiding hypotension during slow continuous ultrafiltration (SCUF), twenty-four consecutive patients were admitted to our 16-bed medical ICU. These patients (13 men and 11 women, mean age 72 ± 5 years, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III-IV) had acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) with diuretic resistance.

Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), blood samples for hematocrit, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and arterial blood gas analysis (BGA) plus lactate were obtained at baseline and then every 2 hours from the beginning of SCUF. IVCD, assessed by M-mode subcostal echocardiography during spontaneous breathing, was evaluated before SCUF, at 12 hours, and just after the cessation of the procedure. The IVCCI was calculated using the formula: [(IVCD(max) - IVCD(min))/IVCD(max)] x 100.

The mean ultrafiltration (UF) time was 20.3 ± 4.6 hours, with a mean volume of 287.6 ± 96.2 ml/hour and a total ultrafiltrate production of 5,780.8 ± 1,994.6 ml. No significant difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR, RR, and IVCD before and after UF was found. However, IVCCI increased significantly after UF, with 33% of patients experiencing an increase greater than 30%. In all other patients, a significant increase in IVCCI was observed without any hemodynamic instability.

In conclusion, IVC ultrasound is a rapid, simple, and non-invasive means for bedside monitoring of intravascular volume during SCUF.

### Does respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameter predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168gXRL]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of respiratory variation in inferior vena cava diameter (ΔIVC) for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were screened from inception to February 2017. The meta-analysis assessed the pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In addition, heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 12 studies involving 753 patients were included. Significant heterogeneity existed among the studies, and meta-regression indicated that ventilator settings were the main sources of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis indicated that ΔIVC exhibited better diagnostic performance in the group of patients ventilated with tidal volume (TV) ≥ 8 mL/kg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≤ 5 cm H2O than in the group ventilated with TV < 8 mL/kg or PEEP > 5 cm H2O, as demonstrated by higher sensitivity (0.80 vs. 0.66; p = 0.02) and specificity (0.94 vs. 0.68; P < .001). For patients ventilated with TV ≥ 8 mL/kg and PEEP ≤ 5 cm H2O, the threshold for predicting fluid responsiveness was 14% ± 5%.

- **Conclusions**: ΔIVC shows limited ability in predicting fluid responsiveness in distinct ventilator settings.

### Comparison of superior and inferior vena cava diameter variation measured with transthoracic echocardiography to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients after abdominal surgery [^112VAGio]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

Rational goal-directed fluid management is one of the crucial components of anaesthesiologists' daily tasks. The latest multicenter retrospective study demonstrated that inappropriate fluid administration is correlated with an increase in postoperative complications. Excessive fluid infusion may increase the risk of pulmonary and peripheral tissue edema, delaying the recovery of respiratory and intestinal function. Conversely, conservative fluid therapy may induce an unstable hemodynamic profile, multiorgan hypoperfusion, and prolonged hospital stay. Furthermore, the volume status of critically ill patients admitted to the anesthesia intensive care unit (AICU) after surgery is inevitably affected by diverse postoperative factors. These include over-zealous intravenous infusion, urine loss, postoperative bleeding, abdominal drainage, and occult sweat evaporation. Precise diagnosis and individualized fluid resuscitation tailored to every postoperative patient, whether overhydrated or underhydrated, remains challenging.

Traditional static hemodynamic parameters, such as central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, have shown little value in guiding volume expansion. Although widely used and accepted as robust indicators to predict preload responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients, the dynamic indices of stroke volume variation (SVV) or pulse pressure variation (PPV) require costly sophisticated devices or invasive catheterization. With the increasing accessibility of ultrasound devices, research is ongoing to determine non-invasive methods for assessing fluid responsiveness.

### The interrater reliability of inferior vena cava ultrasound by bedside clinician sonographers in emergency department patients [^111MaAW2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava ultrasound (IVC-US) is a noninvasive bedside tool to assess intravascular volume status. This study aimed to investigate the interrater reliability of IVC-US by bedside clinician sonographers and determine whether alternative methods such as B-mode and visual estimation are equally reliable as traditional M-mode.

- **Methods**: A convenience sample of adult emergency department (ED) patients was prospectively enrolled. Each patient underwent IVC-US by two different emergency physicians (EPs). Each physician first performed a visual estimation of IVC percent collapse and of volume status, followed by caliper measurements in M-mode and B-mode. The EPs were blinded to patient data and to the other sonographer's results. Interrater reliability for each technique was determined between the two EPs' assessments using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for continuous data and Cohen's weighted kappa for categorical data. Additionally, analysis was performed on M-mode diameter measurements to determine the relationship between sonographer and patient characteristics on interrater reliability.

- **Results**: Five EPs performed 92 ultrasounds on 46 patients. Using M-mode, the ICC for maximum IVC diameter was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67 to 0.89), and for minimum diameter was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.62 to 0.87). There were no statistically significant differences between the caliper methods used for IVC measurements (M-mode diameter, B-mode diameter, or B-mode area). Agreement for visually estimated IVC collapse was 0.60 (95% CI = 0.36 to 0.76).

### Comparison of superior and inferior vena cava diameter variation measured with transthoracic echocardiography to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients after abdominal surgery [^1137Zpv2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the value of diameter variation of the superior vena cava (SVC) during respiratory or cardiac phases with diameter variation of the inferior vena cava (dIVC) using noninvasive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for predicting fluid responsiveness in postoperative mechanically ventilated patients. We found that the superior vena cava collapsibility index (SVCCI) had a more significant correlation coefficient with change in cardiac output (ΔCO), a larger area under the curve (AUC), and a smaller gray zone than dIVC and SVC during cardiac variation (SVCV), indicating that the respiratory variation of the SVC is superior to dIVC and SVC cardiac variation in predicting volume responsiveness.

The cyclic effect of positive pressure ventilation on the changes in vena cava diameter depends on the transmural pressure, which is determined by intravascular pressure (circulating volume and right heart function) and surrounding pressure (intrathoracic pressure for SVC and abdominal pressure for IVC). IVC respiratory variation has consistently been recommended to assess potential intolerance to fluid administration. However, conflicting results have been published concerning the reliability of this index. According to previous research, our trial results showed moderate diagnostic accuracy when using dIVC, as the AUC for predicting fluid responsiveness was 0.727 (95% confidence interval, 0.608 to 0.827; P < 0.05). A dIVC threshold of > 14% discriminates responders from non-responders with a sensitivity of 62.5% and specificity of 80%, respectively. However, the gray zone of dIVC (7%-27%) includes more than half of the patients, suggesting that dIVC was not clinically useful in mechanically ventilated patients after abdominal surgery.

### Influence of superior vena caval zone condition on cyclic changes in right ventricular outflow during respiratory support [^113rsagz]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Adequate fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation remains a difficult challenge, and diastolic and systolic right ventricular (RV) changes produced by positive airway pressure are important to consider in an individual patient with inadequate circulatory adaptation during respiratory support. We hypothesized that insufficient thoracic vena cava filling, predisposing to inspiratory collapse (zone 2 condition), may transiently affect RV outflow.

- **Methods**: We measured beat-to-beat superior vena caval diameter and Doppler RV outflow during a routine transesophageal echocardiographic examination in 22 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, all of whom required hemodynamic monitoring. We calculated a collapsibility index for the superior vena cava as maximal expiratory diameter minus minimal inspiratory diameter, divided by maximal expiratory diameter.

- **Results**: In 15 patients (group 1), the collapsibility index was low (17 ± 7%) and was associated with a moderate inspiratory decrease in RV outflow (25 ± 17%). However, in seven patients (group 2), we observed a high collapsibility index (71 ± 7%), which was associated with a major inspiratory decrease in RV outflow (69 ± 14%) combined with a reduced pulmonary artery flow period. A rapid volume expansion, only performed on group 2, markedly and significantly reduced both the collapsibility index (15 ± 12%) and the inspiratory decrease in RV outflow (31 ± 20%).

- **Conclusion**: A major inspiratory decrease in RV outflow associated with a reduced pulmonary artery flow was observed in the study.

### Relationship between the subcostal and right lateral ultrasound views of inferior vena cava collapse: Implications for clinical use of ultrasonography [^117QdcJa]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The collapsibility index of the inferior vena cava is traditionally visualized from the subcostal region in the sagittal plane, referred to here as cIVC SS. Alternatively, the collapsibility index can be visualized from the right midaxillary line in the coronal plane, referred to as cIVC RC. It is unclear whether values of cIVC RC are comparable with values of cIVC SS, because the inferior vena cava collapses asymmetrically into an elliptical form, quantified as the flat ratio of the inferior vena cava (F-IVC). This study aimed (1) to establish if cIVC RC is concordant or discordant with cIVC SS, and (2) to describe how this concordance or discordance is related to F-IVC.

- **Methods**: This single-center cross-sectional study enrolled 110 spontaneously breathing patients. Values of cIVC RC were compared with cIVC SS. Performance of cIVC RC ≥ 42% in predicting fluid responsiveness, defined as cIVC SS ≥ 42%, was assessed. F-IVC was also correlated to the difference between cIVC SS and cIVC RC.

- **Results**: cIVC RC ≥ 42% was 61.5% sensitive (95% CI, 31.58%-86.14%) and 67.1% specific (95% CI, 55.81%-77.06%) for predicting cIVC SS ≥ 42%. cIVC RC underestimated cIVC SS. The degree of discordance between cIVC RC and cIVC SS was proportional to the value of F-IVC.

- **Conclusions**: cIVC RC and cIVC SS measures are discordant, where cIVC RC underestimates cIVC SS. The degree of discordance is directly proportional to the value of F-IVC. Therefore, we recommend that cIVC RC ≥ 42% be used to rule in, but not to rule out, fluid responsivity.

### Usefulness of serial measurements of inferior vena cava diameter by Vscan to identify patients with heart failure at high risk of hospitalization [^114BqVbz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Estimation of volume status is integral to heart failure (HF) management. Measurement of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter (IVCd) by ultrasound provides a noninvasive estimate of right atrial pressures. The GE Vscan is a handheld ultrasound (HHU) device that allows for point-of-care measurements to assess volume status. We hypothesize that IVCd measurements using HHU can predict the risk of HF admission.

We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with HF treated in an ambulatory care setting over 17 months. Serial measurements of IVCd were obtained using HHU in the supine position from the subcostal window. Log-binomial regression models were used to compare IVCd measurements between patients with and without HF admissions and to estimate the association between IVCd and risk of HF admission. Of the 355 patients with systolic (38%) and diastolic HF (62%) who were analyzed, 45% were women with a mean age of 73 years at the time of the first IVCd measurement.

Overall, 3,488 measurements were obtained, and 32.4% of patients were hospitalized during follow-up. Patients with at least one hospital admission had a greater mean IVCd than those who were not admitted (2.0 vs 1.8 cm, p < 0.01). In our analysis, every 0.5-cm increase in the mean IVCd was associated with a 38% increase in risk of HF admission (risk ratio [RR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.62, p < 0.01). The risk of HF admission was also significantly increased in patients with IVCd 2.0 to 2.49 cm (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.52, p < 0.01) and ≥ 2.5 cm (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.55 to 3.67, p < 0.01), compared with patients with an IVCd.

### Role of inferior vena cava collapsibility index in the prediction of hypotension associated with general anesthesia: an observational study [^112necF5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Performance characteristics of IVC collapsibility

The ROC curve analysis of the ability of the inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVCCI) to predict hypotension after the induction of general anesthesia revealed an AUC of 64.8% (95% CI 52.1–77.5%), indicating poor to fair diagnostic accuracy. We set the cutoff value of IVCCI to 50% to distinguish between the CI+ and CI- groups. At this threshold, the sensitivity was only 45.5% (95% CI 28.1–63.7%), but the specificity was as high as 90.0% (95% CI 78.2–96.7%), resulting in a positive likelihood ratio of 4.5 (95% CI 1.8–11.3). The positive predictive value was 75.0% (95% CI 50.9–91.3%), and the negative predictive value was 71.4% (95% CI 58.7–82.1%).

Setting the IVCCI cutoff to 40% was less promising. The sensitivity increased slightly to 51.5% (95% CI 33.5–69.2%), while specificity decreased to 72.0% (95% CI 57.5–83.8%). The positive predictive value was 54.8% (95% CI 36.0–72.7%), and the negative predictive value was 69.2% (95% CI 54.9–81.3%). In this scenario, the positive likelihood ratio was reduced to 1.84 (95% CI 1.06–3.20). The ROC curve's Youden index supported using the 50% cutoff value, identifying it as the optimal threshold.

### The diagnostic accuracy of inferior vena cava respiratory variation in predicting volume responsiveness in patients under different breathing status following abdominal surgery [^112xfqie]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

The IVC respiratory variability index was moderately predictive of postoperative volume responsiveness in patients undergoing abdominal surgery under artificially or spontaneously breathing conditions. The cIVC and IVCmin appeared to be more clinically useful in predicting volume responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients, as opposed to the predictor of cIVC in mechanically ventilated patients.

Comparing the gray zones of IVC-related parameters in predicting volume responsiveness in patients under two respiratory modes

To avoid the dualism of a single cut-off value, the gray zone bounded by a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 90% provided an uncertain range. The gray zone for cIVC2 was 30.72 to 38.32% and included 23.2% of spontaneously breathing patients, whereas it was 17.01 to 25.93% for cIVC1 and included 44.6% of mechanically ventilated patients. The proportions of subjects in the gray zone for inferior vena cava (IVC) respiratory variation under two respiratory modes were the lowest among all IVC relevant parameters. The number of spontaneously breathing patients in the gray zone for IVCmin was 17 (30.4%), which was lower than 29 (51.8%) for ΔIVC, indicating that IVCmin had a better test utility.

- **Sensitivity and specificity plots and gray zones**: Figure 6 shows cIVC1 (A) and ΔIVC (B) in mechanically ventilated patients, and cIVC2 (C) and IVCmin (D) in spontaneously breathing patients. These reflect the ability of predicting volume responsiveness. The two dotted lines indicate the gray zone. IVC: inferior vena cava; cIVC1: IVC diameter variation in mechanically ventilated patients; ΔIVC: the difference of the maximum and minimum IVC diameter; cIVC2: collapsibility of IVC in spontaneously breathing patients; IVCmin: minimum diameter of IVC.

The independent predictors analyzed by multivariable logistic regression under two respiratory modes

After adjusting some indicators commonly applied in the clinical setting, the multivariable logistic regression analysis identified independent predictors under both respiratory modes.

### Using the ventilator to predict fluid responsiveness [^112bWQv4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Changes in vena cava diameter occur under mechanical ventilation during preload responsiveness. The extra-thoracic inferior vena cava (IVC) dilates during inspiration as venous return is impeded, while the intrathoracic superior vena cava (SVC) collapses. However, respiratory variations in IVC diameter, and to a lesser extent in SVC diameter, are less reliable than other tests of preload responsiveness (Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, they share the same limitations as pulse pressure variation (PPV), except for arrhythmias. The IVC variation has limited diagnostic ability in cases of intra-abdominal hypertension.

### Comparative analysis of the collapsibility index and distensibility index of the inferior vena cava through echocardiography with pulse pressure variation that predicts fluid responsiveness in surgical patients: An observational controlled trial [^115NcZHt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of the present study was to compare the collapsibility (IcIVC) and distensibility (IdIVC) indices of the inferior vena cava with pulse pressure variation (PPV). It aimed to determine the accuracy and cutoff points of IcIVC and IdIVC that best predict response to intravenous fluid therapy in surgical patients.

- **Design**: Observational, prospective, non-blinded, single-center.

- **Setting**: Hospital do Servidor Público Estadual de São Paulo, in São Paulo, Brazil.

- **Participants**: Volunteer surgical patients.

- **Interventions**: This prospective study evaluated adult surgical patients before and after they underwent mechanical ventilation. IcIVC and IdIVC measurements were obtained with echocardiography and PPV through arterial catheterization.

- **Measurements and main results**: Twenty-two patients with a mean age of 55.7 ± 10.9 years were included; 31.8% of the study participants had PPV values > 13% and were shown to be responsive to fluid. A good correlation was detected between PPV and IcIVC (R² = 0.71; p 13% were > 40% for IcIVC and > 17.6% for IdIVC.

### Dynamic assessment of the central vein throughout the cardiac cycle in adults with no right heart disease by cardiac CT [^116a2c8m]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the cardiac cycle on the vena cava and determine the phase of measuring maximum diameters.

- **Methods**: A total of 152 patients who underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT) were included. Patients' basic information was collected. The major axis, minor axis, and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the vena cava in 10 phases reconstructed at 10% steps from 5% to 95% of the R-R interval were measured in four planes:
	- **SVC1 layer**: The bifurcation of the pulmonary artery
	- **SVC2 layer**: The superior vena cava (SVC) into the right atrium
	- **IVC1 layer**: The intersection of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the right atrium
	- **IVC2 layer**: The IVC into the anterior hepatic plane

The difference in vena cava diameters between cardiac cycles was determined using the linear mixed model.

- **Results**: The variations in diameter and CSA of the SVC during cardiac cycles were statistically significant (p < 0.05), while those of the suprahepatic IVC were not. In the SVC1 layer, the maximum values of the SVC major and minor axes were observed at the 85% and 45% phases, respectively, while in the SVC2 layer, the maximum was observed at the 45% phase. The maximum SVC diameters in the SVC1 and SVC2 layers were 19.48 ± 2.57 mm and 17.43 ± 3.09 mm, respectively. The SVC and IVC diameters and CSA were positively correlated with the body surface area in the linear mixed model.

- **Conclusion**: The maximum SVC diameter and CSA were mostly observed in the 45% phase, which provides a reference for selecting the best phase to measure the abnormality of vena cava diameter in the future.

### The effect of weight-based volume loading on the inferior vena cava in fasting subjects: a prospective randomized double-blinded trial [^114Gtdun]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava ultrasound (IVC-US) assessment has been proposed as a noninvasive method of assessing volume status; however, literature is divided on its ability to do so. The primary objective of this study was to compare IVC-US changes in healthy fasting subjects randomized to receive either 10 or 30 mL/kg of intravenous (IV) fluid administration versus a control group that received only 2 mL/kg.

This prospective randomized double-blinded trial was conducted in emergency department (ED) clinical care rooms. Volunteer subjects with no history of cardiac disease or hypertension fasted for 12 hours. They were randomly assigned to receive IV 0.9% saline bolus of 2 (control group), 10, or 30 mL/kg over 30 minutes. IVC-US was performed before and 15 minutes after each fluid bolus.

Forty-two fasting subjects were enrolled. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparison showed that IVC-US was unable to detect any significant difference between the control group and those given either 10 or 30 mL/kg fluid, whether using maximum or minimum IVC diameter or caval index (IVC-CI). The groups receiving 10 and 30 mL/kg each had a statistically significant change in IVC-CI; however, the 30 mL/kg group had no significant change in either of the mean IVC diameters.

Overall, there were statistically significant differences in mean IVC-US measurements before and after fluid loading, but not between groups. Fasting asymptomatic subjects had a wide intersubject variation in both baseline IVC-US measurements and fluid-related changes.

### Superior vena caval collapsibility as a gauge of volume status in ventilated septic patients [^116GTmS2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In mechanically ventilated patients, an inspiratory increase in pleural pressure during lung inflation may produce complete or partial collapse of the superior vena cava. The occurrence of this collapse suggests that, at this time, external pressure exerted by the thoracic cavity on the superior vena cava is greater than the venous pressure required to maintain the vessel fully open. We tested the hypothesis that measuring superior vena caval collapsibility would reveal the need for volume expansion in a given septic patient.

- **Design and setting**: Prospective data collection for 66 successive patients in septic shock admitted to a medical intensive care unit and mechanically ventilated for an associated acute lung injury.

- **Measurements and results**: We simultaneously measured superior vena caval collapsibility by echocardiography and cardiac index by the Doppler technique at baseline and following a 10 ml/kg volume expansion by 6% hydroxyethyl starch in 30 minutes. The threshold superior vena caval collapsibility of 36%, calculated as (maximum diameter on expiration - minimum diameter on inspiration)/maximum diameter on expiration, allowed discrimination between responders (defined by an increase in cardiac index of at least 11% induced by volume expansion) and nonresponders, with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%.

- **Conclusions**: Superior vena cava measurement should be systematically performed during routine echocardiography in septic shock, as it provides an accurate index of fluid responsiveness.

### Respiratory variability of inferior vena cava at different mechanical ventilator settings [^112tSouL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Assessment of the respiratory changes in the inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter has been investigated as a reliable tool to estimate the volume status in mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients. Our purpose was to compare the echocardiographic measurements of the IVC diameter, stroke volume, and cardiac output under different positive pressure ventilation parameters.

- **Methods**: This prospective clinical study with a crossover design was conducted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Twenty-five sedated, paralyzed, intubated, and mechanically ventilated patients under volume control mode (VCV) in the ICU due to respiratory failure were included in the study. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (TV) were changed in each patient consecutively — Group A: TV 6 ml/kg, PEEP 5 cmH2O; Group B: TV 6, PEEP 8; Group C: TV 8, PEEP 5; Group D: TV 8, PEEP 8 — and the changes in vital parameters, central venous pressure (CVP), and ultrasonographic changes in IVC and cardiac parameters were measured. All measures were compared between groups by robust repeated measures ANOVA with trimmed mean.

- **Results**: The respiratory changes of the IVC diameter and echocardiographic parameters showed no significant difference across separate mechanical ventilator settings. A significant difference was found in peak and plateau pressure values among groups (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: The results of our study suggest that IVC-related parameters are not affected by different ventilatory settings. Further studies are needed to confirm the reliability of these parameters as predictors of fluid assessment.

### Correlation between IVC dimensions and volume status on CT scan [^116D7Svf]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

The end points of resuscitation in trauma patients are difficult to define. The size of the inferior vena cava (IVC) on a CT scan may accurately indicate volume status and guide resuscitation efforts. Our hypothesis was that IVC "flatness" on a CT scan reflects volume status in hemodynamically normal trauma patients.

- **Methods**: The study population was drawn from a database of trauma patients who had abdominal CT scans and lactate levels drawn on arrival. Lactate was chosen as a marker of volume status since hypotensive patients were unlikely to undergo CT. Anteroposterior (AP) and transverse (TV) diameters of the IVC were measured at the suprarenal and infrarenal locations. A flatness index was calculated for each location (TV ÷ AP), and this value was correlated with heart rate, blood pressure, and lactate.

- **Results**: There was no difference in IVC flatness at the suprarenal or infrarenal position for patients with an elevated lactate compared with those with a normal lactate: 1.54 ± 0.18 versus 1.43 ± 0.08 (P = 0.2) suprarenal and 1.54 ± 0.46 versus 1.68 ± 0.58 (P = 0.4) infrarenal. IVC flatness at the suprarenal location weakly correlated with blood pressure (r = -0.29). IVC flatness did not correlate with blood pressure at the infrarenal location (r = -0.1). IVC flatness did not correlate with heart rate (P > 0.3) or age (P > 0.2).

- **Conclusion**: These results did not demonstrate a correlation between IVC flatness and the markers of intravascular volume, such as heart rate, blood pressure, or lactate. IVC flatness on a CT scan is not a valid indicator of volume status in hemodynamically normal trauma patients.

### Intensivist use of hand-carried ultrasonography to measure IVC collapsibility in estimating intravascular volume status: Correlations with CVP [^117Y7vuN]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Volume status assessment is an important aspect of patient management in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Echocardiologist-performed measurement of the IVC collapsibility index (IVC-CI) provides useful information about filling pressures but is limited by its portability, cost, and availability. Intensivist-performed bedside ultrasonography (INBU) examinations have the potential to overcome these impediments. We used INBU to evaluate the hemodynamic status of SICU patients, focusing on correlations between IVC-CI and CVP.

- **Study design**: Prospective evaluation of hemodynamic status was conducted on a convenience sample of SICU patients. A brief (3 to 10 minutes) INBU examination was performed by noncardiologists after 3 hours of didactic training in interpreting and acquiring two-dimensional and M-mode images, as well as at least 25 proctored examinations. IVC-CI measurements were compared with invasive CVP values.

- **Results**: Of 124 enrolled patients, 101 had CVP catheters (55 men, mean age 58.3 years, 44.6% intubated). Of these, 18 patients had uninterpretable INBU examinations, leaving 83 patients with both CVP monitoring devices and INBU IVC evaluations. Patients in three IVC-CI ranges (0.60) demonstrated a significant decrease in mean CVP as IVC-CI increased (p = 0.023), although 40% of this group had a CVP > 12 mmHg. Conversely, > 60% of patients with IVC-CI > 0.6 had CVP < 7 mmHg.

- **Conclusions**: Measurements of IVC-CI by INBU can provide a useful guide to noninvasive volume status.
