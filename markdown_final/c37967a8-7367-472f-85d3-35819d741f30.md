## Question

Remdesivir affect p450

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether remdesivir meaningfully affects cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and what the clinical implications are for drug–drug interactions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about remdesivir's primary metabolic pathways and whether CYPs are central or peripheral. Then, I should verify in vitro CYP inhibition data and reconcile them with clinical interaction studies. Next, I will review authoritative labeling and guidelines for clinically significant interactions. After that, I should consider special populations and edge cases that might alter risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable conclusion with monitoring advice and exceptions to keep in mind.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology. Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes rapid hydrolysis to GS-704277, followed by further metabolism to GS-441524, and then intracellular phosphorylation to the active triphosphate GS-443902; importantly, the predominant route is hydrolysis rather than oxidative CYP metabolism, which already suggests limited CYP liability in vivo [^115VEz9J] [^117BTqaM].

> Wait, let me verify the CYP substrate profile. In vitro, remdesivir shows weak CYP3A inhibition and is a substrate for CYP3A, CES1, and CatA, but this is not reflected in clinically meaningful interactions; the FDA labeling explicitly states no clinically significant drug interactions are expected with CYP3A inducers or inhibitors, and it characterizes remdesivir as a weak CYP3A inhibitor without clinical consequence, which aligns with its rapid clearance and minimal systemic exposure to parent drug [^112zapFW] [^117BTqaM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should double-check the clinical interaction data. Dedicated drug–drug interaction studies summarized in the FDA label show no clinically significant effects on CYP3A substrates, and major society guidance (e.g. IDSA) highlights remdesivir's favorable interaction profile compared with ritonavir-boosted regimens, reinforcing that routine CYP-mediated interaction management is not required with remdesivir [^112zapFW] [^112UpQoz].

> I need to check for any exceptions or edge cases. The only labeled interaction of concern is antagonism with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine based on cell culture, not CYP effects; mechanistically, this appears to interfere with intracellular activation rather than hepatic CYP metabolism, so it is a different class of concern altogether [^112zapFW] [^112UsYvF].

> Next, I should review special populations. In hepatic impairment, exposures to remdesivir and GS-441524 are modestly altered but not considered clinically significant; in renal impairment, accumulation of the excipient (betadex sulfobutyl ether) is the issue, not CYP-related toxicity, and the U.S. label advises against use when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min for that reason; pediatric PK shows broadly similar exposures to adults, again without CYP-driven interaction concerns [^111EjXe3] [^115V9Khh] [^114LHUQY].

> But wait, what if a patient is on a narrow therapeutic index CYP3A substrate — should I still be concerned? The in vitro CYP3A inhibition is weak and transient, and the rapid hydrolysis and distribution of remdesivir limit sustained CYP effects; nonetheless, if a patient is on a high-risk substrate (e.g., certain immunosuppressants), a quick check of interaction resources is reasonable, yet major guidelines still prefer remdesivir over ritonavir-boosted therapy in transplant populations precisely to avoid potent CYP3A interactions, which supports the low practical risk here [^112bKpLX] [^111GN89j].

> I should confirm safety signals that could be confused with CYP effects. Transaminase elevations and bradycardia have been reported with remdesivir, but these are not CYP-mediated drug–drug interactions; they reflect intrinsic hepatic sensitivity and potential accumulation or effects of metabolites, so they warrant baseline and on-treatment LFT monitoring and cardiac vigilance rather than CYP interaction management [^112UsYvF] [^111igAEy] [^1141nXPV].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis. Mechanistically, remdesivir's clearance is dominated by hydrolysis; in vitro CYP3A signals are weak and not translated into clinically meaningful interactions; authoritative labeling and guidelines do not require routine CYP-based interaction screening; and the only consistent interaction warning is non-CYP antagonism with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, which should be avoided [^117BTqaM] [^112zapFW] [^112UsYvF].

> Final clinical take: No, remdesivir does not meaningfully affect CYP450 activity in a way that mandates routine interaction management; standard precautions include avoiding coadministration with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, monitoring liver enzymes during therapy, and using caution in severe renal impairment due to excipient accumulation; beyond that, routine CYP interaction checks are unnecessary, though a quick verification is sensible when patients are on high-risk narrow therapeutic index drugs [^112zapFW] [^112UsYvF] [^115V9Khh].

Remdesivir is **not a clinically significant inhibitor or inducer** of cytochrome P450 enzymes [^116DQqRR]. In vitro, it shows weak CYP3A inhibition, but this does not translate into meaningful clinical interactions [^112zapFW] [^116DQqRR]. No dose adjustments are needed for CYP substrates, and remdesivir is preferred over nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients with complex regimens or when CYP interactions are a concern [^112bKpLX]. Monitor liver function during therapy due to potential transaminase elevations, but CYP-mediated drug interactions are not expected [^112UsYvF] [^116DQqRR].

---

## Pharmacokinetic profile of remdesivir

Remdesivir is a **nucleotide analog prodrug** that undergoes rapid hydrolysis to GS-704277, followed by phosphorylation to the active triphosphate metabolite, GS-443902 [^115VEz9J]. The parent drug is rapidly cleared from plasma, while GS-441524 has a longer half-life (~27 hours) and is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine [^111gjAPE]. This metabolism is largely independent of CYP enzymes, limiting the potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions [^114DpXaH].

---

## In vitro studies on CYP interactions

In vitro studies show that remdesivir is a **weak inhibitor of CYP3A** and does not significantly inhibit other CYP isoforms [^117BTqaM]. It is also a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MATE1, but no clinically significant effects on substrates of these transporters have been observed [^117BTqaM] [^112zapFW]. These findings indicate minimal potential for CYP-mediated drug interactions.

---

## Clinical studies and drug interaction data

Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that remdesivir **does not cause clinically significant CYP-mediated drug interactions** [^116DQqRR]. The FDA labeling explicitly states that no clinically significant drug interactions are expected with CYP inducers or inhibitors [^notfound]. This is supported by pharmacokinetic studies showing no meaningful changes in exposure to co-administered CYP substrates.

---

## Comparison with other antiviral medications

Compared with other antiviral medications, remdesivir has a **favorable interaction profile**. For example, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) contains ritonavir, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, which can cause significant drug interactions requiring careful management [^112UpQoz]. In contrast, remdesivir's minimal CYP interaction potential makes it a safer option for patients with complex medication regimens [^112zapFW].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given its minimal CYP interaction potential, remdesivir is **suitable for patients** taking multiple medications, including immunosuppressants, anticoagulants, and antiepileptics [^112zapFW]. However, clinicians should remain vigilant for potential hepatic adverse effects, as remdesivir has been associated with transaminase elevations [^112UsYvF]. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended during treatment [^112UsYvF].

## Summary of remdesivir's CYP interaction profile

| **Parameter** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| CYP inhibition | Weak inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro; no clinically significant interactions observed [^117BTqaM] [^112zapFW] |
| CYP induction | No significant induction of CYP enzymes observed [^116DQqRR] |
| Clinical interactions | No clinically significant CYP-mediated drug interactions reported [^112zapFW] |
| Hepatic effects | Transaminase elevations reported; monitor liver function tests [^112UsYvF] |

Remdesivir is **not a clinically significant inhibitor or inducer** of cytochrome P450 enzymes [^116DQqRR]. Its metabolism is largely independent of CYP enzymes, minimizing the risk of CYP-mediated drug interactions [^114DpXaH]. Clinicians should monitor liver function during treatment, but no dose adjustments are necessary for co-administered CYP substrates [^notfound].

Considerations for antiviral drug selection

There are key differences in drug effectiveness, profile of adverse effects, and other factors among the 3 authorized or approved antiviral medications (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir) that inform tailored drug selection. Several clinical considerations are outlined in Table 1. Of note, much of the antiviral effectiveness data were generated from studies of unvaccinated populations and/or preceded the contemporary SARS-CoV-2 variant era; real-world data continue to accrue.

Table 1.
Major Considerations and Comparison Among United States FDA Authorized or Approved Antivirals to Treat COVID-19 in the Outpatient Setting

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has shown high effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes in older individuals and those with incomplete vaccination. A key consideration in prescribing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is ensuring careful assessment of possible drug–drug interactions because ritonavir potently affects the activity of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes; the effect may also endure after drug discontinuation during enzyme regeneration. Several excellent resources are available for point-of-care reference to avoid and reduce clinically important interactions including those stewarded by the University of Liverpool and National Institutes of Health treatment guidelines; notably, in the United States, licensed pharmacists are permitted to prescribe nirmatrelvir/ritonavir after medication review. Important drug classes to consider include immunosuppressants (eg, tacrolimus), antiarrhythmics (eg, amiodarone), antiepileptics (eg, phenytoin), anticoagulants (eg, direct-acting oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban), and lipid-lowering medications (eg, atorvastatin). Additionally, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not recommended for individuals with severe decompensated liver disease or renal impairment because of limited safety and efficacy data in these patient populations; there are dose adjustments for persons with moderate chronic kidney disease. In sum, primary considerations for use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for a high-risk individual include manageability of drug–drug interactions and assessment of end-organ function. The phenomenon of "rebound" syndromes after antiviral discontinuation is later discussed in "Additional Considerations".

### PaxlovidInformation from FDA and guidance for AES members [^115gXY7W]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Considerations for Patients on Antiseizure Medications

There are two major considerations when Paxlovid is given to patients taking some antiseizure medications (ASMs), consistent with previously documented interactions of ASMs and antiretroviral drugs, including ritonavir. The first major consideration is the effect of some ASMs on Paxlovid. The ASMs carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone (although primidone is not listed in the EUA) are contraindicated, because they are strong inducers of the CYP3A4 isozymes that metabolize Paxlovid. Due to the strong enzymatic induction caused by these medications, there is concern for possible loss of virologic response to Paxlovid and development of resistance.

Paxlovid needs to be started soon after diagnosis of COVID-19. Clinically, if patients were to stop taking these strong enzyme-inducing ASMs, the time-dependent process of de-induction of CYP3A4 isozymes would take more time than is likely feasible, so other treatments for COVID-19, including molnupiravir or IV therapies like remdesivir, may be appropriate. The EUA for molnupiravir, another COVID-19 oral therapy for patients ≥ 18 years old, states that the drug is not a substrate of CYP enzymes or major drug transporters, and in vitro studies do not suggest inhibitory actions.

### Interactions of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir, with common anesthesia drugs [^116Pzpix]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ritonavir has been used for decades for human immunovirus (HIV) infection in adults and children. It inhibits the HIV proteases that are necessary to cleave long protein chain precursors into mature smaller infectious HIV proteins. The consequent cytochrome P‐450 (CYP) 3A inhibition and its implication for anesthesia providers are described. Interest in this drug has resurfaced because antiviral agents (e.g. remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir) have gained prominence for community‐based early management of proven COVID‐19 infection. Nirmatrelvir is combined with the protease inhibitor, ritonavir, that slows the metabolism of nirmatrelvir viainhibition. When used as combination therapy with ritonavir, nirmatrelvir half‐life is doubled. The inclusion of ritonavir in any drug combination is likely to create complexities and restrictions for its use.

Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP 3A, an enzyme system that comprises the majority of adult human liver cytochrome P‐450 and metabolizes a broad range of drugs, including those commonly used in anesthesia. Resources are available that detail ritonavir interactions where raised substrate drug concentrations are associated with serious and/or life‐threatening reactions or when potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance may occur. These interactions are often based on in vitro information, are poorly quantified for many drugs used in anesthesia and were reported with higher doses associated with ritonavir use for human immunodeficiency virus treatment when compared with those currently used for viral COVID‐19 management. Table 1 demonstrates drugs relevant to pediatric anesthesia with current anesthesia practice recommendations.

TABLE 1
Ritonavir effect on commonly used anesthetic drugs. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A and a weaker inhibitor of CYP 2D6 mediated metabolism. Ritonavir is an inducer of CYP 1A2, CYP 2B6, glucuronosyl transferase (UGT), and possibly CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19. There are no known interactions of ritonavir with those plasma esterases responsible for metabolizing remifentanil.

### A novel PLpro inhibitor improves outcomes in a pre-clinical model of long COVID [^114a7sz3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) affects approximately one-third of non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients. It is estimated that over 77 million people have experienced continuation or development of new symptoms after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. PASC presents a complex and persistent health condition that is primarily driven by a sustained dysregulated host immune response and continues to affect patients with a wide range of physical and psychological consequences. Collectively, PASC not only significantly affects individual patients, but also impacts the healthcare system and societal structures. There are currently no available treatments for patients suffering from PASC.

The lack of effective antivirals against CoVs early in the pandemic was problematic and preventable. The first antiviral treatments approved for emergency use for COVID-19 included RNA polymerase inhibitors remdesivirand molnupiravir, however, their effectiveness was limited. A more efficacious antiviral, Paxlovid, was approved in late 2021and has since been widely used. Paxlovid targets the essential CoV main protease (Mpro), an enzyme required to cleave viral polypeptides into functional proteins. In Paxlovid, the Mpro inhibitor nirmatrelviris paired with the pharmacokinetic enhancer ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor required to extend the half-life of nirmatrelvir. However, due to this CYP3A4 inhibition not all patients can safely access Paxlovid, with potential for unwanted drug-drug interactions. Antivirals without this CYP3A liability would expand treatment options to greater patient cohorts. Paxlovid has not shown any efficacy in preventing or reversing PASC. Alternative Mpro inhibitors have been reported, but so far, none have been approved by the FDA.

### Hepatic disorders with the use of remdesivir for coronavirus 2019 [^115Mbacz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog prodrug with antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of human coronavirus in cell cultures and mouse models including severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2. Recently, the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended remdesivir for the treatment of patients hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. 1, 2 In the remdesivir clinical development program, some cases have raised concerns regarding potential hepatobiliary disorders associated with remdesivir, including in healthy volunteers and patients with COVID-19. 3 In cohort studies of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, elevated hepatic enzymes were the most frequent adverse drug reaction reported. 4, 5 In the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the effect of intravenous remdesivir in adults admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 (n = 237), a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients had dosing prematurely stopped by the investigators because of adverse events including aminotransferase or bilirubin increases (3 versus 0). 6 Although there is no signal from the available data of severe hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver injury in clinical trials, the number of patients exposed to remdesivir was too limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the hepatic safety profile associated with remdesivir in COVID-19 patients.

### Why bother about cytochrome P450 enzymes? [^114wCZ9J]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2000). Low credibility.

The cytochrome P450 system is a group of enzymes, found mainly in the liver and gut mucosa, that controls the concentrations of many endogenous substances and drugs. The activity of the individual enzymes can vary over time and from person to person in response to diet, medicines or exposure to environmental pollutants. Here, we review the cytochrome P450 system and consider its relevance to prescribing.

### Multivalent bicyclic peptides are an effective antiviral modality that can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [^115Qvi3M]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Small molecule antivirals offer potential advantages over antibody therapeutics. They are cheaper, more stable, and frequently orally bioavailable. During the early months of the pandemic, huge multinational effort was initiated to repurpose already approved antiviral or immunosuppressive drugs. One such drug was remdesivir, a nucleoside analog chain terminator that blocks replication of viral RNA. Initial studies reported clinical improvement after treatment of hospitalized patients with remdesivir –, but larger clinical trials, such as the WHO Solidarity Trial, revealed no reduction in severe COVID-19 symptoms or mortality. Remdesivir has been shown to be effective in mild disease, however, treatment requires intravenous administration in a hospital setting and current WHO recommendations are for use in severe but not critical disease. Another repurposed antiviral that has been approved for SARS-CoV-2 is molnupiravir (Merck), which is orally bioavailable and also targets RdRp but leads to lethal mutagenesis during RNA replication. Molnupiravir showed promising results in Phase I and II human clinical trials, but final Phase III findings revealed only modest reductions in hospitalization from 9.7% to 6.8%. A second oral therapeutic, also repurposed, is the viral 3 C protease/M pro inhibitor nirmatrelvir (Pfizer), which is combined with ritonavir to boost plasma concentrations via inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 mediated metabolism. Interim results for Phase II-III studies showed an 89% reduced hospitalization risk when initiated within three days of symptom onset. Nirmatrelvir uses a covalent nitrile warhead, meaning it is possible for off-target reactions with nucleophilic residues in host proteinsor drug-drug interactions, the latter of which prohibit its use in children or those taking other medicines. Overall, the development of small molecules has been considerably slower than antibodies and entirely based on existing chemical templates that were already known and well-characterized as viral inhibitors before the pandemic. As for monoclonal antibodies, multiple routes of resistance escape have been described to emerge under a selective pressure in vitro for small-molecule drugs, and the resistance liability is yet to be fully understood.

### Remdesivir (Veklury) [^117Y1YJN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Remdesivir is an antiviral drug with activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Exposure-Response

Remdesivir and metabolites exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At 3 times the maximum recommended dose, clinically significant QTc interval prolongation was not observed.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of remdesivir and metabolites are provided in Table 14. The multiple dose PK parameters of remdesivir and metabolites in adults with COVID-19 are provided in Table 15.

Specific Populations

Pharmacokinetic differences based on sex, race, age, and renal function on the exposures of remdesivir were evaluated using population pharmacokinetic analysis. Sex and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its metabolites (GS-441524 and GS-704277).

Pregnant Individuals

The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its circulating metabolites (GS-441524 and GS-704277) were evaluated in pregnant individuals with COVID-19. Exposures (AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau) of remdesivir and its circulating metabolites during pregnancy were similar to those in non-pregnant individuals (see Table 16).

### Impact and management of COVID-19 in liver transplant candidates and recipients [^112bKpLX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should be aware of the potential drug–drug interactions and overlapping toxicities between treatment regimens for COVID-19 and concomitant medications. Adjustment of the immunosuppressive therapy should be individualized based on COVID-19 severity, the type of immunosuppressants, the type of transplant, the time since transplantation, and the risk of graft rejection. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus, sirolimus) have a narrow therapeutic index. Medications that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or P-glycoprotein may result in clinically significant drug–drug interactions, requiring therapeutic drug monitoring. Non-hospitalized LT patients who are receiving calcineurin or mTOR inhibitors should be administered either an anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb or remdesivir as first-line therapy. Recent data suggest that the administration of remdesivir for 3 days reduces the risk of hospitalization/death by 87%. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may be given with caution. The reintroduction or dose adjustment of calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors in patients who have completed therapy with ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be guided by therapeutic drug monitoring, as shown in Table 3. Clinicians should refer to resources such as the Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions website, and "Drug-Drug Interactions Between Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir".

Table 3
Special precautions when using RBN in LT patients receiving CNI or mTOR inhibitor

As mentioned above, observational studies have shown that immunosuppressive therapy containing tacrolimus is associated with better survival in LT patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, mycophenolate is an independent factor for severe COVID-19. Lowering immunosuppression, primarily antimetabolites, in LT recipients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been shown to increase the risk of rejection, as long as liver biochemistries are regularly monitored. AST recommends holding MMF with active COVID-19 infection for 5–10 days, or until symptoms resolve, and then restarting as tolerated. Lowering the dosage or stopping immunosuppressants without monitoring liver biochemistries may cause a flare, especially in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), or precipitate acute rejection. Some studies indicated that, after adjustment for multiple risk factors, LT recipients may not be at significantly greater risk of death compared to the general population with COVID-19.

### Hepatobiliary adverse drug reactions associated with remdesivir: the WHO international pharmacovigilance study [^1132uR4n]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Remdesivir has demonstrated clinical benefits in randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 1–4 and was first approved for COVID-19 patients. 5 However, whether remdesivir causes gastrointestinal adverse drug reaction (GI-ADRs) including hepatotoxicity is less clear. 1–4, 6 Therefore, we aimed to detect a diverse spectrum of GI-ADRs associated with remdesivir using VigiBase, the World Health Organization's international pharmacovigilance database of individual case safety reports.

### Neurological side effects and drug interactions of antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2 [^1145pMKb]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rapidly spread across the globe. Tremendous efforts have been mobilized to create effective antiviral treatment options to reduce the burden of the disease. This article summarizes the available knowledge about the antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 from a neurologist's perspective.

Methods

We summarize neurological aspects of antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2 with full, conditional, or previous marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Results

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir targets the SARS-CoV-2 3c-like protease using combinatorial chemistry. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir levels are affected by medications metabolized by or inducing CYP3A4, including those used in neurological diseases. Dysgeusia with a bitter or metallic taste is a common side effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Molnupiravir is a nucleotide analog developed to inhibit the replication of viruses. No clinically significant interactions with other drugs have been identified, and no specific considerations for people with neurological comorbidity are required. In the meantime, inconsistent results from clinical trials regarding efficacy have led to the withdrawal of marketing authorization by the EMA. Remdesivir is a viral RNA polymerase inhibitor and interferes with the production of viral RNA. The most common side effect in patients with COVID-19 is nausea. Remdesivir is a substrate for CYP3A4.

Conclusions

Neurological side effects and drug interactions must be considered for antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are required to better evaluate their efficacy and adverse events in patients with concomitant neurological diseases. Moreover, evidence from real-world studies will complement the current knowledge.

Antivirals

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is an oral antiviral indicated for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Importantly, surveillance data showed that the emergence of resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is infrequent (< 0.3%–1.1%). Concurrent patients' medications must be carefully assessed because ritonavir is a potent P4503A4 inhibitor that can cause clinically significant drug–drug interactions.

Remdesivir is an intravenous antiviral agent used for COVID-19, which is indicated both for mild and moderate/severe settings. In the mild/moderate setting, remdesivir is administered within seven days from symptom onset and for 3 days. Being available only as intravenous formulation makes remdesivir less convenient for outpatient use compared with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The second indication is COVID-19-related pneumonia, administered for 5–10 days. In a recent retrospective analysis of all-cause mortality in HM, HCT, or SOT patients, the administration of remdesivir within two days from hospitalization was associated with lower 14-day and 28-day mortality both in patients with and without oxygen dependence. A high barrier to resistance has been reported in vitro and in vivo. Advantages of remdesivir include lack of major drug-drug interactions, and the possibility of use in patients with renal failure including those receiving dialysis.

APPROVED AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES

Veklury (remdesivir) is FDA-approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (at least 28 days old and weighing at least 3 kg) who are not hospitalized and have mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Veklury is administered via intravenous infusion for a total treatment duration of 3 days.

Although Veklury is an approved alternative to LAGEVRIO for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, FDA does not consider Veklury to be an adequate alternative to LAGEVRIO for this authorized use because it may not be feasible or clinically appropriate for certain patients (e.g., it requires a 3-day intravenous treatment duration).

Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets; ritonavir tablets co-packaged for oral use) is FDA-approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Paxlovid is administered orally for a total treatment duration of 5 days. Although Paxlovid is an approved alternative to LAGEVRIO for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, FDA does not consider Paxlovid to be an adequate alternative to LAGEVRIO for this authorized use because it may not be clinically appropriate for patients on medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and/or that are strong CYP3A inducers.

### Pharmacogenomics and COVID-19: clinical implications of human genome interactions with repurposed drugs [^1156rqhb]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an emergent global pandemic. Many drugs without established efficacy are being used to treat COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial. Although drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost, there is a need to make predictions on success before the start of therapy. For the optimum use of these repurposed drugs, many factors should be considered such as drug-gene or dug-drug interactions, drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity. There is limited data on the pharmacogenomics of these agents and this may constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy. This article reviewed the available human genome interactions with some promising repurposed drugs for COVID-19 management. These drugs include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), atazanavir (ATV), favipiravir (FVP), nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), oseltamivir, remdesivir, anakinra, tocilizumab (TCZ), eculizumab, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) regulators, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide. Drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19 patients are presented. The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in clinical efficacy include CQ/HCQ (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, ACE2, and HO-1); azithromycin (ABCB1); LPV/r (SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCC2 and CYP3A); NVP (ABCC10); oseltamivir (CES1 and ABCB1); remdesivir (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and OATP1B1); anakinra (IL-1a); and TCZ (IL6R and FCGR3A). The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in adverse effects include CQ/HCQ (G6PD; hemolysis and ABCA4; retinopathy), ATV (MDR1 and UGT1A1*28; hyperbilirubinemia; and APOA5; dyslipidemia), NVP (HLA-DRB1*01, HLA-B✱3505 and CYP2B6; skin rash and MDR1; hepatotoxicity), and EFV (CYP2B6; depression and suicidal tendencies).

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines — remdesivir recommendations state: The guideline panel suggests remdesivir for patients with mild-to-moderate disease who are at high risk for severe COVID-19. The guideline panel suggests remdesivir rather than no remdesivir for treatment of severe COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air; however, the guideline panel suggests against the routine initiation of remdesivir among patients on invasive ventilation and/or ECMO. Prescribing information in the United States recommends against use of remdesivir in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute, arising from concern about accumulation of the excipient (betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium) with potential for hepatic and renal toxicity.

### Prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at risk for progression to severe disease [^113NKrsB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The availability of outpatient treatment options for COVID-19, such as nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and monoclonal antibodies, raises hopes for reducing COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality. Among these options, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid)may be preferred for most high-risk patients because of the convenience of oral dosing and its high efficacy vs placebo in reducing hospitalization or death, as reported in a phase 2/3 trial.

However, there are circumstances in which nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should not be used, due to the effect of ritonavir. Ritonavir may elevate the concentrations of drugs highly dependent on hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) metabolism, potentially resulting in serious reactions. Conversely, coadministration with potent CYP3A inducers can significantly reduce nirmatrelvir concentrations, potentially leading to the loss of virologic response. Furthermore, patients with severe kidney impairment and severe liver impairment were excluded from the clinical trials. These medical contraindications may be prevalent in patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease, as suggested by a recent study.

We examined the prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We hypothesized that the rate would be high in these patients.

### Is there more to learn about cytochrome P450 enzymes? [^114mBcyS]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

The cytochrome P450 system is a group of enzymes, found mainly in the liver and gut mucosa, that plays a crucial role in controlling the concentrations of many endogenous substances and drugs.1 The activity of the individual enzymes can vary over time and from person to person in response to diet, medicines or exposure to environmental pollutants. It has been almost 15 years since DTB reviewed the significance of the cytochrome P450 system and its relevance to prescribing (Why bother about cytochrome p450 enzymes?).1 A lot has changed in healthcare over that time, but has our understanding of this important aspect of drug metabolism altered significantly? Here we provide a brief overview of the function of cytochrome P450 enzymes and look at some of the concepts that have become established, or have begun to emerge, since the publication of our previous article.

### Antifungal prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients: an observational study [^114Jt1W3]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We observed that mould-active antifungal prophylaxis for patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure admitted to the ICU was highly effective in preventing CAPA. In patients without antifungal prophylaxis, CAPA was diagnosed in 17.5% versus only in 1.4% of those receiving prophylaxis, representing a reduction in relative risk for development of CAPA of 92% in the prophylaxis group and a number needed to receive prophylaxis of 7 to prevent one CAPA case. These results outline the efficacy of prophylaxis with posaconazole. While CAPA was associated with significantly higher mortality, antifungal prophylaxis did not have a significant impact on overall survival.

In our study, mould active antifungal prophylaxis resulted in a > 90% reduction of CAPA, outlining the effectiveness of antimould prophylaxis in this setting. After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, the positive effect of mould active antifungal prophylaxis was even stronger. The vast majority of patients in our study received posaconazole prophylaxis, the current gold standard for antifungal prophylaxis in patients with haematological malignancies. Posaconazole and particularly its newer tablet and intravenous formulations have several advantages compared to other drugs that are used for prophylaxis, starting with favourable pharmacokinetics, long half live and high intracellular concentrations. Voriconazole and isavuconazole are predominantly metabolized by the CYP enzyme system resulting in higher rates of drug–drug interactions, when compared to posaconazole which is metabolized predominantly through the uridine diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase enzyme pathways. Voriconazole is in fact among the drugs most frequently associated with major drug-drug interactions in the ICU setting, and may also show interactions with remdesivir which also is a substrate for CYP3A4, although its metabolism is primarily mediated by hydrolase activity. Administration of intravenous liposomal Amphotericin B is complicated by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has shown renal tropism and has been described as a frequent cause of acute kidney injury. Inhaled amphotericin B may be an alternative for prophylaxis of CAPA but lacks regulatory approval in this application and has been associated with severe adverse events. Therefore, posaconazole seems for now an appropriate choice for CAPA prophylaxis, although isavuconazole may be an alternative. New antifungal classes currently under development, namely fosmanogepix and olorofim, which show equal efficacy with minimal drug–drug interactions and toxicity in current phase IIb studies may become options/alternatives soon.

Antiviral Therapy

Lopinavir, a protease inhibitor, is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and was therefore combined with ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, to enhance its efficacy. Lopinavir/ritonavir has strong drug interactions with AADs (Figure 2). Lopinavir is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the gastrointestinal tract, with minimal renal excretion but significant nephrotoxicity (Table). Ritonavir is also a strong P‐glycoprotein inhibitor and may potentially interact with anticoagulants 24 (Figure 4).

Nucleotide analogs that inhibit RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, such as remdesivir (adenosine analog), ribavirin (guanosine analog), and favipiravir (purine analog), are being studied in COVID‐19 patients. Remdesivir is mainly metabolized by hydrolase and partially metabolized by CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Remdesivir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro, but no clinically significant drug interaction is documented, likely because of its rapid clearance 25 (Table). Ribavirin is metabolized by non–organ‐specific phosphorylation and renally excreted without CYP metabolism. 4, 26 Ribavirin does not have documented interaction with AAD but elevates international normalized ratio when used with warfarin by unclear mechanisms. 4, 27 Favipiravir was approved for influenza treatment in Japan. It is metabolized by oxidase and excreted in the urine. 28 Cardiovascular adverse effects are not yet established. 4

Umifenovir inhibits membrane fusion of viral envelope targeting the S‐protein/angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 interaction. It is approved in China and Russia. It is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and excreted by gastrointestinal tract. 29 There is no documented evidence of drug interaction between AAD and umifenovir. However, given its CYP3A4 substrate, plasma concentration of umifenovir may be increased with amiodarone, diltiazem, and verapamil (Table).

Interferon is a cytokine that has antiviral activity by interfering with viral replication and promoting activation of the adaptive immune system. Interferons undergo proteolytic degradation by lysosomal enzymes and are excreted in urine. 30 The cardiovascular adverse effects include nonspecific arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and hypotension. Their interaction with AADs is unknown. 4

TRANSLATION OF IN VITRO SYSTEMS

Antiviral potency, particularly the 90% inhibitory concentration estimated using cells infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro, is a key parameter underwriting drug design and repurposing. As such, it is critical to understand the factors that affect the translation of in vitro potency to the in vivo scenario. Differences in biological context between in vitro and in vivo systems can create apparent disparities in potency and confound effective pharmaceutical research. The examples of lopinavir and remdesivir provided by Boffito et al. serve as a good reminder for how differences in biological context between in vitro and in vivo systems may affect the drug concentration available at the site of action. Some aspects, like differences in the unbound fraction of lopinavir in vitro and in vivo, are common and straightforward to measure. Other aspects, like the rate and extent of intracellular remdesivir activation, are less common and more difficult to measure. Beyond those covered in these examples, many other mechanisms of drug disposition may differ between in vitro and in vivo systems. One that may be particularly relevant, given the widespread use of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected VeroE6 cells, is efflux via P‐gp. Boras et al. have very recently reported a decrease in antiviral half‐maximal inhibitory concentration of > 100‐fold for the investigational protease inhibitor, PF‐00835231, in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected VeroE6 cells in the presence of a P‐gp inhibitor. Consistent with relatively low expression of P‐gp in the lungs, this potency was very similar to that determined in more physiologically relevant cell lines (e.g. A549‐ACE2 and polarized human airway epithelial cells). Interestingly, the lopinavir example of Boffito et al. is a known P‐gp substrate, and this has been shown to affect intracellular lopinavir distribution cell lines expressing P‐gp. Although it would seemingly contradict recent clinical resultsand the reported potency in more physiologically relevant Calu‐3 cells, a significant P‐gp related shift in lopinavir potency in SARS‐CoV2 infected VeroE6 cells could paint a more optimistic picture of potential antiviral efficacy in the lungs than that previously provided. Of course, biological context can affect antiviral potency in ways that are independent of drug disposition (e.g. cell type, multiplicity of infection, duration of infection, and timing of treatment relative to infection). Although this aspect receives comparatively less focus, much can be learned from other therapeutic areas regarding the biological factors that affect potency between in vitro and in vivo systems. Given the number of potentially confounding factors, it is of little surprise that clinically effective concentrations across a wide range of therapeutics are often not simply related to apparent in vitro measures of potency without consideration of differences in biological context between systems.

### SARS-CoV-2 and the liver: clinical and immunological features in chronic liver disease [^115GgekR]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-induced acute liver injury in healthy individuals. Acute liver injury can have different reasons including microvascular thrombosis, hypoxaemia, drug toxicity, inflammatory cytokines or direct viral infection of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, which express ACE2. The presence of comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension, is associated with more severe liver injury. S1, spike protein subunit 1; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease serine subtype 2.

SARS-CoV-2-induced liver injury can also be immune-mediated. SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals display higher levels of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) or IFN-gamma (IFNγ) and, notably, levels of CXCL10, CCL2 and TNFα are higher in patients with severe disease treated at the intensive care unit (ICU). This hypercytokinaemia can contribute to endothelial dysfunction and increased generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in capillary leakage syndrome and subsequent hepatic cell injury by hypoperfusion (reviewed in Anirvan et al).

For SARS-CoV-2 infection, several treatment options are available, including dexamethasone, baricitinib in combination with remdesivir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir that have all been shown to reduce mortality in symptomatically infected patients. However, some of these drugs may also cause liver injury. For example, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue RNA polymerase inhibitor, has been described to induce hepatocellular damage with elevated transaminases suggesting close monitoring of liver function tests especially in subjects with CLD. In contrast, other commonly used antiviral drugs such as the combination of nirmatrelvir (viral 3CL protease inhibitor) with ritonavir (cytochrome P450 inhibitor) or molnupiravir (impairs viral replication) have a favourable hepatic safety profile.

Taken together, acute liver injury in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be caused by different mechanisms including systemic inflammation, hypoxaemia, direct viral infection of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes as well as drug-induced liver injury. However, in our opinion, the systemic inflammatory response and drug-induced mechanisms appear to be more relevant than direct viral infection of liver cells in the development of liver injury. In consequence, the high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with liver function abnormalities corroborates the need for consistent monitoring of liver function in routine clinical practice.

### Identification of bradycardia following remdesivir administration through the US food and drug administration American college of medical toxicology COVID-19 toxic pharmacovigilance project [^1141nXPV]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

While cardiovascular events have been described from World Health Organization and FDA adverse event reporting system databases, and several individual case reports have described bradycardia associated with remdesivir within 2 to 5 days of treatment, the FACT Pharmacovigilance Project is one of the only large multicenter cohorts with HR data at each administration of remdesivir. Of the case reports that provided HR, 2 reported daily HR, and 1 case report of a single patient provided multiple HR values. A small, single-center prospective study found a significant decrease in diurnal HR of patients treated with remdesivir compared with controls at days 4 and 5 of treatment. A small, single-center retrospective study found a significantly higher incidence of bradycardia after treatment day 3 of those treated with remdesivir. Although minimum HR was not specifically provided in these prior reports, our data of mean minimum HR (Figure 2 A) are congruent with these reports and may indicate accumulation of GS-441524 or other cardioactive metabolites.

Due to variability in the frequency of documented vital signs across sites and levels of care, we chose time to first bradycardic episode and time to minimum HR as targets for time-to-event analysis. Although detailed vital sign trends are often not available in case reports of bradycardia following remdesivir, bradycardia was noted in several case reports after the second to fourth remdesivir dose in 19 cases including 5 cases in children. Three cases reported bradycardia within 24 hours of the 200-mg loading dose. In a single-center retrospective cohort of 473 patients, the incidence of bradycardia was higher after the third to fifth doses than after the first 2 doses. We found a median time to the first bradycardic episode of 23.4 hours. It is possible that in previous reports in the literature bradycardia was not noted until it was more pronounced. Still, a substantial number of patients had their time to first bradycardic episode in doses 2 to 5. The time to the first bradycardic episode was significantly shorter for patients aged 65 years or older. The reasons for this are unclear and may be multifactorial. While remdesivir is relatively quickly converted to active metabolites, GS-441524 is primarily eliminated in the urine. Decreased kidney clearance could result in accumulation of this metabolite and potentially explain this observed difference.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling of remdesivir and its metabolites to support dose selection for the treatment of pediatric patients with COVID-19 [^114LHUQY]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome, has been reported in children. This report summarizes development of a remdesivir physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that accurately describes observed adult remdesivir and metabolites exposure and predicts pediatric remdesivir and metabolites exposure. The adult PBPK model was applied to predict pediatric remdesivir and metabolites steady-state exposures using the Pediatric Population Model in SimCYP and incorporated the relevant physiologic and mechanistic information. Model development was based on adult phase I exposure data in healthy volunteers who were administered a 200-mg loading dose of remdesivir intravenous (IV) over 0.5 hours on Day 1, then 100-mg daily maintenance doses of IV over 0.5 hours starting on Day 2 and continuing through Days 5 or 10. Simulations indicated that use of the adult therapeutic remdesivir dosage regimen (200-mg loading dose on Day 1 then 100-mg daily maintenance dose starting on Day 2) in pediatric patients ≥ 40 kg and a weight-based remdesivir dosage regimen (5-mg/kg loading dose on Day 1 then 2.5-mg/kg daily maintenance dose starting on Day 2) in pediatric patients weighing 2.5 to < 40 kg is predicted to maintain therapeutic exposures of remdesivir and its metabolites. The comprehensive PBPK model described in this report supported remdesivir dosing in planned pediatric clinical studies and dosing in the emergency use authorization and pediatric compassionate use programs that were initiated to support remdesivir as a treatment option during the pandemic.

### Whole body PBPK modeling of remdesivir and its metabolites to aid in estimating active metabolite exposure in the lung and liver in patients with organ dysfunction [^113WNsDV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Remdesivir (RDV) is the first drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in certain patients requiring hospitalization. As a nucleoside analogue prodrug, RDV undergoes intracellular multistep activation to form its pharmacologically active species, GS-443902, which is not detectable in the plasma. A question arises that whether the observed plasma exposure of RDV and its metabolites would correlate with or be informative about the exposure of GS-443902 in tissues. A whole body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation approach was utilized to elucidate the disposition mechanism of RDV and its metabolites in the lungs and liver and explore the relationship between plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics (PK) of RDV and its metabolites in healthy subjects. In addition, the potential alteration of plasma and tissue PK of RDV and its metabolites in patients with organ dysfunction was explored. Our simulation results indicated that intracellular exposure of GS-443902 was decreased in the liver and increased in the lungs in subjects with hepatic impairment relative to the subjects with normal liver function. In subjects with severe renal impairment, the exposure of GS-443902 in the liver was slightly increased, whereas the lung exposure of GS-443902 was not impacted. These predictions along with the organ impairment study results may be used to support decision making regarding the RDV dosage adjustment in these patient subgroups. The modeling exercise illustrated the potential of whole body PBPK modeling to aid in decision making for nucleotide analogue prodrugs, particularly when the active metabolite exposure in the target tissues is not available.

### Remdesivir (Veklury) [^111EjXe3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 were evaluated in healthy subjects and those with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) following a single dose of 100 mg of VEKLURY (see Table 19). Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, mean exposures (AUCinf, Cmax) of remdesivir and GS-441524 were similar in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. The exposure differences in subjects with severe hepatic impairment are not considered to be clinically significant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Pediatric Patients

Population pharmacokinetic models for remdesivir and its circulating metabolites (GS-441524 and GS-704277), developed using pooled data from studies in healthy subjects and in adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19, were used to estimate pharmacokinetic exposures in pediatric patients aged from birth to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 1.5 kg (Study 5823). Geometric mean estimated exposures (AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau) for patients ≥ 28 days to < 18 years old and weighing ≥ 3 kg (Cohorts 1–4 and 8, n = 50) at the doses administered were 33% to 130% higher for remdesivir, 3% lower to 60% higher for GS-441524, and 32% to 124% higher for GS-704277 as compared to those in adult patients with COVID-19; however, the increases were not considered clinically significant. Individual estimated exposures (AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau) for patients 14 to < 28 days old, GA > 37 weeks, and weighing ≥ 2.5 kg (Cohort 5, n = 3); patients < 14 days old, GA > 37 weeks, and weighing ≥ 2.5 kg at birth (Cohort 6, n = 1); and patients < 56 days old, GA ≤ 37 weeks, and weighing ≥ 1.5 kg at birth (Cohort 7, n = 1) at the doses administered were higher for remdesivir, GS-441524, and GS-704277 as compared to median exposures in adult patients with COVID-19; however, the increases were not considered clinically significant. As limited PK data were available in Cohorts 5–7, additional analyses were conducted using a simulated population.

Animal Data

Remdesivir was administered via intravenous injection to pregnant rats and rabbits (up to 20 mg/kg/day) on Gestation Days 6 through 17, and 7 through 20, respectively, and also to rats from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation/Post-partum Day 20. No adverse effects on embryo-fetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal (rats) development were observed in rats and rabbits at nontoxic doses in pregnant animals. During organogenesis, exposures to the predominant circulating metabolite (GS-441524) were 4 times higher (rats and rabbits) than the exposure in humans at the RHD. In a pre/postnatal development study, exposures to the predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir (GS-441524) were similar to the human exposures at the RHD.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

A published case report describes the presence of remdesivir and active metabolite GS-441524 in human milk. Available data (n = 11) from pharmacovigilance reports do not indicate adverse effects on breastfed infants from exposure to remdesivir and its metabolite through breastmilk. There are no available data on the effects of remdesivir on milk production. In animal studies, remdesivir and metabolites have been detected in the nursing pups of mothers given remdesivir, likely due to the presence of remdesivir in milk (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VEKLURY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from VEKLURY or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

Data

Remdesivir and its metabolites were detected in the plasma of nursing rat pups, likely due to the presence of remdesivir and/or its metabolites in milk, following daily intravenous administration of remdesivir to pregnant rats from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 20. Exposures in nursing pups were approximately 1% that of maternal exposure on Lactation Day 10. The concentration of remdesivir in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.

Remdesivir mechanism and antiviral activity — Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an antiviral drug with potent in vitro activity against a range of RNA viruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV 1 & 2; it acts by causing premature termination of viral RNA transcription, and in SARS-CoV-1 infected mice its use improved disease outcomes and reduced viral loads.

### Oral prodrug of remdesivir parent GS-441524 is efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets [^115QUSFN]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants such as VOC γ are a major concern because of their high prevalence and increased frequency of transmission. Ferrets infected with VOC γ did not develop more severe clinical signs than after infection with WA1/2020 and the virus did not advance to the lower respiratory tract, indicating that pathogenicity of this VOC is not fundamentally different from that of WA1/2020 in this model. Peak viral burden and shed virus loads of VOC γ-infected ferrets were equivalent to those of WA1/2020. Reflecting that analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOC worldwide has yielded no evidence of widespread transmission of remdesivir-resistant strains, GS-621763 and its metabolite GS-441524 were comparably potent against VOC α, β, and γ as against WA1/2020 in cell culture. Importantly, oral GS-621763 was highly efficacious against VOC γ in vivo, reducing infectious titers to near-undetectable levels rapidly after treatment initiation. Whole genome sequencing of GS-621763-experienced viruses recovered from treated ferrets likewise revealed no allele variations in candidate remdesivir resistance sites, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 does not rapidly escape from inhibition by GS-621763 in vivo.

Based on the high transmissibility of VOC γ in the field and very efficient direct-contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between ferrets, we assessed the impact of oral GS-621763 on VOC γ spread among ferrets. To recapitulate what we consider a realistic scenario for exploring pharmacological interference in community transmission, we therapeutically treated the infected source animals but left their contacts untreated. In this relevant experimental setting, treatment with the same GS-621763 dose of 10 mg/kg b.i.d. completely blocked transmission of VOC γ, resembling the performance of oral EIDD-2801/molnupiravir in the model.

These results build confidence that a new generation of orally available broad-spectrum antivirals is emerging that should allow initiation of treatment early after infection and promise to efficiently interrupt community transmission chains. In addition to immediately contributing to ending the COVID-19 pandemic and containing the continued evolution of increasingly contagious SARS-CoV-2 VOC –, an oral analog of the broad-spectrum antiviral drug remdesivir with confirmed in vivo efficacy may become a cornerstone in the first-line defense against future pandemic threats.

### Pharmacologic treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review [^115EA7jr]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment. Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection.

Observations

No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19.

Conclusions and Relevance

The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date.

Like for mAb, we think that treatment with antiviral drugs (within the investigated time interval after disease onset) is a valid option in immunosuppressed patients who are unvaccinated or not protected by vaccination, especially when the risk for a severe disease course is increased. Remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir appear to be most effective, but a major disadvantage of remdesivir is the need for i.v. administration. The use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is challenging because of severe drug–drug interactions due to the CYP3A inhibition by ritonavir, which can strongly increase the blood concentrations of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus even more than cyclosporine) and mTOR inhibitors. A useful source for information on these interactions is the Liverpool COVID-19 Drug Interactions website. A recommendation for how to manage these interactions has been published. In patients who are at relatively low risk of acute rejection, a pragmatic solution could be to discontinue calcineurin inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors during the 5-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and to resume the use of these drugs 2–3 days later. In addition, the use of remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are not recommended when estimated glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

In conclusion, there are effective antiviral agents available for the treatment of early COVID-19. However, the most efficacious agents either require i.v. administration (remdesevir) or have strong pharmacokinetic interactions with a wide array of other drugs (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir).

### Oral prodrug of remdesivir parent GS-441524 is efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets [^115MXsLW]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Although GS-443902 levels in ferret respiratory tissues after a single 30 mg/kg oral dose of GS-621763 trailed those of intravenous 10 mg/kg remdesivir by approximately fourfold at 24 h, a minimal daily oral dose of 20 mg/kg GS-621763 (10 mg/kg b.i.d.) provided full therapeutic benefit, rapidly reducing shed virus titers to near-undetectable. However, as the GS-443902 active metabolite is quantitated from gross tissue samples, we cannot compare GS-443902 levels resulting from either GS-621763 or remdesivir dosing in distinct respiratory cell types. If human oral bioavailability of GS-621763 is consistent with that observed in ferrets, and the model is predictive of antiviral potential, the dose levels identified in the ferret study as fully efficacious in upper respiratory tract correspond to a feasible human daily dose of approximately 250 mg oral GS-621763.

An observed difference of approximately two to three orders of magnitude between the infectious titers and viral RNA copy numbers in the ferrets closely resembled that described in earlier reports, demonstrating high reproducibility of the model. At present, the correlation between upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 load at early stages after human infection and the likelihood of progression to viral pneumonia and severe COVID-19 has not been fully understood. However, clinical studies have linked higher upper respiratory virus burden to a heightened patient risk of developing severe COVID-19, requiring intubation or intensive care, and having an unfavorable outcome. Based on these clinical data and the rapid reduction of upper respiratory virus burden seen in the ferret model, we expect that early initiation of oral treatment, ideally immediately following a positive diagnostic test and before the onset of clinical signs, holds high promise to block viral invasion of the lower respiratory tract and viral pneumonia that necessitates hospitalization.

### Remdesivir for COVID-19 in hospitalized children: a phase 2 / 3 study [^116APetM]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Remdesivir decreases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection progressing to severe disease in adults. This study evaluated remdesivir safety and pharmacokinetics in infants and children.

Methods

This was a phase 2/3, open-label trial in children aged 28 days to 17 years hospitalized for polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants received for ≤ 10 days once-daily intravenous remdesivir doses defined using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling (for ≥ 40 kg, 200 mg day 1, then 100 mg/day; for age ≥ 28 days and ≥ 3 to < 40 kg, 5 mg/kg day 1, then 2.5 mg/kg/day). Sparse pharmacokinetic samples were analyzed using population-pharmacokinetic approaches for remdesivir and metabolites GS-704277 and GS-441524.

Results

Among 53 participants, at enrollment the median (Q1, Q3) number of days of COVID-19 symptoms was 5 (3, 7) and hospitalization was 1 (1, 3). Underlying conditions included obesity in 19 (37%), asthma in 11 (21%), and cardiac disorders in 11 (21%). Median duration of remdesivir treatment was 5 days (range, 1–10). Remdesivir treatment had no new apparent safety trends. Two participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events including elevated transaminases; both had elevated transaminases at baseline. Three deaths occurred during treatment (and 1 after). When compared with phase 3 adult data, estimated mean pediatric parameters (area under the concentration-time curve over 1 dosing interval, AUCτ, Cmax, and Cτ) were largely overlapping but modestly increased (remdesivir, 33%-129%; GS-704277, 37%-124%; GS-441524, 0%-60%). Recovery occurred for 62% of participants on day 10 and 83% at last assessment.

Conclusions

In infants and children with COVID-19, the doses of remdesivir evaluated provided drug exposure similar to adult dosing. In this study with a small sample size, no new safety concerns were observed.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^114j7V95]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Drug interactions.

Drug–drug interaction is a problem associated with LT during the COVID-19 era. Patients who underwent LT are usually poly-medicated mainly with immunosuppressive drugs. Since a number of drugs used in COVID-19 have only been recently authorized, monitoring for potential drug interactions is important. Remdesivir has been approved by US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is potentially hepatotoxic and should be used with caution. Increased liver transaminase levels are a common adverse effect, and discontinuation of remdesivir infusions should be considered if elevations in ALT or AST above 10 times the upper limit of normal are noticed. Baseline LFTs should be done before initiation of therapy and these should be monitored closely during therapy. The concentration of remdesivir may be affected by enzyme inducers such as clarithromycin, rifampin, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Favipiravir increases the concentration of pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, paracetamol, oseltamivir, and hormonal replacement therapy, but does not have significant interactions with immunosuppressive medications or steroids. Paxlovid, an oral antiviral agent contains the protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir and a low dose of ritonavir. Ritonavir may cause liver injury and thus caution needs to be exercised when Paxlovid is considered for patients with liver enzyme abnormalities, hepatic inflammation, or preexisting liver diseases. Tociluzumab has minor interactions with ciclosporin, tacrolimus, and sirolimus. It may also reduce the concentrations of calcineurin inhibitors and drug level monitoring should be performed. Its use with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may produce additive toxicity. Tocilizumab has a myelosuppressive effect and it may thus potentiate hematological toxicity of ribavirin and interferon-beta if used together. In the setting of LT, interferon-beta has no interactions with immunosuppressive drugs or steroids. However, as it induces myelosuppression, it should not be combined with tocilizumab. Also, potential interaction with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may increase its toxicity.

### Remdesivir in COVID-19: a critical review of pharmacology, pre-clinical and clinical studies [^112bY6Yw]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Remdesivir is a broad spectrum anti-viral drug that has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, in vitro and in vivo. In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial. Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as "Remdesivir" or 'GS-5734″ AND "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2" and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.

Results

Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality.

Conclusions

Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials.

### Toward consensus on correct interpretation of protein binding in plasma and other biological matrices for COVID-19 therapeutic development [^113xJvA9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a drug in humans is a prerequisite for inclusion of regimens in clinical trials examining antiviral efficacy. Particular attention needs to be paid to in vitro inhibitory concentrations and ideally to using dosing regimens designed to achieve in vivo minimum effective concentrations in plasma (or intracellularly for nucleoside analogues like remdesivir or favipiravir). As the authors have emphasized above, care must be taken with interpretation of protein binding data where overly scrupulous application of in vitro data may discourage assessment of agents with therapeutic potential. Conversely, a lack of recognition of the impact of protein binding may promote evaluation of candidates that are not indicated. The current lack of an optimal pharmacodynamic parameter, such as quantitative viral load tests, has presented considerable difficulty in evaluating antiviral dosing regimens for SARS‐CoV‐2. Validation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models will undoubtedly allow better prediction of activity, via concentration‐response curves and maximum effect (E max) models, to rapidly select drugs based upon efficacy. While an adequate surrogate marker of efficacy is being developed, it is critical that the clinical trial community better utilize available pharmacokinetic and in vitro activity data to make informed, evidence‐based selection of candidate therapies and dosing schedules. Lessons from past mistakes and in vitro model systems demonstrate that standardization and integrated empirical assessment of the impact of protein binding is required. No in vitro assay or prior knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can guarantee the success of a therapeutic agent, but if drugs do not achieve effective concentrations in relevant compartments, the chances of success in clinical trials are limited.

Influenza antivirals and antiretroviral drug interactions — clinical data are limited with no clinical trials to date evaluating the safety or efficacy of using combinations of different classes of influenza antiviral drugs; pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies of oseltamivir suggest clinically significant drug interactions with antiretroviral (ARV) agents are unlikely, and since none of the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) affect cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes, no clinically significant drug interactions are predicted based on in vitro studies.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis

Given the short-term administration of VEKLURY for the treatment of COVID-19, long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of remdesivir were not conducted.

Remdesivir was not genotoxic in a battery of assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo rat micronucleus assays.

Impairment of Fertility

Nonclinical toxicity studies in rats demonstrated no adverse effect on male fertility at exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite (GS-441524) approximately 2 times the exposure in humans at the RHD.

Reproductive toxicity, including decreases in corpora lutea, numbers of implantation sites, and viable embryos, was seen when remdesivir was administered by daily intravenous administration at a systemically toxic dose (10 mg/kg) in female rats 14 days prior to mating and during conception; exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite (GS-441524) were 1.3 times the exposure in humans at the RHD.

13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology

Intravenous administration (slow bolus) of remdesivir to male rhesus monkeys at dosage levels of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day for 7 days resulted, at all dose levels, in increased mean urea nitrogen and increased mean creatinine, renal tubular atrophy, and basophilia and casts.

Intravenous administration (slow bolus) of remdesivir to rats at dosage levels of ≥ 3 mg/kg/day for up to 4 weeks resulted in findings indicative of kidney injury and/or dysfunction.

Kidney-related effects in rats and monkeys were observed at exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite (GS-441524) that are lower than the exposure in humans at the RHD.

### Clinical antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019: an open-label, randomized controlled adaptive platform trial (PLATCOV) [^113LB4Ly]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Remdesivir has been used extensively as a parenteral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in some regions, although therapeutic recommendations have varied widely. The initial clinical trials of remdesivir suggested clinical benefit in reduced duration of hospitalization but did not demonstrate an in vivo antiviral effect. Until early 2022 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended against use of remdesivir in treatment, largely based on lack of mortality reduction in the interim results from the WHO's multinational Solidarity trial, and many countries did not license remdesivir for use. The WHO recommendation against the use of remdesivir has now been reversed, with updated results from the WHO's Solidarity trial indicating a small benefit. It is now appreciated that antiviral medications are more effective early in COVID-19 infections when viral burdens are highest, and they provide less benefit later in the course of illness in hospitalized patients where anti-inflammatory interventions show life-saving benefit. In the majority of cases, hospitalization occurs after approximately 1 week from symptom onset (this was the population studied in the Solidarity trial) — administration of remdesivir early in the course of infection has been shown to prevent progression to severe disease in high-risk outpatients.

Large randomized controlled trials have since demonstrated the clinical efficacy of multiple small molecule drugs in the treatment of early COVID-19, notably molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. These oral medications are simpler to administer compared with intravenous remdesivir. However, drug–drug interactions, other contraindications, and availability of these oral medications mean that remdesivir retains clinical utility in select populations. Until now there has been no standardized method for assessing in vivo antiviral effects. Time to viral clearance is an insensitive measure that is highly dependent on baseline viral loads. The PLATCOV study (Finding treatments for COVID-19: a phase 2 multi-centre adaptive platform trial to assess antiviral pharmacodynamics in early symptomatic COVID-19) is a platform randomized trial aiming to provide a standardized assessment in vivo of candidate antiviral drugs by measuring rates of viral clearance. We report the antiviral activity of remdesivir in adults with early symptomatic COVID-19. The previously published clinical trials on remdesivir were conducted largely in unvaccinated patients infected with the early SARS-CoV-2 viral variants, which were more likely to result in hospitalization and severe outcomes than those prevalent today. This study was conducted in largely vaccinated individuals in a period that spanned the Delta and early Omicron variants.

### Impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) on cytochromes P450 activity assessed by the Geneva cocktail [^113rcdy4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), so named by the World Health Organization (WHO), emerged in late December 2019. It was identified as being caused by a coronavirus, which is a single‐stranded RNA virus, later entitled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2).

COVID‐19 presents as a respiratory infection with a broad spectrum of symptoms. A minority of patients will present a severe to critical disease that could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. The host inflammatory response has been hypothesized to play an important role in the severity of the disease, with, in severe cases of COVID‐19, an uncontrolled response of the immune system with massive release of proinflammatory cytokines. This life‐threatening response is characterized by high levels of cytokines and hyperactivation of immune cells, hence the proportionality found between markers of inflammation and disease severity. Indeed, elevated proinflammatory markers, including C‐reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ), interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, and IL‐10 levels, are proportional to COVID‐19 severity. Moreover, IL‐6 and TNF‐α were independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. Similarly, CRP correlated with disease severity and appeared to be a good predictor of adverse outcomes. Studies suggest that CRP levels are an excellent biomarker of the presence and severity of COVID‐19, with the advantages that CRP is routinely measured to assess inflammation in patients.

### Remdesivir (Veklury) [^112UsYvF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hypersensitivity Including Infusion-related and Anaphylactic Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including infusion-related and anaphylactic reactions, have been observed during and following administration of VEKLURY; most occurred within one hour. Signs and symptoms may include hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypoxia, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, angioedema, rash, nausea, diaphoresis, and shivering. Slower infusion rates, with a maximum infusion time of up to 120 minutes, can be considered to potentially prevent these signs and symptoms. Monitor patients during infusion and observe patients for at least one hour after infusion is complete for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity as clinically appropriate. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occur, immediately discontinue administration of VEKLURY and initiate appropriate treatment. The use of VEKLURY is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to VEKLURY or any components of the product [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2	Increased Risk of Transaminase Elevations

Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers who received 200 mg of VEKLURY followed by 100 mg doses for up to 10 days; the transaminase elevations were mild (Grade 1) to moderate (Grade 2) in severity and resolved upon discontinuation of VEKLURY. Transaminase elevations have also been reported in patients with COVID-19 who received VEKLURY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Because transaminase elevations have been reported as a clinical feature of COVID-19, and the incidence was similar in patients receiving placebo versus VEKLURY in clinical trials of VEKLURY, discerning the contribution of VEKLURY to transaminase elevations in patients with COVID-19 can be challenging.

Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients before starting VEKLURY and while receiving VEKLURY as clinically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Consider discontinuing VEKLURY if ALT levels increase to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal.
Discontinue VEKLURY if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation.

5.3	Risk of Reduced Antiviral Activity When Coadministered with Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate

Coadministration of VEKLURY and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended based on data from cell culture experiments demonstrating a potential antagonistic effect of chloroquine on the intracellular metabolic activation and antiviral activity of VEKLURY [see Drug Interactions (7) and Microbiology (12.4)].

### Drug treatments for mild or moderate COVID-19: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113aLK7s]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Several interventions do not seem to result in a benefit for any patient important outcomes, including ACEi/ARB, aspirin, colchicine, fluvoxamine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and lopinavir-ritonavir. Lopinavir-ritonavir increases the risk of adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation and increases length of hospital stay.

Strengths and limitations of this review

Our review includes studies from various stages of the pandemic, with many trials being conducted earlier, before the deployment of vaccines and when covid-19 had worse outcomes. To ensure that our results remain applicable, we consulted with the WHO guideline panel to choose baseline risks (non-severe, moderate risk) most reflective of this population. Additionally, while our included studies include patients infected with different covid-19 variants, we do not believe this is likely to importantly affect our results as, to our knowledge, there is no substantial evidence that viral subtype is an effect modifier of any of our included drugs. Some of the included drugs have downsides that this review did not capture; however, further details can be found in the guideline. For example, molnupiravir could be carcinogenic, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has many critical drug-drug interactions, and remdesivir is administered intravenously. Thus, while this review provides an overview of the evidence, individual considerations (such as patient values and preferences, contraindications, drug-drug interactions, and drug-specific adverse events not included in this review) must be taken into account when deciding whether to use any medication.

### Oral prodrug of remdesivir parent GS-441524 is efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets [^111doPzK]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

Female ferrets were either intravenously administered 10 mg/kg remdesivir as a 30-min infusion or orally administered 30 mg/kg GS-621763, after which plasma was isolated at 7–9 timepoints postadministration. Plasma samples underwent methanol protein precipitation followed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatants were isolated, evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and reconstituted with 5% acetonitrile for injection onto an LC-MS/MS system (Sciex API-4500). Concentrations of remdesivir, GS-621763, and GS-441524 were determined using 9-point calibration curves spanning at least 3 orders of magnitude, with quality control samples to ensure accuracy and precision, prepared in normal ferret plasma. Analytes were separated by a 50 × 3.0 mm, 2.55 μm Synergi Polar-RP 30 A column (Phenomenex, Inc.) using a mobile phase A consisting of 10 mM ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid and a mobile phase B consisting of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. A multi-stage linear gradient from 5% to 95% mobile phase B at a flow rate of 1 mL/min was employed for analyte separation (Shimadzu). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin (version 8.2, Certara) and concentration-time profiles generated using Prism (version 8, GraphPad). Ferret lungs were collected at 24 h following initiation of drug administration. Whole tissues were quickly isolated and immediately placed into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until processing and LC-MS/MS analysis. Reported values for lung total nucleosides are the sum of (GS-441524 and mono-, di-, and triphosphate (GS-443902) metabolites).

Key Points

Question

For hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving remdesivir, is there an association between dose and time to bradycardia in those experiencing bradycardic events?

Findings

In this cohort study, among 188 patients receiving remdesivir who had bradycardia, the most substantial decrease in heart rate occurred within 24 hours of the loading dose. The median time to minimum heart rate was 60.7 hours after remdesivir administration.

Meaning

In this study, bradycardia in patients receiving remdesivir was seen during the infusion and after 1 or more doses; however, these findings are limited because a large proportion of patients had cardiac risk factors and/or severe COVID-19.

### Impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) on cytochromes P450 activity assessed by the Geneva cocktail [^115445bg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

We thus have demonstrated that COVID‐19 has an impact on CYP activity in an isoform‐specific manner (inhibition or induction, and magnitude). The magnitude of the effects found on CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 activities might be of clinical relevance, in particular in polymorbid and polymedicated patients with COVID‐19.

Our study has some limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small and confirmation of our multiple linear regression model findings in an additional and/or broader sample is needed, allowing for possible adjustment with other covariables. In addition, a correlation between COVID‐19 and variation in CYPs' activity was found, but further investigations are needed to corroborate it. In particular, the patients included had different health status, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or none. Finally, the duration of follow‐up was of only 3 months and there is no guarantee that CYP activity in included patients had returned to their initial levels, in light of considerations about the potential long‐term effects of COVID‐19. A study with a longer follow‐up time may provide answers and should include the statement of symptoms of long COVID‐19.

To conclude, our results suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and the resulting acute inflammation have a large impact on the activity of six key CYPs in an isoform‐specific manner. These effects could be prolonged for certain isoforms. Our findings may help manage relevant drug efficacy and safety issues in the context of COVID‐19 through the impact on the PK of drugs that are substrates of these major drug‐metabolizing enzymes, whether used to treat acute disease or as routine patient therapy.

### Prioritization of anti-SARS-cov-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on plasma and target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics [^113yNUxk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

At least 7 of the 13 candidates achieving C max above one of their reported EC 50 and derived EC 90 are already in clinical evaluation for treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2. These include remdesivir (NCT04292730, NCT04292899, NCT04257656, NCT04252664, and NCT04315948), favipiravir (NCT04310228 and NCT04319900), niclosamide (NCT04345419), mefloquine (NCT04347031), lopinavir/ritonavir, and chloroquine. No robust antiviral activity data were found for galidesivir on which to conduct an analysis but it is also under clinical investigation (NCT03800173). A recent trial for favipiravir demonstrated some success with an improvement over arbidol from 56–71% (P = 0.02) in patients without risk factors (but not critical cases or patients with hypertension and/or diabetes). The results of compassionate use of remdesivir in severely ill patients was also recently reported, and if confirmed in ongoing randomized, placebo‐controlled trials, will serve as a further validation of the other candidates presented here. Of particular interest, nitazoxanide, tipranavir, sulfadoxine, and nelfinavir may be expected to sustain their plasma pharmacokinetic exposure above their lowest reported EC 50 and derived EC 90 (where available) for the duration of their approved dose and dosing interval.

### Induction effects of ritonavir: implications for drug interactions [^115KAbKV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on the induction effects of ritonavir on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and glucuronyl transferase and identify resultant established and potential drug interactions.

Data Sources

Primary literature was identified from MEDLINE (1950-April 2008), EMBASE (1988-April 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2008) using the search terms ritonavir, cytochrome P450 enzyme system, enzyme induction, glucuronyl transferase, and drug interactions. Additionally, relevant conference abstracts and references of relevant articles were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Abstraction

All English-language articles and abstracts identified were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Ritonavir is a well-known inhibitor of the metabolism of numerous medications that are substrates of the CYP3A and CYP2D6 pathways. It also exhibits a biphasic, time-dependent effect on P-glycoprotein of inhibition followed by induction. Numerous pharmacokinetic studies suggested that ritonavir induces cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A, 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, and 2C19, as well as glucuronyl transferase. Additionally, several case reports described clinically significant subtherapeutic effects of drugs metabolized by these isoenzymes when coadministered with ritonavir. Both therapeutic and boosting doses of ritonavir appear to induce these enzymes; however, most of the studies of low-dose ritonavir involved a second protease inhibitor such as lopinavir, darunavir, or tipranavir. It is, therefore, difficult to distinguish the relative effects of additional medications unless well-designed, 3-way studies are conducted.

Conclusions

At both therapeutic and boosting doses, ritonavir exhibits a clinically relevant induction effect on numerous drug-metabolizing enzymes. A decrease or loss of therapeutic effect may be observed when ritonavir is coadministered with medications that are substrates for these enzymes. It is important for clinicians to be aware of drugs potentially impacted by ritonavir therapy to identify and manage these interactions.

### Oral prodrug of remdesivir parent GS-441524 is efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets [^117Bnhoj]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates oral efficacy of the remdesivir analog GS-621763 against the early clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate WA1/2020 and one of the recently emerged VOC in the ferret model. After oral administration of GS-621763, only low systemic levels of intact prodrug were transiently observed. The parent nucleoside GS-441524 was the major metabolite detected in blood, more than three orders of magnitude higher than intact prodrug, indicating efficient conversion upon intestinal absorption. GS-441524 metabolism inside cells to the same intracellular bioactive triphosphate GS-443902 in tissues links GS-621763 to the well-understood mechanism of action of remdesivir, which blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication by triggering delayed chain termination of the nascent viral RNA chainand/or template-dependent inhibition after incorporation into viral antigenomic RNA. Systemic GS-441524 is less efficient at forming the bioactive GS-443902 in the lungs of ferrets compared to systemic remdesivir, but the exposure of GS-441524 achieved following oral dosing of GS-621763 is sufficient to overcome this difference and generate substantial levels of bioactive GS-443902. The more persistent but lower plasma levels of GS-441524 following intravenous remdesivir are a result of efficient formation of triphosphate in tissues from remdesivir, followed by slow dephosphorylation to GS-441524, which then appears in plasma, as evidenced by its similar half-life with that of the triphosphate GS-443902 in PBMC.

### Oral prodrug of remdesivir parent GS-441524 is efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets [^113QKzQW]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Remdesivir is an antiviral approved for COVID-19 treatment, but its wider use is limited by intravenous delivery. An orally bioavailable remdesivir analog may boost therapeutic benefit by facilitating early administration to non-hospitalized patients. This study characterizes the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of GS-621763, an oral prodrug of remdesivir parent nucleoside GS-441524. Both GS-621763 and GS-441524 inhibit SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern (VOC) in cell culture and human airway epithelium organoids. Oral GS-621763 is efficiently converted to plasma metabolite GS-441524, and in lungs to the triphosphate metabolite identical to that generated by remdesivir, demonstrating a consistent mechanism of activity. Twice-daily oral administration of 10 mg/kg GS-621763 reduces SARS-CoV-2 burden to near-undetectable levels in ferrets. When dosed therapeutically against VOC P.1 gamma γ, oral GS-621763 blocks virus replication and prevents transmission to untreated contact animals. These results demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of a much-needed orally bioavailable analog of remdesivir in a relevant animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19-final report [^115bxuXM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study ACTT-1 was published by John H Beigel and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the ACTT-1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who have evidence of lower respiratory tract infection? In the ACTT-1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACTT-1 study, the population was: 1062 patients (378 female, 684 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. The key exclusion criteria were alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase > 5 times the ULN; eGFR < 30 mL/min; pregnancy or lactation; allergy to any study medication. In the ACTT-1 study, the interventions were: n = 541 remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) n = 521 placebo (matching placebo or normal saline for up to 10 days). In the ACTT-1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in time to recovery (10 days vs. 15 days; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.49). In the ACTT-1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in clinical improvement at day 15 (with an ordinal score of 1) (29% vs. 22.1%; OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9) No significant difference in the rate of death by day 29 (11.4% vs. 15.2%; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03) Significant increase in median time to discharge (8 days vs. 12 days; HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.46). In the ACTT-1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in grade 3 or 4 adverse events and nonserious adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (24.6% vs. 31.6%), serious respiratory failure adverse events (8.8% vs. 15.5%). In the ACTT-1 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection, remdesivir was superior to placebo with respect to time to recovery.

### Acetaminophen and codeine [^114PHEQ5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes

The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, codeine, and the active metabolite, morphine.

Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction

The concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations with subsequently greater metabolism by cytochrome P450 2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.

The concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via 2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels. This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.

Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in far more than 150 million cases and an estimated 3.5 million deaths. The socioeconomic and geopolitical impact of the pandemic is unprecedented and will most likely become fully evident only in postpandemic years. To date, remdesivir is the only small molecule antiviral therapeutic approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19. Originally discovered for respiratory syncytial virus, remdesivir is a mono-phosphoramidate prodrug of a ribonucleoside analog that must be administered intravenously. The obligatory parenteral delivery limits access of COVID-19 outpatients to remdesivir treatment, thereby narrowing the therapeutic window in which a direct-acting antiviral targeting an acute viral infection is expected to have its greatest effect.

Orally active COVID-19 therapeutics have the potential to maximize patient benefit and ideally prevent progression to severe disease. Several oral therapeutic candidates such as EIDD-2801/molnupiravir – and AT-527are in advanced stages of clinical trials, but currently, only remdesivir has shown confirmed efficacy for COVID-19 treatment in humans. Following intravenous administration and despite its short plasma half-life, remdesivir is sufficiently stable in non-rodent species to distribute to tissues, such as the lung, where it is rapidly converted to its monophosphate metabolite and then efficiently anabolized to the bioactive triphosphate GS-443902 (Fig. 1a). An alternative strategy to generate GS-443902 could be to directly administer the remdesivir parent nucleoside GS-441524, but due to less efficient metabolism of GS-441524 to its monophosphate, higher daily systemic exposures of GS-441524 than those obtained from intravenous remdesivir are required to generate equivalent concentrations of GS-443902 in lung tissue. In addition, GS-441524 has displayed poor oral bioavailability in several species. In order to obtain high exposures after oral delivery, a prodrug strategy to improve oral absorption was employed leading to the identification of GS-621763, which demonstrated high oral bioavailability in two relevant animal species including non-human primates.

### A narrative review on antimicrobial dosing in adult critically ill patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^116TZUob]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

For peramivir, an ex vivo study demonstrated no significant loss of peramivir in the ECMO circuit regardless of the presence of the oxygenator. Without any clinical data, we have no recommendation for alternative dosing strategies in patients receiving ECMO.

Remdesivir is a pro-drug which converts into its active metabolite GS-441524. It is a highly protein bound molecule and therefore may get sequestered in the circuit. Carina et al. examined the interactions between circuits and drugs in closed-loop ex vivo ECMO and CRRT setups. The mean recovery of remdesivir at 6 h post-dosing was notably low in both ECMO (33.3% [2.0]) and CRRT (3.5% [0.4]) circuits. Conversely, the recovery of GS-441524 at the 6-h mark was substantial in the ECMO circuit (75.8%), but undetectable in the CRRT circuit. The significant loss of both molecules, particularly in the CRRT setup, indicates potential need for remdesivir dosing adjustments especially in patients undergoing both ECMO and CRRT support. Similarly, Dhanani et al. observed decreased drug recoveries in ex vivo ECMO circuits than control jars. Ide et al. assessed the effect of ECMO circuit in a patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with normal renal function. The plasma concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 4 h after administration were lower than the concentrations reported in normal individuals. Notably, the patient had also gained 20 kg of extracellular fluid weight during the hospitalization which likely also affected the PK resulting in lower serum levels. While clinical evidence is scarce, standard dosing may be considered for remdesivir.

### Drug repurposing screens identify chemical entities for the development of COVID-19 interventions [^112k9oG1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

HeLa-ACE2 remdesivir potentiation screen and synergy studies

Combination therapies have the potential to increase efficacy of treatment while reducing drug dose of either or both combinations partners, and thus prevent side effects that may be associated with administration of higher doses. Drug combinations can also slow the acquisition of drug resistance. Drug synergy, the increase in activity of the combination therapy beyond what is expected of an additive interaction is rare, yet additive effects themselves have the potential to improve therapy regimens.

To identify compounds that interact synergistically with the FDA-approved COVID-19 drug remdesivir, we carried out a second unbiased ReFRAME screen in the presence of low concentrations (80 nM) of remdesivir. The activity of hits from this screen were assessed in the presence and absence of remdesivir. Based on a perceived shift in activity in the presence of remdesivir, compounds were tested in a checkerboard 10 × 10 synergy matrix and results analyzed using the synergyfinder packagein R to assess the interactions between the tested compounds using the Zero Interaction Potency Model (ZIP)(see Methods section). From this screen we identified the nucleoside analog riboprine (N6-isopentenyladenosine, previously investigated as an antineoplastic agent, for treatment of nausea and surgical site infections, and a component of CitraNatal 90 DHA, a prescription prenatal/postnatal multivitamin/mineral tablet) and a folate antagonist 10-deazaaminopterin (an antineoplastic compound currently in Phase II stage of development) as having activities that synergized with those of remdesivir. The synergistic effects for both compounds were observed across specific concentrations, signified as peaks within the 3-dimensional synergy score landscape (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b), prompting closer scrutiny of activity of each compound.

### The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in COVID-19 [^111QXWca]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A number of review articles and editorials have been published on the possible effects of NSAIDs on the risk or severity of COVID-19. A predominant theme of these publications is the lack of evidence to suggest a mechanism by which NSAIDs (particularly ibuprofen) can worsen outcomes of COVID-19 infection. In fact, the hypothesis involving upregulation of ACE-2 appears to be contradicted by new evidence that NSAIDs do not affect expression of this enzyme. The importance of basing therapeutic recommendations on robust evidence rather than speculative hypotheses has been emphasized. The most recent editorial we identified, published in May 2021, concluded "NSAID use with COVID-19 appears to confer no increased risk of poorer outcomes".

To further increase complexity, recent data show genetic variations of cytochrome P450 liver oxidative enzyme systems can influence the metabolism of NSAIDs, potentially affecting their elimination from the body, their tissue concentrations, and the greater risks of adverse events. Genetic variations differ between ethnic groups, meaning, for example, that the risk of higher-than-expected plasma drug levels may be greater in some populations than others. Future implementation of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice could, therefore, help optimize the use of NSAIDs in all patients including those with COVID-19.

### Interactions of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir, with common anesthesia drugs [^11786TUG]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The protease inhibitor, ritonavir, is a strong inhibitor of CYP 3A. The drug is used for management of the human immunovirus and is currently part of an oral antiviral drug combination (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir) for the early treatment of SARS-2 COVID-19-positive patients aged 12years and over who have recognized comorbidities. The CYP 3A enzyme system is responsible for clearance of numerous drugs used in anesthesia (e.g., alfentanil, fentanyl, methadone, rocuronium, bupivacaine, midazolam, ketamine). Ritonavir will have an impact on drug clearances that are dependent on ritonavir concentration, anesthesia drug intrinsic hepatic clearance, metabolic pathways, concentration-response relationship, and route of administration. Drugs with a steep concentration-response relationship (ketamine, midazolam, rocuronium) are mostly affected because small changes in concentration have major changes in effect response. An increase in midazolam concentration is observed after oral administration because CYP 3A in the gastrointestinal wall is inhibited, causing a large increase in relative bioavailability. Fentanyl infusion may be associated with a modest increase in plasma concentration and effect, but the large between subject variability of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic concentration changes suggests it will have little impact on an individual patient, especially when used with adverse effect monitoring. It has been proposed that drugs that have no or only a small metabolic pathway involving the CYP 3A enzyme be used during anesthesia, for example, propofol, atracurium, remifentanil, and the volatile agents. That anesthesia approach denies children of drugs with considerable value. It is better that the inhibitory changes in clearance of these drugs are understood so that rational drug choices can be made to tailor drug use to the individual patient. Altered drug dose, anticipation of duration of effect, timing of administration, use of reversal agents and perioperative monitoring would better behoove children undergoing anesthesia.

### Concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 in human milk from lactating individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 [^112tQUPJ]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Remdesivir and GS-441524 concentrations in human milk were below the level of clinical concern in the samples evaluated in this study. The concentration of remdesivir was below the LLOQ (100 ng/mL) in all 17 samples tested. The estimated RID of remdesivir was < 1%, which is considerably below the acceptability level of 10% for presumed safety in infants. – Furthermore, as remdesivir is administered intravenously due to poor oral bioavailability, systemic infant exposure via milk consumption is expected to be negligible.

The metabolite GS-441524 was quantifiable in only 6 of 17 samples tested with a maximum concentration of 168 ng/mL. All of the 6 milk samples with quantifiable GS-441524 concentrations were collected between 4 and 12 h following administration of remdesivir. The RID of GS-441524 could not be reliably estimated because the maternal dose of the metabolite is undefined. With a 150 mL/kg/day infant milk intake at the maximum observed GS-441524 milk concentration of 168 ng/mL, the weight-based infant dose of GS-441524 would be 0.0252 mg/kg/day. In adults, 48.6% of the remdesivir dose is recovered in urine as GS-441524. Using these values, the RID of GS-441524 via human milk was < 5% of the weight-adjusted adult dose. The present results are similar to those of Wada et al. who reported that remdesivir was either not detected or insignificant in 4 human milk samples from a single lactating woman, with an estimated RID of 0.007%. In addition, GS-441524 milk concentrations were similar in both studies.

Treatment of COVID-19 is largely supportive as yet there is no effective antiviral drug, vaccine, or antibody against the virus. Hundreds of trials are underway globally, examining the efficacy of different drugs, convalescent plasma, herbal medicines, etc. (search on trials.gov reveals 609 trials registered till 20 April 2020). The pharmacological agents that have been investigated include various agents like camostat mesylate, tocilizumab and sarilumab, arbidol, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, favipiravir, interferon alpha, famotidine, etc. The agents have variable mechanism of actions, ranging from inhibition of entry of viral particles into the cells and inhibition of various enzymes associated with viral replication to an improvement of the host immune response to the virus.

### Prioritization of anti-SARS-cov-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on plasma and target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics [^116FJK5C]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The current analysis reveals that many putative agents are never likely to achieve target concentrations necessary to adequately suppress SARS‐CoV‐2 under normal dosing conditions. It is critical that candidate medicines emerging from in vitro antiviral screening programs are considered in the context of their expected exposure in humans where possible. Clinical trials are extremely time‐consuming and expensive, and it is critical that only the best options are progressed for robust analysis as potential monotherapy or combination therapy or prevention options. Finally, it would be highly beneficial for activity data for SARS‐CoV‐2 to be performed with standardized protocol and with activity reported as EC 90 values as a better marker of the concentrations required to suppress the virus to therapeutically relevant levels. Based upon the currently reported data, atazanavir, chloroquine, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, indomethacin, lopinavir, mefloquine, nitazoxanide, ritonavir, sulfadoxine, and tipranavir are predicted to have mean/median C max concentrations above their reported EC 50 in both plasma and lungs. Anidulafungin, eltrombopag, merimepodib, nelfinavir, niclosamide, and remdesivir also had mean/media C max above available EC 50 in plasma but a lung prediction was not possible. Only atazanavir, indomethacin, nelfinavir, nitazoxanide, sulfadoxine, and tipranavir were predicted to have mean/median plasma C max concentrations above their reported EC 50 for the duration of their dosing interval, but full concentration‐time profiles were not available to make this judgment for favipiravir, niclosamide, and remdesivir.

### Remdesivir reduced mortality in immunocompromised patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across variant waves: findings from routine clinical practice [^113AFmHe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With reduced vaccine efficacy and ongoing viral evolution leading to immune evasiveness, there remains an ongoing need for effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients.

Intravenous remdesivir treatment is an important first-line antiviral for managing immunocompromised patients hospitalized for COVID-19 for several reasons. In the era following viral escape from key neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, there is a high risk of drug–drug interactions between the oral antiviral, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, used for early treatment of COVID-19, and cornerstone immunosuppressant medications for solid organ transplant recipients, particularly calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target-of-rapamycin inhibitor drugs. There are also concerns and hesitation regarding intensifying background immunosuppression with drugs, such as dexamethasone, since this may further prolong severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication, increase the risk of secondary infections with other pathogens, and contribute to selection and transmission of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Minimum Heart Rate (HR) During Remdesivir Therapy

Minimum HR shown for total cohort (A), in patients younger than 65 years vs 65 years or older (B), and in men vs women (C). Marginal mean minimum HR 48 hours prior to the first dose of remdesivir and 24 hours after each dose of remdesivir was determined using linear mixed-effect model. Error bars indicate 95% CI.

Time-to-event Kaplan-Meier plots were created for time to first bradycardic episode and time to the lowest HR. Of 181 patients included in time-to-event analysis, 91 experienced their first bradycardic episode within 23.4 hours (95% CI, 20.1–31.5 hours). Time to first bradycardic episode is shown in eFigure 1A in Supplement 1. Median time to first bradycardic episode was significantly shorter in patients aged 65 years or older compared with those younger than 65 years by the Wilcoxon test (18.7 hours; 95% CI, 16.8–23.7 hours vs 31.5 hours; 95% CI, 22.7–39.3 hours; p = 0.04) (Figure 3 A). As shown in Figure 3 B, the median time to the first bradycardic episode for patients aged 65 years or older with a cardiac history seemed shortest (17.7 hours; 95% CI, 16.1–21.6 hours) compared with other groups (P = .05, across 4 strata), but time to the first bradycardic episode was not significantly different with respect to the presence or absence of a cardiac history for the entire cohort (eFigure 1B in Supplement 1). There was no significant difference in the distribution of time to first bradycardic episode adjusted for sex (eFigure 1C in Supplement 1) or sex with the presence of a cardiac history (eFigure 1D in Supplement 1).

### Oral prodrug of remdesivir parent GS-441524 is efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets [^112ABEqr]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

Prior to in vivo testing, we assessed antiviral potency of both GS-621763 and its metabolite GS-441524 against lineage A isolate WA1/2020 and three recently emerged VOC, hCoV-19/USA/CA_UCSD_5574/2020 ((α), lineage B.1.1.7; CA/2020), hCoV-19-South Africa/KRISP-K005325/2020 ((β), lineage B.1.351; SA/2020), and hCoV-19/Japan/TY7–503/2021 ((γ), lineage P.1; BZ/2021) in cultured cells.

Antiviral activity against VoCs

Half-maximal effective concentrations (EC 50) in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells were highly consistent, ranging from 0.11 to 0.73 μM for GS-621763 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 1) and from 0.11 to 0.68 μM for GS-441524 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1). Analogous potency ranges were obtained when luciferase-expressing WA1/2020 reporter viruses were examined in dose-response assays in A549 cells stably expressing human ACE2 (A549-hACE2) (Supplementary Table 1). Toxicity-testing of GS-621763, remdesivir, and GS-441524 in different cell lines and primary human cells derived from different donors revealed half-maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC 50) of 40 to > 100 μM (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table 1), 36 to > 100 μM (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1) and > 100 μM (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Table 1), respectively, corresponding to selectivity indices (SI = CC 50 /EC 50) of GS-621763 > 137 in VeroE6 and > 51 in A549-ACE2 cells. The efficacy of GS-441524 and GS-621763 was in parallel assessed on well-differentiated primary human airway epithelium cultures grown at the air-liquid interface and apically infected with VOC γ (Fig. 1f–g). Basolaterally added GS-441524 or GS-621763 displayed similar potency in this disease-relevant human tissue model, returning EC 50 values of 2.83 and 3.01 µM, respectively. Parallel measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance demonstrated that epithelium integrity was fully preserved at basolateral drug concentrations ≥ 3 µM.

### Identification of bradycardia following remdesivir administration through the US food and drug administration American college of medical toxicology COVID-19 toxic pharmacovigilance project [^111RJHJV]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort of patients with bradycardic events following remdesivir administration, we found these events to persist past the initial infusion, with the heart rate nadir typically occurring after the first dose with a median time to nadir of 60.7 hours. The median onset to a bradycardic event was within 24 hours for the total cohort and shorter for those aged 65 years and older and men. Serious AEs requiring intervention, such as arrhythmias, were rare; however, HRs less than or equal to 45 bpm were relatively common.

Remdesivir is a monophosphate prodrug converted to an active cyano-adenosine nucleoside analogue (GS-441524) and a metabolite resembling adenosine triphosphate (GS-443902) originally developed as a candidate drug for treatment of hepatitis C virus. The primary mechanism of action of remdesivir occurs in GS-443902 inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase resulting in premature termination of RNA synthesis. Although plasma concentrations of GS-441524 have an elimination half-life on the order of 1 to 2 hours, intracellular elimination may have an elimination half-life of 24 hours or more.

Although bradycardia had not been reported as an AE associated with remdesivir prior to use in treatment of COVID-19, other RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors have been associated with cardiotoxicity, including bradycardia. Serious cardiovascular AEs are rarely reported for remdesivir in clinical trials for Ebola virus and COVID-19. A single episode of hypotension was reported in the initial clinical trial for Ebola virus of 175 patients; however, no information was provided regarding the timing of the event. The ACTT-1 trial for COVID-19 had 4 cases of unspecified arrhythmias in the remdesivir group (n = 532) vs 1 case of arrhythmia in the placebo group (n = 516). Other cardiac events reported in this trial included atrial fibrillation (5 cases in the remdesivir group vs 10 cases in the placebo group) and supraventricular tachycardia (3 cases vs 2 cases); however, neither of these differences was statistically significant. Bradycardia was not reported as an AE in this trial. Infusion-related reactions, including bradycardia, are listed in the package insert. In our cohort, infusion-related bradycardia was indicated during at least 1 remdesivir dose in 23.9% of the patients; however, 100% of patients with a reported infusion-associated bradycardic episode had continued bradycardia outside of the infusion period.

### Interactions of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir, with common anesthesia drugs [^113En5DM]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

3 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The enzyme inhibition reported with ritonavir is instantaneous but the magnitude of effect is related to plasma concentration and the shape of the concentration‐response curve. Other drugs that use the cytochrome clearance pathways may also be affected by ritonavir. The drug is a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A but is minimally affected by other CYP 3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole), reflecting ritonavir high CYP 3A4 receptor affinity. It also inhibits CYP 2D6–mediated metabolism, but to a lesser extent.

Ritonavir is also an inducer of several enzymes (CYP 1A2, CYP 2B6, glucuronosyl transferase [UGT], and possibly CYP 2C9 and CYP 2C19), although this induction has slower onset. Enzyme induction through activation of DNA transcription requires 7–14 days to achieve a maximum effect. The magnitude of these interactions remains poorly quantified.

Remdesivir — Recommendation 16 for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk: Among patients (ambulatory or hospitalized) with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease, the IDSA guideline panel suggests remdesivir initiated within seven days of symptom onset rather than no remdesivir (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Dosing for remdesivir in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 is 200 mg on day one followed by 100 mg on days two and three; pediatric dosing is 5 mg/kg on day 1 and 2.5 mg/kg on subsequent days. Options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, three-day treatment with remdesivir, molnupiravir, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; patient-specific factors, product availability, and institutional capacity and infrastructure should drive decision-making regarding choice of agent, and data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting.

### Identification of bradycardia following remdesivir administration through the US food and drug administration American college of medical toxicology COVID-19 toxic pharmacovigilance project [^115Rqk7T]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The rapid spread and mortality associated with COVID-19 emphasized a need for surveillance system development to identify adverse events (AEs) to emerging therapeutics. Bradycardia is a remdesivir infusion-associated AE listed in the US Food and Drug Administration-approved prescribing information.

Objective

To evaluate the magnitude and duration of bradycardic events following remdesivir administration.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter cohort study of patients with recorded heart rate less than 60 beats per minute within 24 hours after administration of a remdesivir dose was conducted between November 23, 2020, and October 31, 2021. Participants included patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at 15 medical centers across the US. Patients excluded had AEs unrelated to bradycardia, AEs in addition to bradycardia, or first onset of bradycardia after 5 remdesivir doses.

Exposures

Remdesivir administration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Linear mixed-effect models for the minimum HR before starting remdesivir and within 24 hours of each dose included doses as fixed effects. Baseline covariates were age (≥ 65 years vs < 65 years), sex (male vs female), cardiovascular disease history (yes vs no), and concomitant use of bradycardia-associated medications. The interactions between variables and doses were considered fixed-effects covariates to adjust models.

Results

A total of 188 patients were included in the primary analysis and 181 in the secondary analysis. The cohort included 108 men (57.4%); 75 individuals (39.9%) were non-Hispanic White and mean (SD) age was 61.3 (15.4) years. Minimum HR after doses 1 to 5 was lower than before remdesivir. Mean minimum HR was lowest after dose 4, decreasing by -15.2 beats per minute (95% CI, -17.4 to -13.1; P < .001) compared with before remdesivir administration. Mean (SD) minimum HR was 55.6 (10.2) beats per minute across all 5 doses. Of 181 patients included in time-to-event analysis, 91 had their first episode of bradycardia within 23.4 hours (95% CI, 20.1–31.5 hours) and 91 had their lowest HR within 60.7 hours (95% CI, 54.0–68.3 hours). Median time to first bradycardia after starting remdesivir was shorter for patients aged 65 years or older vs those younger than 65 years (18.7 hours; 95% CI, 16.8–23.7 hours vs 31.5 hours; 95% CI, 22.7–39.3 hours; p = 0.04). Median time to lowest HR was shorter for men vs women (54.2 hours; 95% CI, 47.3–62.0 hours vs 71.0 hours; 95% CI, 59.5–79.6 hours; p = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, bradycardia occurred during remdesivir infusion and persisted. Given the widespread use of remdesivir, practitioners should be aware of this safety signal.

### Broad-spectrum prodrugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities: strategies, benefits, and challenges [^115RbtSL]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

In this era, broad-spectrum prodrugs with anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activities are gaining considerable attention owing to their potential clinical benefits and role in combating the fast-spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The last 2 years have seen a surge of reports on various broad-spectrum prodrugs against SARS-CoV-2, and in in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical practice. Currently, only remdesivir (with many controversies and limitations) has been approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and additional potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs are urgently required to enrich the defense arsenals. The world has ubiquitously grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the availability of broad-spectrum prodrugs provides great hope for us to subdue this global threat. This article reviews promising treatment strategies, antiviral mechanisms, potential benefits, and daunting clinical challenges of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to provide some important guidance for future clinical treatment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115GQPVX]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 treatment in children with HIV — remdesivir use and dosing: For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged ≥ 12 years and at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is the preferred treatment, but "remdesivir may be considered if ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is unavailable or contraindicated (BI*)". For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged < 12 years and at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, "remdesivir is currently the only treatment option but may be logistically challenging to administer and may not be available in all locations". Among hospitalized children with HIV who are aged ≥ 28 days and weigh ≥ 3 kg with laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected acute COVID-19, "remdesivir should be considered in children who are receiving supplemental oxygen (BII*) and should be administered in children who are severely or critically ill, have a rapidly increasing oxygen requirement, and/or who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by CDC (AI*)". Administration is specified as "intravenously once daily for 3 days to non-hospitalized patients and for 5 days or until discharge (whichever occurs first) in hospitalized patients", with duration for those "who are critically ill or have immunosuppression" able to be "extended to 10 days". Timing guidance states, "Ideally, remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset", though in children with HIV with severe immunosuppression, antiviral therapy "could be considered even if presenting with > 7 days of symptoms (CIII)". Reported adverse effects include "nausea/vomiting and elevation of transaminases", and while remdesivir has potential for drug–drug interactions, "the potential for interactions with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs is thought to be unlikely"; clinicians are advised to use a resource "such as the University of Liverpool COVID-19 Drug–Drug Interaction website, for further guidance".

### Concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 in human milk from lactating individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 [^111gjAPE]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnant and postpartum individuals are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Remdesivir is a SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide analog RNA polymerase inhibitor and the first drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19. Remdesivir is rapidly converted by plasma and tissue esterases to an alanine intermediate (GS-704277) which is further metabolized to the pharmacologically active nucleoside analog monophosphate metabolite (GS-441524). Although remdesivir has a short half-life (0.90–0.96 h), the half-life of GS-441524 is approximately 27 h in healthy, non-pregnant adults.

Lactating individuals undergoing treatment with remdesivir are typically advised not to breastfeed or to breastfeed with careful infant monitoring due to a paucity of data on the excretion of remdesivir and its metabolite GS-441524 in human milk. However, breastfeeding while infected with SARS-CoV-2 is considered safe and is recommended since antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted through human milk. To date, there is a single case report published in the literature on remdesivir treatment in a lactating individual. Wada et al. reported low levels of remdesivir and GS-441524 in human milk and estimated a relative infant dose (RID) of 0.007%. The objective of this study was to add to the very limited available data by measuring the concentration of remdesivir and GS-441524 in human milk from lactating individuals receiving remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.

### The role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in endogenous signalling pathways and environmental carcinogenesis [^115Rgp45]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2006). Medium credibility.

Some cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme-thiolate enzymes participate in the detoxication and, paradoxically, the formation of reactive intermediates of thousands of chemicals that can damage DNA, as well as lipids and proteins. CYP expression can also affect the production of molecules derived from arachidonic acid, and alters various downstream signal-transduction pathways. Such changes can be precursors to malignancy. Recent studies in mice have changed our perceptions about the function of CYP1 enzymes. We suggest a two-tiered system to predict an overall inter-individual risk of tumorigenesis based on DNA variants in certain 'early defence' CYP genes, combined with polymorphisms in various downstream target genes.

### Remdesivir (Veklury) [^115VEz9J]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Remdesivir is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is essential for viral replication. Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug that distributes into cells where it is metabolized to a nucleoside monophosphate intermediate by carboxyesterase 1 and/or cathepsin A, depending upon the cell type. The nucleoside monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite (GS-443902). Remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP) acts as an analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with high selectivity (3.65-fold) over the natural ATP substrate for incorporation into nascent RNA chains by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which results in delayed chain termination (position i+3) during replication of the viral RNA. In a biochemical assay assessing RDV-TP incorporation by the MERS-CoV RdRp complex, RDV-TP inhibited RNA synthesis with an IC50value of 0.032 µM. RDV-TP can also inhibit viral RNA synthesis following its incorporation into the template viral RNA as a result of read-through by the viral polymerase that may occur at higher nucleotide concentrations. When remdesivir nucleotide is present in the viral RNA template, the efficiency of incorporation of the complementary natural nucleotide is compromised, thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis. Remdesivir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA and RNA polymerases, including human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.

### Interpretation of cytochrome P-450 inhibition and induction effects from clinical data: current standards and recommendations for implementation [^114q9FBA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Agents that modify cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzyme activity are characterized as strong, moderate, or weak inhibitors or inducers based on the magnitude of their impact on substrate exposure in clinical studies. Criteria for these classifications are simple and semiquantitative. However, assignment of a given agent to a CYP inhibitor or inducer category is often complicated by limitations of the published data, inconsistent study findings, and other factors. CYP inhibitor and inducer categories are commonly used as a basis for differentiating drug interaction management recommendations. For example, product labeling for a CYP substrate may recommend avoidance in combination with strong inhibitors and dose reduction in combination with moderate inhibitors. When such recommendations exist, ambiguity or variability in placement of inhibitors or inducers into categories can introduce potentially harmful variations in clinical drug interaction management. Failure to adequately reflect the drug interaction potential of an agent by under-categorizing it (e.g., calling it weak when data point to moderate effects), for example, may lead clinicians to respond inadequately to real risks, or to ignore potential interactions altogether. Over-categorization may lead to actions such as over-adjustment of substrate doses or unnecessary avoidance of optimal treatments. This review describes the current criteria for assignment of CYP inhibitor and inducer categories, summarizes common circumstances leading to ambiguous or variable CYP inhibitor and inducer categorizations, and proposes an approach to data interpretation and application of current criteria under uncertainty. When applied to > 1,000 CYP reviews, the approach described has identified a clear categorization in almost all cases.

### Drug-drug interactions (DDI) and liver toxicity of COVID-19… [^117R2Rh8]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Remdesivir is an FDA-approved antiviral drug for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but this drug can be potentially toxic to the liver. This project studies the toxicity of remdesivir on the liver as well as the effect of dexamethasone, another drug often used together with remdesivir in treating COVID-19 infections, on remdesivir induced liver injury. Research Outcomes/Results In Aim 1, Researchers tested seven COVID-19 drugs for their potential induction of major drug-metabolizing enzymes. The toxicity in human liver cells of these drugs was also evaluated. With the advances in COVID-19 treatment, some of these drugs initially in the trials are no longer used to treat patients, thus our research has focused on remdesivir, the first FDA-approved drug for COVID-19 treatment. Aim 2 focused on the toxicity of remdesivir and established its toxicity responses in different human liver cell models.

The interaction between remdesivir and dexamethasone was also investigated. Researchers showed that in human liver cells, remdesivir markedly reduced the cell viability while increasing apoptosis and DNA damage. Importantly, when dexamethasone was included, remdesivir-induced liver cell damage was reduced in the human liver cells. In Aim 3, real-world data from COVID-19 inpatients treated with remdesivir with and without dexamethasone at the same time suggested that patients receiving the drug combination were less likely to show an increase in two biomarkers for liver injury.

While additional clinical trials are required to eventually confirm University of Maryland Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation 's current real-world data, M-CERSI's findings suggest a combination of dexamethasone and remdesivir may reduce the likelihood of remdesivir-induced liver injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Research Impacts The liver is the major organ in the body that reduces the toxicity of drugs and is often challenged by various drugs. In this project, we uncover that dexamethasone use may reduce remdesivir-induced liver toxicity. This finding suggests that in addition to reducing respiratory symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the combination of remdesivir and dexamethasone may provide an alternative safety benefit by reducing the likelihood of liver toxicity from remdesivir.

Remdesivir is not currently FDA-approved for any indication but was previously assessed in a clinical trial comparing treatments for Ebola Virus Disease. On May 1, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for remdesivir. The first DSMB meeting was planned for April 27, 2020. Due to extremely rapid enrollment, the number of recoveries had already exceeded the planned final number of 400 recoveries. Therefore, no interim adjustments to 95% confidence levels were applied for this DSMB analysis. The DSMB concluded that remdesivir was effective and. had a high degree of comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes.

### Association of remdesivir treatment with mortality among… [^1162DDry]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Among the eligible patient cohort, a 2-stage approach was used to achieve balance in baseline characteristics between remdesivir-exposed and PS-matched control patients. In the second stage, we subsequently used the pool of eligible patients in the RSS cohort to perform PS matching to identify cohorts of PS-matched remdesivir-exposed patients and control patients. We used PS methods to adjust for baseline differences between the remdesivir-exposed and control groups. Refer to eTable 1 in the Supplement for definition of covariates included in the PS model. We assessed baseline covariate balance between the exposed and control patients in the PS-matched cohort using absolute standardized differences, applying a threshold of 0. 10 difference to indicate well-balanced groups.
22.

Given the high degree of crossover to remdesivir in the control group and differential censoring, the focus of this article is on the more conservative initial-treatment analysis. Patients were censored on the earliest occurrence of discharge or maximum follow-up of 28 days. Cause-specific hazards models were applied to the PS-matched cohort to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs of remdesivir compared with control patients. Results for the as-treated analysis were similar. In the tipping point analysis, the E-value for the HR of 0. 83 was
1. 70, meaning the HR could be explained completely by residual confounding if an unmeasured confounder had a relative risk association of 1. 70 or greater with remdesivir exposure and with inpatient mortality.

In this large US-based retrospective cohort study with nearly 25 000 remdesivir-exposed hospitalized patients identified between May 1, 2020, and May 3, 2021, remdesivir treatment was associated with an overall significantly reduced inpatient mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with PS-matched control patients. In both studies, the association of remdesivir treatment with lower mortality predominated for the subgroup of patients receiving low-flow oxygen. In contrast, in an analysis using the US Veterans Health Administration database, Ohl et al33 observed no association with mortality among 1172 patients receiving remdesivir and 1172 PS-matched controls.
