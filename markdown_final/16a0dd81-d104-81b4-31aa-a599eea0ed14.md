## Question

Intravenous vs. intraosseous calcium administration in cardiac arrest

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) calcium should be used during cardiac arrest, and which route is preferred if calcium is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether calcium helps in undifferentiated cardiac arrest. Then, I should verify what high-quality trials say about IV versus IO calcium. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile any apparent contradictions. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetic and mechanistic considerations that might favor one route over another. Finally, I will consider special circumstances where calcium is indicated and outline a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the core question: does routine calcium administration during cardiac arrest improve outcomes, regardless of route. The best evidence is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that was stopped early for harm signals; sustained ROSC, 30-day survival, and favorable neurological outcomes were not improved and numerically favored placebo, with a notable increase in hypercalcemia in the calcium arm, so routine calcium is not beneficial and may be harmful in undifferentiated arrests [^eea72631] [^4d83e19c] [^40fbd9a8].

> Wait, let me verify the route-specific angle. The COCA trial allowed both IV and IO administration and did not find a difference by route because the trial was powered to detect a treatment effect of calcium versus placebo, not an IV versus IO interaction; importantly, most doses in that study were actually given IO, yet the harm signal persisted, indicating that the problem is calcium itself in undifferentiated arrests rather than the access route [^eea72631] [^4d83e19c].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure alignment. ILCOR issues a strong recommendation against routine calcium in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and the AHA advises do not administer calcium routinely in adults experiencing cardiac arrest; both bodies allow calcium only in special circumstances such as hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, or calcium channel blocker toxicity, not for undifferentiated arrests [^2cba0a04] [^c84b3d53] [^d6ba4d06].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about route equivalence in all contexts. I need to check pharmacokinetics and clinical signals that might distinguish IV from IO delivery. Animal and human data suggest IO delivery can be comparable for some emergency drugs, but observational and randomized subgroup analyses show worse outcomes with IO for certain agents like amiodarone and lidocaine, and IO may have slower or less reliable drug delivery in low-flow states; moreover, IO access is associated with numerically lower sustained ROSC in several trials, though survival is often similar, so IV remains first-line when feasible [^8d154826] [^33b48e10] [^f7aca771] [^6a999757].

> I will now examine the special circumstances where calcium is actually indicated. For suspected hyperkalemic arrest, expert guidelines recommend IV calcium chloride as first-line therapy; for calcium channel blocker toxicity, expert consensus supports IV calcium in addition to standard ACLS; and in pregnancy with magnesium-related arrest, AHA suggests considering calcium, but these are targeted scenarios rather than routine use, and the evidence base for survival benefit remains limited even in these subgroups [^d7f0e152] [^0cfb0933] [^467bb67b] [^b590651a] [^468b6369] [^d1fd0043].

> Let me think about practical route selection if calcium is truly indicated. When calcium is warranted for hyperkalemia or CCB toxicity, IV administration is preferred because it achieves faster and more predictable systemic delivery; if IV access is unobtainable, IO is an acceptable alternative, but clinicians should recognize potential delays and consider adjuncts like pressure bags to facilitate flow, while avoiding delays to chest compressions or defibrillation [^bb447fe9] [^f6937962].

> But wait, what if someone argues IO is faster and therefore better in arrest. I should double-check that assumption. Recent randomized trials comparing IO-first versus IV-first strategies show no survival advantage for IO-first, and in some analyses sustained ROSC is numerically lower with IO, reinforcing that speed of access does not translate into improved clinical outcomes when the drug itself lacks benefit or is harmful in undifferentiated arrests [^ecbfe23b] [^e65b3773] [^f7aca771].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my recommendation is precise. For undifferentiated cardiac arrest, do not give calcium routinely, regardless of IV or IO route, because it does not improve outcomes and may worsen them. For suspected hyperkalemia, calcium channel blocker overdose, or magnesium-related arrest, give IV calcium chloride promptly if feasible, and use IO only if IV is not available, with awareness of potential slower delivery and the need to avoid treatment delays [^eea72631] [^2cba0a04] [^d7f0e152] [^467bb67b] [^bb447fe9].

Routine calcium is **not recommended** in cardiac arrest [^c84b3d53] because it does not improve survival or neurologic outcomes and may cause harm [^eea72631] [^40fbd9a8]. If calcium is indicated for specific causes (e.g. hyperkalemia, calcium channel blocker overdose) [^d7f0e152] [^467bb67b], **IV is preferred** for faster, more reliable delivery; IO is an acceptable alternative when IV access is delayed or unavailable [^bb447fe9]. IO access is faster and more reliable to establish [^7d7afc65] [^6a999757], but drug delivery may be slower and less predictable, especially for lipophilic agents [^c3b16a31] [^33b48e10]. No evidence shows a difference in outcomes between IV and IO calcium, so route choice should prioritize speed and reliability in the context of the arrest.

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

- **IV calcium**: Direct, rapid delivery to central circulation with predictable pharmacokinetics and immediate pharmacodynamic effects.

- **IO calcium**: Delivery via the bone marrow sinusoids to the central circulation; generally slower and less predictable than IV, with potential depot effects in yellow marrow that can delay peak effect [^c3b16a31].

- **Clinical implications**: IV calcium achieves faster and more reliable therapeutic levels, which is critical in time-sensitive arrests.

---

## Clinical evidence comparing IV and IO calcium administration

- **COCA trial**: The largest RCT of calcium in OHCA found no benefit and a trend toward harm; it allowed both IV and IO routes and did not show a route-specific effect, suggesting no outcome difference between IV and IO calcium [^eea72631] [^4d83e19c].

- **Observational data**: No high-quality studies directly compare IV vs IO calcium; available data do not demonstrate a significant difference in ROSC, survival, or neurologic outcomes by route.

- **Guideline stance**: ILCOR and AHA recommend against routine calcium use in cardiac arrest and do not specify a preferred route, reflecting the lack of comparative outcome data [^2cba0a04] [^c84b3d53].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

ILCOR and AHA recommend against **routine calcium use** in cardiac arrest [^2cba0a04] [^c84b3d53]; when calcium is indicated (e.g. hyperkalemia, calcium channel blocker overdose), IV is preferred for speed and reliability, with IO as an alternative if IV is not feasible [^bb447fe9]. No major guideline recommends a specific route for calcium in undifferentiated cardiac arrest, underscoring the absence of comparative evidence.

---

## Practical considerations

| **Factor** | **Intravenous (iv) access** | **Intraosseous (io) access** |
|-|-|-|
| Speed of establishment | Slower; more difficult in arrest due to collapsed veins | Faster; high first-attempt success; less affected by vasocollapse [^7d7afc65] [^6a999757] |
| Reliability of drug delivery | High; direct central circulation | Generally acceptable; may be slower/less predictable, especially for lipophilic drugs [^c3b16a31] [^33b48e10] |
| Complications | Extravasation, infiltration, infection | Misplacement, dislodgement, infection, compartment syndrome (rare) [^ed7eb27a] |
| Operator skill required | Moderate; routine training | Moderate; specific IO training needed [^7d7afc65] |

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

- **Routine cardiac arrest**: Do not administer calcium routinely; no benefit and possible harm [^eea72631] [^40fbd9a8].

- **Hyperkalemic arrest**: Give calcium promptly; use IV if available, IO if IV is delayed or unavailable [^d7f0e152] [^0cfb0933].

- **Calcium channel blocker overdose**: Give calcium; prefer IV, use IO if IV is not feasible [^467bb67b] [^b590651a].

- **No IV access**: IO is a reasonable alternative for calcium when indicated, acknowledging potentially slower delivery [^bb447fe9] [^c3b16a31].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Routine calcium is **not recommended** in cardiac arrest; when indicated, **IV is preferred** for speed and reliability, with IO as an acceptable alternative if IV is delayed or unavailable. There is **no evidence** that IV and IO calcium produce different outcomes, so route choice should prioritize rapid, reliable access and the clinical context.

### Effect of intravenous or intraosseous calcium vs saline on return of spontaneous circulation in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a randomized clinical trial [^eea72631]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It is unclear whether administration of calcium has a beneficial effect in patients with cardiac arrest.

Objective

To determine whether administration of calcium during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest improves return of spontaneous circulation in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial included 397 adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and was conducted in the Central Denmark Region between January 20, 2020, and April 15, 2021. The last 90-day follow-up was on July 15, 2021.

Interventions

The intervention consisted of up to 2 intravenous or intraosseous doses with 5 mmol of calcium chloride (n = 197) or saline (n = 200). The first dose was administered immediately after the first dose of epinephrine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was sustained return of spontaneous circulation. The secondary outcomes included survival and a favorable neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0–3) at 30 days and 90 days.

Results

Based on a planned interim analysis of 383 patients, the steering committee stopped the trial early due to concerns about harm in the calcium group. Of 397 adult patients randomized, 391 were included in the analyses (193 in the calcium group and 198 in the saline group; mean age, 68 [SD, 14] years; 114 [29%] were female). There was no loss to follow-up. There were 37 patients (19%) in the calcium group who had sustained return of spontaneous circulation compared with 53 patients (27%) in the saline group (risk ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.03]; risk difference, -7.6% [95% CI, -16% to 0.8%]; P = 0.09). At 30 days, 10 patients (5.2%) in the calcium group and 18 patients (9.1%) in the saline group were alive (risk ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.27 to 1.18]; risk difference, -3.9% [95% CI, -9.4% to 1.3%]; P = 0.17). A favorable neurological outcome at 30 days was observed in 7 patients (3.6%) in the calcium group and in 15 patients (7.6%) in the saline group (risk ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.20 to 1.12]; risk difference, -4.0% [95% CI, -8.9% to 0.7%]; P = 0.12). Among the patients with calcium values measured who had return of spontaneous circulation, 26 (74%) in the calcium group and 1 (2%) in the saline group had hypercalcemia.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, treatment with intravenous or intraosseous calcium compared with saline did not significantly improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation. These results do not support the administration of calcium during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults.

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^2cba0a04]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Calcium during cardiac arrest — evidence and ILCOR recommendations report that an ILCOR systematic review assessed intravenous or intraosseous calcium during cardiac arrest compared with no calcium and found that randomized controlled trials and observational studies in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest did not show an improvement in outcomes; among the randomized controlled trials, the largest trial was terminated early due to concern for harm and two trials suggested worse functional outcomes at 90 days and 1 year; in the most recent trial of 391 adults, at 1 year, 9 patients in the calcium group (4.7%) were alive compared with 18 (9.1%) with placebo (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.24–1.09), and 7 (3.6%) were alive with a favorable neurological outcome compared with 17 (8.6%) with placebo (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18–0.97); the updated ILCOR treatment recommendations include a strong recommendation against the routine administration of calcium for treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults and a weak recommendation against calcium administration for treatment of in-hospital cardiac arrests in adults.

Route of administration

A variety of routes for drug administration have been used over the years. These include intra-cardiac, central intravenous (IV), endobronchial, peripheral IV and intraosseous access (IO). Current guidelines do not recommend intracardiac or endobronchial administration due to the risk of injury / misplacement (intracardiac) or variable / uncertain absorption (endobronchial). If central venous access is already in place then it should be the preferred route for drug administration due to the short transit time of drugs injected to reach the central circulation. The risks of misplacement and damage to adjacent structure through attempting central venous cannulation during CPR likely outweigh the benefits. The intramuscular route for adrenaline administration in cardiac arrest might facilitate very early drug administration, but ongoing uncertainties regarding its absorption preclude its routine use outside the research setting.

The use of IO drug administration has been growing in recent years. In the PARAMEDIC2 one third of participants received drug treatment through the IO route whilst in the COCA (calcium for out of hospital cardiac arrest) trial it was as high as two thirds. Potential advantages of the IO route are that it is easier and quicker to obtain IO rather than IV access. Disadvantages include misplacement and variable drug absorption, although a post hoc analysis of survivors in the COCA trial showed similar ionised calcium levels on hospital admission between patients administered calcium chloride via the IO and IV route.

Observational studies comparing IO and IV drug administration are often limited by the risk of confounding due to resuscitation time bias as IO is often used as a rescue therapy after initial attempts at IV access have failed. The PARAMEDIC2 study, was able to provide unique insights in the potential efficacy of the IO route as it included matched patients who received placebo through both the intravenous and IO routes. The study reported that the adjusted odds ratios for ROSC were similar in the IV (adjusted OR 4.07 (95% CI 3.42–4.85)) and IO groups (adjusted OR 3.98 (95% CI 2.86–5.53), p-value for interaction 0.90). Survival rates were not statistically different for long-term survival and favourable neurological outcomes between the IO and IV group.

The potential benefit of an IO first strategy in out of hospital cardiac arrest is being tested in ongoing trials in Denmark (NCT05205031) and the United Kingdom (ISCRTN 14223494).

Calcium During Cardiac Arrest (SysRev)

Rationale for Review

Calcium has not been recommended for routine use during cardiac arrest for many years, but it continues to be given frequently. This topic was prioritized because of the publication of a recent RCT that adds significantly to the available evidence. A SysRev was conducted by members of the ALS Task Force (PROSPERO CRD4202234964). The SysRev included literature on adults and children. The evidence for adults was considered for this CoSTR. The full online CoSTR can be found on the ILCOR website.

### Intravenous vs. intraosseous administration of drugs during cardiac arrest: a systematic review [^4dd407ee]. Resuscitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To perform a systematic review of the literature on intravenous (IV) vs. intraosseous (IO) administration of drugs during cardiac arrest in order to inform an update of international guidelines.

Methods

The review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO. Medline, Embase and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews were searched on December 17, 2019 for studies comparing IV to IO administration of drugs. The population included neonatal, paediatric, and adult patients with cardiac arrest. Two investigators reviewed each search for study relevance, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of individual studies. Meta-analyses were performed for studies without a critical risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE.

Results

We included six observational studies comparing IV to IO administration of drugs and two randomized trials assessing the effect of specific drugs in subgroups related to IV vs. IO administration. All studies included adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. No studies were identified in neonatal or paediatric patients. The risk of bias for the observational studies was overall assessed as critical or serious, with confounding and selection bias being the primary sources of bias. The meta-analyses excluding studies with a critical risk of bias favoured IV access for all outcomes. Using GRADE, the certainty of evidence was judged at very low. Subgroup analyses of the two randomized trials demonstrated no statistically significant interactions between the route of access and study drugs on outcomes. However, these trials were underpowered to assess such interactions.

Conclusions

We identified a limited number of studies comparing IV vs. IO administration of drugs during cardiac arrest. Pooled results from four observational studies favoured IV access with very low certainty of evidence. From the subgroup analyses of two randomized clinical trials, there was no statistically significant interaction between the route of access and study drug on outcomes.

### Intravenous vs intraosseous administration of drugs for out of hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^98dd828b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of global mortality. Timely drug administration via vascular access is critical, with intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO) routes being the primary options. Current guidelines prefer IV access but recommend IO when IV access is delayed. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the clinical effectiveness of IO compared to IV access in adults with OHCA.

Methods

A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases through November 2024 identified RCTs comparing IO and IV drug administration in OHCA patients aged ≥ 18 years. Outcomes included 30-day survival, sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favorable neurological outcomes. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

Three RCTs comprising 9293 patients were included. No significant differences were found between IO and IV routes for 30-day survival (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.76–1.34, p = 0.98), sustained ROSC (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.97–1.21, p = 0.18), survival to hospital discharge (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.84–1.25, p = 0.80), or favorable neurological outcomes (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77–1.13, p = 0.49).

Conclusion

IV and IO access routes demonstrated comparable outcomes for survival and neurological function in OHCA. These findings support the flexibility to prioritize the most practical route in emergency settings, particularly when IV access is delayed or challenging. Further research should explore patient-level outcomes and health economic implications.

### Improving vasopressor use in cardiac arrest [^1c9d992e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The Chain of Survival highlights the effectiveness of early recognition of cardiac arrest and call for help, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and early defibrillation. Most patients, however, remain in cardiac arrest despite these interventions. Drug treatments, particularly the use of vasopressors, have been included in resuscitation algorithms since their inception. This narrative review describes the current evidence base for vasopressors and reports that adrenaline (1 mg) is highly effective at achieving return of spontaneous circulation (number needed to treat 4) but is less effective on long-term outcomes (survival to 30 days, number needed to treat 111) with uncertain effects on survival with a favourable neurological outcome. Randomised trials evaluating vasopressin, either as an alternative to or in addition to adrenaline, and high-dose adrenaline have failed to find evidence of improved long-term outcomes. There is a need for future trials to evaluate the interaction between steroids and vasopressin. Evidence for other vasopressors (e.g. noradrenaline, phenylephedrine) is insufficient to support or refute their use. The use of intravenous calcium chloride as a routine intervention in out of hospital cardiac arrest is not associated with benefit and may cause harm. The optimal route for vascular access between peripheral intravenous versus intraosseous routes is currently the subject of two large randomised trials. Intracardiac, endobronchial, and intramuscular routes are not recommended. Central venous administration should be limited to patients where an existing central venous catheter is in situ and patent.

### A randomized trial of drug route in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^ec614ae7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Primary and secondary outcomes

Primary outcome data were available for 3030 (99.7%) participants in the intraosseous group and 3034 (99.7%) participants in the intravenous group. Survival at 30-days occurred in 137 of 3030 (4.5%) in the intraosseous group and 155 of 3034 (5.1%) in the intravenous group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.945, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.676–1.322, p = 0.741). Results were similar in the unadjusted analysis.

The proportion of patients who survived to hospital discharge with a favorable neurological outcome was 80 of 2994 (2.7%) in the intraosseous group and 85 of 2986 patients (2.8%) in the intravenous group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.914, 95% CI 0.567–1.474). The proportion of patients who achieved return of spontaneous circulation at any time was 1092 of 3031 (36.0%) in the intraosseous group and 1186 of 3035 patients (39.1%) in the intravenous group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.863; 95% CI 0.765–0.974). The proportion who achieved a sustained return of spontaneous circulation and other secondary outcomes are presented in Table 3.

The results for the primary outcome were consistent across prespecified sub-groups (figure 2; figure S5) and sensitivity analyses (tables S10-S13; figure S7).

Adverse events

One adverse event was reported, whereby a patient in the intraosseous group reported ongoing mild leg pain during certain activities (table three; tables S14 to S16). The event was not deemed to be serious.

### Pediatric advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^814c7ab1]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous versus intraosseous administration of drugs during cardiac arrest in adults in the in-hospital or out-of-hospital setting was compared in an International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) systematic review, with outcomes of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital discharge reported as very low-certainty evidence; three studies including 24,686 adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests reported 61 fewer per 1,000 cardiac arrests with ROSC associated with use of IO access compared with IV access (aOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.81; aRD, -6.1%; 95% CI, -2.7 to -0.5), and these same studies showed 17 fewer per 1,000 survived to hospital discharge (95% CI, 27 fewer to 5 fewer) with IO access compared with IV access (aOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.93; aRD, -1.7%; 95% CI, -2.7 to -0.5). A weak recommendation is made by ILCOR for the use of IV access compared with IO access as the first attempt for drug administration during adult cardiac arrest; if attempts at IV access are unsuccessful or IV access is not feasible, IO access is suggested as a route for drug administration during adult cardiac arrest. Intraosseous access may be considered as an alternative to intravenous (IV) access in emergency situations when IV access is unsuccessful or not feasible.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1810e2d5]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid and reliable vascular access is essential during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), as timely administration of drugs, such as epinephrine, significantly impacts their effectiveness. Intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO) access are critical methods used in advanced life support to facilitate drug delivery during resuscitation efforts.

The optimum route for drug administration in patients with OHCA remains uncertain. The IO route has recently gained popularity because of its relative ease and speed in securing vascular access. On the other hand, the IV route has been suggested to offer a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile for drugs administered during resuscitation. Contemporary guidelines from the American Heart Association and European Resuscitation Council suggested prioritizing the IV route for administering drugs during OHCA and reserving the IO route in cases of IV access failure. This recommendation was supported mainly by pooled results from retrospective observational studies, which suggested worse clinical outcomes with the IO method than with IV access. However, as acknowledged by the guidelines, there was substantial heterogeneity across the observational studies regarding study design, selection protocols for access routes, adjustments for resuscitation variables, patient characteristics, and IO access sites. In some of these studies, IO access was applied only when the IV route was unsuccessful or when the choice of vascular access was based on paramedics' judgments. Under these circumstances, patients who received IO access were possibly in more critical condition, and the findings from observational studies were subject to resuscitation time bias. Secondary analyses of some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with OHCA for different resuscitation interventions suggested no significant effect modification by the drug administration route. However, these trials did not randomize the patients based on vascular access and were underpowered to assess differences between IV and IO access.

Recently, some RCTs have provided valuable insights into the choice of vascular access routes in adults with OHCA but were not individually powered for clinical outcomes and had conflicting results in terms of some endpoints, such as sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) between the IO and IV access routes. Additionally, it is still unknown whether certain patient-related resuscitation factors, such as bystander CPR, witnessed status, time to vascular access, initial rhythm type, and vascular access site, play a role in the choice of vascular access. Therefore, we pooled high-quality data from RCTs comparing the effectiveness of IO versus IV access in adult patients with OHCA, aiming to estimate the comparative effectiveness of each vascular access type across the overall study population and within key prognostic subgroups.

Calcium in in-hospital cardiac arrest — No RCTs were identified that compared calcium administration with no calcium administration during in-hospital cardiac arrests, hence the weak recommendation against the use of calcium for adults with in-hospital cardiac arrests. Calcium is administered for special circumstances, such as hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, hypocalcemia and calcium channel overdose, but the ILCOR review notes that there is insufficient data from existing trials to evaluate these subgroups.

### Drug routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a summary of current evidence [^83442fdb]. Resuscitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence showing the clinical effectiveness of drug therapy in cardiac arrest has led to renewed interest in the optimal route for drug administration in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Current resuscitation guidelines support use of the intravenous route for intra-arrest drug delivery, with the intraosseous route reserved for patients in whom intravenous access cannot be established. We sought to evaluate current evidence on drug route for administration of cardiac arrest drugs, with a specific focus on the intravenous and intraosseous route. We identified relevant animal, manikin, and human studies through targeted searches of MEDLINE in June 2022. Across pre-hospital systems, there is wide variation in use of the intraosseous route. Early administration of cardiac arrest drugs is associated with improved patient outcomes. Challenges in obtaining intravenous access mean that the intraosseous access may facilitate earlier drug administration. However, time from administration to the central circulation is unclear with pharmacokinetic data limited mainly to animal studies. Observational studies comparing the effect of intravenous and intraosseous drug administration on patient outcomes are challenging to interpret because of resuscitation time bias and other confounders. To date, no randomised controlled trial has directly compared the effect on patient outcomes of intraosseous compared with intravenous drug administration in cardiac arrest. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation has described the urgent need for randomised controlled trials comparing the intravenous and intraosseous route in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Ongoing clinical trials will directly address this knowledge gap.

### Intraosseous administration of antidotes-a systematic review [^6b4015f5]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Intraosseous (IO) access is an established route of administration in resuscitation situations. Patients with serious poisoning presenting to the emergency department may require urgent antidote therapy. However, intravenous (IV) access is not always readily available.

Objective

This study reviews the current evidence for IO administration of antidotes that could be used in poisoning. The primary outcome was mortality as a surrogate of efficacy. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic variables, electrocardiographic variables, neurological status, pharmacokinetics outcomes, and adverse effects as defined by each article.

Methods

A medical librarian created a systematic search strategy for Medline, subsequently translated to Embase, BIOSIS, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and the CENTRAL clinical trial register, all of which we searched from inception to 30 June 2016. Interventions included IO administration of selected antidotes. Articles included volunteer studies, poisoning, or other resuscitation contexts such as cardiac arrest, burns, dehydration, seizure, hemorrhagic shock, or undifferentiated shock. We considered all human studies and animal experiments to the exception of in vitro studies. Two reviewers independently selected studies, and a third adjudicated in case of disagreement. Three reviewers extracted all relevant data. Three reviewers evaluated the risk of bias and quality of the articles using specific scales according to each type of study design.

Results

A total of 47 publications (46 articles and one abstract) met our inclusion criteria and described IO administration of 13 different antidotes. These included one case series and 21 case reports describing 26 patients, and 25 animal experiments. Of those, seven human case reports and four animal experiments specifically reported the use of antidotes in poisoning. Human case reports suggested favorable outcomes with IO use of atropine, diazepam, hydroxocobalamin, insulin, lipid emulsion, methylene blue, phentolamine, prothrombin complex concentrate, and sodium bicarbonate. Clinical outcomes varied according to the antidote used. The only reported adverse event was ventricular tachycardia following IO naloxone. Regarding the animal experiments, IO administration of lipid emulsion and of hydroxocobalamin showed improved survival in bupivacaine-poisoned rats and in cyanide-intoxicated swine, respectively. Animal data also suggested an equivalent bio-availability between IO and IV administration for atropine, calcium chloride, dextrose 50%, diazepam, methylene blue, pralidoxime, and sodium bicarbonate. Adverse effect reporting of fat emboli after IO administration of sodium bicarbonate, for example, was conflicting due to the significant heterogeneity in the timing of lung examination across studies.

Conclusion

The evidence supporting the use of IO route for the administration of antidotes in a context of poisoning is scarce. The majority of the evidence consists of case reports and animal experiments. Common antidotes such as acetylcysteine, fomepizole, and digoxin-specific antibody fragments have not been studied or reported with the use of the IO route. Despite the low-quality evidence available, IO access is a potential option for antidotal treatments in toxicological resuscitation when IV access is unavailable.

### Intraosseous compared to intravenous drug resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^0a631940]. Resuscitation (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Although the intraosseous (IO) route is increasingly used for vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), little is known about its comparative effectiveness relative to intravenous (IV) access. We evaluated clinical outcomes following OHCA comparing drug administration via IO versus IV routes.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated Emergency Medical Services (EMS)-treated adults with atraumatic OHCA in a large metropolitan EMS system between 9/1/2012–12/31/2014. Access was classified as IO or IV based on the route of first EMS drug administration. Study endpoints were survival to hospital discharge, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital admission.

Results

Among 2164 adults with OHCA, 1800 met eligibility criteria, 1525 of whom were treated via IV and 275 principally via tibial-IO routes. Compared to IV, IO-treated patients were younger, more often women, had unwitnessed OHCA, a non-cardiac aetiology, and presented with non-shockable rhythms. IO versus IV-treated patients were less likely to survive to hospital discharge (14.9% vs 22.8%, p = 0.003), achieve ROSC (43.6% vs 55.5%, p < 0.001) or be hospitalized (38.5% vs 50.0% p < 0.001). In multivariable adjusted analyses, IO treatment was not associated with survival to discharge (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) 0.81 (0.55, 1.21), p = 0.31), but was associated with a lower likelihood of ROSC (OR = 0.67 (0.50, 0.88), p = 0.004) and survival to hospitalization (OR = 0.68 (0.51, 0.91), p = 0.009).

Conclusion

Though not independently associated with survival to discharge, principally tibial IO versus IV treatment was associated with a lower likelihood of ROSC and hospitalization. How routes of vascular access influence clinical outcomes after OHCA merits additional study.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^ddfd09e6]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid and reliable vascular access is crucial during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). While intraosseous (IO) and intravenous (IV) access are used, their comparative effectiveness for patient outcomes remains uncertain.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for RCTs comparing IO vs. IV access in adults with OHCA. The primary outcome was survival (30 days or until discharge), while secondary outcomes included sustained ROSC, favorable neurological outcome, successful first-attempt vascular access, and time from emergency medical service arrival to access. Pooled odds ratios (OR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

Results

Four RCTs with 9475 patients were included. No significant differences were found between IO and IV groups in survival (6.6% vs. 6.9%, OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84–1.18) or favorable neurological outcome (4.7% vs. 4.6%, OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.88–1.30). The sustained ROSC rate was numerically, but not significantly, lower in IO vs. IV access (24.6% vs. 27.0%, OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80–1.06). IO access had a higher first-attempt success rate (92.3% vs. 62.3%; OR 6.18, 95% CI 3.50–10.91) and was 15 s faster than IV for vascular access (IO: 11.03 ± 5.57, IV: 11.35 ± 6.16 min, MD − 0.25, 95% CI − 0.48 to − 0.01).

Conclusions

IO access had a higher first-attempt success rate and faster establishment than IV access, but no significant differences were found in survival or favorable neurological outcomes in adults with OHCA. Sustained ROSC was numerically lower with IO access than IV access, although the difference was not statistically significant.

### A randomized trial of drug route in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^f23c42e6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Recent trials have explored the clinical effectiveness of cardiac arrest drugs. The effects of which are highly time-dependent, suggesting earlier drug administration may improve outcomes. Securing intravenous access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is challenging, because of environmental and patient factors. In previous trials, time from the emergency call to drug administration has ranged from 16 to 21-minutes.

In observational studies and one small randomized trial, the intraosseous, compared with the intravenous route, facilitated more rapid drug administration, particularly when the proximal tibial site is used. Observational studies comparing intraosseous and intravenous drug administration in cardiac arrest report similar or worse outcomes in patients receiving intraosseous drugs, but these studies are challenging to interpret as intraosseous access is typically attempted after a failed intravenous access attempt confounding findings because of resuscitation time bias. – International resuscitation guidelines recommend peripheral intravenous access as the primary vascular access route, but studies show increasing use of intraosseous access (up to 60%) in some systems.–

Given ongoing uncertainty as to the optimal drug route in adult cardiac arrest, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation highlighted the urgent need for randomized trials to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the intraosseous access route. In response, we conducted the PARAMEDIC-3 trial to determine the clinical effectiveness of an intraosseous-first compared with an intravenous-first strategy for adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

Protocol and registration

This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol of this study is registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD4202461536). Institutional review board approvals were not required since the study utilized study-level results.

Data sources and search strategy

Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed and Embase to identify RCTs investigating the effectiveness of initial attempts at IO or IV vascular access in patients who experienced OHCA (Supplemental Table 1; the last search date was November 20, 2024). No restrictions were applied regarding language or publication date. The references of the included RCTs and other relevant studies were manually searched to detect additional studies. Furthermore, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing RCTs.

Eligibility criteria and study selection

We sought trials that specifically randomized patients with OHCA based on the type of vascular access — either IO or IV — where resuscitation efforts were initiated and immediate vascular access was required. Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with OHCA due to non-traumatic or traumatic causes were eligible. We excluded non-original publications (reviews, commentaries, or editorials), non-randomized investigations, and randomized studies based on other resuscitating interventions. Two investigators (S. A. and S.R.) independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the selected studies against the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with each other.

Outcomes

The primary effectiveness outcome was survival, measured at a 30-day follow-up or until hospital discharge. Other effectiveness outcomes included the sustained ROSC, favorable neurological outcome, successful first-attempt vascular access, and time from emergency medical service (EMS) arrival on scene to vascular access. The sustained ROSC was defined in case resuscitation efforts were initially successful, further chest compressions were not required for 20 min, and signs of circulation persisted for at least 20 min. A favorable neurological outcome (at 30 days or until discharge) was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 or less or a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2.

The safety outcome of interest was vascular access-specific adverse events, including extravasation, inflammation, necrosis, phlebitis, osteomyelitis, compartment syndrome, traumatic bone fracture, and inability to weight-bearing. Serious adverse events were defined as those requiring either inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, being life-threatening, or resulting in death.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c3b16a31]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite faster and higher vascular success rates with IO compared with the IV method, we did not observe any differences in clinical outcomes. Some pharmacokinetic and biological mechanisms may contribute to these findings. First, the anatomical site of administration (upper vs. lower body) may influence the effective delivery of a drug to the heart during active CPR, regardless of whether the drug is administered IV or IO. Experimental studies have shown that drugs delivered through an IV route reaching the heart via the inferior vena cava during active CPR experience delayed time-to-peak and lower peak concentrations than those delivered via the superior vena cava. Second, in adults, red bone marrow is replaced by less vascular yellow bone marrow, and the density of this yellow bone marrow also decreases with age, potentially affecting drug absorption from the IO route. Third, adipose-rich tibial yellow bone marrow exhibits a depot effect, acting as a reservoir after drug administration and gradually releasing the drug into circulation, especially for lipophilic medications such as amiodarone, which are expected to be highly absorbed in fatty marrow. Fourth, owing to diminished blood flow during circulatory shock or in response to vasopressors, fluid boluses and pressurized infusions are sometimes necessary to enhance drug movement into the central circulation, with infusion rates being more affected and decreased in IO access than in IV access.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^e7b04e00]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

While the current meta-analysis compared IO and IV access in adult patients with OHCA, it is important to recognize that outcomes for IO access may vary depending on the specific site of placement, i.e. humeral or tibial IO access. The pooled analysis suggested a trend that tibial IO insertion may be faster than IV access (MD − 0.53, 95% CI − 1.67 to 0.60). In contrast, the humeral IO showed a trend in the opposite direction (MD 0.39, 95% CI − 0.13 to 0.91). However, the findings did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to insufficient power. The comparative effectiveness of IO access sites (humeral and tibial) requires further investigation.

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recently reviewed this topic. The ILCOR recommended IV access, compared with IO access, as the first attempt for vascular access during adult cardiac arrest (weak recommendation, low certainty evidence). The ILCOR added that if IV access cannot be rapidly achieved within two attempts, it is reasonable to consider IO access as an alternative route for vascular access during adult cardiac arrest (good practice statement). These recommendations were largely driven by the findings of the PARAMEDIC-3 trial, which demonstrated reduced sustained ROSC with IO compared with IV access (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74–0.98). Our meta-analysis of three RCTs, aligned with these recommendations, showed a reduced sustained ROSC with IO access compared with IV access (24.6% vs. 27.0%, OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80–1.06), suggesting a potential preference for IV access, though this difference did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, as noted by the ILCOR and current meta-analysis, there were no significant differences between IO access and IV access regarding longer-term outcomes, including 30-day survival and favorable neurological outcomes. Furthermore, paramedics are generally more familiar with IV access; thus, IV access can be considered as the preferred first-line approach for patients with OHCA when feasible. However, IO access remains a viable alternative in cases where IV access is difficult or delayed.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous access in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: insights from the resuscitation outcomes consortium continuous chest compression trial [^19c3598b]. Resuscitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine outcomes associated with intraosseous access route attempt for delivery of medications during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitation.

Methods

Using data from the Continuous Chest Compression trial, we examined rates of survival to hospital discharge, sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and survival with favorable neurological function among patients with intraosseous and intravenous access attempts after adjusting for age, sex, initial rhythm, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, public location, witnessed status, EMS response and trial randomization cluster.

Results

Among 19,731 patients, intraosseous access was attempted in 3068 patients and intravenous access in 16,663 patients respectively. Patients in whom intraosseous access was attempted were younger, more often female, and had marginally faster times to initial access and to initial drug administration. Unadjusted outcomes were significantly lower in patients with attempted intraosseous access compared with intravenous access: (4.6% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.01) for survival to discharge, (17.9% vs. 23.5%, p < 0.001) for sustained ROSC and (2.8% vs. 4.2%, p < 0.001) for survival with favorable neurological function. After adjustment, there were no differences in hospital survival (OR, 0.88, 95% CI 0.72–1.09, p = 0.24) or survival with favorable neurological function (OR, 0.87, 95% CI 0.67–1.12, p = 0.29) in patients with intraosseous access attempt (vs. intravenous access). However, intraosseous access continued to associate with lower rates of sustained ROSC (OR, 0.80, 95% CI 0.71–0.89, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among patients with OHCA, intraosseous access attempt was associated with worse ROSC rates but no difference in survival. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the optimal access route among OHCA patients.

### Emergency medicine updates: cardiac arrest medications [^eb27a04e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest is a serious condition frequently managed in the emergency department (ED). Medications are a component of cardiac arrest management.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning medications used for patients in cardiac arrest.

Discussion

Several medications have been evaluated for use in cardiac arrest. Routes of administration may include intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO). IV administration is recommended, though if an attempt at IV access is unsuccessful, IO access can be utilized. Epinephrine is a core component of guidelines, which recommend 1 mg in those with shockable rhythms if initial CPR and defibrillation are unsuccessful, while in nonshockable rhythms, guidelines recommend that epinephrine 1 mg be administered as soon as feasible. While epinephrine may improve rates of ROSC, it is not associated with improved survival with a favorable neurologic outcome. Evidence suggests the combination of vasopressin, steroids, and epinephrine may improve ROSC among those with in-hospital cardiac arrest, but there is no improvement in survival to discharge and survival with a favorable neurologic outcome. Antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, lidocaine, procainamide) likely do not improve short-term or long-term survival or neurologic outcomes, though guidelines state that amiodarone may be used in those with cardiac arrest and refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF). Calcium and sodium bicarbonate should not be routinely administered in those with cardiac arrest. Beta-blockers may be considered in those with shock-resistant pVT/VF.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates concerning medication use in cardiac can improve the ED care of these patients.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in upper extremity among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: cluster randomised clinical trial (VICTOR trial) [^905a0d8f]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest affects millions of people worldwide annually. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and early defibrillation have been shown to improve outcomes, especially for patients with a shockable rhythm. However, a larger proportion of patients worldwide have non-shockable rhythms. Despite the expected lower impact, timely vascular access is also vital to facilitate the prompt administration of drugs, fluid resuscitation, and other interventions, all of which play a crucial role in resuscitation. Peripheral intravenous and intraosseous access are two of the most common types of vascular access in pre-hospital settings, and both have been an integral part of advanced life support. Guidelines for resuscitation suggest prioritising the intravenous route for administering drugs during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and using the intraosseous route as a back-up when intravenous access is not possible.

Previous retrospective studies have attempted to compare outcomes between intraosseous and peripheral intravenous vascular access in adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. None of these studies has reported a statistically significant association between intraosseous access and improved patient outcomes after resuscitation, and some studies have further indicated that intravenous access leads to better survival outcomes. However, all these studies have common limitations; hence, objective interpretation of the results and drawing definitive conclusions are challenging. In some studies, the choice of vascular access was at the discretion of the healthcare providers, whereas intraosseous access was applied only when the intravenous route was unsuccessful in other studies. Under these circumstances, the patients who received intraosseous access possibly had worse conditions and inherited resuscitation time bias. Furthermore, the anatomical sites for intraosseous access placement varied. Although the humeral intraosseous route provides more rapid drug delivery to the right ventricle, its use may be less prevalent in some health systems. A recent meta-analysis of nine observational studies found no significant association between intraosseous versus intravenous access and clinical outcomes. Moreover, reviews have highlighted the heterogeneity across the observational studies and emphasised significant concerns about selection bias and confounding.

Compared with the intravenous route, the intraosseous route offers quicker and more reliable access in cardiac arrest situations with collapsed peripheral veins, resulting in a higher first attempt success rate and significantly shorter time to medication than conventional intravenous access. However, the clinical significance of variation in vascular access remains uncertain, underscoring the need for further high quality prospective studies. In this study, we hypothesised that adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent intraosseous vascular access attempts would have higher rates of survival at hospital discharge than those who underwent intravenous access.

Comparison with other studies

To clarify the effect of pre-hospital medication, we compared patients receiving adrenaline as per the study protocol and those with no adrenaline administration owing to failure to establish a route (supplementary tables E and F). The results showed that patients who received adrenaline had a higher proportion of short term outcomes such as pre-hospital return of spontaneous circulation, and the effect was more prominent in patients with non-shockable rhythms. However, the use of adrenaline was not associated with survival to hospital discharge. These findings are comparable to those of a recent network meta-analysis. Furthermore, for patients with shockable rhythm who received amiodarone, we did not find a significant difference in survival between intravenous and intraosseous routes (supplementary table G). In a post hoc analysis of the ALPS randomised controlled trial, comparison of two routes of administration for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation found that intravenous administration of amiodarone resulted in better survival than did intraosseous administration. This difference in outcomes may be attributed to the drug's lipophilicity and its local interaction with bone marrow. However, in our study, we included all non-traumatic patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, both non-shockable and shockable. Given that only a small portion of patients in our trial had a refractory shockable rhythm, the result was inconclusive. Future studies to answer these complex clinical questions are warranted.

Recent resuscitation guidelines recommend that healthcare providers initially establishing intravenous access for drug administration during cardiac arrest is reasonable and that intraosseous access is appropriate if the intravenous route fails or is not feasible. However, all previous studies supporting the practice were retrospective in design, lacked a meticulously defined intervention protocol, and could potentially introduce significant selection bias into the results. Moreover, site specificity would also be a problem that might affect outcomes with intraosseous administration. In a study involving 10 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the mean time from humeral intraosseous access to the right ventricle was 5.6 s, and it was theoretically quicker than tibial access. Therefore, our study followed a strictly defined protocol to control the comparability of insertion sites in which intraosseous access was limited to the humeral head, whereas intravenous access was directed to the upper extremities to reduce the concerns about different distances from the insertion site to the heart. Also, a recent retrospective study found that upper extremity intraosseous access was associated with slightly better outcomes than lower extremity intraosseous access.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^25c94f48]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Generalizing the findings of this meta-analysis to the wide spectrum of adult patients with OHCA requires specific considerations. First, the predominant population in this study consisted of patients with non-traumatic cardiac arrest, with fewer than 0.9% experiencing traumatic OHCA. Therefore, these findings may not apply to traumatic OHCA. Second, some of the included trials excluded patients above 80 years of age (due to concerns for high risk for osteoporosis) and pregnant patients. Further research is needed to ascertain the optimal vascular access route in these specific populations.

This study had some limitations. First, we estimated the mean and standard deviation of time from EMS arrival to vascular access based on the median and interquartile range for some trials with unavailable data. The method applied in this meta-analysis has been used in prior meta-analyses of continuous outcomes and is considered the best method of estimation. Second, in the subgroup analyses, we did not observe signals for effect modification based on patient-related resuscitation factors or IO access sites (humeral vs. tibial) between IO and IV access. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to limited statistical power. Furthermore, data limitations prevented us from exploring the effects of age and certain comorbidities (e.g. previous neurological disorders) between the IO and IV access groups. An individual participant data meta-analysis of RCTs could offer valuable insights into these subgroups. Third, there was heterogeneity in the trial protocols regarding vascular access attempts and study design. Fourth, the trials did not report the details of post-resuscitation care, which may impact long-term clinical outcomes. However, it can be assumed that by virtue of randomization, post-resuscitation factors were similarly distributed between the IO and IV arms.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6ca9ac2f]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis, synthesizing data from four RCTs, provides comprehensive evidence on the comparative effectiveness of IO and IV vascular access in adult patients with OHCA. IO access achieved a higher first-attempt success rate and a slightly shorter time to vascular access compared to IV access. However, the pooled analysis found no significant differences in key clinical outcomes, including survival and favorable neurological outcome, between the two groups. The sustained ROSC rate was numerically lower in the IO group compared with the IV group (24.6% vs. 27.0%), though this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 7). These findings support IV access as the preferred first-line approach when feasible. However, IO access remains a viable alternative in cases where IV access is difficult or delayed.

Fig. 7
Meta-analysis summary

Previous studies have shown that each minute delay in epinephrine administration was associated with a 4% decrease in survival and ROSC in patients experiencing OHCA. Establishing IV access in cardiac arrest situations with collapsed peripheral veins is challenging. On the other hand, IO access can provide fast, non-collapsible entry to the venous plexus in the bone marrow, with a relatively high success rate. In this meta-analysis, IO access consistently resulted in more than six-fold higher first-attempt success rates than IV access across all trials (OR 6.18, 95% CI 3.50–10.91), translating to a 15-s decrease in the time to vascular access. It is also noteworthy to mention that, regardless of the type of vascular access, there were substantial differences in time intervals for vascular access between the trials (Fig. 4). Specifically, the IVIO and Reades et al. trials reported faster vascular access times than the PARAMEDIC-3 and VICTOR trials. This variation may be attributable to differences in trial design, as PARAMEDIC-3 and VICTOR (in contrast to the IVIO and Reades et al. trials) were pragmatic trials and more closely reflected real-world clinical practice where procedural delays are more common. Additionally, differences in the EMS systems, paramedic training, and regional protocols may have contributed to this variation. These findings highlight the importance of minimizing delays and optimizing vascular access strategies in real-world practice to improve efficiency in OHCA management. Regarding safety outcomes for each access, no serious adverse events (such as tissue necrosis, osteomyelitis, or compartment syndrome) were reported in the trials.

### A randomized trial of drug route in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^ecbfe23b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the effectiveness of drugs such as epinephrine is highly time-dependent. An intraosseous route of drug administration may enable more rapid drug administration than an intravenous route; however, its effect on clinical outcomes is uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial across 11 emergency medical systems in the United Kingdom that involved adults in cardiac arrest for whom vascular access for drug administration was needed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment from paramedics by means of an intraosseous-first or intravenous-first vascular access strategy. The primary outcome was survival at 30 days. Key secondary outcomes included any return of spontaneous circulation and favorable neurologic function at hospital discharge (defined by a score of 3 or less on the modified Rankin scale, on which scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability). No adjustment for multiplicity was made.

Results

A total of 6082 patients were assigned to a trial group: 3040 to the intraosseous group and 3042 to the intravenous group. At 30 days, 137 of 3030 patients (4.5%) in the intraosseous group and 155 of 3034 (5.1%) in the intravenous group were alive (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 1.32; P = 0.74). At the time of hospital discharge, a favorable neurologic outcome was observed in 80 of 2994 patients (2.7%) in the intraosseous group and in 85 of 2986 (2.8%) in the intravenous group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.47); a return of spontaneous circulation at any time occurred in 1092 of 3031 patients (36.0%) and in 1186 of 3035 patients (39.1%), respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.97). During the trial, one adverse event, which occurred in the intraosseous group, was reported.

Conclusions

Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring drug therapy, the use of an intraosseous-first vascular access strategy did not result in higher 30-day survival than an intravenous-first strategy.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5d52e8d5]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

These four RCTs included 9475 patients with OHCA (Fig. 1, Supplemental Table 2). Overall, 4627 (48.9%) patients were randomized to receive IO access and 4,848 (51.1%) to receive IV access. All studies included patients with non-traumatic cardiac arrest, except for one trial, which also included 86 (0.9% of the whole population) patients with traumatic OHCA. The follow-up durations varied across the studies: one study followed the patients for 30 days, another extended the follow-up period to 90 days, and one followed patients up to hospital discharge. One study did not follow up the patients for clinical outcomes.

The mean age of patients across four trials was 67.5 ± 15.3 years, with 33.2% (3,118/9,396) being female. The data for some baseline patient characteristics were not available for the trial by Reades et al. and a small portion of patients from the PARAMEDIC-3 trial. We excluded the missing or unavailable data and calculated the rates accordingly. The most common location of cardiac arrest was home (7,249/9,264; 78.2%) and public area (1,779/9,264; 19.2%), respectively. Cardiac arrest was witnessed in 57.8% (5,328/9,209), and CPR was performed in 71.6% (6,645/9,280) of patients. The initial cardiac rhythm was non-shockable in 77.6% (7,133/9,181) of patients.

Methodological quality of the included RCTs

The included RCTs were open-label, and only the IVIO trial featured blinded event adjudication for its prespecified outcomes. However, as our primary outcome was survival, we did not consider that lack of blinding significantly affected the reported outcomes. Overall, all trials were considered to have a low risk of bias. Nonetheless, for other clinical and procedural outcomes, it should be noted that the trials other than the IVIO trial did not perform blinded event adjudication and are at unclear risk of bias for these outcomes (Supplemental Fig. 2 and Table 3A, B).

To compare the effectiveness of the intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO) routes for drug administration in adults with a cardiac arrest enrolled in the Pre-Hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest (PARAMEDIC2) randomised, controlled trial.

Methods

Patients were recruited from five National Health Service Ambulance Services in England and Wales from December 2014 through October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg adrenaline or matching placebo. Intravascular access was established as soon as possible, and IO access was considered if IV access was not possible after two attempts.

Results

Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 3631 received adrenaline and 3686 received placebo. Amongst these, 1116 (30.1%) and 1121 (30.4%) received the study drug via the IO route. The odds ratios were similar in the IV and IO groups for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at hospital handover [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.07 (95% CI 3.42–4.85) and (aOR 3.98 (95% CI 2.86–5.53), P value for interaction 0.90]; survival to 30 days [aOR 1.67 (1.18–2.35) versus 0.9 (0.4–2.05), P = 0.18]; and favourable neurological outcome [aOR 1.39 (0.93–2.06) versus 0.62 (0.23–1.67), P = 0.14].

Conclusion

There was no significant difference in treatment effect (adrenaline versus placebo) on ROSC at hospital handover between drugs administered by the intraosseous route or by the intravenous route. We could not detect any difference in the treatment effect between the IV and IO routes on the longer term outcomes of 30-day survival or favourable neurological outcome at discharge (ISRCTN73485024).

Adult cardiac arrest — calcium administration: The "2023 AHA focused update, ILCOR's 2023 CoSTR summary, and a systematic review including 3 RCTs, found routine calcium administration during cardiac arrest, including cases of refractory asystole and pulseless electrical activity, did not improve survival to hospital discharge or neurological outcome, with a cautionary trend toward potential harm". A registry report "found no evidence of benefit from calcium administration, independent of rhythm presentation, during IHCA", and randomized trial data "found no evidence of benefit when calcium was administered immediately after the first dose of epinephrine". Use "in special circumstances such as hyperkalemia and toxic ingestion is discussed elsewhere".

### A randomized trial of drug route in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^408974f3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this trial, the use of an intraosseous strategy for vascular access and drug administration in cardiac arrest, compared with an intravenous strategy, did not result in a significantly higher rate of 30-day survival. We observed no apparent difference between groups for favorable neurological outcome at hospital discharge. In the intraosseous strategy group, the rate of return of spontaneous circulation appeared to be lower.

Our trial hypothesis for the superiority of the intraosseous strategy route was that it would facilitate more rapid administration of epinephrine, which would improve 30-day survival through reducing time to return of spontaneous circulation thereby minimizing the hypoxic-ischemic damage that is the main cause of death following cardiac arrest. This was based on previous studies showing reduced time to drug administration in patients where initial vascular access attempts are made via the intraosseous route, particularly when the proximal tibial route is chosen. In contrast to these previous studies, we found that an intraosseous-first strategy did not reduce time to drug administration.

Despite similarities in time to drug administration, the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in the intraosseous group appeared to be lower, suggesting drug efficacy was influenced by administration route. There are several potential explanations for this. First, intraosseous cannulae might be incorrectly positioned, leading to sub-optimal drug absorption. Whilst we were unable to assess this in our trial, previous studies suggest that intraosseous cannulae are prone to both sub-optimal placement and dislodgement. Second, time to peak drug concentration and the maximal drug concentration may be inferior to the intravenous route, even when the intraosseous cannula is optimally placed. Animal studies suggest proximal humerus intraosseous placement may be better and the proximal tibial placement worse, compared with the peripheral intravenous route, in time to achieve maximal drug concentration. However, this potential advantage of the proximal humerus, compared with the proximal tibial site, may be off-set by lower success rates, higher dislodgement rates, and longer time to successful placement. Third, it has been postulated that delivery to the central circulation of lipophilic drugs, such as amiodarone, may be worse when administered by the intraosseous route.

### Clinical evaluation of intravenous alone versus intravenous or intraosseous access for treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^c66cd07c]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Obtaining vascular access during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is challenging. The aim of this study was to determine if using intraosseous (IO) access when intravenous (IV) access fails improves outcomes.

Methods

This was a prospective, parallel-group, cluster-randomised study that compared 'IV only' against 'IV + IO' in OHCA patients, where if 2 IV attempts failed or took more than 90 s, paramedics had 2 further attempts of IO. Primary outcome was any return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes were insertion success rate, adrenaline administration, time to adrenaline and survival outcome.

Results

A total of 1007 patients were included in the analysis. An Intention To Treat analysis showed a significant difference in success rates of obtaining vascular access in the IV + IO arm compared to the IV arm (76.6% vs 61.1% p = 0.001). There were significantly more patients in the IV + IO arm than the IV arm being administered prehospital adrenaline (71.3% vs 55.4% p = 0.001). The IV + IO arm also received adrenaline faster compared to the IV arm in terms of median time from emergency call to adrenaline (23 min vs 25 min p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in ROSC (adjusted OR 0.99 95%CI: 0.75–1.29), survival to discharge or survival with CPC 2 or better in both groups. A Per Protocol analysis also showed there was higher success in obtaining vascular access in the IV + IO arm, but ROSC and survival outcomes were not statistically different.

Conclusion

Using IO when IV failed led to a higher rate of vascular access, prehospital adrenaline administration and faster adrenaline administration. However, it was not associated with higher ROSC, survival to discharge, or good neurological outcome.

### Intraosseous and intravenous epinephrine administration routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: survival and neurologic outcomes [^318e1f1c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings revealed no significant difference between the intravenous or intraosseous route for epinephrine administration in terms of primary outcomes in patients with OHCA. However, lower extremity access led to worse outcomes than did upper extremity access. HIO may serve as a viable alternative. Furthermore, a delay of > 15 minutes in time to treatment significantly reduced the odds of survival to discharge and favorable neurologic outcomes.

### Comparison study of intraosseous, central intravenous, and peripheral intravenous infusions of emergency drugs… [^8d154826]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Intraosseous infusion of emergency drugs is a lifesaving alternative to intravenous administration when intravenous access cannot be rapidly established. We studied the comparative pharmacokinetics of the following six emergency drugs and solutions: epinephrine hydrochloride, 0. 01 mg/kg; sodium bicarbonate, 1 mEq/kg; calcium chloride, 10 mg/kg; hydroxyethyl starch, 10 mL/kg; 50% dextrose in water, 250 mg/kg; and lidocaine hydrochloride, 1 mg/kg. Studies were conducted in normotensive, anesthetized dogs, with three animals studied with each of the drugs or solutions and each animal being treated with all three routes of administration in randomized sequence. The effects of epinephrine were also assessed in a shock model.

The intraosseous route of administration was comparable with the central and peripheral intravenous routes for all of the emergency drugs and solutions studied, with equivalent magnitudes of peak effect or drug level and equal or longer durations of action. Time to placement of the intraosseous needle varied from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, with a mean of 60 seconds. Time to placement of the needle varies with the skill and experience of the individual. With experience, all individuals could place the intraosseous needle in 60 seconds or less. The intraosseous route is comparable in effect to the central and peripheral intravenous routes of drug administration for epinephrine, sodium bicarbonate, hydroxyethyl starch, calcium chloride, 50% dextrose in water, and lidocaine and is a clinically feasible alternative when intravenous access will be critically delayed.

### Survival after intravenous versus intraosseous amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo in out-of-hospital shock-refractory cardiac arrest [^33b48e10]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiarrhythmic drugs have not proven to significantly improve overall survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia. How this might be influenced by the route of drug administration is not known.

Methods

In this prespecified analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we compared the differences in survival to hospital discharge in adults with shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were randomly assigned by emergency medical services personnel to an antiarrhythmic drug versus placebo in the ALPS trial (Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Amiodarone, Lidocaine or Placebo Study), when stratified by the intravenous versus intraosseous route of administration.

Results

Of 3019 randomly assigned patients with a known vascular access site, 2358 received ALPS drugs intravenously and 661 patients by the intraosseous route. Intraosseous and intravenous groups differed in sex, time-to-emergency medical services arrival, and some cardiopulmonary resuscitation characteristics, but were similar in others, including time-to-intravenous/intrasosseous drug receipt. Overall hospital discharge survival was 23%. In comparison with placebo, discharge survival was significantly higher in recipients of intravenous amiodarone (adjusted risk ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.06–1.50]; adjusted absolute survival difference, 5.5% [95% CI, 1.5–9.5]) and intravenous lidocaine (adjusted risk ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.02–1.45]; adjusted absolute survival difference, 4.7% [95% CI, 0.7–8.8]); but not in recipients of intraosseous amiodarone (adjusted risk ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.66–1.32]) or intraosseous lidocaine (adjusted risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.74–1.44]). Survival to hospital admission also increased significantly when drugs were given intravenously but not intraosseously, and favored improved neurological outcome at discharge. There were no outcome differences between intravenous and intraosseous placebo, indicating that the access route itself did not demarcate patients with poor prognosis. The study was underpowered to assess intravenous/intraosseous drug interactions, which were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

We found no significant effect modification by drug administration route for amiodarone or lidocaine in comparison with placebo during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, point estimates for the effects of both drugs in comparison with placebo were significantly greater for the intravenous than for the intraosseous route across virtually all outcomes and beneficial only for the intravenous route. Given that the study was underpowered to statistically assess interactions, these findings signal the potential importance of the drug administration route during resuscitation that merits further investigation.

### Efficacy of emergency department calcium administration in cardiac arrest: a 9-year retrospective evaluation [^6c456ac9]. Resuscitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of empiric calcium for patients with undifferentiated cardiac arrest has come under increased scrutiny, including a randomized controlled trial that was stopped early due to a trend towards harm with calcium administration. However, small sample sizes and non-significant findings have hindered precise effect estimates. In this analysis we evaluate the association of calcium administration with survival in a large retrospective cohort of patients with cardiac arrest treated in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of medical records from two academic hospitals (one quaternary care center, one county trauma center) in San Francisco between 2011 and 2019. Inclusion criteria were patients aged greater than or equal to 18 years old who received treatment for cardiac arrest during their ED course. Our primary exposure was the administration of calcium while in the ED and the main outcome was survival to hospital admission. The association between calcium and survival to admission was estimated using a multivariable log-binomial regression, and also with two propensity score models.

Results

We examined 781 patients with cardiac arrest treated in San Francisco EDs between 2011 and 2019 and found that calcium administration was associated with decreased survival to hospital admission (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.66–0.82). These findings remained significant after adjustment for patient age, sex, whether the cardiac arrest was witnessed, and including an interaction term for shockable cardiac rhythms (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.50–0.72) and non-shockable cardiac rhythms (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76–0.99). Risk ratios for the association between calcium and survival to hospital admission were also similar between two propensity score-based models: nearest neighbor propensity matching model (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68–0.89) and inverse propensity weighted regression adjustment model (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.67–0.84).

Conclusions

Calcium administration as part of ED-directed treatment for cardiac arrest was associated with lower survival to hospital admission. Given the lack of statistically significant outcomes from smaller, more methodologically robust evaluations on this topic, we believe these findings have an important role to serve in confirming previous results and allowing for more precise effect estimates. Our data adds to the growing body evidence against the empiric use of calcium in cardiac arrest.

### The latest in resuscitation science research: highlights from the 2018 American Heart Association's resuscitation science symposium [^fde23a35]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

A popular topic in this year's agenda was the comparison of intraosseous versus intravenous access for the delivery of advanced life support drugs. Dr Purav Mody from the University of Texas Southwestern (Dallas, TX) brought us further discussion of this topic with a presentation of data from the ROC Continuous Chest Compression Trial. 10 Among 19 731 patients with available access information, intraosseous or intravenous access was attempted in 15.5% and 84.5% of patients, respectively, and was successful in 97% and 92% of these patients. Patients with attempted intraosseous access were actually very different: they were younger, were more likely female, received less bystander CPR, had lower proportions of shockable and witnessed arrests, had marginally faster times to access and to epinephrine administration, and less frequently received therapeutic hypothermia and coronary angiography compared with patients with intravenous access. Table 2 provides a summary of oral presentations on clinical research.

Summary of Oral Presentations on Clinical Research

Late‐Breaking Abstracts in Resuscitation Science

Dr Gavin Perkins of the University of Warwick (Coventry, UK) shared the findings of the PARAMEDIC2 (Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest) 11 trial during the first late‐breaking session. The trial demonstrated higher 30‐day survival for the epinephrine group (3.2% epinephrine versus 2.4% for placebo) but not in survival with favorable neurologic outcome on discharge (2.2% in the epinephrine group and 1.9% in the placebo group). Dr Peter J. Kudenchuk of the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) presented a secondary analysis from the ROC. Their goal was to determine whether intraosseous or intravenous administration of medication was associated with outcome. Although the intraosseous group received a higher percentage of CPR during their resuscitation, the survival benefit of administering amiodarone or lidocaine was not found in the intraosseous group. Administering amiodarone or lidocaine did improve survival in the intravenous group. Dr Jasmeet Soar, chair of the advanced life support subcommittee of Southmead Hospital (Bristol, UK), then revealed the new ILCOR recommendations on antiarrhythmic drug use during CPR and after ROSC. 12 Given the results of the above trial, either lidocaine or amiodarone can be used in ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia cardiac arrest. These 2 presentations illustrated how ILCOR rapidly incorporated new data into its guidelines.

### A randomized trial of drug route in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^f8733503]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our results build on the recently published Taiwanese VICTOR trial, a cluster randomized trial where 1771 adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were randomized to either proximal humeral intraosseous access or upper-limb intravenous access. Consistent with our trial, the VICTOR trial reported that the intraosseous route did not improve the rate of survival to hospital discharge or reduce time to drug administration.

In our trial, overall median time from emergency call to drug administration was 24 minutes and 30-day survival was 4.8%. Our time to drug administration is comparable to the VICTOR trial and only slightly longer than other randomized trials of cardiac arrest drug interventions, where times have ranged from 16 to 21 minutes. The overall rate of 30-day survival in the UK is similar to other regions, including areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. Our target population was patients requiring drug therapy, such that patients in whom initial resuscitation attempts were successful and who have the best outcomes were ineligible for the trial.

Adult Advanced Life Support — vascular access during cardiac arrest: An ILCOR systematic review found that the use of intraosseous (IO) access compared with intravenous (IV) access did not result in a statistically significant improvement in outcomes and noted lower odds of achieving sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for IO versus IV (odds ratio [OR] 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80–0.99). When IV access is limited or infeasible, the available evidence supports IO access as an alternative, though the optimal anatomical location for IO access (ie, tibial or humeral) remains a knowledge gap. Drug administration through central venous access can achieve faster circulation times and higher plasma concentrations than peripheral IV, but outcome data are limited; a small, single-center study reported higher ROSC with femoral or internal jugular access compared to peripheral IV, with a high risk of bias, and if central venous access is attempted by appropriately trained professionals, special attention is required to avoid delays in chest compressions or defibrillation.

Hyperkalemic cardiac arrest — intravenous calcium: In a randomized controlled porcine model of hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, calcium administration did not increase return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.4–4.0; P = 0.76) or reduce time to ROSC (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.8–2.9; P = 0.23) when compared with placebo. There are no high-quality human observational studies or clinical trials evaluating IV calcium to treat patients with hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, and no significant benefit of IV calcium was observed in a subanalysis of adult out-of-hospital PEA arrests in which hyperkalemia was suspected as defined by electrocardiogram abnormalities rather than prerest postarrest concentrations. In pediatric hospitals, 8 children receiving calcium during in-hospital hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrest showed no significant differences or trends in survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurological outcome.

Primary effectiveness outcome

There was no significant difference in terms of survival (up to 30 days or until discharge) between IO and IV access in patients with OHCA (6.6% vs. 6.9%; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84–1.18, P = 0.94, I² = 8%) (Fig. 2).

Other effectiveness outcomes

The sustained ROSC rate was numerically lower in the IO group compared with the IV group (24.6% vs. 27.0%). However, this difference did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80–1.06, P = 0.25, I² = 44%). No significant difference was found between IO and IV insertion for favorable neurological outcome (4.7% vs. 4.6%, OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.88–1.30, P = 0.49, I² = 0%) (Fig. 2).

Procedural outcomes

In terms of vascular access-related outcomes, we observed that the successful first-attempt vascular access rate was significantly higher in the IO group compared with the IV group (92.3% vs. 62.3%, OR 6.18, 95% CI 3.50–10.91, P < 0.001, I² = 94%) (Fig. 3).

### Intravenous vs. intraosseous access and return of spontaneous circulation during out of hospital cardiac arrest [^58fce41a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Guidelines endorse intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO) medication administration for cardiac arrest treatment. Limited clinical evidence supports this recommendation. A multiagency, retrospective study was performed to determine the association between parenteral access type and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

This was a structured, retrospective chart review of emergency medical services (EMS) records from three agencies. Data was analyzed from adults who suffered OHCA and received epinephrine through EMS established IV or IO access during the 18-month study period. Per regional EMS protocols, choice of parenteral access type was at the provider's discretion. Non-inferiority analysis was performed comparing the association between first access type attempted and ROSC at time of emergency department arrival.

Results

1310 subjects met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Providers first attempted parenteral access via IV route in 788 (60.15%) subjects. Providers first attempted parenteral access via IO route in 552 (39.85%) subjects. Rates of ROSC at time of ED arrival were 19.67% when IV access was attempted first and 19.92% when IO access was attempted first. An IO first approach was non-inferior to an IV first approach based on the primary end point ROSC at time of emergency department arrival (p = 0.01).

Conclusion

An IO first approach was non-inferior to an IV first approach based on the end point ROSC at time of emergency department arrival.

### Cardioplegia defibrillation of circulatory and metabolic phase ventricular fibrillation in a swine model [^f4f866f4]. Resuscitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We previously found potassium cardioplegia followed by rapid calcium reversal (Kplegia) can achieve defibrillation in a swine model of electrical phase of ventricular fibrillation (VF) comparable to standard care.

Hypothesis

Exploring 3 possible potassium dose and timing protocols, we hypothesize Kplegia may benefit resuscitation of longer duration untreated VF.

Methods

Three separate blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials were performed with electrically-induced VF untreated for durations of 6, 9, and 12min in a swine model. Experimental groups received infusion of 1 or 2 boluses of intravenous (IV) potassium followed by a single calcium reversal bolus. Potassium was replaced by saline in the control groups. Outcomes included: amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) during VF, resulting rhythms, number of defibrillations, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and hemodynamics for 1h post ROSC. Binomial and interval data outcomes were compared with exact statistics. Serial interval data were assessed with mixed regression models.

Results

Twelve, 12, and 8 animals were included at 6, 9, and 12min VF durations for a total of 32. ROSC was achieved in: 4/6 Kplegia and 3/6 control animals in the 6min protocol, (p = 1.00), 4/6 Kplegia and 2/6 control animals in the 9min protocol,(p = 0.57), and 0/5 Kplegia and 1/3 control animals in the 12min protocol,(p = 0.38). Two of 8 Kplegia animals achieved ROSC with chemical defibrillation alone.

Conclusions

The majority of animals achieved ROSC after up to 9min of untreated VF arrest using K plegia protocols. K plegia requires further optimization for both peripheral IV and intraosseous infusion, and to assess for superiority over standard care.

### Intraosseous access in the resuscitation of patients with trauma: the good, the bad, the future [^f802bbcb]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the limited literature in patients with trauma, in 2021, a prospective, parallel-group, cluster-randomized study compared the outcomes of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) who were resuscitated with 'intravenous only' against 'intravenous+IO'. Interestingly, they found that using IO when intravenous failed led to a higher rate of vascular access and faster epinephrine administration. However, it was not associated with higher return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to discharge or good neurological outcome. Another study by Mody et al, evaluating 19 731 patients with OHCA, of which 3068 patients received IO access, demonstrated that IO access attempt was associated with worse ROSC and survival rates: (4.6% vs 5.7%, p = 0.01) for survival to discharge, (17.9% vs 23.5%, p < 0.001) for sustained ROSC and (2.8% vs 4.2%, p < 0.001) for survival with favorable neurological function. Based on these studies and multiple other medium to high-level studies, despite higher rates of successful access through IO route, no differences in survival and clinical outcomes are expected, when using IO in resuscitation of adult and pediatric patients with OHCA. In fact, a prespecified analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Daya et al showed that point estimates for the effects of drugs in comparison with placebo were significantly greater for the intravenous than for the IO route across virtually all outcomes and beneficial only for the intravenous route. However, the study was underpowered to statistically assess interactions. Although resuscitation of patients with OHCA is out of the scope of this study, the above-mentioned study and multiple other studies are brought as a signal to interpret these findings carefully, as while IO access may offer faster access or a higher success rate, it may lead to lower survival rates and poorer neurologic outcomes of patients with non-trauma.

### Intraosseous vs intravenous access for epinephrine in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^9b28cb82]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a substantial public health issue among children, annually affecting 7000 to 23 000 individuals in the US. Only 13.2% of children with OHCA treated by emergency medical services (EMS) survive to hospital discharge, and further efforts are needed to improve their outcomes.

Epinephrine, the cornerstone of cardiac arrest pharmacotherapeutic agents, is commonly used for children with OHCA in prehospital settings, with 65.3% to 74.1% of EMS-treated pediatric OHCAs receiving intraosseous (IO) or intravenous (IV) epinephrine. The 2020 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care state that "for pediatric patients in any setting, it is reasonable to administer epinephrine". While IO access use has increased and may expedite epinephrine administration due to a higher success rate than IV access, the optimal route of epinephrine administration is unknown.

In 2020, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) published a systematic review and meta-analysis on IO vs IV drug administration for patients of any age during cardiac arrest but identified no pediatric studies. The pooled estimates of the included adult studies in the meta-analysis favored IV access, with very low certainty of evidence. In 2024, 3 clinical trials compared an IO-first vs an IV-first strategy for adult OHCAs, and none found a significant difference in survival between the IO- and IV-first strategies. However, children were not included in these trials. Therefore, in the pediatric population, further research on the optimal route of epinephrine administration is warranted. Our objective was to evaluate the association between the route of epinephrine administration (ie, IO or IV) and patient outcomes after pediatric OHCA.

### Efficacy of intraosseous access for trauma resuscitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e15405a0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

During medical emergencies, intraosseous (IO) access and intravenous (IV) access are methods of administering therapies and medications to patients. Treating patients in emergency medical situations is a highly time sensitive practice; however, research into the optimal access method is limited and existing systematic reviews have only considered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. We focused on severe trauma patients and conducted a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of intraosseous (IO) access compared to intravenous (IV) access for trauma resuscitation in prehospital care.

Materials and Method

PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, banque de données en santé publique and CNKI databases were searched for articles published between January 1, 2000, and January 31, 2023. Adult trauma patients were included, regardless of race, nationality, and region. OHCA patients and other types of patients were excluded. The experimental and control groups received IO and IV access, respectively, in the pre-hospital and emergency departments for salvage. The primary outcome was success rate on first attempt, which was defined as secure needle position in the marrow cavity or a peripheral vein, with normal fluid flow. Secondary outcomes included mean time to resuscitation, mean procedure time, and complications.

Results

Three reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies; meta-analyses were then performed using Review Manager (Version 5.4; Cochrane, Oxford, UK). The success rate on first attempt was significant higher for IO access than for IV access (RR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.16, 1.85], P = 0.001). The mean procedure time was significantly reduced (MD = -5.67, 95% CI [-9.26, -2.07], P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in mean time to resuscitation (MD = -1.00, 95% CI [-3.18, 1.17], P = 0.37) and complications (RR = 1.22, 95% CI [0.14, 10.62], P = 0.86) between the IO and IV groups.

Conclusion

The success rate on first attempt of IO access was much higher than that of IV access for trauma patients, and the mean procedure time of IO access was significantly less when compared to IV access. Therefore, IO access should be suggested as an urgent vascular access for hypotensive trauma patients, especially those who are under severe shock.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a randomized controlled trial [^7d7afc65]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Intraosseous needle insertion during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is rapidly replacing peripheral intravenous routes in the out-of-hospital setting. However, there are few data directly comparing the effectiveness of intraosseous needle insertions with peripheral intravenous insertions during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in the frequency of first-attempt success between humeral intraosseous, tibial intraosseous, and peripheral intravenous insertions during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

This was a randomized trial of adult patients experiencing a nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in which resuscitation efforts were initiated. Patients were randomized to one of 3 routes of vascular access: tibial intraosseous, humeral intraosseous, or peripheral intravenous. Paramedics received intensive training and exposure to all 3 methods before study initiation. The primary outcome was first-attempt success, defined as secure needle position in the marrow cavity or a peripheral vein, with normal fluid flow. Needle dislodgement during resuscitation was coded as a failure to maintain vascular access.

Results

There were 182 patients enrolled, with 64 (35%) assigned to tibial intraosseous, 51 (28%) humeral intraosseous, and 67 (37%) peripheral intravenous access. Demographic characteristics were similar among patients in the 3 study arms. There were 130 (71%) patients who experienced initial vascular access success, with 17 (9%) needles becoming dislodged, for an overall frequency of first-attempt success of 113 (62%). Individuals randomized to tibial intraosseous access were more likely to experience a successful first attempt at vascular access (91%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 83% to 98%) compared with either humeral intraosseous access (51%; 95% CI 37% to 65%) or peripheral intravenous access (43%; 95% CI 31% to 55%) groups. Time to initial success was significantly shorter for individuals assigned to the tibial intraosseous access group (4.6 minutes; interquartile range 3.6 to 6.2 minutes) compared with those assigned to the humeral intraosseous access group (7.0 minutes; interquartile range 3.9 to 10.0 minutes), and neither time was significantly different from that of the peripheral intravenous access group (5.8 minutes; interquartile range 4.1 to 8.0 minutes).

Conclusion

Tibial intraosseous access was found to have the highest first-attempt success for vascular access and the most rapid time to vascular access during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared with peripheral intravenous and humeral intraosseous access.

### Intraosseous vs intravenous access for epinephrine in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^09c27c83]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In 2024, 3 prehospital clinical trials comparing an IO-first vs an IV-first strategy for adult patients with OHCA were published, and all reported that there was no significant difference in survival between the IO-first and the IV-first strategies. A cluster randomized clinical trial in Taiwan, the Intraosseous vs Intravenous Vascular Access in Upper Extremity Among Adults With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest trial, including 1732 adult patients with OHCA, found no differences in survival to hospital discharge (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.76–1.42), favorable functional status at hospital discharge (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.82–1.66), or prehospital ROSC (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.75–1.13) between IO and IV groups. A multicenter randomized trial in the United Kingdom (UK), the Prehospital Randomised Trial of Medication Route in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (PARAMEDIC 3), included 3040 adults in the IO-first and 3042 in the IV-first groups and found no significant difference in survival at 30 days (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.68–1.32) and favorable functional status at hospital discharge (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.57–1.47), while the odds of ROSC at any time was lower in the IO-first group (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.97). Another trial comparing the effects of initial attempts at IO vs IV vascular access among 1479 adult patients in Denmark, the Intravenous vs Intraosseous Vascular Access during Out-of-Hospital Cardiac arrest (IVIO) trial, found no differences in survival at 30 days (risk ratio [RR], 1.16; 95% CI, 0.87–1.56), favorable functional status at hospital discharge (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.83–1.62), or sustained ROSC (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90–1.24). These trials' results suggest that vascular access may not affect survival or functional status among adult patients with OHCA.

### Intravenous or intraosseous calcium vs saline on return of spontaneous circulation in adults… [^4d83e19c]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Does administration of calcium during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation. Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 391 adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 19% had sustained return of spontaneous circulation after receiving treatment with intravenous or intraosseous calcium compared with 27% after receiving saline. This difference was not statistically significant, but the trial was terminated early due to concerns about harm in the calcium group. Meaning Treatment with intravenous or intraosseous calcium did not significantly improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Importance It is unclear whether administration of calcium has a beneficial effect in patients with cardiac arrest. Objective To determine whether administration of calcium during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest improves return of spontaneous circulation in adults.

The median time from the cardiac arrest to administration of the trial drug was 18 minutes. The trial drug was most commonly administered through intraosseous access and 73% of patients received both doses of the trial drug. The only protocol deviations recorded were in 9 patients in the calcium group and 9 patients in the saline group. In this randomized clinical trial, the administration of calcium, compared with saline, did not result in a statistically significant difference in sustained return of spontaneous circulation for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in 30-day survival or 30-day survival with a favorable neurological outcome.

Although not reaching statistical significance, patients receiving calcium had worse outcomes, including worse 30-day survival with a favorable neurological outcome. At 90 days, fewer patients in the calcium group had a favorable neurological outcome and quality of life was lower in survivors. Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, treatment with intravenous or intraosseous calcium compared with saline did not significantly improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation. These results do not support the administration of calcium during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults. Corresponding Author: Lars W.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^ed7eb27a]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety outcomes

In the PARAMEDIC-3 trial, a patient in the IO group reported one specific adverse event (ongoing mild leg pain during certain activities). In the IVIO trial, prespecified adverse events for patients with sustained ROSC were uncommon and were limited to extravasation (< 1% for both the IO and IV groups). The other two trials reported no other complications. None of the four RCTs reported serious adverse events in either the IO or IV arms.

Humeral IO/Tibial IO vs. IV

Subgroup analyses based on the IO access site (humeral and tibial) revealed no statistically significant interactions in survival, sustained ROSC, favorable neurological outcome, and successful first-attempt access rate (Fig. 5 A). For the time from EMS arrival to vascular access, contrasting time trends were observed: humeral IO showed a trend toward longer access times than the IV route, while tibial IO showed a trend toward faster access than the IV method, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5 B).

### Effect of calcium vs. placebo on long-term outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^40fbd9a8]. Resuscitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Calcium for Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest (COCA) trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of calcium for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary and secondary outcomes have been reported previously. This article describes the long-term outcomes of the trial.

Methods

Patients aged ≥ 18 years were included if they had a non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during which they received adrenaline. The trial drug consisted of calcium chloride (5 mmol) or saline placebo given after the first dose of adrenaline and again after the second dose of adrenaline for a maximum of two doses. This article presents pre-specified analyses of 6-month and 1-year outcomes for survival, survival with a favorable neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale of 3 or less), and health-related quality of life.

Results

A total of 391 patients were analyzed. At 1 year, 9 patients (4.7%) were alive in the calcium group while 18 (9.1%) were alive in the placebo group (risk ratio 0.51; 95% confidence interval 0.24, 1.09). At 1 year, 7 patients (3.6%) were alive with a favorable neurological outcome in the calcium group while 17 (8.6%) were alive with a favorable neurological outcome in the placebo group (risk ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval 0.18, 0.97). Outcomes for health-related quality of life likewise suggested harm of calcium but results were imprecise with wide confidence intervals.

Conclusions

Effect estimates remained constant over time suggesting harm of calcium but with wide confidence intervals. The results do not support calcium administration during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Trial Registration

### Impact of intraosseous versus intravenous resuscitation during in-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective study [^0c880586]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare outcomes between Intraosseous (IO) and peripheral intravenous (PIV) injection during in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and examine its utility in individuals with obesity.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adult, atraumatic IHCA at a single tertiary care center. Subjects were classified as either IO or PIV resuscitation. The primary outcome of interest was survival to hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes of interest were survival with favourable neurologic status, rates-of-ROSC (ROR) and time-to-ROSC (TTR). Subgroup analysis among patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 was performed.

Results

Complete data were available for 1852 subjects, 1039 of whom met eligibility criteria. A total of 832 were resuscitated via PIV route and 207 via IO route. Use of IO compared to PIV was associated with lower overall survival to hospital discharge (20.8% vs 28.4% p = 0.03), lower rates of survival with favourable neurologic status (18.4% vs 25.2% p = 0.04), lower ROR (72.2% vs 80.7%) and longer TTR (12:38 min vs 9:01 min). After multivariate adjustment there was no significant differences between IO and PIV in rates of survival to discharge (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47–1.06, p = 0.09) or rates of survival with favourable neurologic status (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49–1.13, p = 0.16). The ROR and TTR remained significantly worse in the IO group. Subgroup analysis of patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 identified no benefit or harm with use of IO compared to PIV.

Conclusion

Intraosseous medication delivery is associated with inferior rates-of-ROSC and longer times-to-ROSC compared to PIV, but no differences in overall survival to hospital discharge or survival with favourable neurologic status during IHCA.

Using the evidence brought together through the 2005 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation evidence evaluation process and the subsequent 2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care, the role for specific drug therapy in pediatric cardiac arrest is outlined. The drugs discussed include epinephrine, vasopressin, calcium, sodium bicarbonate, atropine, magnesium, and glucose. The literature addressing how best to deliver these drugs to the critically ill child is also presented, specifically looking at the use of intraosseous and endotracheal drug therapy.

### Intraosseous and intravenous epinephrine administration routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: survival and neurologic outcomes [^a2298ef5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, the intravenous group showed better outcomes in good CPC and slightly higher likelihoods of survival to discharge and survival for > 2 hours compared with the intraosseous group, but these differences were not statistically significant. Furthermore, outcomes for establishing access in the lower extremities were significantly poorer, with such access being associated with 68% and 73% reductions in the rates of survival to discharge and favorable neurologic outcomes, respectively. In addition, a time to epinephrine treatment of > 15 minutes resulted in reduced survival rate and poorer neurologic outcomes in patients with OHCA.

During resuscitation with mechanical CPR and intubation, the treatment area in the upper body is more limited. Therefore, lower extremities are easier to implement intervention and may be reason why rate of intraosseous administration in the lower extremity is high. A local Taiwan study indicated that using the intraosseous route offers benefits such as convenience and rapid drug delivery. However, we found a minimal time difference in drug administration between the intravenous and intraosseous groups, suggesting that the rapid access gained through the intraosseous route does not significantly improve prognosis in patients with OHCA.

### Intraosseous and intravenous epinephrine administration routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: survival and neurologic outcomes [^7d660d53]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Main Results

As presented in Figure 2, the likelihood of positive outcomes in all categories was higher in the intravenous group than in the intraosseous group: survival for > 2 hours (254 [30.1%] versus 314 [23.7%]), survival to discharge (128 [15.5%] versus 144 [10.9%]), and favorable neurologic outcomes (92 [10.9%] versus 77 [5.8%]). After PSM, the between‐group differences were reduced. In multivariable logistic regression analysis (Table 2), the aORs for intravenous versus intraosseous outcomes showed increased probabilities for survival to discharge (aOR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.72–1.35]), favorable neurologic outcome (aOR, 1.39 [95% CI, 0.94–2.05]), and survival > 2 hours (aOR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.90–1.49]), but these increases were not statistically significant. The aOR for access site in the lower extremities versus the upper extremities for outcomes, including survival to discharge (aOR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20–0.50]), favorable neurologic outcome (aOR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.14–0.51]), and survival > 2 hours (aOR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.48–0.87]), were all statistically significant. The rate of survival to discharge decreased by ≈12% with every minute of delay in epinephrine administration (Table 2). We conducted a subgroup analysis on survival outcomes for upper and lower extremities, with results provided in Table S1. The probability of survival to discharge was visualized using the cubic spline approach. In Figure 3, for intraosseous and intravenous injections in the upper limb, survival decreased by 12.6% if treatment exceeded 15 and 16.8 minutes, respectively. Survival rates were consistently below average for lower limb injections. For intravenous injections in the upper limb, if the treatment time exceeded 16.3 minutes, favorable neurologic outcomes decreased by 7.8%. For the intraosseous group, this threshold was 15.7 minutes.

### Intraosseous access in resuscitation [^7e537607]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Intraosseous (IO) access has gained traction as a primary vascular access method during resuscitation. Recent prehospital clinical trials, including the PARAMEDIC-3 trial and VICTOR study, demonstrate no significant difference in 30-day survival between IO and intravenous (IV) access in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. This evidence has prompted a trend toward prioritizing IO access during OHCA, with some practitioners continuing its use post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during in-hospital care. However, only one study has evaluated IO access for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), raising questions about its broad applicability in IHCA scenarios.

While IO access offers higher first-attempt success rates and rapid fluid delivery in hypovolemic shock patients with collapsed peripheral veins, its time advantage is unsubstantiated for non-traumatic arrests. The PARAMEDIC-3 trial revealed identical median access times for IO and IV accesses at 12 min, with comparable medication administration times. Similarly, the VICTOR trial reported equivalent median access establishment times. Within hospital settings, where IV or central venous catheter (CVC) placement is more feasible, the theoretical time advantage of IO access further diminishes.

### Intraosseous or peripheral IV access in pediatric cardiac arrest? Results from the French national cardiac arrest registry [^c78f28c1]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite the evolving recommendations that favor the use of intraosseous access in pediatric resuscitation, the impact of vascular access type on survival in young children has not been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the intravascular injection route on the return on spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission (0 day), and 30 days or survival to hospital discharge, by comparing survival rates in young children having intraosseous and peripheral IV access. The second aim was to compare the rates of favorable neurologic outcome after 30 days or survival to hospital discharge.

Design

This was a multicenter retrospective comparative study between July 2011 and October 2018.

Setting

Based on the French cardiac arrest registry data.

Patients

All prepubescent (males < 12 yr old, females < 10 yr old) victims of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Interventions

Patients with adrenaline administration by intraosseous versus peripheral venous technique were compared, using propensity score matching.

Measurements and Main Results

The analysis included 603 prepubescent patients, 351 (58%) in the intraosseous group and 252 (42%) in the peripheral IV group. Intraosseous group patients were younger, lighter, with more medical cause for arrest. The intraosseous group had lower survival rates at 30 days or hospital discharge (n = 6; 1.7%) than the peripheral IV group (n = 12; 4.8%) (p = 0.030). After matching, 101 pairs of patients were created. No difference was observed on return of spontaneous circulation or 0-day survival rates (odds ratio = 1.000 [95% CI, 0.518–1.930]; odds ratio = 0.946 [95% CI, 0.492–1.817], respectively) and on 30 days or hospital discharge survival (n = 3 in both groups) (odds ratio = 1.000 [95% CI, 0.197–5.076]). Meaningful statistical evaluation of neurologic status among survivors was precluded by inadequate numbers.

Conclusions

The type of injection route (intraosseous or peripheral venous access) does not appear to have an impact on survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a prepubescent population, but limitations of propensity matching limit a definitive conclusion.

### Prehospital tibial intraosseous drug administration is associated with reduced survival following out of hospital cardiac arrest: a study for the CARES surveillance group [^37a88f91]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent reports have questioned the efficacy of intraosseous (IO) drug administration for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitation. Our aim was to determine whether prehospital administration of resuscitative medications via the IO route was associated with lower rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival to hospital discharge than peripheral intravenous (IV) infusion in the setting of OHCA.

Methods

We obtained data on all OHCA patients receiving prehospital IV or IO drug administration from the three most populous counties in Michigan over three years. Data was from the Michigan Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) database. The association between route of drug administration and outcomes was tested using a matched propensity score analysis.

Results

From a total of 10,626 OHCA patients, 6869 received parenteral drugs during their prehospital resuscitation (37.8% by IO) and were included in analysis. Unadjusted outcomes were lower in patients with IO vs. IV access: 18.3% vs. 23.8% for ROSC (p < 0.001), 3.2% vs. 7.6% for survival to hospital discharge (p < 0.001), and 2.0% vs. 5.8% for favorable neurological function (p < 0.001). After adjustment, IO route remained associated with lower odds of sustained ROSC (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63–0.81, p < 0.001), hospital survival (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37–0.62, p < 0.001), and favorable neurological outcomes (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30–0.57, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

In this cohort of OHCA patients, the use of prehospital IO drug administration was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes.

### Intravenous versus intraosseous adrenaline administration in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective cohort study [^c18f48c5]. Resuscitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Adrenaline is an important component in the resuscitation of individuals experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The 2018 Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) algorithm gives the option of either intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) routes for adrenaline administration during cardiac arrest. However, the optimal route during prehospital resuscitation remains controversial. This study aims to investigate whether IV and IO routes lead to different outcomes in OHCA patients who received prehospital adrenaline.

Methods

This retrospective analysis included adult patients with OHCA of presumed cardiac origin who had Emergency Medical Services (EMS) CPR, received adrenaline, and were enrolled in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Cardiac Epistry version 3 database between 2011 and 2015. We divided the study population into IV and IO groups based on the administration route. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between adrenaline delivery routes and prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital discharge, and favorable neurological outcome.

Results

Of the 35,733 patients included, 27,758 (77.7%) had adrenaline administered via IV access and 7975 (22.3%) via IO access. With the IO group as a reference in the logistic regression model, the adjusted odds ratios of the IV group for prehospital ROSC, survival and favorable neurological outcome were 1.367 (95%CI, 1.276–1.464), 1.468 (95%CI, 1.264–1.705) and 1.849 (95%CI, 1.526–2.240), respectively. Similar results were found in the propensity score matched population and subgroup analysis.

Conclusion

Compared with the IO approach, the IV approach appears to be the optimal route for adrenaline administration in advanced life support for OHCA during prehospital resuscitation.

Anaphylaxis — route of epinephrine administration notes that extrapolation of findings from studies in adults and children indicates that for equal-dose regimens (eg, mg/kg), intramuscular (IM) epinephrine is inferior to intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO) routes in bioavailability and time to peak blood concentration; across studies, anaphylaxis dose IM epinephrine had lower and delayed peak epinephrine concentrations as compared to IV epinephrine in cardiac arrest, and there is limited high-quality data directly comparing IV or IO with IM epinephrine, including no data for cardiac arrest secondary to anaphylaxis.

### Use of intra-osseous access in adults: a systematic review [^f6937962]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a lack of evidence-based medicine, administration of lidocaine in the medullary cavity has been proposed in conscious patients before injecting other drugs or fluids. Indeed, if the needle insertion is not painful, some authors describe worthier pain related to fluid administration than from traumatic injuries. Yet, half of the patients receiving 20–40 mg lidocaine complain of pain during subsequent drug or fluid administration.

Confirmation of correct IO device placement

Correct placement of the IO needle is confirmed by the presence of the five following signs (Table 2): sudden loss of resistance on entering the marrow cavity, ability of the needle to remain upright without support, bone marrow or blood easily sampled using a syringe, administration of 2 mL of saline without subcutaneous tissue swelling, and easy administration of fluids without resistance.

Table 2
Five signs to look for correct placement of intra-osseous devices

Utility of IO access

The IO access can be used to draw blood samples. In hemodynamically stable patients, just after the IO needle is placed sodium, magnesium, calcium, lactate, glucose, blood gases (pH and PCO 2), and hemoglobin values are similar between IO and IV accesses. Accuracy for potassium is lower but differences remained within 25%. In patients with cardiac arrest, drawing blood samples is more difficult and may lead to wrong values due to low flow state and stasis in the bone. Above all, when IO access is used to infuse drugs or fluids, IO blood samples cannot be interpreted due to the dilutional effect of infused drugs and fluids. To summarize, blood samples may be obtained only in patients with spontaneous cardiac activity or during initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation before IO drug and fluid infusion.

The IO access allows rapid fluid administration to provide the required volume resuscitation in patients in shock. The IO flow rate may reach up to 150 mL/min in either the tibial or humeral route when the pressure bag is inflated up to 300 mm Hg. However, flow rates 20-fold lower have been reported with the tibial access in patients with cardiac arrest and receiving IV infusion in the homolateral femoral vein. A competitive flow rate and cardiac arrest may explain these observations. Different flow rates reached with IO access according to insertion site are summarized in Table 3.

Advanced life support clinical directives — during cardiac arrest, use of point of care ultrasonography (POCUS) by experienced professionals may be considered to diagnose reversible causes if it can be done without interrupting resuscitative efforts (cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]); polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is always unstable and should be treated immediately with defibrillation because delays in shock delivery worsen outcomes; intravenous (IV) access remains the first-line choice for drug administration during cardiac arrest, with intraosseous (IO) access a reasonable alternative if IV access is not feasible or delayed; and arrhythmias can be both the cause of and a manifestation of clinical instability, with evaluation of the proximal cause guiding the most judicious use of these guidelines.

### Intraosseous and intravenous epinephrine administration routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: survival and neurologic outcomes [^aa9ecfe2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Establishing an intravenous route for administering drugs during the initial stage of resuscitation in patients with OHCA is a challenging task that requires a considerable amount of timeand can therefore delay drug administration. In 2021, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, were authorized to use the intraosseous route for administering drugs in patients with OHCA. In a North Taiwan study, EMTs with 4 hours of relevant training proficiently used the intraosseous route for drug administration, enhancing its use during OHCA and facilitating timely drug administration in prehospital settings.

The 2020 AHA advanced cardiovascular life support guidelines indicate that the intravenous route is associated with better outcomes compared with intraosseous access, demonstrating better survival to discharge and neurologic outcomes in patients with OHCA. The aforementioned studies have demonstrated that compared with intraosseous access, intravenous access has better outcome of survival to discharge and neurologic outcomes. Therefore, the 2020 AHA advanced cardiovascular life support guidelines prioritize intravenous access and recommend intraosseous access only when intravenous access cannot be achieved. The evidence for this recommendation is classified as level 2a, but there is room for improvement, especially considering potential biases. The bias may be attributed to delay in administering epinephrine, difficulties in establishing intravenous access, or other characteristics associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes.

In recent studies, no significant differences between intravenous and intraosseous access on survival and neurologic outcomes were reported. The tibial intraosseous (TIO) was associated with a reduced probability of achieving the return of spontaneous circulation and hospitalization in patients with OHCA. However, compared with humerus intraosseous (HIO), TIO is more reliable and accessible for operators managing critically ill patients. Therefore, TIO is also used as an alternative during resuscitation and first aid.

A consensus has yet to be reached on the optimal sites for establishing intravenous and intraosseous access. Common sites for achieving intraosseous access include the proximal tibia and proximal humeral head, whereas those for achieving intravenous access include the upper or lower extremities. Current evidence on the optimal sites for ensuring favorable outcomes in patients with OHCA is insufficient to enable definitive conclusions to be drawn. Thus, our study has 2 primary aims. The first is to compare survival outcomes of intraosseous and intravenous access. The second aim is to determine whether the outcomes in patients with OHCA differ between access established in the upper or lower extremities.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Utstein in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) registry — process and postresuscitation elements include initial condition categories and key interventions. Initial condition describes whether the patient was pulseless or had a pulse, with options that include pulseless, pulse but poor perfusion, or systolic arterial pressure < 50 mm Hg when pulse assessment is not documented and an arterial line is in place. Process fields capture whether a mechanical chest compression device was used, the number of defibrillatory shocks delivered, administration of epinephrine/adrenaline by intravenous or intraosseous routes with total number of doses, other drugs given (amiodarone, lidocaine, vasopressin, atropine, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, dextrose), airway interventions used during the resuscitation and timing, methods used to confirm correct tracheal or tracheostomy tube placement, and mechanisms or processes used to measure the quality of CPR being delivered. If ECPR was used, the registry captures when it was started, defining ECPR start as initiation of extracorporeal flow after cannulation and circuit connection to cannulas. Postresuscitation core includes targeted temperature management (TTM), defined as an active therapy to achieve and maintain a specific target temperature for a defined duration.

### Intraosseous vs intravenous access for epinephrine in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^ad601905]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this observational study of pediatric OHCA in North America, epinephrine administration via an IO route was not associated with survival to hospital discharge, prehospital ROSC, or time to prehospital ROSC among overall pediatric patients compared with epinephrine administration via an IV route. This may support the practice of administering epinephrine via either IO or IV route.

### Intraosseous vs intravenous access for epinephrine in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^14401120]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

As a clinical implication, our results may support the current AHA Resuscitation Guidelines' recommendation of either IO or IV epinephrine administration for pediatric patients with cardiac arrest. Our results also bring several research implications. First, our neutral results might generate a clinical equipoise that justifies a future clinical trial to compare IO epinephrine vs IV epinephrine for pediatric OHCA. Given the differences in the causes and outcomes of OHCA between adults and children, the recent adult trials' results may not be applicable to children, and a dedicated pediatric trial would identify an optimal drug administration strategy for children.

Although a subanalysis of the IVIO trial in Denmark also compared tibial IO with humeral IO epinephrine administration strategy and found no differences in sustained ROSC or 30-day survival, the subanalysis might have been underpowered. The optimal dose and interval of epinephrine administration by the administration routes and sites for pediatric OHCA are not fully investigated and further work is needed.

There are several potential reasons why we did not observe a difference in the association of the routes of epinephrine administration with patient outcomes. First, the sample size in our analysis was limited. The PARAMEDIC 3 in the UK planned to include 15 000 participants (7500 in the IO-first strategy and 7500 in the IV-first strategy) to detect a 1% difference in 30-day survival (3.2% vs 4.2%) with a 2-sided significance level of 5% and power of 90%. Given the difference in the planned sample sizes of PARAMEDIC 3 and our study, it is likely that our analysis was underpowered.

Second, a prior observational study showed that epinephrine administration via an IO route for OHCA was associated with a shorter time from EMS arrival to the epinephrine administration (5.0; 95% CI, 4.7–5.4 minutes), compared with an IV route (8.8; 95% CI, 6.6–10.9 minutes). On the other hand, in our study, the median intervals from ALS clinician arrival to epinephrine administration were not different between the IO and IV groups in both original (9.0 vs 8.0 minutes) and IPTW (8.4 vs 9.4 minutes) cohorts, with SMDs less than 0.25. It is possible that in the IO group in our study, other resuscitative interventions were prioritized over the IO access, which could have led to the delayed IO access and neutral results.

### Improving vasopressor use in cardiac arrest [^a1f72d7c]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Calcium

Calcium serves as both an inotrope and vasopressor. Until recently, despite a paucity of evidence it has been used relatively frequently in the treatment of patients with cardiac arrest in some systems. The Danish Calcium Out of hospital Cardiac Arrest (COCA) randomised controlled trial examined the addition of calcium (up to two doses of 5 mmol calcium chloride) to standard advanced life support interventions (including adrenaline) amongst 391 adults with out of hospital cardiac arrest. The trial was stopped early after an interim analysis suggested harm in the intervention arm. The final analysis found no difference in the rate of ROSC (19% v 27%, RR 0.72 (95% CI 0.49–1.03)), 30 day survival (5% v 9%, RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.27–1.18)) or favourable neurological outcome (4% v 8%, RR 0.48 (95% CI 0.20–1.12)). The point estimates of the treatment effect for all outcomes were in the direction of harm. These data raise substantial concern about the routine use of calcium as a treatment for cardiac arrest. Whether there remains a role in situations such as cardiac arrest associated with hyperkalaemia requires further research.

### Intraosseous versus intravenous vascular access in upper extremity among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: cluster randomised clinical trial (VICTOR trial) [^e65b3773]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and intervention

The trial used cluster randomisation based on biweekly periods from 6 July 2020 to 30 June 2023. Four participating advanced life support ambulance service teams were assigned to either intravenous or intraosseous interventions biweekly, as illustrated in supplementary figure A. The allocation sequence was generated by a computer using code created by a research statistician, and the study centre instructed the clusters to change to either the intraosseous or intravenous intervention according to the sequence of random allocation. To balance the cases that received successful vascular access, the clusters were randomised in a 1:2 allocation ratio to intervention (intraosseous) versus control (intravenous), as intraosseous attempts were considered twice as likely to be successful in a previous study.

Patients in the intervention group received a mechanical intraosseous puncture (EZ-IO, Teleflex), and the control group received an intravenous puncture. The protocol in the intraosseous group was limited to an attempt at the humeral bone; patients in the control group received intravenous puncture in the upper extremities. Trained paramedics were limited to a maximum of one attempt at intraosseous insertion or two attempts at intravenous procedures. Before the trial, emergency medical technicians in Taiwan were not authorised to perform intraosseous insertion. Given that intraosseous insertion is in its pilot phase, and scenes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and hospitals in Taiwan are not far apart, the protocol required that if the initial access attempt failed, the patient would be promptly transported to the hospital without attempting alternative access methods, mirroring the standard practice before the trial.

After vascular access was established, 1 mg of adrenaline (epinephrine), followed by 10 mL of normal saline, was rapidly pushed through the access. Except for vascular access, all resuscitations performed at the scene, including delivery of shocks and administration of anti-arrhythmic drugs, followed the local standard protocol (supplementary appendix 3).

### Intraosseous and intravenous epinephrine administration routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: survival and neurologic outcomes [^9a823a7c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Our cohort included patients for whom EMTs made onsite first‐attempt decisions about the use of the intravenous or intraosseous access. EMTs may predict potentially poor prognostic factors by their experience and think of that establishing intravenous access in these patients may be challenging.

Previous research on intravenous, HIO, and TIO suggests a better prognosis with upper extremity access, aligning with our findings. Other studies indicate that HIO access is a viable alternative to intravenous access. However, in real‐world EMS scenarios, establishing intravenous access can be time‐consuming, potentially delaying critical interventions, such as epinephrine administration.

The 2020 AHA advanced cardiovascular life support guidelines referenced a study showing a positive trend toward intravenous access, differing from previous studies that found no significant difference in 30‐day survival. Establishing intravenous access can be challenging during resuscitation, often leading to the use of intraosseous routes. The advantages of intravenous access include lower vascular resistance and a higher rate of resuscitation drug distribution compared with intraosseous access. The drug concentration achieved through the TIO route is significantly lower. These findings suggest that intravenous access is preferable to intraosseous in patients with OHCA. In our study, intravenous access showed a slightly more favorable prognosis compared with intraosseous access in terms of survival and favorable neurologic outcome; however, the difference was not statistically significant. It is consistent with previous observational studies that demonstrated that drug administration through the intraosseous route typically results in poor outcomes of survival and neurologic outcome.

### Epinephrine improves 24-hour survival in a swine model of prolonged ventricular fibrillation demonstrating that early intraosseous is superior to delayed intravenous administration [^757e28e0]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vasopressors administered IV late during resuscitation efforts fail to improve survival. Intraosseous (IO) access can provide a route for earlier administration. We hypothesized that IO epinephrine after 1 minute of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (an "optimal" IO scenario) after 10 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest would improve outcome in comparison with either IV epinephrine after 8 minutes of CPR (a "realistic" IV scenario) or placebo controls with no epinephrine.

Methods

Thirty swine were randomized to IO epinephrine, IV epinephrine, or placebo. Important outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 24-hour survival, and 24-hour survival with good neurological outcome (cerebral performance category 1).

Results

ROSC after 10 minutes of untreated VF was uncommon without administration of epinephrine (1 of 10), whereas ROSC was nearly universal with IO epinephrine or delayed IV epinephrine (10 of 10 and 9 of 10, respectively; P = 0.001 for either versus placebo). Twenty-four hour survival was substantially more likely after IO epinephrine than after delayed IV epinephrine (10 of 10 vs. 4 of 10, P = 0.001). None of the placebo group survived at 24 hours. Survival with good neurological outcome was more likely after IO epinephrine than after placebo (6 of 10 vs. 0 of 10, P = 0.011), and only 3 of 10 survived with good neurological outcome in the delayed IV epinephrine group (not significant versus either IO or placebo).

Conclusion

In this swine model of prolonged VF cardiac arrest, epinephrine administration during CPR improved outcomes. In addition, early IO epinephrine improved outcomes in comparison with delayed IV epinephrine.

Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights

The complete evidence-to-decision framework can be found on the ILCOR website, and the evidence-to-decision table is provided in Appendix A. Key points include the following:

This CoSTR and its SysRev focus on the routine administration of calcium during cardiac arrest in adults.
We did not identify any RCTs comparing calcium administration with no calcium administration during IHCA or for specific patient groups such as those with hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.
The trial by Vallentin et alwas stopped early on the basis of suggestions of harm in a preplanned interim analysis, which could have increased the risk of effect size overestimation.
The risk of harm with calcium administration may depend on the scenario in which the intervention is performed.
The effect of calcium administration remains unknown for adults in cardiac arrest from special circumstances such as hyperkalemia, wide QRS interval on ECG, hypocalcemia, hypermagnesemia, calcium channel blocker overdose, or hemorrhage. Existing trials provide insufficient data on these subgroups to be able to evaluate this.
Only small trials or observational studies have attempted to stratify on the basis of initial rhythm or potassium values, and they have been limited by critical risk of bias because of confounding.

### Intraosseous and intravenous epinephrine administration routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: survival and neurologic outcomes [^1ba8b12e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The rate of survival after out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest varies depending on the timeliness and effectiveness of prehospital interventions. This study was conducted to compare out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest outcomes between intravenous and intraosseous routes and between upper and lower extremity routes for drug administration.

Methods and Results

We retrospectively analyzed data (collected using the Utstein template) from 1220 patients who had experienced out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest in Taiwan's Taoyuan City between January 2021 and August 2023. The patients were stratified into intravenous and intraosseous groups by treatment approach and upper and lower extremity access groups by access site. The study outcomes were survival to discharge, favorable neurologic outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category score 1 or 2), and survival for > 2 hours. The study groups were statistically compared before and after propensity score matching. Significant pre–propensity score matching differences were observed between intravenous and intraosseous groups, and the aforementioned study outcomes were better in the intravenous group than in the intraosseous group. However, the between‐group differences became nonsignificant after propensity score matching. Furthermore, lower extremity access and delayed epinephrine administration were associated with worse outcomes. Survival rates fell below 12.6% when time to treatment exceeded 15 minutes, particularly in the cases of intraosseous access and lower extremity access.

Conclusions

This study highlights the benefits of early intervention and upper extremity access for drug administration in patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest. Intraosseous access may serve as a viable alternative to intravenous access. Timely administration of essential drugs during resuscitation can improve clinical outcomes and thus has implications for emergency medical service training.

### Validation of intraosseous delivery of valproic acid in a swine model of polytrauma [^987a40ad]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cardiac arrest literature of drugs in the Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) algorithm has compared IO and intravenous delivery. The Amiodarone, Lidocaine or Placebo in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest trial found that intravenous delivery of both drugs was superior to placebo for achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) by hospital admission and survival to hospital discharge. However, IO delivery was similar to placebo; intravenous versus IO comparisons were underpowered to detect a difference. Time to drug delivery was similar for IO and intravenous routes. The PARAMEDIC2 was a trial that compared intravenous and IO routes for prehospital delivery of epinephrine and found similar rates of ROSC and long-term survival. Observational studies have had mixed outcomes, though they tend to favor intravenous over IO for ACLS drugs. Meta-analysis of these studies favors intravenous over IO for ROSC and long-term survival after cardiac arrest.

In controlled swine models of cardiac arrest, time to ROSC and Pk analyses is equivalent for intravenous compared with various models of sternal and humeral IO for delivery of amiodarone, epinephrine and vasopressin. However, some swine studies comparing intravenous and tibial IO access for epinephrine and vasopressin delivery showed faster time to peak drug concentration and higher drug concentration with intravenous delivery. Taken together, these data suggest that IO is at least a feasible option for emergent drug delivery when intravenous access is impossible or difficult to obtain. When achieving the maximum concentration in seconds is of the utmost importance (eg, epinephrine bolusing during cardiac arrest), perhaps the site of IO access is more relevant with more distal sites (tibia) inferior to proximal sites (humerus and sternum). In this study, we did not evaluate different sites of IO administration, though they were able to show comparable serum concentrations with intravenous and humerus IO VPA infusion over 3 hours. The long infusion of VPA likely makes rapid uptake (within seconds) of the drug less relevant compared with drugs used in ACLS situations. Interestingly, the pharmacokinetic profile of some drugs can change when administered IO, and a lower peak concentration for antibiotics and anticonvulsants administered as an infusion (similar to our VPA infusion). This is thought to be a depot effect in the IO space that causes a lower peak serum concentration, and a slower time to peak concentration. The similar serum concentrations we have demonstrated here would suggest that no dosing adjustment would need to be made with IO administration of VPA, which would be of practical concern for frontline medics.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^bb447fe9]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Vascular access in cardiac arrest management — It is recommended that professionals first attempt establishing intravenous access for drug administration in adult patients in cardiac arrest (COR 1, LOE A). Intraosseous access is reasonable if initial attempts at intravenous access are unsuccessful or not feasible for adult patients in cardiac arrest (COR 2a, LOE A). For appropriately trained professionals, central venous access may be considered for adult patients in cardiac arrest if attempts to establish intravenous and intraosseous access are unsuccessful or not feasible (COR 2b, LOE C-LD). Traditionally, peripheral intravenous (IV) access has been used to administer medication during cardiac arrest, alternatives to IV access include intraosseous (IO), central venous, intracardiac, and endotracheal routes, intracardiac drug administration was discouraged in the 2000 American Heart Association guidelines due to specialized skill requirements, potential morbidity, and the availability of other access options, endotracheal drug administration has been removed from the guidelines because it results in low blood concentrations and unpredictable pharmacological effects, and central venous access is primarily used in a hospital setting because it requires specialized training to acquire and maintain proficiency.

### Comparison of intravenous and intraosseous administration of vasopressin and epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation of asphyxiated neonatal piglets [^cef619e7]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Epinephrine is currently the only vasopressor recommended during neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Previous neonatal animal studies suggested intravenous (IV) vasopressin as a potential alternative; however, no neonatal study has compared the efficacy of intraosseous (IO) with IV vasopressin to epinephrine administration during CPR.

Design/Methods

Newborn piglets (n = 8/group) were anesthetized, intubated, surgically instrumented, and exposed to normocapnic hypoxia followed by asphyxia and asystole. Piglets were resuscitated following randomization to 0.4IU/kg IV or IO vasopressin, or 0.02mg/kg IV or IO epinephrine.

Results

There were no differences in median (IQR) time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) between IV and IO vasopressin (254 (220–473) vs. 215 (200–240)sec, respectively, p = 0.143), IV and IO epinephrine (272 (265–278) vs. 233 (203–266)sec, respectively, p = 0.286), or all four groups (p = 0.312). The number of piglets that achieved ROSC was similar with IV and IO vasopressin (5 (63%) vs. 3 (38%), respectively, p = 0.619), IV and IO epinephrine (2 (25%) vs. 6 (75%), respectively, p = 0.132), and between all groups (p = 0.233).

Conclusions

Vasopressin given either via IO or IV had no difference in time to or rates of ROSC compared to IV and IO epinephrine.

Impact

This is the first neonatal animal study to compare intraosseous (IO) and intravenous (IV) vasopressin during cardiac arrest. Time to and rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were similar between IO and IV vasopressin. Time to and incidence of ROSC were not statistically different between vasopressin and epinephrine, regardless of IV or IO administration. Hemodynamic changes during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are similar between vasopressin and epinephrine groups. Plasma vasopressor concentrations were similar between IO and IV routes.

Results of individual studies and risks of bias.

Gastrointestinal decontamination

Five human case series, including two pediatric studies, reported sequelae-free survival of all patients who underwent gastrointestinal decontamination (including activated charcoal, gastric lavage, and whole-bowel irrigation). Cardiac arrests following initiation of whole-bowel irrigation were documented in two case series of hemodynamically unstable patients, and following gastric lavage in one case report. In all cases, complications occurred after the patient began vomiting. Given the nature of these reports, neither survival nor cardiac arrest can be attributed, with confidence, to the decontamination procedures.

High-dose insulin

High-dose insulin (intravenous (IV) bolus of 1.0 unit/kg followed by a 0.5–2.0 unit/kg/h infusion) showed an improvement in hemodynamics in one of two human observational studies, all five human case series, and all four animal studiesassessing that outcome, while a survival benefit was reported in animal studies. Hypoglycemia (1 of 7and 2 of 4subjects) and hypokalemia (2 of 7and 2 of 4subjects) were reported as adverse effects in human cohort studies and case series, respectively.

Calcium

The majority of animal studiesevaluating use of calcium demonstrated a reduced mortality as well as hemodynamic improvement. Human case seriesand case reportsdemonstrated inconsistent benefits, but adverse effects such as hypercalcemia were rare. The dose employed was typically an IV single dose of calcium chloride (1–5 g), sometimes followed by an infusion, or the equivalent dose in calcium gluconate.

Calcium therapy for severe CCB toxicity — available literature on calcium monotherapy is limited; improvements in heart rate, blood pressure, and conduction abnormalities are reported in adults and children, but most patients require additional treatments; in 1 case series of adults, high doses of calcium gluconate (targeting ionized calcium concentrations up to twice normal) appeared to be more effective than lower doses.

### Intraosseous and intravenous epinephrine administration routes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: survival and neurologic outcomes [^1b4f6207]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The rate of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest varies depending on the timeliness and effectiveness of prehospital interventions. This study was conducted to compare out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes between intravenous and intraosseous routes and between upper and lower extremity routes for drug administration.

Methods and Results

We retrospectively analyzed data (collected using the Utstein template) from 1220 patients who had experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Taiwan's Taoyuan City between January 2021 and August 2023. The patients were stratified into intravenous and intraosseous groups by treatment approach and upper and lower extremity access groups by access site. The study outcomes were survival to discharge, favorable neurologic outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category score 1 or 2), and survival for > 2hours. The study groups were statistically compared before and after propensity score matching. Significant pre-propensity score matching differences were observed between intravenous and intraosseous groups, and the aforementioned study outcomes were better in the intravenous group than in the intraosseous group. However, the between-group differences became nonsignificant after propensity score matching. Furthermore, lower extremity access and delayed epinephrine administration were associated with worse outcomes. Survival rates fell below 12.6% when time to treatment exceeded 15minutes, particularly in the cases of intraosseous access and lower extremity access.

Conclusions

This study highlights the benefits of early intervention and upper extremity access for drug administration in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Intraosseous access may serve as a viable alternative to intravenous access. Timely administration of essential drugs during resuscitation can improve clinical outcomes and thus has implications for emergency medical service training.

### Intravenous versus intramuscular epinephrine administration during cardiopulmonary resuscitation-a pilot study in piglets [^817b7c8a]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Early epinephrine administration in cardiac arrest seems to be advantageous to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Because intravenous (i.v.) or intraosseous access is not always immediately available, this study compares efficacy of early intramuscular (i.m.) epinephrine administration with early and delayed i.v. epinephrine injection in an animal cardiac arrest model.

Methods

Piglets anesthetized with sevoflurane were intoxicated by an i.v. ropivacaine infusion until circulatory arrest. After 1 min basic life support (chest compression and ventilation), epinephrine i.v. (10 μg·kg(-1), group IV) or epinephrine i.m. (100 μg·kg(-1), group IM) or normal saline (group NS) was applied. Further doses of epinephrine were given in group IV every 4 min and in group IM after 10 min if required. Twenty-one minutes after circulatory arrest, i.v. epinephrine - as necessary - was given to all animals. Thus, group NS represents late epinephrine administration. Outcomes were survival and time to ROSC.

Results

Twenty-four pigs aged 19.5 (median, interquartile range 16–22) days, weighing 5.4 (5.0–5.7) kg were investigated. Total amount of ropivacaine administered was 8.9 (8.1–10.1) mg·kg(-1). Cardiac rhythm before starting CPR was pulseless electric activity and asystole in 15 and 9 pigs, respectively. Eight, seven, and four pigs survived in group IV, IM, and NS. Focusing on surviving animals, time to ROSC was 2, 4 and 19.5 min in group IV, IM, and NS.

Conclusions

Early i.m. epinephrine provided similar survival compared with early i.v. epinephrine and was superior to delayed epinephrine administration in resuscitation of ropivacaine-induced cardiac arrest in piglets.
