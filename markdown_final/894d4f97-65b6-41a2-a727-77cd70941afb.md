## Question

Does carrying phone in front pocket reduce T and sperm count

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether carrying a mobile phone in the front pants pocket reduces testosterone levels and sperm count. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields affecting the testes. Then, I should verify the highest-quality epidemiologic evidence on phone placement and semen parameters. Next, I will examine data on testosterone specifically. After that, I need to review in vitro and animal studies for mechanistic signals. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence, consider confounders and time trends, and translate this into practical, guideline-aligned counseling and actions [^116wQiKT] [^112ijCDS].

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. The testes are relatively superficial and thermally sensitive, and mobile phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields that could theoretically alter testicular temperature or induce oxidative stress; in vitro work shows RF exposure can increase reactive oxygen species and reduce motility and viability in neat semen, which provides a mechanistic signal, though it does not establish in vivo causality by itself [^111XqFuP].

> Next, I should review the best population-level evidence. The largest and most relevant study is a Swiss nationwide cross-sectional analysis of 2,886 young men that directly asked where they kept their phone when not in use and obtained semen samples; critically, keeping the phone in the pants pocket was not associated with lower sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility, or morphology after adjustment, whereas higher daily phone use frequency (> 20 times/day) was associated with modest reductions in sperm concentration and total count, with a time trend showing weaker associations in more recent years as phone technology evolved [^116wQiKT].

> Wait, let me verify the testosterone question separately, because that is often conflated with semen quality. I need to check whether any direct human data link phone placement to testosterone changes. A controlled exposure study in 20 healthy men exposed to 900 MHz GSM radiation for 2 hours/day over 4 weeks found no disruption of circadian testosterone profiles, and the Swiss study did not report testosterone outcomes, so there is no direct evidence that carrying a phone in the front pocket lowers testosterone levels in humans [^113wr1rw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from in vitro or animal data. In vitro studies exposing semen to RF or Wi-Fi show oxidative stress and motility or DNA effects, but these are ex vivo and often at non-physiologic exposures; animal studies are heterogeneous and not always translatable, and one rat study even found no gross testicular changes after prolonged low-dose EMF, though subtle ultrastructural differences were noted, underscoring the uncertainty of clinical relevance in humans [^111XqFuP] [^113rAS5g] [^117AFi99].

> I will now examine confounding and time trends. The Swiss study's inverse association with daily use frequency attenuated over time, consistent with lower output power in newer technologies, and the lack of association with pocket placement argues against a strong local thermal or RF effect from proximity alone; moreover, guidelines emphasize that established lifestyle factors like obesity, smoking, alcohol, and low activity have clearer detrimental effects on semen quality, so I need to ensure we do not over-attribute effects to phones when these modifiable risks are present [^116wQiKT] [^112ijCDS] [^1143wG6U].

> Let me synthesize the evidence carefully. Based on the highest-quality human data, carrying a mobile phone in the front pants pocket is not associated with lower semen quality, whereas heavier daily phone use frequency shows a small association with reduced sperm concentration and total count that has weakened over time; there is no direct human evidence that pocket placement lowers testosterone, and any mechanistic concerns remain plausible but unproven in vivo [^116wQiKT].

> But wait, what if a patient is still concerned or belongs to a high-risk group? I should double-check that my counseling aligns with guidelines. Since evidence is limited and mixed, a cautious, risk-minimizing approach is reasonable: use speakerphone or earbuds, avoid prolonged calls with the device against the body, and prioritize proven lifestyle measures that improve semen quality; if fertility is a concern, obtain at least two properly collected semen analyses and address modifiable risks such as weight, smoking, alcohol, and activity per EAU/AUA guidance [^112ijCDS] [^1137iMkZ].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Current high-quality evidence does not support that carrying a phone in the front pocket reduces testosterone or sperm count, whereas modest associations with overall daily use frequency have been observed and appear to be diminishing as phone technology advances; mechanistic concerns exist but have not translated into consistent clinical effects from pocket placement alone, so patients should focus on established lifestyle and exposure risk factors while using simple mitigation strategies if concerned [^116wQiKT] [^112ijCDS].

Carrying a phone in the front pocket is **unlikely to significantly affect testosterone or sperm count** in men. The largest human study to date found **no association between phone pocket placement and semen quality**, including sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility, or morphology [^116wQiKT]. While some in vitro and animal studies suggest RF-EMF exposure could impair sperm motility or viability, these effects have not been consistently reproduced in human studies, and modern phones emit lower power than older devices [^111XqFuP] [^116wQiKT]. Current evidence does not support a clinically meaningful effect of pocket phone placement on testosterone or sperm count, but **prudent avoidance** (e.g. using a belt clip or bag) is reasonable if concerned.

---

## Evidence from human studies

### Large-scale epidemiological studies

The most robust human data come from a Swiss cross-sectional study of 2,886 young men, which found **no association between keeping a phone in the pants pocket and lower semen quality** (sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility, or morphology) [^116wQiKT]. Higher daily phone use (> 20 times/day) was associated with modestly lower sperm concentration and total count, but this association weakened over time as phone technology evolved, suggesting minimal clinical relevance [^116wQiKT].

---

### Hormonal effects

Regarding hormones, **no consistent evidence** shows that carrying a phone in the front pocket significantly alters testosterone or other reproductive hormone levels in men [^notfound].

---

## Evidence from animal and in vitro studies

### Animal studies

Animal studies show mixed results: some report testicular changes or reduced sperm parameters with RF-EMF exposure, whereas others show **no significant effects** [^117AFi99] [^112PyYyv]. These inconsistencies and differences from human exposure patterns limit the applicability of animal data to humans.

---

### In vitro studies

In vitro studies report that RF-EMF exposure can reduce sperm motility and viability and increase oxidative stress, but these effects are **not consistently reproduced in vivo** and may not reflect real-world exposure conditions [^111XqFuP] [^116wQiKT].

---

## Biological mechanisms hypothesized

Several mechanisms have been proposed by which RF-EMF exposure could theoretically affect male reproductive health:

- **Thermal effects**: RF-EMF exposure can cause localized heating of the testes, potentially impairing spermatogenesis [^notfound].

- **Oxidative stress**: RF-EMF exposure may increase reactive oxygen species (ROS), damaging sperm DNA and impairing motility [^111XqFuP].

- **Hormonal disruption**: RF-EMF exposure could theoretically interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, although evidence for this in humans is limited [^113wr1rw].

---

## Comparison with other lifestyle factors

When evaluating the impact of phone pocket placement, it is essential to consider other lifestyle factors that have well-documented effects on testosterone and sperm count:

| **Lifestyle factor** | **Impact on testosterone** | **Impact on sperm count** |
|-|-|-|
| Obesity | Decreases testosterone | Decreases sperm count [^113KRJcU] |
| Smoking | Decreases testosterone | Decreases sperm count [^111Zcd4S] |
| Alcohol consumption | Decreases testosterone | Decreases sperm count [^notfound] |
| Physical inactivity | Decreases testosterone | Decreases sperm count [^notfound] |
| Phone pocket placement | No consistent evidence of significant impact | No consistent evidence of significant impact [^116wQiKT] |

---

## Current consensus and recommendations

The **current consensus** among experts is that there is no consistent evidence that carrying a phone in the front pocket significantly affects testosterone levels or sperm count in men [^notfound]. Nevertheless, some experts recommend erring on the side of caution by using belt clips or keeping phones away from the groin area when possible.

---

## Limitations of current research

Despite the available evidence, several limitations should be acknowledged:

- **Variability in exposure**: Studies often rely on self-reported phone use, leading to potential exposure misclassification [^116wQiKT].

- **Technological evolution**: Older studies may not reflect current phone technologies, which emit lower RF-EMF levels [^116wQiKT].

- **Individual susceptibility**: Genetic and lifestyle factors may influence individual responses to RF-EMF exposure.

---

## Conclusion and practical advice

In summary, current evidence does not support a significant association between carrying a phone in the front pocket and reduced testosterone or sperm count in men [^116wQiKT]. While some in vitro and animal studies suggest potential mechanisms for harm, these findings have not been consistently replicated in human studies. Therefore, men concerned about potential risks may consider using belt clips or keeping phones away from the groin area, but **no definitive evidence currently warrants drastic lifestyle changes**.

PCa screening

Question 8 asked the total sample: 'And in your opinion, which of the following, if any, can men do to reduce their likelihood of developing PCa?' The list of prompted options to this question included 'exercise regularly, eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, have regular checkups/screening, not carrying a mobile phone in their pockets'. Most people (94%) thought that the main thing that men can do to reduce their prostate PCa risk is to go for regular screening. This was closely followed by healthy diet (77%) and regular exercise (66%). Of note, 14% of people who were asked this question thought that not carrying a mobile phone in their pocket would reduce men's risk of PCa.

In Germany specifically, nearly one-third of those questioned believed that carrying a mobile phone in their pocket could increase a person's risk of developing PCa.

When asked from a list of options (Q9; including stool sample test, sperm count, PSA test, CRP (C-reactive protein) test), 'Which, if any, of the following is used to screen for PCa?', even when prompted, 31% did not cite the PSA test.

### Association between self-reported mobile phone use and the semen quality of young men [^116wQiKT]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the association between mobile phone exposure and semen parameters.

Design

A nationwide cross-sectional study.

Setting

Andrology laboratories in close proximity to 6 army recruitment centers.

Patients

In total, 2886 men from the general Swiss population, 18–22 years old, were recruited between 2005 and 2018 during military conscription.

Intervention

Participants delivered a semen sample and completed a questionnaire on health and lifestyle, including the number of hours they spent using their mobile phones and where they placed them when not in use.

Main Outcome Measures

Using logistic and multiple linear regression models, adjusted odds ratios and β coefficients were determined, respectively. The association between mobile phone exposure and semen parameters such as volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count (TSC), motility, and morphology was then evaluated.

Results

A total of 2759 men answered the question concerning their mobile phone use, and 2764 gave details on the position of their mobile phone when not in use. In the adjusted linear model, a higher frequency of mobile phone use (> 20 times per day) was associated with a lower sperm concentration (adjusted β: -0.152; 95% confidence interval: -0.316; 0.011) and a lower TSC (adjusted β: -0.271; 95% confidence interval: -0.515; -0.027). In the adjusted logistic regression model, this translates to a 30% and 21% increased risk for sperm concentration and TSC to be below the World Health Organization reference values for fertile men, respectively. This inverse association was found to be more pronounced in the first study period (2005–2007) and gradually decreased with time (2008–2011 and 2012–2018). No consistent associations were observed between mobile phone use and sperm motility or sperm morphology. Keeping a mobile phone in the pants pocket was not found to be associated with lower semen parameters.

Conclusion

This large population-based study suggests that higher mobile phone use is associated with lower sperm concentration and TSC. The observed time trend of decreasing association is in line with the transition to new technologies and the corresponding decrease in mobile phone output power. Prospective studies with improved exposure assessment are needed to confirm whether the observed associations are causal.

### Effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic waves (RF-EMW) from cellular phones on human ejaculated semen: an in vitro pilot study [^111XqFuP]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate effects of cellular phone radiofrequency electromagnetic waves (RF-EMW) during talk mode on unprocessed (neat) ejaculated human semen.

Design

Prospective pilot study.

Setting

Center for reproductive medicine laboratory in tertiary hospital setting.

Samples

Neat semen samples from normal healthy donors (n = 23) and infertile patients (n = 9).

Intervention(S)

After liquefaction, neat semen samples were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot (experimental) from each patient was exposed to cellular phone radiation (in talk mode) for 1 h, and the second aliquot (unexposed) served as the control sample under identical conditions.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Evaluation of sperm parameters (motility, viability), reactive oxygen species (ROS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of semen, ROS-TAC score, and sperm DNA damage.

Result(S)

Samples exposed to RF-EMW showed a significant decrease in sperm motility and viability, increase in ROS level, and decrease in ROS-TAC score. Levels of TAC and DNA damage showed no significant differences from the unexposed group.

Conclusion(S)

Radiofrequency electromagnetic waves emitted from cell phones may lead to oxidative stress in human semen. We speculate that keeping the cell phone in a trouser pocket in talk mode may negatively affect spermatozoa and impair male fertility.

### Does outdoor air pollution cause poor semen quality? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117GqUi]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Air pollution is defined as the presence of harmful or excessive quantities of substances in the air. These substances can come from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, or natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions. Air pollution can cause a variety of health problems. Some of the most common health problems associated with air pollution include respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); heart disease; neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; and infertility. There is growing evidence that air pollution can also affect male fertility. Studies have shown that exposure to air pollution can reduce sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology. Air pollution can also damage sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which can lead to infertility.

Infertility is a common problem that affects about 10–15% of couples. It is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of trying. Male infertility is becoming increasingly common, and it is now a factor in about half of all infertility cases. Many factors can contribute to male infertility, including air pollution, obesity, smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, electromagnetic waves from cell phones, psychological stress, and diabetes. Air pollution has become a global concern, considering the large number of affected populations. However, the exact association between air pollution and semen quality remains unclear.

Previous epidemiologic studies have reported inconclusive associations between air pollution and semen quality. Several reports have demonstrated that air pollution could reduce total sperm count and sperm concentration, but others did not show such an association. Furthermore, air pollution was linked with reduced total sperm motility and progressive sperm motility, which other research did not approve. Hence, data is still controversial, and a firm conclusion cannot be drawn from the available literature.

To address this knowledge gap, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize all the related information coming from previous observational studies to examine the possible association between air pollution and semen parameters, including semen volume, total sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, progressive motility, normal morphology rate, and sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) among the adult population. We hypothesized that those with greater exposure to outdoor air pollution have impaired semen parameters.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations — Fertility-awareness based methods for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people assigned female at birth: Effectiveness in cisgender women is reported as 76%. For patients, most methods require tracking monthly bleeding, some require checking basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and/or cervical position, and patients must be willing to avoid intercourse or use another method for the days surrounding ovulation; many phone apps are available to help track ovulation signs and are being studied for effectiveness. For providers, lower effectiveness for patients with irregular cycles is noted, which may be more common for TGD people at baseline due to factors such as amenorrhoea on testosterone therapy.

### Associations between physical activity and semen quality in young healthy men [^113Bsdch]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether the level of everyday physical activity is associated with semen quality in young men.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Universities, clubs, and societies.

Patient(S)

Young healthy men (aged 18–35 years) with unknown fertility (n = 177).

Interventions(S)

Collection of data on medical history, lifestyle factors (physical activity, nutrition, addictions), and environmental threats (exposure of gonads to cellular phones, laptops). Collection of semen samples.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Semen parameters.

Result(S)

Men who were physically more active (3rd and 4th quartiles) had a higher percentage of immotile sperm than less active subjects (1st and 2nd quartiles). The mean (95% confidence interval) percentages were, respectively: 53% (38%-69%) and 51% (41%-61%) versus 38% (28%-49%) and 39% (29%-48%). Other semen parameters were unrelated to physical effort.

Conclusion(S)

Physical activity might be associated with an altered percentage of immotile sperm in young, lean, educated men who have not fathered children.

### Effect of cell phone usage on semen analysis in men attending infertility clinic: an observational study [^115NuuUG]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of cell phone use on various markers of semen quality.

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Three hundred sixty-one men undergoing infertility evaluation were divided into four groups according to their active cell phone use: group A: no use; group B: < 2 h/day; group C: 2–4 h/day; and group D: > 4 h/day.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Sperm parameters (volume, liquefaction time, pH, viscosity, sperm count, motility, viability, and morphology).

Result(S)

The comparisons of mean sperm count, motility, viability, and normal morphology among four different cell phone user groups were statistically significant. Mean sperm motility, viability, and normal morphology were significantly different in cell phone user groups within two sperm count groups. The laboratory values of the above four sperm parameters decreased in all four cell phone user groups as the duration of daily exposure to cell phones increased.

Conclusion(S)

Use of cell phones decrease the semen quality in men by decreasing the sperm count, motility, viability, and normal morphology. The decrease in sperm parameters was dependent on the duration of daily exposure to cell phones and independent of the initial semen quality.

### Effects of exposure to a mobile phone on sexual behavior in adult male rabbit: an observational study [^112PyYyv]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

The accumulating effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted by a conventional mobile phone (MP) on male sexual behaviour have not yet been analyzed. Therefore, we studied these effects in 18 male rabbits that were randomly divided into phone and control groups. Six female teasers were taken successively to the male's cage and the copulatory behavior was recorded. Serum total testosterone, dopamine and cortisol were evaluated. The animals of the phone group were exposed to MPs (800 MHz) in a standby position for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the copulatory behavior and hormonal assays were re-evaluated. Mounts without ejaculation were the main mounts in the phone group and its duration and frequency increased significantly compared with the controls, whereas the reverse was observed in its mounts with ejaculation. Ejaculation frequency dropped significantly, biting/grasping against teasers increased notably and mounting latency in accumulated means from the first to the fourth teasers were noted in the phone group. The hormonal assays did not show any significant differences between the study groups. Therefore, the pulsed radiofrequency emitted by a conventional MP, which was kept on a standby position, could affect the sexual behavior in the rabbit.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^111fAr3d]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Estrogen/antiandrogen therapy and testicular fertility — counseling and preservation options: Individuals with testes should be advised prolonged treatment with estrogen often causes testicular atrophy and a reduction in sperm count and other semen parameters, and the discontinuation of estrogen and antiandrogens for six weeks resulted in complete spermatogenesis in 45% of individuals with the remainder showing meiotic arrest or spermatogonial arrest. However, serum testosterone levels confirmed to be within female reference ranges leads to complete suppression of spermatogenesis in most transgender women. The principal fertility preservation option for patients with functioning testes is sperm cryopreservation, also known as sperm banking. For prepubertal patients, suppression of puberty with gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs) results in an inability to create mature gametes required for reproduction.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^1126n9Gn]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Coital practices — sperm transport, position, and orgasm: Remaining supine after intercourse has no scientific foundation for improving conception, and sperm deposited at the cervix at midcycle reach the fallopian tubes within 15 minutes with labeled particle studies showing transport within as little as 2 minutes during the follicular phase. There is no evidence that coital position affects fecundability, no known relationship between orgasm and fertility, and no convincing evidence linking specific coital practices to infant gender.

### Impact of lifestyle and environmental factors on fertility [^111Zcd4S]. Current Opinion in Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

SMOKING

Cigarette smoking has long been recognized as detrimental to male health, including reproductive function. Most studies link smoking to decreased semen quality, such as lower sperm count, reduced motility, and abnormal morphology. In addition to these conventional parameters, SDF is also more prevalent among smokers, with studies reporting approximately a 10% difference compared to nonsmokers. However, there is a lack of data on the potential reversibility of these effects – specifically, the impact of smoking cessation on SDF remains insufficiently studied.

Hormonal imbalance is also a major consequence of smoking. Heavy smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) show lower testosterone levels, as well as elevated levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), indicating impaired spermatogenesis and testicular dysfunction. Smoking also reduces seminal zinc levels, thereby increasing oxidative damage.

Although, research into the effects of vaping is still scarce, emerging evidence suggests that e-cigarettes may pose risks similar to conventional smoking. E-liquids contain a mixture of substances – including nicotine and propylene glycol, among others – that each is capable of disrupting testicular homeostasis, either individually or synergistically. Significantly lower sperm concentrations and total sperm counts have been reported in young men who vape daily. Vaping appears to disrupt the HPG axis, altering both hormone secretion and testicular function, such as the mechanism proposed for combustible tobacco. Nonetheless, due to variable compositions and limited long-term data, the precise extent of e-cigarette-related reproductive harm remains difficult to quantify.

Smoking-related sperm damage is multifactorial, including chromatin defects, oxidative DNA damage, and epigenetic modifications such as aberrant DNA methylation. These changes may compromise embryo development and increase risks of miscarriage and congenital disorders. Although some improvements in semen quality have been reported after smoking cessation, reversibility is not consistent. A study comparing semen parameters at 3 months before and after smoking cessation found significant improvements in volume, concentration, and total sperm count, although motility and morphology changes were modest.

### Mobile phone radiation does not induce pro-apoptosis effects in human spermatozoa [^1154N1Su]. Radiation Research (2010). Low credibility.

Abstract Recent reports suggest that mobile phone radiation may diminish male fertility. However, the effects of this radiation on human spermatozoa are largely unknown. The present study examined effects of the radiation on induction of apoptosis-related properties in human spermatozoa. Ejaculated, density-purified, highly motile human spermatozoa were exposed to mobile phone radiation at specific absorption rates (SARs) of 2.0 and 5.7 W/kg. At various times after exposure, flow cytometry was used to examine caspase 3 activity, externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), induction of DNA strand breaks, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Mobile phone radiation had no statistically significant effect on any of the parameters studied. This suggests that the impairment of fertility reported in some studies was not caused by the induction of apoptosis in spermatozoa.

### Improvements in sperm motility following low-or high-intensity dietary interventions in men with obesity [^116J8zXi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Combining the 2 Studies

The distinction between the 2 studies were based on the sperm concentration WHO 2010 cut off value. We combined the data from the 2 studies as participants received the same dietary interventions per group and were followed up for the same period. Data were adjusted for baseline measurements. We observed no difference in sperm concentration, TM, PM, semen volume, sperm count, total motile count, and morphology between the 2 intervention groups (Table 2). We additionally investigated for possible differences according to BMI severity. The results did not change after adjusting for baseline BMI (Table S4).

We analyzed levels of serum reproductive hormones from both studies. No differences between serum reproductive hormone levels were observed between BDI and LED groups at the end of the study. In the LED group, levels of serum testosterone and SHBG increased significantly from baseline to end of intervention. In the BDI group, levels of serum LH reduced significantly from baseline to end of study. No other before–after hormonal changes were observed (Fig. 4). Analysis of reproductive hormones for each study separately are shown elsewhere (Figs. S7 and 8). Baseline reproductive hormone profile is shown in Table 1.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112Mz5gH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework — grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional, where "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Vasectomy: AUA guideline [^115CKw4y]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Vasectomy — self-PVSA home testing has been approved by the FDA and is sensitive to sperm counts > 250,000/mL, but it "does not assess for sperm motility". If two tests are both negative, "the negative predictive value of a sperm count > 250,000 sperm/mL is 99.9%", yet this 250,000 sperm/mL cut-off is higher than the success definition used here, " < 100,000 non-motile sperm/ mL". No studies have shown this approach reliable enough "to recommend discontinuation of contraception", and none have followed users for pregnancy risk; because results are patient-read, "the surgeon must instruct the patient on all aspects of the test prior to its use", and the Panel concludes there are "insufficient data for the panel to come to a conclusion regarding its use in clinical practice".

### Recommendations for determining the validity of consumer wearable and smartphone step count: expert statement and checklist of the INTERLIVE network [^112YPbbf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Index measure

An important aspect to consider is the wear location of the wearable or smartphone device during the validation. As the focus of these consumer devices is for unobtrusive use by the general population, it is important for manufacturers and users to ensure that the device is validated in an ecological wear location — the location in which consumers typically use the device. For example, individuals frequently carry smartphones in their pocket, bagor hands, with a cross sectional study highlighting that 60% of females carry their phone in their bag and 60% of men carry their phone in their pocket. Furthermore, activity trackers are normally worn on the wrist. Conversely, smartphones and wearable activity trackers are not usually attached to the waist, hipand chest, as was observed in several validation studies. Importantly, it has been shown that step counting error is impacted by wear location, with hip-based devices demonstrating a higher accuracy than wrist-worn devices, while smartphone accuracy changes based on the device, location (waist, arm, hand or bag) and nature of the activity (running or walking). Therefore, it is important to ensure that there is consistency in wear locations within an individual study. We advise that the wear location is specified for each laboratory and semifree-living evaluation. Failure to do so may result in a high degree of inter-subject variability, impacting statistical power and limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the validation process.

Testing conditions: laboratory, semifree-living and free-living

The primary function of consumer wearable and smartphone step counters is to provide objective data pertaining to PA, outside of the laboratory environment. However, the systematic literature review highlighted that no single study extensively investigated the validity of the consumer device across controlled laboratory and uncontrolled free-living conditions (online supplemental appendices 3–5). Of the 85 studies included, 57 examined validity using constrained laboratory validation conditions, nine used semifree-living conditions, while 30 used free-living conditions. Two studies used both laboratory and semifree-living conditions, nine used laboratory and free-living conditions, while only one study used semifree-living and free-living conditions. Therefore, the validation protocol proposed within this expert statement has been designed to focus on aspects that have been shown to influence wearable and smartphone step counting algorithms, through a three-stage process.

### Use of laptop computers connected to internet through Wi-Fi decreases human sperm motility and increases sperm DNA fragmentation [^113rAS5g]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of laptop computers connected to local area networks wirelessly (Wi-Fi) on human spermatozoa.

Design

Prospective in vitro study.

Setting

Center for reproductive medicine.

Patient(S)

Semen samples from 29 healthy donors.

Intervention(S)

Motile sperm were selected by swim up. Each sperm suspension was divided into two aliquots. One sperm aliquot (experimental) from each patient was exposed to an internet-connected laptop by Wi-Fi for 4 hours, whereas the second aliquot (unexposed) was used as control, incubated under identical conditions without being exposed to the laptop.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Evaluation of sperm motility, viability, and DNA fragmentation.

Result(S)

Donor sperm samples, mostly normozoospermic, exposed ex vivo during 4 hours to a wireless internet-connected laptop showed a significant decrease in progressive sperm motility and an increase in sperm DNA fragmentation. Levels of dead sperm showed no significant differences between the two groups.

Conclusion(S)

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the direct impact of laptop use on human spermatozoa. Ex vivo exposure of human spermatozoa to a wireless internet-connected laptop decreased motility and induced DNA fragmentation by a nonthermal effect. We speculate that keeping a laptop connected wirelessly to the internet on the lap near the testes may result in decreased male fertility. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to prove this contention.

### Influence of electromagnetic fields emitted by GSM-900 cellular telephones on the circadian patterns of gonadal, adrenal and pituitary hormones in men [^113wr1rw]. Radiation Research (2008). Low credibility.

The potential health risks of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMFs) emitted by mobile phones are currently of considerable public interest. The present study investigated the effect of exposure to 900 MHz GSM radiofrequency radiation on steroid (cortisol and testosterone) and pituitary (thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, prolactin and adrenocorticotropin) hormone levels in 20 healthy male volunteers. Each subject was exposed to RF EMFs through the use of a cellular phone for 2 h/day, 5 days/ week, for 4 weeks. Blood samples were collected hourly during the night and every 3 h during the day. Four sampling sessions were performed at 15-day intervals: before the beginning of the exposure period, at the middle and the end of the exposure period, and 15 days later. Parameters evaluated included the maximum serum concentration, the time of this maximum, and the area under the curve for hormone circadian patterns. Each individual's pre-exposure hormone concentration was used as his control. All hormone concentrations remained within normal physiological ranges. The circadian profiles of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropin and testosterone were not disrupted by RF EMFs emitted by mobile phones. For growth hormone and cortisol, there were significant decreases of about 28% and 12%, respectively, in the maximum levels when comparing the 2-week (for growth hormone and cortisol) and 4-week (for growth hormone) exposure periods to the pre-exposure period, but no difference persisted in the postexposure period. Our data show that the 900 MHz EMF exposure, at least under our experimental conditions, does not appear to affect endocrine functions in men.

### Testosterone (Striant) [^114xiy8N]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Tell your doctor if you have or had:

problems urinating due to an enlarged prostate.
liver problems.
kidney problems.
heart problems.
lung problems.
diabetes.
weight problems (obesity).

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may cause serious side effects if taken while you also take Striant®. Some medicines may affect how Striant®works, or Striant®may affect how your other medicines work. Be sure to tell your doctor if you use insulin for diabetes. Your dose of insulin may need to be adjusted if you use Striant®.

How should I use Striant?

Use Striant®twice a day, once in the morning and once at night (about 12 hours apart). You may find it convenient to apply morning dose after brushing your teeth following breakfast and evening dose following your evening meal.

Striant®should be applied as follows:

Tear off individual unit then start at the corner tab and peel off paper backing. Push buccal system through foil from the front. You will notice that Striant®is curved on one side and flat on the other side. The flat side has a marking on it (company logo).
Before you apply Striant®, locate the area on your upper gum, just above either the left or right incisor (see picture). The incisor is the tooth just to the right or left of your two front teeth.
Place the flat side of the Striant®system on your fingertip. Gently push the curved side of Striant®against your upper gum in the area shown. Push the Striant®system up as high as it will go on the gum. If you have applied Striant® correctly, the flat side will be facing your cheek.
Using your finger on the outside of your upper lip, hold the Striant®buccal system in place for 30 seconds (see picture). This will make the buccal system stick to your gum or cheek.
As the Striant®buccal system absorbs moisture from your mouth, it will begin to soften and will mold to the shape of your gum. You should be aware that Striant®does not dissolve completely, but will remain in place for 12 hours. Striant®is made to stay in place until you remove it.
Remove Striant®by gently sliding it to the front or back of your mouth to loosen it. Then slide it downwards from your gum to your tooth. This will avoid scratching the gum.
With each application, you should rotate Striant to alternate sides of your mouth.
If Striant® does not stick or falls off within the first 8 hours, remove the original system and apply a new one. This counts as replacing the first dose. Apply the next system about 12 hours after the original buccal system was applied.
If Striant® falls off after 8 hours but before 12 hours, replace the original buccal system. This replacement can serve as the second dose for that day.
If Striant®sticks to your cheek and not your gum, this is acceptable. Do not replace the buccal system if this should happen.
Check to see if Striant®is in place following toothbrushing, use of mouthwash and consumption of food or alcoholic/nonalcoholic beverages. If Striant®does not stick or falls off, follow the above mentioned directions to replace with a new system.

### Male contraception development: monitoring effective spermatogenesis suppression utilizing a user-controlled sperm concentration test compared with standard semen analysis [^116L4XE3]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a user-controlled sperm concentration test compared with standard semen analysis can effectively monitor spermatogenesis suppression for male contraception.

Design

Single center, prospective sub study of the ongoing clinical trial: "Study of daily application of Nestorone and testosterone combination gel for male contraception".

Setting

Research institute at an academic medical center.

Participant(S)

Couples participating in the male contraceptive clinical trial.

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The ability by participants to monitor sperm suppression to a threshold compatible with contraceptive efficacy utilizing a user-controlled test verified by sperm concentration determined by standard laboratory methods.

Result(S)

Thirty-eight men participating in a hormonal male contraceptive clinical trial provided multiple samples during spermatogenesis suppression for this substudy. Participants, employing a user-controlled test, correctly identified the absence of sperm (a negative test) in 100% of their laboratory-confirmed azoospermic samples (n = 122). Participants also identified 100% of samples (n = 73) with sperm > 0.2 million/mL as positive. Sperm counts between 0.01 and 0.2 million/mL were identified as negative in 96% of samples. Trial participants noted the overall ease of using the test with respect to sample preparation, test timing, and result interpretation, and that they could accurately use this test at home without difficulty.

Conclusion(S)

Participants undergoing spermatogenesis suppression in a hormonal male contraceptive trial performed user-controlled test to determine whether their semen sperm concentration was ≤ or > 0.2 million/mL. Compared with standard semen analyses, participants correctly identified 100% of samples with sperm counts > 0.2 million/mL as positive (Sensitivity 100%). A positive result when the couple is using a male contraceptive method triggers the need for semen analysis by a laboratory while the couple uses another method of contraception. Participants correctly diagnosed samples ≤ 0.2 million sperm/mL as negative in 99% of samples (specificity 99%). A negative result indicates a sperm concentration ≤ 0.2 million/mL, well below the threshold of ≤ 1 million/mL offering contraceptive efficacy demonstrated by prior studies. At-home sperm concentration test would minimize the need for users to return to the clinic to monitor suppression of spermatogenesis, decreasing cost and burden of male contraception trials and increasing practicality of the method.

### An evaluation of the effects of long-term cell phone use on the testes via light and electron microscope analysis [^117AFi99]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether the low-intensity electromagnetic waves transmitted by cell phones cause histopathological or ultrastructural changes in the testes of rats.

Materials and Methods

Wistar-Kyoto male rats were placed into either a control group or a group that was exposed to an electromagnetic field (EMF). Two cell phones with Specific Absorbation Rate values of 1.58 were placed and left off in cages that housed 15 rats included in the control group, and four cell phones were placed and left on in cages that housed 30 rats included in the experimental group. After 3 months, weights, seminiferous tubule diameters, and spermatogenic cell conditions of all testes of the rats were evaluated. One half of each testis was examined also under an electron microscope.

Results

No significant differences were observed between the testis weights, seminiferous tubule diameters, and histopathological evaluations between rats that had and had not been exposed to EMF. Electron microscope analysis revealed that the membrana propria thickness and the collagen fiber contents were increased and the capillary veins extended in the experimental group. Common vacuolization in the cytoplasm of the Sertoli cells, growth of electron-dense structures, and existence of large lipid droplets were noted as the remarkable findings of this study.

Conclusion

Although the cells that had been exposed to long-term, low-dose EMF did not present any findings that were contrary to the control conditions, the changes observed during ultrastructural examination gave the impression that significant changes may occur if the study period were to be extended. Longer studies are needed to better understand the effects of EMFs on testis tissue.

PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane library, Web of Science, Scopus databases were searched to collect clinical studies related to the effects of obesity and diabetes on male sperm from inception to on 1st February 2021. Statistical meta-analyses were performed using the RevMan 5.4 software. Stata16 software was used to detect publication bias. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the Ottawa-Newcastle scale using a star-based system.

Results

A total of 44 studies were finally included in the present study, which enrolled 20,367 obese patients and 1386 patients with diabetes. The meta-analysis results showed that both obesity and diabetes were associated with reduced semen volume (obese versus non-obese controls: mean difference (MD) = - 0.25, 95% CI = (- 0.33, - 0.16), p < 0.001; diabetes versus non-diabetic controls: MD = - 0.45, 95% CI = (- 0.63, - 0.27), p < 0.001), reduced sperm count (obese versus non-obese controls: MD = - 23.84, 95% CI = (- 30.36, - 17.33), p < 0.001; diabetes versus non-diabetic controls: MD = - 13.12, 95% CI = (- 18.43, - 7.82), p < 0.001), reduced sperm concentration (obese versus non-obese controls: MD = - 7.26, 95% CI = (- 10.07, - 4.46), p < 0.001; diabetes versus non-diabetic controls: MD = - 11.73, 95% CI = (- 21.44, - 2.01), p = 0.02), reduced progressive motility (obese versus non-obese controls: MD = - 5.68, 95% CI = (- 8.79, - 2.56), p < 0.001; diabetes versus non-diabetic controls: MD = - 14.37, 95% CI = (- 21.79, - 6.96), p = 0.001), and decreased testosterone levels (obese versus non-obese controls: MD = - 1.11, 95% CI = (- 1.92, - 0.30), p = 0.007; diabetes versus non-diabetic controls: MD = - 0.37, 95% CI = (- 0.63, - 0.12), p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that obesity and diabetes negatively affect sperm parameters in men and are associated with low testosterone levels. Due to the limitation of the number and quality of included studies, the above conclusions need to be verified by more high-quality studies.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116MWjhJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — serum testosterone (T) monitoring and targets across formulations — calls for evaluating the patient 3–12 mo after treatment initiation and then annually, and to monitor T concentrations 3–6 mo after initiation with therapy aiming to raise serum T concentrations into the mid-normal range; for injectable T enanthate or cypionate, measure midway between injections and adjust dose or frequency if mid-interval T is > 600 ng/dL (24.5 nmol/L) or < 350 ng/dL (14.1 nmol/L); for transdermal gels, assess 2–8 h after application after at least 1 wk on treatment; for transdermal patches, assess 3–12 h after application; for buccal T bioadhesive tablet, assess concentrations immediately before or after application of a fresh system; for T pellets, measure at the end of the dosing interval and adjust the number of pellets and/or the dosing interval to maintain serum T in the midnormal range; for oral T undecanoate, monitor 3–5 h after ingestion with a fat-containing meal; for injectable T undecanoate, measure at the end of the dosing interval just prior to the next injection and aim to achieve nadir levels in low-mid range.

### Association of diabetes and obesity with sperm parameters and testosterone levels: a meta-analysis [^116gmAoY]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

The results of this study show that both obesity and diabetes can reduce semen volume, reduce sperm count, reduce sperm concentration, reduce progressive motility, and decrease testosterone levels. Pergialiotis et al.'s meta-study on diabetes also showed the same results, but some statistical data were wrong in this study. For example, Handelsman et al. sued Mean ± SEM to present the data, while the authors did not convert the data and directly integrated the results into Mean ± SD for analysis. A meta-analysis by Pergialiotis et al. showed that diabetes seems to decrease the seminal volume and the percentage of motile cells, and increase the follicle-stimulating hormone values of men who were screened for infertility; while diabetes also influenced the total sperm count, the percentage of normal sperm morphology, or luteinizing Hormone and testosterone values. A meta-analysis by Sermondade et al. showed that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased prevalence of azoospermia or oligozoospermia. Wang et al. selected ordinary obese men rather than infertile patients to conduct a meta-analysis, and the results showed that obesity had no effect on sperm concentration and percentage of normal sperm morphology, but decreased semen volume, total sperm number, percentage of forward progression and percentage of viability, suggesting that obesity affects semen quality to a certain extent, and maintaining normal weight may be one of the effective ways to improve male fertility. The present further included the most updated studies to perform the meta-analysis and demonstrated that obesity and diabetes could both influence the sperm parameters.

The limitations of this systematic evaluation were as follows: (1) The types of people with diabetes included were different, some were type 1 diabetes and some were type 2 diabetes; (2) The large difference in the sample size of the included studies may cause some heterogeneity; (3) Only English literature was included in this study, which may affect the extrapolation of the results; (4) Some studies did not describe whether continuous cases were included or not, and none of the included studies described whether blind method was used.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^112s3jD7]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Statement 8.4 — fertility counseling for nonbinary individuals — We recommend health care professionals provide information to nonbinary people about the effects of hormonal therapies/surgery on future fertility and discuss the options for fertility preservation prior to starting hormonal treatment or undergoing surgery. All nonbinary individuals who seek gender-affirming hormonal therapies should be offered information and guidance about fertility options, and it is important to discuss the potential impact of hormone therapy on fertility prior to initiation, including fertility preservation options, whether fertility may or may not be regained if hormone therapy is ceased, and that hormone therapy per se is not birth control. Any gender diverse individual should be offered information on current options and techniques for fertility preservation, ideally prior to commencing hormonal treatment, as the quality of the sperm or eggs may be impacted by exposure to hormones; however, this should in no way preclude making inquiries and seeking more information at a later time, as there is evidence that fertility is still possible for individuals taking estrogen and testosterone. A decision by a nonbinary or gender diverse person that fertility preservation or counseling is not needed should not be used as a basis for denying or delaying access to hormonal treatment.

### Anti-TNF agents and potential effects on male fertility: are men being counseled? [^113S2PCA]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade has revolutionized the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as inflammatory joint and bowel disease, helping to reduce disease-associated morbidity and mortality. However, the impact of these agents on male fertility is unclear based on the limited current literature. While the role of TNF in male spermatogenesis is still under investigation, the basic science literature suggests TNF plays critical role in spermatogenesis and maintaining the blood-testis barrier. TNF is produced by germ cells and acts as a paracrine cytokine, binding to both Sertoli and Leydig cells. Suominen et al. demonstrated that TNF is important in regulating germ cell apoptosis by promoting germ cell survival, which is blocked by infliximab (a TNF antagonist). Furthermore, sperm production was found to be reduced by 54% in a TNF-related-to-apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) deficient mouse model in whom TNF signaling is impaired. While TNF is integral to spermatogenesis, if unregulated, high levels of TNF can also be detrimental by leading to testicular inflammation. Therefore, maintaining an adequate equilibrium is essential.

The effect of TNF blockade on human fertility is poorly understood. While two small studies have shown no deleterious effect of anti-TNF agents on semen quality, spermatogenesis, production of anti-sperm antibodies, and testosterone levels, others have demonstrated increased risk for asthenospermia (decreased sperm motility) and impaired sperm morphology. In the rheumatology literature, concern has been raised of cases where sperm counts were significantly reduced following initiation of an anti-TNF agent. Despite the "very low level of evidence" for the effects of anti-TNF agents on male fertility, a review of drug effects on male fertility by Semet et al. states that sperm cryopreservation and discontinuation of treatment for fertility concerns is not necessary for males initiating anti-TNF therapy.

Given the discordant research regarding specific reproductive effects, our objective was to ascertain if men prescribed anti-TNF agents are being: (1) counseled regarding potential for adverse reproductive effects; (2) screened for anatomic or laboratory abnormalities associated with infertility; and (3) electing for sperm cryopreservation.

### Obesity and reproduction: a committee opinion [^116NsjQf]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Weight loss and male reproductive hormones and sexual function — prospective data: A diet-induced weight loss study in 118 overweight (N = 32) and obese (N = 86) men tracked testosterone and self-reported sexual function via the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) during a 12-week weight loss period followed by 40 weeks of maintenance; the total testosterone level increased and the IIEF improved during acute weight loss, with continued increases in total and free testosterone during maintenance while IIEF remained stable. Regarding spermatogenesis, evidence is less definitive; one study followed 43 men with short-term follow-up at 14 weeks after diet and exercise weight loss, and men with the largest degree of weight loss showed the most significant increases in sperm count and normal morphology.

### Cannabis and male fertility: a systematic review [^116t45ZW]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

With cannabis consumption on the rise and use prominent among males of reproductive age it is essential to understand the potential impact of cannabis on male fertility. We reviewed the literature regarding the effects of cannabis on male fertility.

Materials and Methods

We performed a literature search using PubMed®/MEDLINE® to identify relevant studies of the effects of cannabis on male fertility. Relevant studies were identified and reviewed.

Results

The strongest evidence of cannabis induced alterations in male fertility is in the category of semen parameters. Research supports a role for cannabis in reducing sperm count and concentration, inducing abnormalities in sperm morphology, reducing sperm motility and viability, and inhibiting capacitation and fertilizing capacity. Animal models demonstrate a role for cannabis in testicular atrophy, and reduced libido and sexual function but to our knowledge these results have not yet been replicated in human studies. Studies of hormonal changes suggest inconclusive effects on testosterone levels, lowered luteinizing hormone levels and unchanged follicle-stimulating hormone levels.

Conclusions

Current research suggests that cannabis may negatively impact male fertility. Further studies are needed to validate that robust findings in animal models will carry over into human experience. Clinicians should be aware of these potential effects when prescribing medical marijuana therapies to men of reproductive age, and they should consider the degree of cannabis use as a possible component of a complete male infertility workup.

### Zika virus disrupts steroidogenesis and impairs spermatogenesis by stalling the translation of CYP17A1 mRNA [^115kZQ1B]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In the testicular tissue, various cells, including Germ cells (GCs), Sertoli cells (SCs), Leydig cells (LCs), and peritubular-myoid cells (MCs), are susceptible to ZIKV infection. Given that LCs serve as the primary site for the synthesis and secretion of male sex hormones, particularly testosterone, ZIKV infection of LCs may potentially be a crucial factor in reducing testosterone levels. Testosterone plays a pivotal role in sustaining spermatogenesis and fertility. Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. The seminiferous tubules are composed of two major cell types: SCs and GCs. GCs are reproductive cells that develop into sperm, while SCs provide the nutritional and structural support to GCs, facilitating their maturation. Within the seminiferous tubules, only SCs have receptors for testosterone. GCs do not express androgen receptors (AR). Consequently, testosterone produced by LCs diffuses into the seminiferous tubules and regulates the expression of proteins involved in spermatogenesis through its action on SCs, thus maintaining normal sperm production. Sperm then mature and are stored in the epididymis, where high testosterone levels are vital for supporting sperm maturation. Thus, maintaining normal testosterone levels is crucial for the entire spermatogenic process. For instance, withdrawal of testosterone in the testis leads to a substantial decline in sperm production –. Spermatogenesis is also regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. ZIKV infection in male suckling mice has been shown to cause long-term disruptions to the HPG axisand, ultimately, fertility. However, ZIKV-induced functional abnormalities in HPG axis have not been observed in adult mice or human patients. Thus, our hypothesis posits a strong correlation between ZIKV infection of LCs and the resultant decline in testosterone levels and sperm counts.

### Dutasteride [^114pyabc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Effect on Semen Characteristics

The effects of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in healthy men throughout 52 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. At 52 weeks, compared with placebo, dutasteride treatment resulted in mean reduction in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility; the effects on total sperm count were not reversible after 24 weeks of follow-up. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected and mean values for all semen parameters remained within the normal range at all timepoints. The clinical significance of the effect of dutasteride on semen characteristics for an individual patient's fertility is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

### Comparing remote smartphone-based semen assessments with laboratory evaluations in men unselected for fertility concerns [^1148ZXNm]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the quality of remote semen collection and a smartphone-based semen analysis system under real-world conditions compared to a laboratory assessment among participants who were unselected for fertility status.

Design

Prospective study SUBJECTS: 150 men unselected for fertility status who participated in the Reproductive Effects of Chemicals and Air Pollution (RECAP) study.

Exposure

Participants performed remote smartphone-based semen analysis and sent samples to a fertility center laboratory.

Main Outcome Measures

Agreement of sperm concentration and motility using a smartphone-based analyzer and delayed evaluation in the andrology laboratory.

Results

Of 150 men who provided a semen sample analyzed remotely or at the laboratory, 92 participants had both usable smartphone and delayed Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) results. The median time (IQR) between semen collection and delayed laboratory assessment was 29.9 (26.5, 32.3) hours. The median sperm concentration was 83.0 million/ml by smartphone and 50.7 million/mL by delayed CASA assessment. The median total motility was 36.5% by smartphone and 4.5% by delayed laboratory assessment. Bland-Altman plots comparing the smartphone analyzer to delayed laboratory assessment for sperm concentration and total sperm count suggest that differences between the two methods were higher as sperm concentration increased. Smartphone-based measures were highly reproducible for concentration (ICC = 0.98) and motility (ICC = 0.90). Smartphone-based systems had high specificity (86.2%) and negative predictive value (93.8%) for identifying men with low sperm concentration (< 16 million/ml, n = 5) by laboratory assessment. There was a suggestion that sperm motility based on the smartphone assessment was inversely associated with the probability of having no motile sperm in the delayed laboratory assessment.

Conclusion

Smartphone-based systems are a comparable option to a single laboratory-based CASA measurement and have logistical advantages for research studies and potentially as a clinical screening tool among men in the general population. Further studies are warranted to confirm their effectiveness and broader utility.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part I [^116FoRmr]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Lifestyle factors and relationships between infertility and general health — counseling and risk communication: Clinicians should counsel infertile men or men with abnormal semen parameters of the health risks associated with abnormal sperm production (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B), and infertile men with specific, identifiable causes of male infertility should be informed of relevant, associated health conditions (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should advise couples with advanced paternal age (≥ 40) that there is an increased risk of adverse health outcomes for their offspring (Expert Opinion), and clinicians may discuss risk factors (i.e., lifestyle, medication usage, environmental exposures) associated with male infertility with counseling that current data on the majority of risk factors are limited (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Over 50% of the time, the cause of a man's infertility can be attributed to one of several conditions many of which have health implications beyond fertility; genetic counseling may be considered for couples with advanced paternal age to discuss the low absolute risk (but high relative risk) of increased paternal age on at least certain genetic risks; ongoing use of anabolic steroids suppresses spermatogenesis and interferes with fertility; and it is recommended that if there is concern about a medication's influence on fertility, clinicians may consult reviews or databases on reproductive effects of medications for additional information.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^115JsMqc]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Frequency of intercourse — effects of abstinence duration on semen parameters: Whereas abstinence intervals greater than 5 days may adversely affect sperm counts, abstinence intervals as short as 2 days are associated with normal sperm densities. A widely held misconception is that frequent ejaculations decrease male fertility. In men with normal semen quality, sperm concentrations and motility remained normal, even with daily ejaculation, and in men with oligozoospermia, sperm concentration and motility may be highest with daily ejaculation. After longer abstinence intervals of 10 days or more, semen parameters begin to deteriorate.

### Should home-based ovulation predictor kits be offered as an additional approach for fertility management for women and couples desiring pregnancy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112N8tmw]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Methods

We conducted this systematic review in accordance to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Research question and inclusion criteria

Should home-based OPKs be made available as an additional approach for fertility management?

Population: Women attempting to become pregnant.

Intervention: Fertility management that includes home-based OPKs.

Comparison: Fertility management that does not include home-based OPKs (clinician-led assessment of ovulation only or no ovulation prediction).

Outcomes: (1) Time-to-pregnancy; (2) Pregnancy; (3) Live birth; (4) Stress/anxiety; (5) Social harms/adverse events (eg, device-related issues, coercion, violence [eg, intimate-partner violence, violence from family members or community members], psychosocial harm, self-harm, suicide, stigma, discrimination).

To be included in the effectiveness (PICO) review, an article had to (1) have a comparative study design examining women who managed their fertility using home-based OPKs to women who did not manage their fertility using home-based OPKs (ie, clinician-led assessment only or no ovulation prediction), (2) evaluate one or more of the outcomes listed above and (3) be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Inclusion was not restricted by location of the intervention. No language or publication date restrictions were used in the search.

OPKs could include both urine-based and serum-based kits and any modality (stick, monitor, digital, electronic slip that connects to a phone and so on). In order to focus on OPKs as a specific biomedical and biochemical intervention, the other behavioural and non-biochemical methods of ovulation prediction, such as calendar/standard day/fertility awareness methods, basal body temperature monitoring, Billings/cervical mucus monitoring methods, use of fertility beads and so on, were not included.

### Cryostorage of reproductive tissues in the in vitro fertilization laboratory: a committee opinion [^113c37Xb]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Cryostorage tank alarms — electronic monitoring, probe selection, backup power, and testing frequency are detailed: All storage tanks must be electronically monitored with probes that will sense a rise in temperature and/or a decrease in LN2 levels, and these monitoring systems should be associated with a remote alarm system that will immediately notify laboratory personnel when critical values are reached; all laboratories should have a clearly written response plan and phone tree for all alarms during both working and non-working hours. Monitoring probes should be located in the tank so that an alarm trigger will provide sufficient time for personnel to respond before samples are compromised, and level probes suspended in LN2 are recommended over temperature probes suspended in vapor because laboratories that monitor only temperature may have a delayed and shortened response time if there is a vacuum failure; tanks with intact high-pressure vacuums can maintain adequate temperatures even with extremely low LN2 levels. Alarm systems should be able to operate in cases of power failure by being plugged into a backup generator or an uninterruptible power supply battery, or should be cloud based, and the monitoring system should be tested on a frequent basis; at a minimum, quarterly.

### Testosterone (testim) [^116NRKdY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis

With large doses of exogenous androgens, including TESTIM, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count.

5.9 Hepatic Adverse Effects

Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. TESTIM is not known to cause these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue TESTIM while the cause is evaluated.

5.10 Edema

Androgens, including TESTIM, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required.

5.11 Gynecomastia

Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.12 Sleep Apnea

The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases.

5.13 Lipid Changes

Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy and after dose increases.

5.14 Hypercalcemia

Androgens, including TESTIM, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients.

5.15 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin

Androgens, including TESTIM, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.

5.16 Flammability

Alcohol-based products, including TESTIM, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid fire, flame or smoking until the TESTIM has dried.

The clinical significance of sperm DNA damage lies in its association with natural conception rates and also might have a serious consequence on developmental outcome of the newborn. The aim of the present study is to determine whether stress and everyday life factors are associated with sperm DNA damage in adult men. The study population consisted of 286 men who attended the infertility clinic for diagnostic purposes and who had normal semen concentration of 20–300mml(-1) or with slight oligozoospermia (semen concentration of 15–20mml(-1)) (WHO, 1999). Participants were interviewed and provided a semen sample. The sperm chromatin structure assay was assessed using flow cytometry. In the present study, we found evidence for a relationship between sperm DNA damage parameters and everyday life factors. High and medium level of occupational stress and age increase DNA fragmentation index (P = 0.03, P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively). Other lifestyle factors that were positively associated with percentage of immature sperms (high DNA stainability index) included: obesity and cell phone use for more than 10 years (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively). Our findings indicate that stress and lifestyle factor may affect sperm DNA damage. Data from the present study showed a significant effect of age, obesity, mobile phone radiation and occupational stress on sperm DNA damage. As DNA fragmentation represents an extremely important parameter indicative of infertility and potential outcome of assisted reproduction treatment, and most of the lifestyle factors are easily modifiable, the information about factors that may affect DNA damage are important.

### A randomized trial of web-based fertility-tracking software and fecundability [^112c23RZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of randomization to FertilityFriend.com, a mobile computing fertility-tracking app, on fecundability.

Design

Parallel non-blinded randomized controlled trial nested within the Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), a North American preconception cohort.

Patient(S)

Female participants aged 21 to 45 years attempting conception for ≤ 6 menstrual cycles at enrolment (2013–2019).

Intervention

Randomization (1:1) of 5532 participants to receive a premium Fertility Friend (FF) subscription.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Fecundability (per-cycle probability of conception). Participants completed bimonthly follow-up questionnaires until pregnancy or a censoring event, whichever came first. We first performed an intent-to-treat analysis of the effect of FF randomization on fecundability. In secondary analyses, we used a per-protocol approach that accounted for adherence in each trial arm. In both analyses, we used proportional probabilities regression models to estimate fecundability ratios (FR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing those randomized vs. not randomized and applied inverse probability weights to account for loss-to-follow-up (intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses) and adherence (per-protocol analyses only).

Results

Using life-table methods, 64% of the 2775 participants randomized to FF and 63% of the 2767 participants not randomized to FF conceived during 12 cycles; these respective percentages were each 70% among those with 0–1 cycles of attempt time at enrolment. Of those randomized to FF, 72% were defined as adherent (68% of observed menstrual cycles). In intent-to-treat analyses, there was no appreciable association overall (FR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90–1.04) or within strata of pregnancy attempt time at enrolment, age, education, or other characteristics. In per-protocol analyses, we observed little association overall (FR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99–1.14), but weak-to-moderate positive associations among participants who had longer attempt times at enrolment (FR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98–1.35 for 3–4 cycles; FR = 1.14; 95% CI, 0.87–1.48 for 5–6 cycles), were aged < 25 years (FR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01–1.66), had ≤ 12 years of education (FR = 1.32; 95% CI, 0.92–1.89), or were non-users of hormonal contraception within 3 months before enrolment (FR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02–1.19).

Conclusion

No appreciable associations were observed in intent-to-treat analyses. In secondary per-protocol analyses that accounted for adherence, randomization to FF was associated with slightly greater fecundability among selected subgroups of participants; however, these results are susceptible to unmeasured confounding.

### Testosterone (testim) [^111RUwZv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

TESTIM is contraindicated in pregnant women. Testosterone is teratogenic and may cause fetal harm based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Exposure of a female fetus to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization. In animal development studies, exposure to testosterone in utero resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring and structural impairments of reproductive tissues in female and male offspring. These studies did not meet current standards for nonclinical development toxicity studies.

Data

Animal Data

In developmental studies conducted in rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus monkeys, pregnant animals received intramuscular injection of testosterone during the period of organogenesis. Testosterone treatment at doses that were comparable to those used for testosterone replacement therapy resulted in structural impairments in both female and male offspring. Structural impairments observed in females included increased anogenital distance, phallus development, empty scrotum, no external vagina, intrauterine growth retardation, reduced ovarian reserve, and increased ovarian follicular recruitment. Structural impairments seen in male offspring included increased testicular weight, larger seminal tubular lumen diameter, and higher frequency of occluded tubule lumen. Increased pituitary weight was seen in both sexes.

Testosterone exposure in utero also resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring. Hypertension was observed in pregnant female rats and their offspring exposed to doses approximately twice those used for testosterone replacement therapy.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

TESTIM is not indicated for use in females.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

During treatment with large doses of exogenous androgens, including TESTIM, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)], possible leading to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. Reduced fertility is observed in some men taking testosterone replacement therapy. Testicular atrophy, subfertility, and infertility have also been reported in men who abuse anabolic androgenic steroids [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. With either type of use, the impact on fertility may be irreversible.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of TESTIM in pediatric patients less than 18 years old have not been established. Improper use may result in acceleration of bone age and premature closure of epiphyses.

8.5 Geriatric Use

There is insufficient long-term safety data in geriatric patients to assess the potentially increased risks of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Steroid hormones for contraception in men [^112u4Zsd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Male hormonal contraception has been an elusive goal. Administration of sex steroids to men can shut off sperm production through effects on the pituitary and hypothalamus. However, this approach also decreases production of testosterone, so 'add-back' therapy is needed.

Objectives

To summarize all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of male hormonal contraception.

Search Methods

In January and February 2012, we searched the computerized databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, POPLINE, and LILACS. We also searched for recent trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. Previous searches included EMBASE. We wrote to authors of identified trials to seek additional unpublished or published trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs that compared a steroid hormone with another contraceptive. We excluded non-steroidal male contraceptives, such as gossypol. We included both placebo and active-regimen control groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome measure was the absence of spermatozoa on semen examination, often called azoospermia. Data were insufficient to examine pregnancy rates and side effects.

Main Results

We found 33 trials that met our inclusion criteria. The proportion of men who reportedly achieved azoospermia or had no detectable sperm varied widely. A few important differences emerged. 1) Levonorgestrel implants (160 μg daily) combined with injectable testosterone enanthate (TE) were more effective than levonorgestrel 125 µg daily combined with testosterone patches. 2) Levonorgestrel 500 μg daily improved the effectiveness of TE 100 mg injected weekly. 3) Levonorgestrel 250 μg daily improved the effectiveness of testosterone undecanoate (TU) 1000 mg injection plus TU 500 mg injected at 6 and 12 weeks. 4) Desogestrel 150 μg was less effective than desogestrel 300 μg (with testosterone pellets). 5) TU 500 mg was less likely to produce azoospermia than TU 1000 mg (with levonorgestrel implants). 6) Norethisterone enanthate 200 mg with TU 1000 mg led to more azoospermia when given every 8 weeks versus 12 weeks. 7) Four implants of 7-alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) were more effective than two MENT implants. We did not conduct any meta-analysis due to intervention differences. Several trials showed promising efficacy in percentages with azoospermia. Three examined desogestrel and testosterone preparations or etonogestrel and testosterone, and two examined levonorgestrel and testosterone.

Authors' Conclusions

No male hormonal contraceptive is ready for clinical use. Most trials were small exploratory studies. Their power to detect important differences was limited and their results imprecise. In addition, assessment of azoospermia can vary by sensitivity of the method used. Future trials need more attention to the methodological requirements for RCTs. More trials with adequate power would also be helpful.
