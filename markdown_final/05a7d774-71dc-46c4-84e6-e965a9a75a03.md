## Question

incidence of duplicated IVC

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the incidence of duplicated inferior vena cava (IVC) and a synthesis of the evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "duplicated IVC" precisely means embryologically and how it differs from other caval variants. Then, I should identify the highest-quality prevalence data and compare it with ranges reported in imaging reviews and older series. Next, I will reconcile variability across study types and clarify the misuse of "incidence" versus "prevalence". Finally, I should translate this into practical clinical implications and present a concise bottom line with appropriate confidence intervals and ranges, which I will verify against the 2019 meta-analysis and contemporary imaging summaries [^116vWmyT] [^116fDcZb].

> Let me first confirm the anomaly definition so I do not conflate it with a left-sided IVC. Duplicated IVC results from persistence of the left supracardinal vein such that two infrarenal caval channels ascend on either side, with the left usually joining the left renal vein before crossing to the orthotopic suprarenal IVC; this is distinct from a solitary left-sided IVC where the right infrarenal segment regresses and only the left persists [^113rimrR] [^116fDcZb].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy before quoting numbers. Hold on, I should verify the availability of pooled estimates. The most rigorous source is a 2019 meta-analysis pooling 39 studies that specifically estimated duplication prevalence, and it also examined detection-method effects; imaging reviews provide broader ranges that reflect heterogeneity across cadaveric, surgical, and radiologic series [^116vWmyT] [^116fDcZb].

> Wait, let me verify the exact pooled prevalence and its precision. The 2019 meta-analysis reports an overall duplication prevalence of 0.7% with a 95% confidence interval of 0.5%–0.9%, and importantly shows higher detection in anatomic (cadaveric) studies than in imaging or surgical cohorts, explaining part of the spread seen across the literature [^116vWmyT]. Supporting reviews commonly cite a broader literature range of approximately 0.2%–3.0%, with some older or selective series stating figures such as "up to 2.8%", which align with the upper tail of anatomic reports and special populations [^116fDcZb] [^113FAARE] [^116KRMK8].

> Hmm, wait a minute — are we being asked for incidence or prevalence? I should double-check the terminology. For a congenital venous variant, "prevalence" in imaged or dissected populations is the correct measure; "incidence" (new cases over time) is not typically applicable to a fixed developmental anomaly. So while the question says incidence, the answer should explicitly report prevalence estimates derived from pooled observational data and imaging surveys, with the 0.7% pooled prevalence being the most defensible figure to cite [^116vWmyT] [^116TQo4S].

> Let me consider why numbers vary so much across studies, so I do not overgeneralize. Detection method matters: cadaveric series tend to find more variants than routine clinical imaging, and modalities differ in sensitivity; ultrasound may miss a duplicated segment, whereas CT or MR venography delineate paired infrarenal channels and their confluence reliably. I should confirm that CT and MR are preferred for characterization and preprocedural planning, which the imaging literature supports, and that multidetector CT can depict complex venous anatomy and interiliac communications when duplication is suspected [^116vWmyT] [^116fDcZb] [^114sGdWh].

> I will now examine the clinical consequences briefly, because prevalence alone is not the whole story. Duplicated IVC is usually asymptomatic but is procedurally consequential: for IVC filters, bilateral infrarenal filters or selective strategies may be required; unrecognized duplication risks incomplete protection or complications, and case literature documents safe outcomes when anatomy is recognized in advance. Similarly, retroperitoneal and aortic surgery, nephrectomy, and oncologic venous thrombectomy require anticipatory planning to avoid hemorrhage or missed thrombus, and duplication can be mistaken for nodal disease on imaging if its tubular continuity is overlooked [^116KRMK8] [^114qZm6y] [^1158sVps] [^116fDcZb].

> But wait, what if duplication predisposes to thrombosis and inflates detection in VTE cohorts? I should acknowledge that although duplication itself is not uniformly thrombogenic, case series and reports describe DVT in the setting of duplicated systems or associated compression phenomena, underscoring the need to map both channels when managing iliofemoral thrombosis or planning endovascular therapy [^116NRWdg] [^115F8Xgd].

> Synthesis time — let me ensure internal consistency. The best single estimate for duplicated IVC in unselected populations is a pooled prevalence of 0.7% with 95% CI 0.5%–0.9%, with a method-dependent literature range of about 0.2%–3.0% reflecting greater detection in anatomic series and variability in imaging sensitivity. Clinically, most individuals are asymptomatic, but recognition materially affects filter strategy, venous interventions, and retroperitoneal surgery, so cross-sectional venography with CT or MR is the modality of choice when this variant is suspected or its presence would alter management [^116vWmyT] [^116fDcZb] [^113FAARE].

---

The incidence of duplicated inferior vena cava (IVC) is approximately 0.2–3% [^116fDcZb] [^113FAARE] in the general population, with a pooled prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI 0.5–0.9%) per meta-analysis [^116vWmyT]. Most cases are asymptomatic and detected incidentally on imaging [^116TQo4S]; however, recognition is essential for surgical and interventional planning to avoid complications [^112Q3oVw] [^114At6HV].

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^116fDcZb]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Anatomical variants of the inferior vena cava (IVC) primarily result from abnormal regression or persistence of embryological veins. Although most anomalies are asymptomatic incidental findings, they can cause lower extremity venous insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, and affect the planning of vascular procedures. The most common anomalies include duplicated IVC, left-sided IVC, and interruption of the IVC.

- **Duplicated IVC**: A duplicated IVC is formed by an abnormal persisting left supracardinal vein, resulting in duplicated infrarenal IVC segments (Fig. 3). This variant has a prevalence of 0.2–3%. The common iliac veins typically drain to their respective sides, with the left infrarenal IVC joining the left renal vein, which in turn crosses to join the orthotopic suprarenal IVC. Some studies subclassify this anomaly by differences in the caliber of the duplicated infrarenal IVC segments. In addition, a bridging vein may connect the common iliac veins at the inferior origin of the duplicated IVC (Fig. 4). Rarely, the duplicated segment can continue as the hemiazygos vein and drain directly into the superior vena cava. Case reports of association with retrocaval ureters, horseshoe kidneys, and malrotation of the gut have been described. In this review, we present a rarely described case of duplicated IVC and crossed renal ectopia with both renal veins draining into the orthotopic IVC (Fig. 5). A duplicated IVC can also be mistaken for adenopathy or lymph nodes if its tubular nature is not recognized. Lastly, if this anomaly is not recognized, it can affect procedures, leading to potential complications.

### Inferior vena cava anomalies and variations: Imaging and rare clinical findings [^114At6HV]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to summarize imaging findings of some frequent and infrequent inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies and variations.

IVC anomalies should be suspected in patients presenting with pulmonary emboli, chronic pain, and deep vein thrombosis. Correctly characterizing and classifying IVC anomalies and variations is crucial for proper planning of surgical interventions and avoiding serious complications.

- **Key points**:
	- IVC anomalies should be suspected in patients with pulmonary emboli, pain, and venous thrombosis.
	- Awareness of IVC anomalies and variations is crucial for clinical and surgical procedures.
	- Unawareness of these anomalies may lead to severe and deadly complications.

### Duplication and transposition of inferior vena cava: A meta-analysis of prevalence [^116vWmyT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The primary aim of this article was to establish the actual prevalence of transposition and duplication of the inferior vena cava and to increase awareness about them.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis of prevalence was conducted of cases obtained from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases.

- **Results**: A total of 48 studies contained data that allowed us to estimate the prevalence of these variants (39 for duplication and 32 for transposition). The overall prevalence of duplication was 0.7%, with a 95% confidence interval between 0.5% and 0.9%; for transposition, the prevalence was 0.3%, with a 95% confidence interval between 0.2% and 0.5%. The publication bias was minimal. Duplication prevalence was significantly higher in anatomy studies compared with imaging and surgery studies; for transposition, there were no statistically significant differences by detection technique.

- **Conclusions**: The overall prevalence of duplication of the inferior vena cava is 0.7%; for transposition, it is 0.3%. Even if they are obviously rare conditions, their presence must be suspected by practitioners as they can have important clinical consequences, may require changes in the surgery protocol, or can be associated with other congenital abnormalities.

### Dual inferior vena cava: Two inferior vena cava filters [^117RgmF1]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The formation of the venous drainage system of the human body is a complex process involving structures forming and regressing in a predefined order. Interruption of any one of these steps results in the formation of a congenital anomaly. Knowledge of these anomalies can prevent us from potential serious and sometimes fatal complications. Variations from the normal anatomy of the inferior vena cava (IVC) occur in 3% of the population.

The complex embryology of the IVC stems from three pairs of fetal veins: (1) posterior cardinal veins, (2) subcardinal veins, and (3) supracardinal veins. The cardinal veins constitute the main venous drainage system of the embryo. Although venous anomalies are rare, their knowledge is crucial in diagnosis and treatment. These variations should not be mistaken for pathologic findings, but should be viewed as normal findings of abnormal embryogenesis. We present a case here identifying a dual IVC, subsequently leading us to place two IVC filters.

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: a rare case report [^115sgKKz]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Wilms tumor is the most common renal tumor of childhood. Duplication of the inferior vena cava is an uncommon anomaly. In the present study, we present a case of Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication, which has not been reported previously.

- **Case presentation**: A 14-month-old female presented with an enlarging abdominal mass. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated a large mass in the right kidney, duplication of the inferior vena cava below the renal veins, and compression of the right inferior vena cava caused by the enormous mass. A right radical nephrectomy was performed, and the final pathology was consistent with Wilms tumor. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was executed. Computed tomography imaging at three months postoperatively showed the right inferior vena cava played a dominant role, and the left inferior vena cava was not detected clearly. During the follow-up of 18 months, no local recurrence or metastasis has been observed.

- **Conclusion**: It is important to recognize the case of Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication to avoid injury to retroperitoneal venous anomalies and life-threatening hemorrhage during surgery through preoperative computed tomography.

### Duplication of the inferior vena cava in a patient presenting for IVC filter placement [^116KRMK8]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2010). Low credibility.

Given the complex embryogenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC), anatomic variations are commonly encountered. Duplication of the IVC occurs in up to 2.8% of the population. Although asymptomatic, a duplicated IVC has important clinical implications when attempting caval filtration. We present the case of a 45-year-old male with Factor V Leiden and protein C deficiency, who required cessation of warfarin anticoagulation in preparation for cervical laminectomy. The patient had a duplicated IVC and required placement of a caval filter in each IVC.

### Inferior and superior vena cava reconstruction [^113uamhN]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

SVC obstruction is often referred to as "SVC syndrome" in the literature and affects about 15,000 patients in the United States annually. Malignancy is the leading cause of SVC obstruction, accounting for up to 90% of all cases, predominantly due to lung cancer. Benign causes include non-malignant tumor compression, infectious disease, or complications from indwelling intravascular devices. The increased utilization of indwelling catheters and pacemaker/defibrillator leads, in particular, has led to a rise in device-related SVC syndrome. The exact numbers in Europe and worldwide are less well-known; however, the incidence of SVC syndrome reported in the literature ranges approximately from 1 in 650 to 1 in 3100 patients. Due to the lower number of hemodialysis catheters implanted, the incidence of catheter-related SVC obstruction may be lower in Europe, thereby shifting the ratio more towards a malignant etiology. The most common causative tumor entity is bronchial carcinoma, followed by tumors frequently metastasizing to the mediastinum, as well as primary mediastinal tumors, such as thymomas or lymphomas.

In contrast to SVC obstruction, IVC obstruction is infrequently referred to as "IVC syndrome" in the literature, as it is rarely associated with severe complications such as hypotension, tachycardia, end-organ failures, and death. The underlying pathologies leading to IVC obstruction are extremely diverse, making reliable estimates on epidemiology, especially regarding the nature of these obstructions, virtually impossible. While 4–15% of IVC obstructions seem to be…

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^113TCM7d]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the largest vein in the body, responsible for draining blood from the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities. This pictorial review summarizes the normal anatomy and embryological development of the IVC. Additionally, it highlights a wide range of anatomical variants, acquired pathologies, and a common pitfall in imaging of the IVC. This information is essential for clinical decision-making and to reduce misdiagnosis.

### Complete infrahepatic inferior vena cava occlusion presenting as congenital absence [^1116T4Be]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) occlusion may present with a variety of clinical symptoms similar to congenital IVC anomalies. However, correct diagnosis, including the differentiation from congenital absence, is essential. Endovascular therapy for chronic occlusions appears to yield results comparable to those of open repair. We report a case of infrahepatic IVC occlusion that was initially misdiagnosed as congenital absence of the IVC. The IVC occlusion was successfully recanalized and treated with angioplasty and stent placement.

### Repair of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in the presence of a left-sided inferior vena cava [^116uBLaF]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Venous anomalies are frequently encountered during aortoiliac reconstruction due to the complexity of venous system development. Retroaortic left renal veins, duplicate inferior vena cava (IVC), and left-sided IVC are occasionally found. A left-sided IVC has been reported with infrarenal aortic aneurysms. We report a successful repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm in a patient with a left-sided IVC. The embryology and intraoperative management are discussed.

### Abdominal aortic surgery in the presence of inferior vena cava anomalies: A case series [^112Q3oVw]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Left-sided inferior vena cava (LIVC) and duplicated inferior vena cava (DIVC) are rare asymptomatic congenital abnormalities. If unrecognized, these anomalies can cause major injuries and serious life-threatening bleeding complications, especially during abdominal aortic surgery.

- **Methods**: Retrospective data for patients with two major inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies who underwent aortic surgery over a 13-year period were collected. Patient demographics, type of aortic disease and caval anomaly, surgical approach, type of aortic reconstruction associated with the procedure on the caval vein, postoperative complications, and in-hospital mortality were recorded.

- **Results**: There were nine patients with IVC anomalies who underwent aortic surgery. All of them were men, with a median age of 66.2 years. Seven had an LIVC and two had DIVC. Five patients were operated on due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and four due to aortoiliac occlusive disease. In all patients, a midline transperitoneal aortic approach was performed. In five cases, the left IVC had to be temporarily resected and later reconstructed, and in the other four, it was just mobilized. There were no postoperative complications except in one patient who developed deep vein thrombosis in the left calf; this was successfully treated with anticoagulant therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Due to favorable results, low incidence of perioperative complications, and in the absence of other associated abdominal pathologies, we propose the midline transperitoneal approach with mobilization or temporary resection of LIVC as a viable technique.

### Posterior lumbar vein off the retrohepatic inferior vena cava: a novel anatomical variant with surgical implications [^111w9zUp]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

The resection of tumors involving the inferior vena cava requires vascular control of posteriorly draining lumbar veins to ensure a bloodless field. Surgical texts and atlases assert that lumbar veins do not insert into the inferior vena cava superior to the renal hilum. However, at our institution, we have encountered patients undergoing inferior vena cava tumor thrombectomy who have a posterior lumbar vein cephalad to the renal veins. Since this represents an unrecognized source of hemorrhage, we investigated the frequency of a superior lumbar vein in cadaveric dissection.

- **Materials and methods**: Retroperitoneal cadaveric dissection of the inferior vena cava was performed to assess the frequency of a lumbar vein draining into the inferior vena cava cephalad to the renal veins.

- **Results**: Of the 49 cadaveric dissections performed, 19 (38.8%) showed a single posterior lumbar vein between the diaphragm and the renal hilum. Of these 19 cadavers, 15 (78.9%) were male. This vein was located an average ± SD of 7.4 ± 0.6 cm cephalad to the right renal vein, and it was 3.7 ± 1.6 cm in diameter. In all cadavers, this vein inserted within 30 degrees to the left or right of the posterior (also termed dorsal) aspect of the inferior vena cava.

- **Conclusions**: The identification of a lumbar vein between the renal hilum and the diaphragm represents an important anatomical variant that occurs in a significant percentage of individuals. Surgeons will benefit from the knowledge of this variant of inferior vena cava vasculature and should anticipate the presence of this vein to prevent unnecessary morbidity.

### CT appearances of congenital and acquired abnormalities of the superior vena cava [^114htgq1]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

A wide spectrum of congenital and acquired abnormalities can affect the superior vena cava (SVC). Congenital anomalies can present either as incidental findings or be associated with underlying cardiac abnormalities; these include left-sided or double SVCs and anomalous venous drainages. Acquired conditions involving the SVC, including SVC obstruction syndrome, can be secondary to extrinsic compression or intrinsic occlusion. The CT appearances, the incidence, and associations of these conditions are discussed.

### Relationship between the subcostal and right lateral ultrasound views of inferior vena cava collapse: Implications for clinical use of ultrasonography [^117QdcJa]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The collapsibility index of the inferior vena cava is traditionally visualized from the subcostal region in the sagittal plane, referred to here as cIVC SS. Alternatively, the collapsibility index of the inferior vena cava can be visualized from the right midaxillary line in the coronal plane, referred to here as cIVC RC. It is unclear whether values of cIVC RC are comparable with values of cIVC SS because the inferior vena cava collapses asymmetrically into an elliptical form, quantified as the flat ratio of the inferior vena cava (F-IVC). This study aimed to establish if cIVC RC is concordant or discordant to cIVC SS and describe how this concordance or discordance is related to F-IVC.

- **Methods**: This single-center cross-sectional study enrolled 110 spontaneously breathing patients. Values of cIVC RC were compared with cIVC SS. Performance of cIVC RC ≥ 42% in predicting fluid responsiveness, defined as cIVC SS ≥ 42%, was assessed. F-IVC was also correlated to the difference between cIVC SS and cIVC RC.

- **Results**: cIVC RC ≥ 42% was 61.5% sensitive (95% CI, 31.58%-86.14%) and 67.1% specific (95% CI, 55.81%-77.06%) for predicting cIVC SS ≥ 42%. cIVC RC underestimated cIVC SS. The degree of discordance between cIVC RC and cIVC SS was proportional to the value of F-IVC.

- **Conclusions**: cIVC RC and cIVC SS measures are discordant, where cIVC RC underestimates cIVC SS. The degree of discordance is directly proportional to the value of F-IVC. Therefore, we recommend that cIVC RC ≥ 42% be used to rule in, but not to rule out, fluid responsivity.

Thrombosis

IVC thrombosis carries significant morbidity and mortality, with a high risk for pulmonary embolism. Commonly reported causes include anomalous venous anatomy, extraluminal or intraluminal obstruction by malignancy, extension of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and unretrieved IVC filters. Studies indicate that 5–16% of young patients presenting with iliofemoral DVT had IVC anomalies, with most cases attributed to IVC interruption or agenesis, likely secondary to venous stasis from poor collaterals. Up to 4% of patients with lower limb DVT experience IVC thrombosis.

- **Predisposing factors**: Common factors such as malignancy, localized inflammation, and coagulopathy create hypercoagulable states. In addition to malignancy-related hypercoagulability, tumor invasion by renal cell carcinoma is an additional independent risk factor for thrombogenesis.

Extensive venous thrombus can occur secondary to an interrupted IVC with azygos continuation. For example, a 19-year-old man presented with a right lower limb DVT and underwent contrast-enhanced CT to assess the proximal extent of thrombus. He later developed a right ankle ulcer, likely contributed to by post-thrombotic syndrome.

- **Clinical findings**: A coronal CT image in the portal venous phase shows occlusive venous thrombus in the common iliac veins and an adjacent paravertebral collateral vein. Notably, the infrarenal and renal segments of the IVC are absent. Additional imaging revealed the right renal vein draining into a small caliber interrupted inferior vena cava, while an axial CT shows the left renal vein draining into a tortuous collateral pathway.

### Left laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in the presence of a duplicated inferior vena cava with complicated anomalous tributaries by a transmesocolic approach [^111jAJP2]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy should be executed under the fundamental principle of early ligature of the renal artery to prevent the diffusion of cancerous cells. This is crucial in the treatment of large renal tumors contacting the main renal vasculature. The presence of a duplicated inferior vena cava (IVC) with associated aberrant tributaries significantly increases surgical difficulty and the risk of vascular injury. Herein, we describe a transperitoneal left laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for a large hilar left renal tumor in the presence of a duplicated IVC with complicated anomalous tributaries, using a transmesocolic approach.

### Vena cava anomalies in thoracic surgery [^114Akude]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Vena cava anomalies are a rare group of anatomical variations due to incorrect development of the superior or inferior vena cava during fetal life. They generally show no clinical relevance, and diagnosis is often made due to associations with congenital heart diseases in most cases. However, preoperative identification of these anomalies is mandatory for surgeons for proper surgical planning. If not recognized, lethal complications may occur, as reported in the literature.

- **Case presentation**: We report a case series of three different unidentified vena cava anomalies in patients undergoing lung resection. These unrecognized anomalies led to minor complications in two cases and required an accurate intraoperative evaluation in another. A careful retrospective evaluation of preoperative radiological images showed the anomalies.

- **Conclusions**: A careful evaluation of the vena cava anatomy at preoperative imaging is mandatory for thoracic surgeons to properly plan the surgery and avoid complications.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^113NLPre]. Insights into Imaging (2021).

Most studies focus on imaging findings of portal vein tumor thrombus. However, parallels may be drawn when identifying inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus. On CT, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor thrombus demonstrates hepatic vein expansion and arterial enhancement with washout in the portal vein and delayed phases. Catalano et al. have shown that diffusion-weighted imaging may be employed to differentiate bland thrombus from tumor extension, with bland thrombus eliciting higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Patients typically have concomitant liver dysfunction, a poor prognosis, and a high rate of recurrence; therefore, HCC with IVC invasion is considered an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation and is managed non-surgically. However, recent studies have shown that sorafenib, external beam radiotherapy, and surgery with careful patient selection can improve clinical outcomes.

- **Figure 18**:
	- Hepatocellular carcinoma invading the IVC.
	- Coronal multiphase CT images show a 12 x 11 cm necrotic hepatic lesion invading the hepatic and supradiaphragmatic IVC. The thrombus (arrows) demonstrates enhancement in both (a) arterial and (b) portal venous phases, with complete washout in the (c) delayed phase.
	- Axial CT shows near-complete obstruction of the hepatic IVC (arrowhead).
	- Ultrasound (US) abdomen demonstrates a hyperechoic hepatic mass extending into the right hepatic vein and IVC.

### Persistent left superior vena cava: Clinical importance and differential diagnoses [^1138ZwGD]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is the most common thoracic venous anomaly and may be a component of complex cardiac pathologies. While often asymptomatic, it can lead to significant problems such as arrhythmias and cyanosis. Additionally, it can cause serious complications during vascular interventional procedures or surgical treatment of cardiac anomalies (CA). The clinical significance of PLSVC depends on the drainage site and the accompanying CA.

In this article, we will describe the epidemiology, embryology, and anatomic variations of PLSVC. Possible accompanying CA and heterotaxy spectrum will be reviewed with the help of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) images. Radiological pitfalls, differential diagnoses, and the clinical importance of PLSVC will be highlighted.

### Congenital anomalies of the venae cavae: Embryological origin, imaging features and report of three new variants [^111G8VEY]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Due to the complexity of their developmental stages, the venae cavae may undergo a very large number of congenital anomalies. All the possible abnormalities which, to our knowledge, have been observed in the literature are reported. These include abnormalities of the superior vena cava and the azygos system, those of the inferior vena cava, and the complex anomalies that concern the venous system as a whole. Moreover, we present three new variants: a right double inferior vena cava with azygos continuation of the posterior-medial vein; an agenesis of the superior vena cava with drainage through the azygos and hemiazygos veins to the inferior vena cava; and a double inferior vena cava with hemiazygos and azygos continuation of the left one.

### Inferior vena cava anomalies and variations: Imaging and rare clinical findings [^111YscjW]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

- **Figure 3**: Illustration of findings of infrarenal IVC agenesis with collateral pathways, including superficial (epigastric vein, internal mammarian veins, thoracoabdominal veins, lateral thoracic vein, and axillary vein), portal (inferior haemorrhoidal vein [IHV], paraumbilical veins [PUV], inferior mesenteric vein [IMV]), deep (ascending lumbar vein, continuous azygos vein [CA], continuous hemiazygos vein [CHA]), and median collateral pathways (gonadal vein). Key: RA: right atrium; A: aorta; SVC: superior vena cava; RRV and LRV: right and left renal veins, respectively; D: diaphragm.

A persistent left IVC arises from the regression of a right supracardinal vein and the persistence of a left supracardinal vein. In this paper, we present three patients with left IVC and some unique imaging features. Typically, the left IVC meets the LRV, which passes anterior to the aorta in the "N fashion", joining the RV to create a normal right-sided prerenal IVC. In the literature, the prevalence of left IVC is reported to be 0.2%-0.5%.

In the cases we present, a left IVC was draining into the CHA, which eventually joined the CA supradiaphragmatically; the combined CA-CHA was draining into the SVC (Figure 4). This pattern does not align with the common left IVC variations reported in the literature. Haswell et al. reported a left IVC with CHA and accessory CHA that eventually connected to the SVC through the brachiocephalic route. Koç et al. reported a similar variation, but the drainage promptly returned to the CAA and progressed thereafter. In the literature, we were not able to find data regarding similar variations.

### Use of a trellis device for endovascular treatment of venous thrombosis involving a duplicated inferior vena cava [^115F8Xgd]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are increasingly recognized with CT and venography techniques. Although many patients with IVC anomalies are asymptomatic, recent studies have suggested an association with venous thromboembolism.

We report the case of a 62-year-old woman with extensive venous clot involving the infrarenal segment of a duplicated left IVC who underwent pharmacomechanical thrombectomy and tissue plasminogen activator catheter-directed thrombolysis, resulting in complete deep venous thrombosis resolution. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the English literature of the use of a Trellis thrombectomy catheter in the setting of duplicated IVC.

### Left-sided inferior vena cava: A retrospective study and literature review [^112q7tUX]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The primary goal of this research is to explore the clinical and pathological facets of the left-sided inferior vena cava (IVC) and to catalog and condense its radiological and clinical attributes, thereby furnishing valuable references for pertinent clinical diagnosis and therapeutic procedures.

- **Methods**: We collated and scrutinized the general clinical features, radiological characteristics, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of 30 patients diagnosed with left-sided IVC (LIVC) in our hospital from July 2014 through February 2024.

- **Results**: A majority of patients were asymptomatic and were only identified during diagnostic procedures for other ailments. CT scans revealed anomalies in the anatomical configuration of the LIVC. The radiological presentations primarily showcased the right common iliac vein traversing the lumbar vertebrae to amalgamate with the left common iliac vein, forming the IVC. The IVC ascended on the left side of the abdominal aorta, accepted the left renal vein, and then transitioned to the right side of the abdominal aorta. In 3 instances, the IVC was witnessed ascending on the left side of the abdominal aorta, permeating through the diaphragm, converging with the azygos vein and abdominal aorta, and making its way into the right atrium. In these cases, the hepatic segment of the IVC was missing, and there was an absence of the IVC inferior to the hepatic vein, a condition we refer to as complete LIVC.

- **Conclusions**: LIVC is predominantly asymptomatic but carries significant anatomical implications during abdominal and retroperitoneal surgeries.

### Nutcracker syndrome and deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava [^116NRWdg]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2016). High credibility.

Duplicated inferior vena cava is a rare anomaly, and thrombosis in one or both segments is even less frequent. We present a case of deep venous thrombosis of the left lower limb involving the popliteal, femoral, and iliac veins, as well as the left segment of the duplicated vena cava and nutcracker syndrome. After catheter-directed thrombolysis complemented by mechanical thrombolysis, the compromised veins had complete revascularization; the nutcracker syndrome was treated with stent placement, followed by the use of anticoagulants. There was technical success and complete recovery of the patient.

### Inferior vena cava duplication and deep venous thrombosis: Case report and review of literature [^113FAARE]. Annals of vascular surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Duplications of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are seen with an incidence of 0.2% to 3.0%. Duplications causing symptoms are rare, with only six reported cases of IVC duplication associated with deep venous thrombosis. We present a 78-year-old Caucasian woman with an IVC duplication who developed deep venous thrombosis. The etiologies of IVC duplication include the failure of anastomosis between the primitive cardinal veins and the failure of regression of the left supracardinal vein.

When asymptomatic, treatment options include observation, placing filters in both systems, or coil-embolization of the duplicated segment plus placing a filter in the right IVC. For our patient, we chose to coil-embolize the communication to the duplicated segment as well as place a filter in the main right IVC system.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^1173Kso8]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Absent infrarenal IVC, also known as interruption of the infrarenal IVC or infrarenal agenesis of IVC with azygos continuation, is postulated to be caused by acquired intrauterine or perinatal venous thrombosis rather than the failure of embryonic vein development. This condition leads to a failure in the development of posterior cardinal and supracardinal veins, resulting in the external and internal iliac veins draining into the azygos–hemiazygos system via ascending lumbar veins, while a suprarenal IVC segment is preserved. It is a rarely described anomaly with an unknown incidence. Affected patients risk developing lower extremity venous insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis, varicose veins, and pelvic congestion syndrome. In the absence of adequate flow through ascending lumbar veins and the azygos system, other collateral pathways can form, involving abdominal wall, pelvic, gonadal, and retroperitoneal vessels.

### Unique venocaval anomalies: Case of duplicate superior vena cava and interrupted inferior vena cava [^1133FzEx]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Venocaval anomalies are uncommon in the general population and often go unrecognized, but physicians should be aware of their significance. Duplicate superior vena cava should be identified during cardiac imaging, surgery, and catheter insertions. While an interrupted inferior vena cava can predispose to thrombus formation, it protects against pulmonary embolism from lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. We describe a unique case of a patient in which combined superior vena cava and inferior vena cava anomalies were found incidentally. This is the first reported case of a duplicate superior vena cava and interrupted inferior vena cava in a single patient in English literature. This article also provides a literature review on the topic.

### Congenital systemic venous return anomalies to the right atrium review [^111x6LmW]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Left-sided inferior vena cava (IVC) (Fig. 7 a–c) results from the persistence of the left supracardinal vein, along with the regression of the one on the right, and has a prevalence of about 0.2–0.5%. Typically, the left IVC joins the left renal vein, which then crosses ventrally to join the right renal vein, resulting in a normal suprarenal segment of the IVC. This anomaly may complicate the placement of an IVC filter on the infrarenal segment via a transjugular access.

- **Schematic representation of left-sided IVC (Fig. 7a)**: This is distinct from duplication, as the infrarenal segment of the right IVC is absent. The left IVC joins the left renal vein, which normally crosses ventrally the aorta to join the right renal vein, resulting in a normal suprarenal segment of the IVC.

- **Embryology of left-sided IVC (Fig. 7b)**: This condition arises from the regression of the right supracardinal vein and the persistence of the left supracardinal vein.

- **Imaging of left-sided IVC (Fig. 7c)**: A contrast-enhanced CT scan shows a left-sided IVC (L-IVC) joining the left renal vein, which crosses ventrally in a normal manner to join the right renal vein (asterisk), forming a normal suprarenal segment of the IVC.

Interruption of the infrarenal IVC with preservation of the suprarenal segment (Fig. 8) represents a rarer anomaly. This is due to abnormal embryologic development of the posterior cardinal and supracardinal veins, leading to the absence of the infrarenal segment of the IVC. Blood from the lower half of the body reaches the heart via the superior vena cava (SVC) through the azygos-hemiazygos system.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^113rimrR]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

At the same time, the cranial end of the right subcardinal vein forms the suprarenal segment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and fuses with the developing hepatic IVC. Gonadal and suprarenal veins are also derived from the subcardinal veins. The caudal left supracardinal vein and left subcardinal veins regress, establishing right-sided dominance. Paired supracardinal veins and their anastomosis extend above the diaphragm to become the azygos and hemiazygos veins. Caudally, the right supracardinal vein persists as the infrarenal IVC, communicating with the paired iliac veins (Fig. 1 c).

In summary, the mature IVC is composed of infrarenal (right supracardinal vein), renal (right suprasubcardinal and intersubcardinal anastomoses), suprarenal/infrahepatic (right subcardinal vein), and hepatic (vitelline veins) segments. Posterior cardinal veins persist as paired common iliac veins, whilst the supracardinal veins contribute to the azygos venous system (Fig. 2).

- **Mature IVC composition**: The mature IVC is composed of infrarenal (right supracardinal vein), renal (right suprasubcardinal and intersubcardinal anastomoses), suprarenal (right subcardinal vein), and hepatic (vitelline veins) segments. Renal and suprarenal segments are separated by a dashed line.

- **Vein contributions**: Posterior cardinal veins persist as paired common iliac veins, which join to form the iliac confluence, whilst supracardinal veins contribute to the azygos venous system, draining into the superior vena cava. The gonadal and suprarenal veins are derived from subcardinal veins.

### Giant adrenal pseudocyst in patient with duplicated inferior vena cava: A case report [^116ydMvn]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Adrenal pseudocysts are rare entities in clinical practice, and many are identified incidentally. The incidence of congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava is estimated to range from 0.2% to 3.0% in the general population. We report an exceptional case of a giant right-sided adrenal pseudocyst with inferior vena cava duplication to illustrate the clinical and histopathological features of this entity.

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: A rare case report [^113VUZYn]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Wilms tumor is the most common renal tumor of childhood, while duplication of the inferior vena cava is an uncommon anomaly. In this study, we present a case of Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication, a scenario which has not been previously reported.

- **Case presentation**: A 14-month-old female presented with an enlarging abdominal mass. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated a large mass in the right kidney, duplication of the inferior vena cava below the renal veins, and compression of the right inferior vena cava caused by the enormous mass. A right radical nephrectomy was performed, and final pathology was consistent with Wilms tumor. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was executed. Computed tomography imaging at three months postoperatively showed the right inferior vena cava played a dominant role, and the left inferior vena cava was not clearly detected. During the 18-month follow-up, no local recurrence or metastasis was observed.

- **Conclusion**: It is important to recognize cases of Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication to avoid injury to retroperitoneal venous anomalies and prevent life-threatening hemorrhage during surgery through preoperative computed tomography.

### Anomalous inferior vena cava associated with horseshoe kidney on multidetector computed tomography [^113a2pFo]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

We evaluated the prevalence of anomalous inferior vena cava (IVC) associated with 205 patients with horseshoe kidney (HSK) and 1,990 patients without HSK on multidetector computed tomography. We compared prevalence between both groups.

We identified anatomical variations of the IVC in 8 patients (3.9%) with HSK:

- 1 preisthmic IVC with retrocaval ureter
- 4 double IVCs
- 2 left IVCs
- 1 IVC with azygos continuation

In 12 patients (0.6%) without HSK, the variations included:

- 8 double IVCs
- 3 left IVCs
- 1 IVC with azygos continuation

Anomalous IVC was significantly more frequent in patients with HSK than those without it.

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: a rare case report [^114QBkNy]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to an en bloc resection of the tumor, lymph node sampling is another significant goal in Wilms tumor (WT) surgery. However, patients with anomalous venous anatomy might exhibit unusual patterns of lymph node metastases because the lymphatic drainage generally follows the vascular architecture. Thus, lymph node sampling or dissection in a patient with a venous anomaly might be adjusted accordingly.

WT involves inferior vena cava (IVC) invasion in 4–8% of cases, and caval extension of WT has been an important surgical challenge. Although tumor thrombus of the renal vein or IVC was not found in the present case, the extension of renal cell carcinoma into duplications of the IVC and the retroaortic renal veins has been reported.

Computed tomography (CT) is the most reliable technique for detecting tumors and retroperitoneal venous anomalies. Three-dimensional CT angiography can be employed to detect the duplication of the IVC before surgery or other interventional procedures of the retroperitoneum are undertaken. In WT, preoperative CT is also an important diagnostic tool and adjunct in assessing lymph node involvement to provide accurate treatment recommendations.

In our case, a plain chest X-ray was performed for the evaluation of pulmonary metastases, and the report was normal. Considering the disadvantage of radiation exposure, a routine pulmonary CT, which was still controversial, was not performed.

### An interesting case: bilateral superior vena cava in a patient with end stage renal disease [^114VdgqY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

A left superior vena cava, present in 0.5% of the population, results from the persistence of the embryonic left anterior cardinal vein and is usually considered a normal variant. We present our experience of an incidental discovery of bilateral superior vena cava during routine evaluation of suspected intra-fistula stenosis in a dialysis-dependent patient with end stage renal disease.

Our images were consistent with a left-sided venous structure draining into the heart with an independent right-side superior vena cava, as evidenced by fluoroscopy. There was also evidence of a 60% intra-fistula stenosis.

To conclude, twin superior vena cava may be present as independent draining vessels or as part of a duplicate caval drainage. While cases of persistent left superior vena cava have been associated with disturbances of cardiac impulse formation and conduction, no such significant associations have been found in patients with bilateral superior vena cava. However, the variant anatomy may confound efforts during central venous catheterization and alter flow characteristics, potentially affecting the maturation of an arteriovenous fistula.

### Inferior vena cava agenesis: a rare cause of deep vein thrombosis [^117RUm4i]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis considered the possibility of chronic inferior vena cava (IVC) occlusion based on the initial CT findings. However, following a specialist radiology consultant reviewed the images, the absence of any demonstrable thrombus superior to the iliac veins, combined with well-developed azygous collateral venous drainage, was characteristic of a diagnosis of IVC agenesis (IVCA).

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: A rare case report [^112ryzhd]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

A 14-month-old female was referred to our hospital with a history of an enlarging abdominal mass noted by her parents for 3 days. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass with clear and smooth margins, extending from the right upper quadrant to the right hemipelvis. Routine blood tests were normal apart from mild anemia, and urine analysis did not show hematuria. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a unilateral 10.8 × 7.2 × 9.2 cm solid tumor in the right kidney, whereas the contralateral kidney was normal.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large lesion arising from the inferior aspect of the right kidney, occupying the right flank and extending across the midline. Enhanced CT detected duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVC) below the renal veins and compression and displacement of the right IVC caused by the enormous tumor (Fig. 1). An additional movie file shows this in more detail [see Additional file 1].

- **Figure description**: Axial, coronal, and three-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography scan with contrast showing a large mass in the right kidney, duplication of the inferior vena cava below the renal veins, and compression and displacement of the right inferior vena cava. The straight arrow denotes the right inferior vena cava, and the curved arrow the left inferior vena cava.

Neither intravascular extension nor invasion to adjacent organs and regional lymph nodes was detected by CT. Chest radiography was reported as normal.

With the presumptive diagnosis of Wilms tumor (WT), a right-sided radical nephrectomy was performed. Final pathology was consistent with favorable histology, stromal-

### Inferior vena cava anomalies and variations: Imaging and rare clinical findings [^115sNoAt]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Anomalies of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its variations were first described by Abernethy in 1793 in a 10-month-old child with polysplenia and dextrocardia, who presented with a congenital mesocaval shunt and continuation of IVC with the azygos vein (CCA). The IVC develops sequentially, primarily between the sixth and eighth gestational weeks, with the formation of anastomoses and posterior regression of three paired veins: subcardinal, supracardinal, and postcardinal. Because of this complexity in its embryogenesis, there are numerous anatomical forms and variations of IVC.

Anomalies of IVC are usually visualized by noninvasive imaging techniques, including multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In fact, these anomalies can be misdiagnosed as a mass lesion if variations and anomalies such as the double IVC, agenesis of infrarenal IVC, left IVC, and enlarged azygos vein are overlooked. Moreover, awareness of these variations is crucially important for cardiopulmonary surgeries. For instance, in cases with left IVC, the infrarenal placement of an IVC filter may be difficult to perform through the transjugular approach.

In this article, we present the imaging findings and rare clinical variations of IVC anomalies with associated variations and diseases.

### Azygos continuation of interrupted inferior vena cava in association with sick sinus syndrome [^113h9aAi]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for the right side of the heart and the systemic venous system have increased the need for ready access to the inferior vena cava (IVC) through the transfemoral route. Anatomical variations or obstruction of the IVC can make these procedures challenging.

The case of a 47-year-old woman with an interrupted infrahepatic IVC with azygos continuation, accompanied by sick sinus syndrome and a structurally normal heart, is reported. Negotiating a temporary pacing lead from the IVC to the right atrium was difficult. Ultimately, the lead followed the course from the IVC to the azygos vein, then to the superior vena cava, the right atrium, and finally the right ventricular apex. Permanent VVI pacing through the right subclavian route was uneventful since the superior vena cava and its tributaries had a normal course.

Awareness of these anomalies before pacing can lead to the use of an alternative route for pacing, which may avoid undue delay of an otherwise urgently needed procedure.

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: A rare case report [^1112A8zS]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common renal tumor in childhood. Duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is an uncommon anomaly. Although it is asymptomatic and often detected incidentally by imaging, IVC duplication may represent a hazard for bleeding during surgery, such as nephrectomy. In the present study, we present a case of WT with IVC duplication, which has not been reported previously.

### The inferior vena cava: Anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^112FAqT1]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Acquired conditions affecting the inferior vena cava (IVC) include primary and secondary malignancy, with or without intravascular extension, benign tumors, extrinsic compression, bland thrombus, and chronic obstruction. Primary IVC malignancy is rare, representing less than 1% of all malignancies. In contrast, secondary IVC malignancy is much more common and often results from tumor thrombus, i.e. direct intravascular extension from an abdominal primary such as the kidney, liver, or adrenal gland. Metastatic lesions may also invade the caval wall, the most common of which are liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Lung carcinoma involving the IVC is extremely rare. In this review, we present a case of adrenal metastases from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with extension into the suprarenal IVC (Fig. 11). Tumors such as pheochromocytoma and leiomyomas are typically benign; however, there are reports of IVC invasion and metastasis.

The IVC may also be compressed extrinsically by tumors such as lymphoma, causing symptoms of IVC syndrome, such as lower limb and lower torso swelling (Fig. 12). Furthermore, distinguishing tumor from bland thrombus is important to guide anticoagulation therapy. Enhancement of the filling defect, expansion of the vessel lumen, contiguity with mass, and increased FDG uptake on PET-CT are findings characteristic of tumor thrombus. Compared to CT, MRI demonstrates superior characterization of thrombus composition, identifying a greater proportion of tumor thrombi. Finally, determining the extent of IVC involvement affects staging and is crucial for treatment planning.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^117Vzoy1]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

- **Duplicated IVC with symmetrical caliber**: Contrast-enhanced coronal CT images show a duplicated IVC (asterisk) with symmetrical caliber draining into the suprarenal IVC. Bilateral external iliac veins (arrows) both drain into cavae on their respective sides. An axial CT image shows the paired IVC trunks (arrows) positioned on either side of the abdominal aorta (arrowhead).

- **Duplicated IVC with asymmetrical caliber and bridging vein**: Contrast-enhanced coronal CT images show a duplicated IVC (asterisk) of smaller caliber compared to the orthotopic IVC, which approaches and subsequently drains into the left renal vein (arrow). An axial CT image shows a bridging vein (arrow) connecting paired common iliac veins (arrowheads) positioned anterior to the L4 vertebral body and posterior to the common iliac arteries.

- **Duplicated IVC with right-sided crossed fused renal ectopia**: Coronal CT images reveal a duplicated IVC (asterisk) crossing the midline to drain into the right-sided suprarenal IVC. The right renal vein (arrow) and vein of the left ectopic kidney (arrowhead) join before draining into the orthotopic IVC. Coronal CT further demonstrates the right-sided crossed fused renal ectopia and its renal vein (arrow).

Left-sided IVC occurs due to abnormal regression of the right supracardinal vein and persistence of the left supracardinal vein, resulting in a left-sided IVC, with a prevalence of 0.2–0.5%. Bilateral common iliac veins drain into the left-sided IVC, which typically courses superiorly to join the left renal vein. Known variants to this configuration include hemiazygos continua.

### Duplicate inferior vena cava complicating the evaluation of primary aldosteronism [^1111wibb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old man with a known duplicate inferior vena cava (D-IVC) and resistant hypertension presented to our emergency department in a hypertensive crisis. He had a longstanding history of hypertension and unexplained hypokalemia treated with oral potassium supplementation. The patient was diagnosed with primary aldosteronism, and MRI of the abdomen revealed a left-sided adrenal adenoma. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) lateralized aldosterone hypersecretion to the left adrenal gland. The patient subsequently underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on a single antihypertensive medication on postoperative day 1.

D-IVC is one of several rare IVC anatomical variants that have been well described in the literature. Knowledge of this patient's unique abdominal venous anatomy enabled successful AVS and appropriate surgical management. It is necessary to identify potential anatomical variants of abdominal venous anatomy that may complicate these invasive procedures.

### Inferior and superior vena cava reconstruction [^113KVBkN]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Obstructions of the superior and inferior vena cava are prevalent etiologies of deep venous obstruction, presenting a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from life-threatening conditions to asymptomatic states. The etiological diversity inherent to these central venous obstructions necessitates a subtle approach to their diagnosis and management. This discrepancy in clinical presentations emphasizes the importance of a differentiated diagnostic and therapeutic strategy, tailored to the specific form of vena cava obstruction encountered. This article aims to delineate the various manifestations of vena cava obstruction and encourages specific diagnostic and treatment pathways.

### Congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava [^116TQo4S]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its tributaries are increasingly recognized in asymptomatic patients due to the more frequent use of cross-sectional imaging and computed tomography (CT) in particular. The development of the IVC is a complex process involving the formation of anastomoses between three pairs of embryonic veins during the 4th to 8th week of gestation.

Various permutations occur in the basic venous plan of the abdomen and pelvis, resulting in variants such as isolated left IVC, double IVC, and retroaortic left renal vein. The majority of these anomalies are asymptomatic but may occasionally present clinically with thromboembolic complications. Awareness of their existence is important to avoid significant diagnostic pitfalls and in preoperative surgical and interventional radiological planning.

### Prenatal diagnosis and outcome of isolated interrupted inferior vena cava [^113FxCdY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

We report our experience in the prenatal diagnosis of 11 cases of interrupted inferior vena cava and summarize the clinical significance and implications of this variant.

- **Study design**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 11 fetuses diagnosed with interrupted inferior vena cava, out of 55,457 pregnant women who underwent extensive fetal anomaly scans over 20 years.

- **Results**: Eight of the 11 fetuses with interrupted inferior vena cava had a completely normal outcome. One had a normal outcome despite abnormal spleen function. Another had multiple abnormalities, and one case was lost to follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of isolated interrupted inferior vena cava (IIVC) is 1 in 5000. In the vast majority (90%) of cases, it is an isolated variant not associated with isomerism or fetal anomalies. In all cases of isolated interrupted inferior vena cava, the outcome is favorable. In 10% of cases, abnormal spleen function may be detected after delivery, necessitating antipneumococcal vaccination.

### Management of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava and contraindication to anticoagulation: Case and review of the literature [^1158sVps]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Duplication of the inferior vena cava (DIVC) is an uncommon embryological anatomic phenomenon. We report a 63-year-old woman with extensive right leg deep vein thrombosis who required an IVC filter due to contraindications for anticoagulation. However, she was found to have DIVC, which required the placement of two IVC filters, resulting in a good outcome. This report will review and summarize past reports on DIVC management to provide guidance for future clinicians. Additionally, it will examine the embryological development, diagnosis, and IVC filter placement options based on the type of anatomic malformation encountered.

### Duplicated vena cava with tumor thrombus from renal cancer: Use of venogram for safer operative planning [^115AFFqj]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Renal and adrenal tumors can invade the inferior vena cava (IVC) in 4%-10% of cases. Consequently, urologists must remain well versed in the anatomy of the IVC. The IVC develops embryologically from the coordinated growth and regression of a series of veins. Occasionally, these veins can persist, creating vena caval abnormalities. A completely duplicated caval system is one of these variations. We present a case of renal cell carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into a duplicated IVC and show how an understanding of venous drainage and pertinent imaging can aid with a successful outcome.

### Double inferior vena cava in a monochorionic twin pregnancy with selective fetal growth restriction [^111rMxSL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC) are well described in adult life; however, little information exists on their associations in fetal life. Here, we describe a case of a monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancy complicated by selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) with an incidental finding of a double IVC in one child. In fetal life, variants of the infrarenal IVC are strongly associated with heart defects, which might suggest hemodynamic alterations or genetic causes, particularly in our case with MCDA twins complicated by sFGR.

Duplication of the inferior vena cava (DIVC) is an uncommon embryological anatomic phenomenon. We report a 63-year-old woman with extensive right leg deep vein thrombosis who required an IVC filter due to contraindications for anticoagulation, but was found to have DIVC, which required the placement of two IVC filters with good results. This report will review and summarize past reports of DIVC management to provide a guide for future clinicians. It will also review the embryological development, diagnosis, and IVC filter placement options based on the type of anatomic malformation encountered.

### An unusual case of leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava in a patient with a duplicated inferior vena cava [^113xpC25]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Leiomyosarcoma of primary vascular origin is a rare primary soft tissue tumour that arises mainly from the inferior vena cava (IVC). Clinical symptoms depend upon the size and location of the tumour and usually present with abdominal pain, a palpable mass, and weight loss. Complete surgical resection with clear surgical margins plays a central therapeutic role. The effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy remain to be evaluated.

We report a 64-year-old Chinese female who presented with an abdominal mass and pain associated with weight loss and was subsequently diagnosed with inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma. She underwent successful surgical resection but unfortunately developed a recurrence of the tumour 12 months post-operatively. She was also found to have a duplicated inferior vena cava, which allowed reconstitution of venous return from the lower limbs after surgical resection of the IVC tumour. We discuss the surgical treatment and results of leiomyosarcoma of the IVC.

### Imaging of partial right double vena cava with ureter crossing through its split, confirmed at surgery [^112kvkWw]. Clinical Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

A complex development process occurs during the embryogenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC), such as the formation of several anastomoses between three paired embryonic veins, which may result in a wide range of congenital abnormalities of the IVC. We report a case, not described before, of partial double right IVC with a circumcaval ureter crossing through the divide in the IVC.

### Ct of inferior vena cava filters: normal presentations and potential complications [^114qnjdx]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

With massive pulmonary embolism (PE) being a leading cause of unexpected death in adults, protection against PE is critical in appropriately selected patients. The use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters has increased over the years, paralleling the improved detection of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE by more advanced and available imaging techniques. The use of IVC filters has become very common as an alternative and/or as a supplement to anticoagulation. These filters are often seen on routine abdominal CT, including in the emergency setting; therefore, knowledge of the normal spectrum of findings of IVC filters on CT is crucial for radiologists.

Additionally, CT can be used specifically to identify complications related to IVC filters; CT may also reveal problems associated with IVC filters that are not clinically anticipated. With the availability of multiple IVC filters on the US market, and even more outside the United States, it is important for both emergency and general radiologists to recognize the different models, their appearances, positioning on CT, and their potential complications. These complications may relate to venous access, and include thrombosis associated with the filter, filter migration, penetration, and issues with filter deployment. With the increasing number of inferior vena cava filters being placed and their duration within patients increasing over time, it is essential for emergency and other radiologists to be aware of these findings on CT.

### Unusual duplication anomaly of the inferior vena cava with normal drainage of the right IVC and hemiazygous continuation of the left IVC [^113vK4PD]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and other IVC anomalies have been well described in the literature. Although they are often discovered incidentally in patients without symptoms, these anomalies can have significant clinical implications and must be recognized when they occur. In most cases of a duplicated IVC, the right and left iliac veins drain into the right and left IVC, respectively, and the left IVC ends at the level of the left renal vein, subsequently draining into the right IVC. The authors describe a unique case of duplicated IVC with hemiazygous continuation of the left-sided IVC and normal drainage of the right-sided IVC into the right atrium.

### Double vena cava filter insertion in congenital duplicated inferior vena cava: a case report and literature review [^114qZm6y]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

The complex embryogenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) can result in several anomalies, often presenting as incidental radiological findings. Recognizing IVC defects is crucial for invasive procedures, in addition to differentiating them from pathological lesions. This report describes a patient with a right femoral vein thrombosis who could not receive anticoagulant therapy due to a concomitant acute cerebral hemorrhage. The patient was found to have an asymptomatic duplicated IVC with interiliac communication. A filter had to be inserted in each vena cava to prevent pulmonary embolism. A review of the literature addressing the few reported cases of filter insertion in congenital duplicated IVC is presented.

### Thrombotic risk and features of patients with inferior vena cava agenesis: A multicentre, retrospective, observational study [^112b2LtN]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Inferior vena cava agenesis (IVCA) is a rare anomaly that predisposes affected individuals to lower-limb venous thrombosis, with a low frequency of pulmonary embolism. Antenatal thrombosis and inherited thrombophilia have been suggested as causes of IVCA; however, there is little evidence on the clinical course and management of this condition. We designed a patient registry to assess the thrombotic risk and features of IVCA.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, retrospective, observational study, we included patients with IVCA diagnosed by routine imaging from 20 hospitals in Spain (n = 18), Portugal (n = 1), and Italy (n = 1). Patients were identified from a systematic search in radiology databases using data extraction software (cohort A) and alternative searches in medical records for confirmed IVCA (cohort B; option allowed when systematic approaches were unapplicable). The primary outcomes were clinical and imaging features, thrombotic risk, the phenotype of IVCA-associated thrombosis, anticoagulant treatment, and the results of thrombophilia testing.

- **Findings**: We included patients with IVCA diagnosed by routine imaging studies done between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2022. In the systematic search, 4,341,333 imaging exams were screened from the radiology databases of eight centres. A total of 122 eligible patients were enrolled in cohort A. A further 95 patients were identified by screening medical records at 12 centres, of whom 88 were eligible and included in cohort B, making a combined cohort of 210 patients. Of these, 96 (46%) patients were female, and 200 (95%) were European or Hispanic.

### Obstructive lesions of the inferior vena cava: Clinical features and endovenous treatment [^114rSRvF]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructions of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are associated with many unusual features. Even total occlusions may remain entirely silent or present late with acute symptoms. Renal dysfunction is rare. Many have chronic symptoms, but often only one limb is affected. We describe the clinical features in a series of 120 patients seen over a 10-year period and the results of successful stent placement in 99 limbs.

- **Methods**: Patients with acute onset of symptoms due to distal thromboses underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis. Patients with significant chronic symptoms were investigated by duplex, venous function tests, transfemoral venography, and finally intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Stenotic segments were balloon dilated and occluded segments were recanalized when feasible; stents were placed under IVUS control.

- **Results**: In the asymptomatic group, 10 patients with total occlusions had transient or no occlusive symptoms. In the acute symptom group, four patients with chronic IVC occlusions presented with acute onset of deep venous thrombosis distal to the occlusion but became asymptomatic when the clot was lysed. In the chronic symptom group, 97 patients (99 limbs) had symptoms of chronic venous disease of variable distribution and intensity. In two-thirds, limb symptoms were unilateral. Pathology was total occlusion in 14%, and the rest were stenoses. The lesion extended above the renal vein in 18%. Common iliac obstruction was identified in 93%. Distal reflux was present in 66%. Modifications of the basic stent technique were required in recanalization.

### Inferior vena cava agenesis: a rare cause of deep vein thrombosis [^111ATfcZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Congenital absence of the entire inferior vena cava (IVC) represents a particularly peculiar phenomenon. Given its embryological origin, a failure in the formation of the entire IVC implies agenesis and failure in anastomosis of several venous structures. The exact pathological mechanism by which multiple venous systems fail to form the single largest vein within the body is unknown. Inferior vena cava agenesis (IVCA) is historically quoted to have an annual incidence as low as 0.0005% within the general population, with accurate estimations lacking due to the largely asymptomatic nature of the condition.

While its presence within the general population is unclear, it has been largely observed in patients who present with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as an incidental finding, particularly in young adults. Anatomical venous anomalies are well known to be associated with the development of DVT, with around 5%–6.7% of patients between 20 and 40 years of age presenting with DVT observed as having some form of structural abnormality of the IVC. This represents a 10-fold increase in the estimated prevalence of IVC abnormalities in the general population. Furthermore, the presence of bilateral limb DVT within this cohort was also observed in 35.4%–62.5% of patients, compared with up to 8.6% of all acute DVT presentations.

Therefore, while there are unanswered questions regarding the pathogenesis and true prevalence within the general population, the association of congenital IVC anomalies within younger patients presenting with bilateral DVT requires significant consideration, particularly in the follow-up investigations for underlying risk factors.

### Duplication of the inferior vena cava with thrombotic complication: Incidentally detected [^114apVos]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Although the duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVCD) is usually clinically silent and often detected incidentally by image analysis, it may have important relevance during retroperitoneal surgery and endovenous procedures. Furthermore, IVCD may represent the primary provocating factor of unilateral iliofemoral vein thrombosis in patients with hypoplasia or thrombosis of one of the caval veins. This was the case in a 37-year-old man with acute painful swelling of the right leg. The patient was treated successfully by endovenous reconstruction of the occluded caval vein. A review of the pathophysiology, clinical manifestation, and treatment of the IVCD is provided here.

### Venous anomalies in renal transplantation: an accessory left-sided IVC in a live kidney donor [^114ycTBE]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVC), resulting in an accessory left-sided IVC, is a relatively rare vascular anomaly with a reported prevalence of 0.7%. Radiologically, a duplicated left-sided IVC is usually seen as a continuation of the left common iliac vein, crossing anterior to the aorta at the level of the renal vein to join the right-sided IVC. We present a rare case in which an accessory left-sided IVC was discovered intraoperatively in a 47-year-old living donor, posing significant intraoperative challenges regarding extraction and subsequent transplantation.

### Vena cava anomalies in thoracic surgery [^112ZmyBa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Vena cava anomalies are a rare group of anatomical variations due to incorrect development of the superior or inferior vena cava during fetal life. They generally show no clinical relevance, and diagnoses are often prompted by their association with congenital heart diseases in most cases. However, preoperative identification of these anomalies is mandatory for surgeons for proper surgical planning. If not recognized, lethal complications may occur, as already reported in the literature.

- **Case presentation**: We report a case series of three different unidentified vena cava anomalies in patients undergoing lung resection. These unrecognized anomalies led to minor complications in two cases and required an accurate intraoperative evaluation in another. A careful retrospective evaluation of preoperative radiological images showed the anomalies.

- **Conclusions**: A careful evaluation of the vena cava anatomy at pre-operative imaging is mandatory for thoracic surgeons to properly plan the surgery and avoid complications.

### Radiographic characterization of inferior vena cava and its reaction following filter placement: A single-center retrospective study [^116N5RJd]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to classify the radiographic characterization of the inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and quantitatively describe dimensional alterations in response to filter placement variations, using cross-sectional computer tomographic venography (CTV) imaging.

- **Methods**: A single-center retrospective study was conducted on eligible patients who underwent CTV of the IVC, both before and after the placement of spindle-shaped filters, from September 2018 to June 2023. Baseline data, IVC diameter and orientation pre- and post-filter placement, IVC enlargement rate, and related complications were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 70 eligible patients were included, with 52 (74.3%) having type 1 IVC, 11 (15.7%) type 2, 4 (5.7%) type 3, 3 (4.3%) type 4, and none with type 5. An accompanying morphological alteration turned the IVC into a quasi-round shape with Lin CCC of 0.870, and orientation was significantly altered after filter placement. In patients with type 1, 3, and 4 IVCs, the mean diameter of the IVC increased almost 1.5-fold in the minor axis (95% confidence intervals [CIs] = -7.77 to -5.83, p < 0.05). The enlargement rate of the IVC was greater in the minor axis diameter than in the major axis (95% CI = 40.31 to 65.12, p < 0.001). Notably, regional clots around the filter were found in 22 (31.4%) patients; among them, 14 (20.0%) were located on the anterior or posterior walls of the caval minor axis, 5 (7.1%) in the lateral walls, and 3 (4.3%) in the central part of the IVC filter.

### A literature review and case series of DVT patients with absent IVC treated with thrombolysis [^116QhBbP]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Congenital absence of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is related to deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in 5% of cases with no other risk factors. DVT is typically diagnosed by duplex ultrasound, while computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required to visualize the absence of the IVC. Consequently, this condition is often missed but should be considered in young patients. There are numerous cases in the literature illustrating this connection, but these patients were often managed conservatively with anticoagulation.

- **Case series**: We report five cases presenting with a DVT who were found to have an absent inferior vena cava after imaging. These cases were treated successfully with thrombolysis and subsequently managed with lifelong anticoagulation, between January 2014 and January 2019.

- **Conclusions**: Anomalies of the inferior vena cava can cause unprovoked DVT. These anomalies are often incidental findings after CT but could alter the management plan in these patients. Treatment options include anticoagulants, thrombolysis, thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty, stents, and long-term or lifelong anticoagulation to prevent DVT recurrence.

### Inferior vena cava anomalies during laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection [^117TMkaM]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

To report our experience with congenital inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies found during laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (LRPLND), two men with a mean age of 31.5 years (range 26–37 years) underwent LRPLND because of nonseminomatous germ-cell tumors (NSGCT) between December 2003 and July 2004. A four-port technique was used; a left-sided IVC anomaly was found in both patients. The two operations were performed with no serious immediate complications and minimal blood loss. Congenital IVC anomalies were identified intraoperatively. A left-sided template, modified because of anatomic variation, was used.

The mean operative time was 95 minutes (range 60–130 minutes). Both patients remain without tumor recurrence at a median of 24.5 months of follow-up (range 15–34 months).

Although uncommon, IVC anomalies must be considered when performing LRPLND because of potential complications. Preoperative studies are essential in surgical planning.

### Upper ureteric obstruction secondary to entrapment between twin segments of inferior vena cava — an unusual occurrence [^111qH4px]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

A retrocaval ureter is a rare congenital cause of upper ureteric obstruction that results from entrapment of the upper ureter by the inferior vena cava (IVC) as it courses posterior to the cava. We report an interesting scenario of upper ureteric obstruction secondary to entrapment between twin segments of the IVC.

### Inferior vena cava anomalies and variations: Imaging and rare clinical findings [^114xmXkS]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Specific inferior vena cava (IVC) variations and anomalies, including associated venous variations such as continuous azygos (CA) and hemiazygos (CHA) veins, and other collateral pathways (deep, portal, median, and superficial), were recorded using a standardized form.

In the literature, there is no consensus about the classification of IVC anomalies and variations. In a study about the development of the IVC in the domestic cat performed in 1920, Huntington and McLure proposed a theoretical classification system for IVC anomalies and suggested that there could be 14 theoretical variations. In this paper, the authors stated that 11 of these 14 variants had been observed either in cats or in humans. Nevertheless, they observed other additional anomalies in humans, such as abnormal development of the prerenal division of the IVC and persistence of the renal collar.

Today, the most frequently encountered and published anomalies include retroaortic left renal vein, left IVC, double IVC, circumaortic left renal vein, interruption of IVC with azygos and hemiazygos continuation, absence of the infrarenal IVC, and circumcaval ureter. In general, the prevalence of IVC anomalies is reported as 0.5% worldwide. In the present pictorial essay, we summarize imaging findings of ten patients with frequent and infrequent IVC anomalies, including absence of infrarenal IVC, left IVC, double IVC, interruption of IVC with CA, left retroaortic vein, and accessory continuous hemiazygos vein. Of these ten patients, five were men and five were women, with a mean age of 45 years (range: 11–65 years).

### The inferior vena cava: Anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^117YDKQF]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the largest vein in the body, responsible for draining blood from the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities. This pictorial review summarizes the normal anatomy and embryological development of the IVC. In addition, it highlights a wide range of anatomical variants, acquired pathologies, and a common pitfall in the imaging of the IVC. This information is essential for clinical decision-making and for reducing misdiagnosis.

### Management of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava and contraindication to anticoagulation: Case and review of the literature [^112UFaza]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

On hospital day 7, the acute DVT was treated with a high-intensity unfractionated heparin drip, but 12 hours later, the patient developed copious bloody secretions during tracheostomy suctioning. Due to the extent of the bleeding, anticoagulation was stopped, and interventional radiology was consulted for the placement of an IVC filter.

By day 9, a mapping venogram revealed the presence of a duplicated inferior vena cava (DIVC), with the continuation of the left IVC into the azygos and hemiazygos system (Figures 1 and 2). On day 10, the patient underwent placement of two infrarenal IVC filters, one in each IVC (Figure 3).

### The inferior vena cava: Anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^116oRqcG]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically invades the portal venous system; however, involvement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is not uncommon, occurring in 4.0–5.9% of patients either through the extension of hepatic vein tumor thrombus or direct wall invasion. Tumor thrombus is uncommon in other hepatic malignancies and therefore should be considered a differentiating feature of HCC. IVC and right atrial involvement carry an extremely poor prognosis due to predisposition to metastatic disease, resulting in a median survival of 1–5 months. Hepatic venous outflow obstruction may cause Budd–Chiari syndrome and clinical manifestations of portal hypertension. Tumor thrombus may also embolize and obstruct pulmonary arteries.

### Management of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava and contraindication to anticoagulation: Case and review of the literature [^114sGdWh]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The embryological formation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) involves the anastomosing of pairs of primitive veins. The IVC consists of four segments: the suprarenal, hepatic, renal, and infrarenal. The primitive veins that form the final IVC are the posterior cardinal, subcardinal, and supracardinal veins. Posterior cardinal veins form the distal IVC and common iliac veins; right subcardinal veins form the suprarenal portion. The renal segment of the IVC develops from the right suprasubcardinal and postsubcardinal anastomoses, and the right supracardinal vein forms the infrarenal IVC. The alteration of any of these steps can result in IVC anatomic abnormalities. Duplicated inferior vena cava (DIVC) results from the persistence of the left supracardinal vein and can have multiple anatomic variations such as left IVC, retrocaval IVC, IVC with drainage through the azygos vein, and IVC interruption with continuation through the azygos vein. DIVC is clinically silent and therefore diagnosis is often incidental.

If DIVC is suspected or detected, multidetector CT is less costly and less invasive than conventional angiography. It is fast, easily applicable, and reliable in terms of identification of thoracoabdominal vascular structures. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional images can aid in the visualization and understanding of complex vascular malformations of the IVC.

A PubMed search with the terms 'Duplicated Inferior Vena Cava' and 'Inferior Vena Cava filter' returned 14 cases utilizing three options for caval interruption: (1) placement of bilateral IVC filters (10 cases); (2) filter insertion in large right IVC and steel coil embolization of the smaller left IVC, and (3) use of two separate filters placed in both the left and right IVCs.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^113p2D4p]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) is formed by a complex process involving the fusion and subsequent regression of embryological veins. These veins include the posterior cardinal, subcardinal, supracardinal, and vitelline veins. During the fourth week of embryological development, the right and left horns of the sinus venosus receive paired common cardinal, umbilical, and vitelline veins. These veins are responsible for draining blood from general tissue, the placenta, and the yolk sac, respectively.

- **Embryological development of the IVC**:
	a. The sinus venosus receives paired common cardinal, umbilical, and vitelline veins for blood drainage.

	b. The right hepatocardiac channel (illustrated in purple) is formed by the right vitelline vein and persists to become the hepatic IVC. Paired subcardinal (shown in red) and supracardinal veins (illustrated in green) develop, forming multiple anastomotic channels. These include intersubcardinal anastomoses, suprasubcardinal anastomoses, and the fusion between the right subcardinal vein (red) and the developing hepatic IVC (purple). As the embryo matures, some of these anastomoses regress.

	c. Illustrations highlight vessels that persist to form the mature IVC and its tributaries.
