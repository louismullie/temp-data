## Question

Can you give morphine to ckd patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether morphine can be used in patients with chronic kidney disease, and if so, how to approach dosing, monitoring, and alternatives safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of morphine in CKD and which metabolites accumulate. Then, I should verify guideline positions and risk signals from high-quality sources. Next, I will stratify recommendations by kidney function and dialysis status. After that, I need to outline a practical, stepwise approach if morphine is unavoidable, including dose adjustments and monitoring. Finally, I should consider safer opioid and non-opioid alternatives and close with a concise bottom line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology in CKD. Morphine is hepatically glucuronidated to morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), an active mu-agonist, and morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), which lacks analgesic activity but is implicated in neurotoxicity; both are renally cleared and accumulate as eGFR declines, increasing the risk of sedation, confusion, myoclonus, seizures, and respiratory depression, with M6G contributing substantially to analgesia and toxicity in renal impairment [^112kFuNT] [^1151Dbsg] [^112747qS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify what major guidelines say. The VA/DoD CKD guideline advises that full-agonist opioids are not routine for chronic non-cancer pain in CKD and notes that opioids with metabolites less dependent on kidney function are preferred, explicitly listing oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine as safer choices, while emphasizing that morphine metabolites accumulate and require caution or avoidance, especially in advanced CKD [^116NKYFv] [^113bLmfR]. ASCO's cancer pain guidance similarly recommends avoiding morphine in significant renal impairment due to neurotoxic metabolite accumulation and favors alternatives like hydromorphone, fentanyl, or methadone when possible [^111x8ff7] [^114hKGGY]. ESMO likewise prefers fentanyl or buprenorphine in CKD stages 4–5, reflecting the same accumulation concern [^1142ma7u] [^116kmvFz].

> Wait, let me verify the risk magnitude from observational data. A large meta-analysis found opioid use in CKD was associated with higher mortality, hospitalization, and fractures, underscoring the population-level harm signal even if causality is complex [^115ELWoL]. Prospective cohort data from CRIC showed opioid use was associated with kidney failure progression, hospitalization, and death, with stronger associations than NSAIDs in many analyses, reinforcing the need for caution and non-opioid-first strategies in CKD [^111WPBbA] [^1138PpkB]. I should also note that pre-dialysis opioid exposure has been linked to higher post-dialysis mortality, which further heightens concern in advanced CKD transitions [^115S4yZo].

> I will now examine how recommendations vary by kidney function. For eGFR 20–50 mL/min, if morphine is used at all, dose reductions of about 25% are suggested in labeling, with close monitoring for neurotoxicity and sedation; however, many nephrology-focused reviews still advise choosing alternatives when feasible due to M3G/M6G accumulation risk [^112RRf8u] [^112oAEvE]. For eGFR 10–20 mL/min, labeling advises 50% dose reductions and extended intervals, and several guidelines move toward avoidance of morphine altogether given the high risk of neurotoxicity and limited benefit margin in this range [^113Qii5m] [^113bLmfR]. For eGFR < 10 mL/min or dialysis, labeling recommends 75% dose reductions or avoidance, and multiple high-credibility guidelines advise strongly against morphine in this setting due to metabolite accumulation and dialysis's limited removal of these hydrophilic glucuronides [^116MRTKD] [^111x8ff7] [^114hKGGY] [^1142ma7u].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on morphine and stopping would destabilize pain control? I need to ensure a safe transition plan. If morphine must be used temporarily, use the lowest possible dose, extend dosing intervals, and monitor closely for cognitive changes, myoclonus, and respiratory depression; be prepared to rotate promptly to a safer opioid such as buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone, or methadone based on kidney function and clinical context, recognizing that buprenorphine requires no renal dose adjustment and is not dialyzed, making it particularly attractive in advanced CKD and dialysis [^116NKYFv] [^113bLmfR]. I should double-check that any rotation follows conservative equianalgesic principles with reduction for incomplete cross-tolerance to avoid overdose, especially when switching from a morphine regimen with accumulated M6G [^112dgYFH].

> Next, I should review safer opioid alternatives and their caveats. Buprenorphine is preferred in many CKD pathways due to partial agonism, lower respiratory risk, hepatic metabolism, and lack of dialyzability; transdermal fentanyl is also favored in stages 4–5 and dialysis because it is not significantly renally cleared, though absorption can be variable and heat can increase release, so I need to ensure careful titration and monitoring [^116NKYFv] [^1142ma7u] [^112dgYFH]. Hydromorphone and oxycodone are reasonable second-line options with dose caution in moderate impairment, while methadone can be effective but requires expertise due to QT risk, variable kinetics, and complex interactions; I should confirm ECG monitoring and specialist involvement if methadone is chosen [^113bLmfR] [^116dFBej].

> Hold on, I should verify non-opioid foundations before any opioid is considered. Guidelines emphasize optimizing nonpharmacologic therapies and non-opioid medications first in CKD: acetaminophen at conservative doses, topical NSAIDs for focal pain when acceptable, gabapentinoids with renal dose adjustment, SNRIs or TCAs for neuropathic pain, and physical therapy or behavioral interventions, reserving opioids for refractory cases after shared decision-making and with explicit functional goals and exit strategies [^114vTRHn] [^112P19vk] [^116Ywa5z]. I need to ensure NSAID use is minimized or avoided in eGFR < 30 unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and monitoring is in place, given nephrotoxicity and cardiovascular risks [^1137WjKP] [^1158BK29].

> I should confirm practical monitoring steps if morphine is unavoidably used short term. Baseline and serial assessment of mental status, myoclonus, and respiratory rate are essential; given limited urine output in advanced CKD, consider serum drug levels where available and use clinical toxicity screens rather than relying on urine drug testing alone in anuric patients, while also watching for constipation and proactively managing with laxatives and, if needed, peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists for opioid-induced constipation in accordance with renal dosing adjustments [^116dFBej] [^116gLcef]. Let me reconsider the plan frequently: if there is no meaningful functional improvement within a short trial, I should deprescribe and pivot to safer strategies rather than escalating morphine in the face of accumulating metabolites [^114vTRHn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "morphine is absolutely contraindicated in eGFR < 30", but I should correct that wording. It is not an absolute contraindication in labeling; rather, it is strongly discouraged by multiple high-credibility guidelines due to neurotoxic metabolite accumulation, and if used at all, it requires drastic dose reductions and vigilant monitoring, with many experts recommending avoidance when alternatives exist, especially in eGFR < 30 and in dialysis patients [^111x8ff7] [^114hKGGY] [^116MRTKD] [^1142ma7u].

> Bottom line: Morphine can be used in CKD only with great caution and is generally not preferred; avoid in advanced CKD or dialysis when possible due to M3G/M6G accumulation and neurotoxicity risk, and if used in mild to moderate impairment, reduce dose by about 25–50% with extended intervals and close monitoring, while prioritizing alternatives such as buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone, or methadone tailored to kidney function and clinical context, all within a non-opioid-first, function-focused pain management plan [^116NKYFv] [^113bLmfR] [^111x8ff7] [^114hKGGY] [^114vTRHn] [^112RRf8u] [^113Qii5m].

Morphine can be used in CKD patients, but **requires dose reduction and close monitoring** due to accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites (M3G, M6G) and risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and confusion [^111x8ff7] [^1151Dbsg]. For eGFR 20–50 mL/min, **reduce dose by 25%** [^112RRf8u]; for eGFR 10–20 mL/min, **reduce by 50%** [^113Qii5m]; for eGFR < 10 mL/min or dialysis, **reduce by 75%** [^116MRTKD] and extend dosing intervals [^114eCzcq]. Prefer alternatives like buprenorphine, fentanyl, or methadone when possible [^116NKYFv] [^1142ma7u]; if morphine is used, monitor for neurotoxicity and respiratory depression, and avoid in severe renal impairment unless benefits outweigh risks [^114hKGGY].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of morphine in CKD

Morphine is metabolized in the liver to **morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G)** and **morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G)** [^1151Dbsg], which are renally excreted. In CKD, reduced renal clearance leads to accumulation of these metabolites, increasing the risk of neurotoxicity and respiratory depression [^111x8ff7].

- **M3G accumulation**: Associated with neurotoxicity, confusion, and myoclonus [^111x8ff7].
- **M6G accumulation**: Potent analgesic but also causes respiratory depression and sedation [^1151Dbsg].
- **Prolonged half-life**: Morphine and its metabolites have prolonged half-lives in CKD, necessitating dose adjustments and extended dosing intervals [^112x8S34].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several clinical guidelines provide **specific recommendations** for morphine use in CKD patients:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| VA/DoD CKD Clinical Practice Guideline | - Avoid morphine in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) <br/> - If used, reduce dose by 50–75% and extend dosing intervals [^112kFuNT] [^113Qii5m] [^116MRTKD] |
| American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) | - Avoid morphine in significant renal impairment due to neurotoxic metabolite accumulation <br/> - Prefer alternatives like hydromorphone, fentanyl, or methadone [^111x8ff7] [^114hKGGY] |
| European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) | - Prefer fentanyl or buprenorphine in CKD stages 4–5 (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^1142ma7u] [^116kmvFz] |

---

## Dose adjustments based on renal function

Morphine dosing should be **adjusted based on renal function**:

| **Renal function (egfr)** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| 20–50 mL/min/1.73 m² | Reduce dose by 25% [^112RRf8u] |
| 10–20 mL/min/1.73 m² | Reduce dose by 50% [^113Qii5m] |
| < 10 mL/min/1.73 m² or dialysis | Reduce dose by 75% and extend dosing intervals [^116MRTKD] [^112J1hmt] |

---

## Alternative opioid analgesics

Given the risks associated with morphine in CKD, **alternative opioids** are recommended:

- **Buprenorphine**: Partial agonist with ceiling effect on respiratory depression; minimal renal clearance; no dose adjustment required [^116NKYFv] [^113bLmfR].
- **Fentanyl**: Primarily hepatic metabolism; minimal renal clearance; suitable for severe renal impairment [^1142ma7u] [^116kmvFz].
- **Methadone**: Hepatic metabolism; minimal renal clearance; suitable for severe renal impairment but requires careful monitoring due to QT prolongation risk [^114Pk82k] [^116dFBej].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

When administering morphine to CKD patients, **close monitoring is essential**:

- **Neurological monitoring**: Watch for confusion, sedation, myoclonus, and seizures [^notfound].
- **Respiratory monitoring**: Monitor for respiratory depression, especially in severe renal impairment [^116dFBej].
- **Renal function monitoring**: Regularly assess renal function and adjust dosing accordingly [^112x8S34].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients about side effects and when to seek medical attention [^116NKYFv].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks

Morphine use in CKD patients is associated with several **clinical risks**:

- **Increased mortality**: Opioid use in CKD is associated with higher mortality rates [^115ELWoL] [^111WPBbA].
- **Increased hospitalization**: Higher risk of hospitalization due to adverse effects [^115ELWoL] [^111WPBbA].
- **Neurotoxicity**: Accumulation of M3G and M6G can cause significant neurotoxicity [^111x8ff7] [^112kFuNT].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Avoid morphine**: In severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) when possible [^112kFuNT] [^114hKGGY].
- **Dose reduction**: Reduce dose by 25–75% based on renal function and extend dosing intervals [^112RRf8u] [^113Qii5m] [^116MRTKD].
- **Prefer alternatives**: Use buprenorphine, fentanyl, or methadone when possible [^116NKYFv] [^1142ma7u].
- **Close monitoring**: Regularly monitor for neurotoxicity, respiratory depression, and renal function [^112VG6kk] [^116dFBej] [^113Qii5m].

---

Morphine can be used in CKD patients with **careful dose adjustment and monitoring**, but **alternatives are preferred** due to metabolite accumulation and neurotoxicity risk [^111x8ff7].

### Opioid use in chronic pain patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review [^115E2qRd]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence of chronic pain and opioid management among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A systematic search was performed, including citations from 1960 to May 2015. The review highlights methodological quality assessment of the selected studies; prevalence of pain; type, dose, and reason for opioid use; effectiveness of pain control and associated adverse effects of opioids in CKD patients.

Results

Twelve of 131 articles met inclusion criteria. There were no randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluable, and 12 were observational studies. Out of 12 studies, four were of high quality, six were of moderate quality, and the remaining two were low-quality studies. The studies were from different countries with sample size ranging from 10 to 12,782. Several studies showed a high prevalence of chronic uncontrolled pain. The effectiveness of different categories of opioids, dose, duration, and commonly prescribed opioids varied across studies.

Conclusions

Based on a systematic review of the current literature, there is fair evidence for the high prevalence of chronic pain among patients with CKD, which is not being effectively managed, probably due to underprescription of analgesics or opioids in the CKD population. Clinicians are in need of additional and well-designed randomized control trials that focus on the indications for opioid therapy, appropriate opioid doses and dosing intervals, outcomes with adequacy of symptom control, and reporting on the incidence of adverse side effects.

### Opioid management in CKD [^11291DrG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience a high pain and symptom burden. Concurrently, opioid prescription and use in patients with CKD continues to increase, leading to concern for opioid-related risks. Nephrologists increasingly face challenging clinical situations requiring further evaluation and treatment of pain, for which opioid use may be indicated. However, nephrologists are not commonly trained in pain management and may find it difficult to compile the necessary information and tools to effectively assess and treat potentially multidimensional pain. In these situations, they may benefit from using an evidence-based stepwise approach proposed in this article. We address current approaches to opioid use for pain management in CKD and offer a stepwise approach to individualized opioid assessment, focusing on kidney-specific concerns. This includes thorough evaluation of the pain experience, opioid use history, and treatment goals. We subsequently discuss considerations when initiating opioid therapy, strategies to reduce opioid-related risks, and recommended best practices for opioid stewardship in CKD. Using this sequential approach to opioid management, nephrologists can thereby gain a broad overview of key patient considerations, the foundation for understanding implications of opioid use, and a patient-tailored plan for opioid therapy.

### Opioid management in older adults with chronic kidney disease: a review [^112oAEvE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain, a common comorbidity of chronic kidney disease, is consistently under-recognized and difficult to treat in older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease. Given the decreased kidney function associated with aging and chronic kidney disease, these patients are at increased risk for drug accumulation and adverse events. Emerging research has demonstrated the efficacy of opioids in chronic kidney disease patients, but research specifically focusing on older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients is scarce. The primary objective of this review is to determine which oral and transdermal opioids are the safest for older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients. We discuss the limited existing evidence on opioid prescription in older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients and provide recommendations for the management of oral and transdermal opioids in this patient population. Specifically, transdermal buprenorphine, transdermal fentanyl, and oral hydromorphone are the most tolerable opioids in these patients; hydrocodone, oxycodone, and methadone are useful but require careful monitoring; and tramadol, codeine, morphine, and meperidine should be avoided due to risk of accumulation and adverse events. Because older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for adverse events, vigilant monitoring of opioid prescription is critical. Lastly, collaboration among an interprofessional clinical team can ensure safe prescription of opioids in older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^111EHeVq]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Full-agonist opioids in CKD — The 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain noted the evidence of ill effects of long-term full agonist opioid use, including opioid use disorder (OUD), overdose, and death, and concurs with CDC guidance that opioids should not be considered routine therapy for chronic pain outside of active cancer, palliative, and end-of-life care. The guideline recommends against the initiation of opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain, particularly in younger patients; in CKD, observational studies associate full-agonist opioid use with kidney failure progression, hospitalization, and mortality. Non-pharmacologic options and optimization of non-opioid analgesics should usually be considered prior to opioid prescribing, although closely monitored opioid therapy may be warranted in select patients after careful consideration of risks and benefits. When initiating opioids, a short duration prescription with reevaluation at 30 days or sooner to assess improvements in pain and functional status and adverse effects, is recommended, and the lowest effective dose of opioids as indicated by patient-specific risks and benefits is recommended.

### Clinical pharmacology considerations in pain management in patients with advanced kidney failure [^111ZdH3A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain is common and poorly managed in patients with advanced CKD, likely due to both under and over prescription of appropriate analgesics. Poorly managed pain contributes to patients' poor quality of life and excessive health care use. There is tremendous variability within and between countries in prescribing patterns of analgesics, suggesting that factors other than patient characteristics account for these differences. This article discusses the pharmacologic management of acute and chronic pain in patients with advanced CKD, and the role analgesics, including opioids, play in the overall approach to pain management.

### Pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease [^112P19vk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review evaluates current recommendations for pain management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with a specific focus on evidence for opioid analgesia, including the partial agonist, buprenorphine.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence supports the use of physical activity and other nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or with pharmacological therapies, for pain management. Nonopioid analgesics, including acetaminophen, topical analgesics, gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and TCA may be considered based on pain cause and type, with careful dose considerations in kidney disease. NSAIDs may be used in CKD and ESKD for short durations with careful monitoring. Opioid use should be minimized and reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Opioids have been associated with increased adverse events in this population, and thus should be used cautiously after risk/benefit discussion with the patient. Opioids that are safer to use in kidney disease include oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be a promising and safer option due to its partial agonism at the mu opioid receptor.

Summary

Pain is poorly managed in patients with kidney disease. Nonpharmacological and nonopioid analgesics should be first-line approaches for pain management. Opioid use should be minimized with careful monitoring and dose adjustment.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116dFBej]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

There are two basic scenarios a provider will encounter with the treatment of opioids in CKD patients: inheriting the established opioid patient or initiating chronic opioid therapy. Inherited opioid patients should be assessed for risks versus benefits, with an "escape route" in mind if improvement is suboptimal or aberrancy is observed and confirmed.

Due to the risk of respiratory depression and abuse associated with opioids, patients need to be thoroughly evaluated before starting therapy and closely monitored for the duration of treatment. Therapeutic monitoring is complicated by little to no urine output that precludes the ability to perform urine drug monitoring. This should not allow the patient a "free pass" to avoid opioid compliance monitoring. Instead obtaining random serum blood levels should become the standard of care. The Risk Index for Overdose or Serious Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (RIOSORD) could be used to assess patients for opioid-induced respiratory depression and qualify these patients for "take home naloxone".

An obvious barrier for prescribing opioids in this population is the lack of guidance from major pain management organizations, for nearly all aspects of pain management in patients with CKD, which is directly attributable to the lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. Recommendations published in 2007 by Murtagh et al suggested fentanyl, methadone, and tramadol as opioids to be used in advanced CKD patients managed without dialysis. Although these opioids have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles when used in those with renal dysfunction, they still carry their own heightened risks. Methadone can prolong the QTc interval and increase risk of torsades de pointes; fentanyl has extremely variable absorption characteristics, which lead to variable serum concentrations that are not easily controlled; and both tramadol and methadone are ubiquitously fraught with toxicities and polymorphic variabilities associated with phase I cytochrome metabolism.

### Is there a legitimate role for the therapeutic use of cannabinoids for symptom management in chronic kidney disease? [^111pAdi7]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is a common and debilitating symptom experienced in the context of numerous other physical and emotional symptoms by many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Management of pain with opioids in CKD can be problematic given the prominence of adverse effects of opioids in CKD, which may exacerbate symptoms, such as nausea, anorexia, pruritus, and insomnia, all of which impact negatively on patients' health-related quality of life. Novel therapeutic approaches for pain and symptom management in CKD are required. Recent research in the area of cannabinoids (CBs) is legitimizing the use of cannabis-based medicine. In this review, we describe the symptom burden borne by patients with CKD and review some of the key basic science and clinical literature to evaluate the potential use of CBs for the management of overall symptom burden in CKD.

### Analgesic use and associated adverse events in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ELWoL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating pain in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with an increased risk of toxicity and drug adverse events in this population. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to assess the prevalence of analgesic use and establish the risk of analgesics-related adverse events, in patients with CKD.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched until January 2021. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were conducted to pool and summarise prevalence data and measures of association between analgesic use and adverse events.

Results

Sixty-two studies relevant to the prevalence of analgesic use and 33 to analgesic-related adverse events were included, combining data on 2.3 and 3 million individuals, respectively. Pooled analyses found that 41% (95% confidence interval, 35–48) of the CKD population regularly use analgesia. The annual period prevalence was estimated at 50% for opioids and 21% for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Overall, 20% and 7% of patients with CKD are on chronic opioid or NSAID therapy, respectively. Opioid use was associated with an increased risk of death (1.61; 95% CI, 1.12–2.31; n = 7, I² = 91%), hospitalisation (1.38; 95% CI, 1.32–1.45; n = 2, I² = 0%), and fractures (1.51; 95% CI, 1.16–1.96; n = 3, I² = 54%).

Conclusion

High levels of analgesic consumption and related serious adverse outcomes were found in patients with CKD. Consideration needs to be given to how these patients are assessed and managed in order to minimise harms and improve outcomes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114vTRHn]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Table N-1 — conceptual approach to chronic pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes focusing on function, non-pharmacologic options, careful pharmacologic use tailored to kidney function, and selective referral. Opioids are prescribed to patients with CKD/ESKD at rates several-fold higher than the general population (20% CKD, 30% dialysis vs. 4–7% general U.S. Population), and use of opioids engenders its own risks. Focus on function includes to "Emphasize functional outcomes (rather than pain scores) when assessing therapeutic interventions". Address co-occurring conditions by "Treat co-occurring mental health conditions… - pain may improve… " and to "Identify OUD or physiologic opioid dependence and treat with MOUD (e.g., buprenorphine, or referral for methadone)" while encouraging meaningful functional activities. Try non-pharmacologic interventions by "Add psychosocial or behavioral interventions… based on availability and patient preference if self-management strategies are insufficient", and "Consider acupuncture and chiropractic care if available and indicated", with familiarity with local resources. For medications, "Select medications based on risk of nephrotoxicity, side effects, overdose and potential drug interactions", "Adjust dose… using eGFR or using manufacturer's dose guidance", and "Consider starting at lower dose and titrating slowly to mitigate risks"; "Use analgesics judiciously, short-term", "De-prescribe if no benefit is observed in the near-term (e.g., 3 months)", and "Consider patient-directed deprescribing… stabilized (e.g., 9–12 months)". Also "Assess risk of fall and fracture… and use caution when co-prescribing sedating medications". Refer to pain specialists as needed: "Consider referral when there is diagnostic uncertainty… ", "Employ multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary approach… ", and "Offer virtual options… when available".

### When ESKD complicates the management of pain [^113tBmmN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2020). Medium credibility.

Pain is one of the most common symptoms reported by patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and negatively impacts their health-related quality of life (HRQOL), dialysis adherence, healthcare utilization, and mortality. There are a number of patient-related and health system-related barriers that make it very challenging to treat pain in these patients. Moreover, the limited availability of efficacious and safe nonopiate analgesic options has led to over-use of opioids in this population. We propose a framework for pain assessment and tailored treatment using nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches to optimize pain management and opioid use. Additionally, we recommend system-level changes to improve care coordination and pain management in ESKD patients.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^111x8ff7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — clinical interpretation for renal impairment notes that in patients with significant renal function impairment, morphine use may result in the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites such as morphine-3-glucuronide and normorphine, and opioid-induced neurotoxicity; other opioids such as hydromorphone or fentanyl are less likely to result in accumulation of active metabolites in renal failure; methadone can also be a good alternative since it is primarily metabolized in the liver, but it should only be used by experienced clinicians.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^115heYoE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that there has been substantial use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older patients with CKD in the US with a clear increasing trend until recently, with early suggestion of decreasing use, perhaps due to the recent heightened awareness of the opioid epidemic in the US. Clinicians must continue evaluating benefits and risks of using opioids and NSAIDs in this and other patient populations. Specifically, clear clinical guidelines for chronic pain management among patients aged 65 years and older with CKD may be warranted to address potentially suboptimal pain management in this patient population.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116fYBjp]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

In hemodialysis (HD) patients, the prevalence of chronic pain can be up to 92%. A survey of HD patients found 55% reported a severe pain episode in the previous 24 hours. Furthermore, ~75% of HD patients report inadequate pain management. Despite these shocking statistics there is no universally accepted guideline for the treatment of pain in HD patients. Nevertheless, poorly managed pain in HD patients promulgates psychological disturbances, impaired sleep, decreased dialysis compliance, and an overall decline in quality of life.

Providers may be hesitant to prescribe analgesics to patients on HD due to the significant differences in pharmacokinetics compared with their healthy counterparts. Pharmacokinetic variations of most drugs are generally well studied in "healthy" patients; however, physiochemical attributes in HD patients are fraught with uncertainty.

Due to decreased renal elimination of medications and metabolites, a common assumption in patients with renal disease is that estimated renal function is the main, and sometimes only, factor to consider when making dose adjustments. Although not entirely false, other physiologic changes must be considered when selecting medications and commensurate dosing. Table 1 demonstrates the various changes that occur to absorption, volume of distribution, and elimination that must be accounted for in this patient population.

The dialysis machine itself must also be considered among the many changes that HD patients undergo when selecting pharmacotherapy. Certain characteristics impact the removal of a drug by dialysis, including molecular weight, protein binding, volume of distribution, and water solubility. The least likely drugs to be removed by dialysis are those with large molecular weights that are highly protein bound, that have high volume of distribution, and with poor water solubility. Given the aforementioned complexities of selecting appropriate medications for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the potential for adverse events with inappropriate dosing, it is no wonder why providers are so uncomfortable prescribing analgesic therapy to patients with advanced CKD. Nonpharmacologic approaches should be optimized and used in conjunction with any chronic pain patient. If pharmacotherapy is required for adequate pain management, opioids are frequently thought to be first-line therapy when comparing toxicities to alternatives such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Key Points

Question

Is prescription analgesic use higher among Medicare patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with the general population?

Findings

In this cohort study of more than 6 million Medicare Part D beneficiaries, use of both opioids and prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increased substantially among patients with CKD aged 65 years or older from 2006 to 2015. Patients with CKD used significantly more opioids but less NSAIDs compared with the non-CKD population.

Meaning

Results of this study suggest that optimization of pain management in CKD is warranted.

### Opioids for chronic pain management in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure [^115GaDbJ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent among adults treated with maintenance haemodialysis (HD) and has profound negative effects. Over four decades, research has demonstrated that 50–80% of adult patients treated with HD report having pain. Half of patients with HD-dependent kidney failure (HDKF) have chronic moderate-to-severe pain, which is similar to the burden of pain in patients with cancer. However, pain management in patients with HDKF is often ineffective as most patients report that their pain is inadequately treated. Opioid analgesics are prescribed more frequently for patients receiving HD than for individuals in the general population with chronic pain, and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and health-care resource use. Furthermore, current opioid prescribing patterns are frequently inconsistent with guideline-recommended care. Evidence for the effectiveness of opioids in pain management in general, and in patients with HDKF specifically, is lacking. Nonetheless, long-term opioid therapy has a role in the treatment of some patients when used selectively, carefully and combined with an ongoing assessment of risks and benefits. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the use of opioid therapy in patients with HDKF and chronic pain, including a discussion of buprenorphine, which has potential as an analgesic option for patients receiving HD owing to its unique pharmacological properties.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^111xnHqa]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Atkinson et al thoroughly reviewed literature on commonly used opioids in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) setting and ultimately hypothesized that opioids primarily undergoing hepatic phase II metabolism that yields inactive metabolites (such as tapentadol) are highly protein bound, have larger molecular weights, and have higher lipophilicity (to avoid being dialyzed), should be considered first in this population of patients.

NSAIDs have well-documented renal toxicities that can cause acute kidney injury and influence progression of CKD.–They have been shown to increase sodium retention and edema, cause hyperkalemia through decreased delivery of potassium to the distal tubule, cause acute renal failure through disruption of the renal hemodynamic balance, cause nephrotic syndrome by increasing lymphocyte recruitment and activation, and cause acute and chronic renal papillary necrosis through direct toxicity. Nonrenal toxicities include increased blood pressure, decreased antihypertensive effects of several medications, and increased gastrointestinal (GI) bleed risk.

The totality of these toxicities led the American Society of Nephrology to recommend that all patients with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD of all causes avoid NSAID use, in their "Choosing Wisely" campaign published in 2012. This recommendation should further be extended to patients on dialysis. Residual renal function has proven to be important even after commencement of dialysis, because of its implication on dialysis adequacy.NSAIDs have been shown to negatively impact residual renal function, and dialysis patients are more susceptible to fluid and electrolyte changes, have blood pressures that are more difficult to control, and are at higher risk for GI bleeds; thus dialysis patients may be at an even greater risk of harm from NSAID use than the general population.,

Acetaminophen is most commonly used to alleviate mild pain symptoms such as headaches, toothaches, or backaches. The mechanism in which acetaminophen provides analgesia remains unclear; however, it is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus and possibly the spinal cord, with minimal effects on the kidneys. The majority of data supports its renal safety when used in lower, intermittent doses, and only few cases have reported acute renal toxicity after ingestion of larger doses. Chronic high-dose acetaminophen may cause renal function decline (decrease in glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min) and has been reported in women who consumed > 3,000 g of acetaminophen over 11 years and has also been associated with tubular necrosis with long-term use (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.28–3.24).

### Opioid prescribing practices in chronic kidney disease: a population-based cohort study [^112Cz2QD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is common, and its management is complex in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but limited data are available on opioid prescribing. We examined opioid prescribing for non-cancer and non-end-of-life care in patients with CKD.

Methods

This was a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative databases in Ontario, Canada which included adults with CKD defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² from 1 November 2012 to 31 December 2018 and estimated the proportion of opioid prescriptions (type, duration, dose, potentially inappropriate prescribing, etc.) within 1 year of cohort entry. Prescriptions had to precede dialysis, kidney transplant or death.

Results

We included 680445 adults with CKD, and 198 063 (29.1%) were prescribed opioids. Codeine (14.9%) and hydromorphone (7.2%) were the most common opioids. Among opioid users, 24.3% had repeated or long-term use, 26.1% were prescribed high doses and 56.8% were new users. Opioid users were more likely to be female, had cardiac disease or a mental health diagnosis, and had more healthcare visits. The proportions for potentially inappropriate prescribing indicators varied (e.g. 50.1% with eGFR < 30 were prescribed codeine, and 20.6% of opioid users were concurrently prescribed benzodiazepines, while 7.2% with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were prescribed morphine, and 7.0% were received more than one opioid concurrently). Opioid prescriptions declined with time (2013 cohort: 31.1% versus 2018 cohort: 24.5%; p < 0.0001), as did indicators of potentially inappropriate prescribing.

Conclusions

Opioid use was common in patients with CKD. While opioid prescriptions and potentially inappropriate prescribing have declined in recent years, interventions to improve pain management without the use of opioids and education on safer prescribing practices are needed.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^1137WjKP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### Analgesia in patients with ESRD: a review of available evidence [^113WXBcF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Moderate to severe pain frequently accompanies chronic diseases in general and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in particular. Several analgesic agents and associated metabolites show altered pharmacokinetics in the presence of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Drug-related side effects may exacerbate symptoms frequently observed in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and constipation) or those often attributed to hemodialysis therapy (eg, orthostatic hypotension and impaired cognition). Persons with advanced CKD and ESRD are at increased risk for adverse effects of analgesic agents because of enhanced drug sensitivity, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medication use. Dose adjustment and avoidance of certain analgesics may be required in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. We review the available evidence on pharmacokinetics and adverse drug effects of various analgesic agents commonly used in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. Determining an optimal approach to the control of pain in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD will require additional research.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^111jYsuo]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pain is one of most common symptoms experienced by patients with kidney disease. More than 70% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) report experiencing pain. Pain has been associated with lower quality of life, high symptom burden, and greater risk of developing kidney disease, its progression, and mortality. Thus, management of pain is a vital component of comprehensive care for patients with CKD.

The already high medication burden makes pain management even more complex in patients with CKD. There are no well-established guidelines for pain management specific to those individuals with kidney disease. Special precautions are needed to manage treatment of patients with reduced kidney function, who may be more prone to experiencing drug toxic effects, adverse effects, greater dose adjustment requirements, and drug interactions. Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used analgesics. Opioids may have extended half-life in patients with advanced CKD, with substantial effects on the central nervous system, resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, and addiction. Long-term opioid use is a risk factor for opioid abuse and dependence. Use of NSAIDs in patients with CKD may result in nephrotoxicity, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hypertension, and other complications. Therefore, patients with CKD may be especially at risk of receiving suboptimal pain control and inappropriate use of prescription analgesics.

The opioid epidemic has recently received considerable attention from clinicians, policy makers, and the public. However, to our knowledge, few studies have assessed use of analgesics and outcomes in patients with reduced kidney function, particularly with regard to the long-term effects. The present study sought first to examine trends from 2006 to 2015 in the use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older (age ≥ 65 years) patients with CKD in the US, and then to explore factors associated with opioid and NSAID use, as well as outcomes associated with their use, including development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and death. We hypothesized that prescription analgesic use would be higher in patients with CKD compared with the general population. Furthermore, we postulated that use of prescription NSAIDs would be associated with more rapid kidney disease progression to ESKD and opioid use with both higher mortality and advanced-stage or progressive kidney disease.

### Interventions for itch in people with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115mbrE5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Itch in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, often very distressing and associated with depression, reduced quality of life, and increased death. The most common first-line treatment has been the use of antihistamines despite the lack of substantial evidence for its use for uraemic itch. Few recommendations and guidelines exist for treatment.

Objectives

We aimed to determine: 1) the benefits and harms (both absolute and relative) of all topical and systemic interventions for the treatment of uraemic itch, either alone or in combination, when compared with placebo or standard care; and, 2) the dose strength or frequency, stage of kidney disease or method of dialysis used (where applicable) in cases where the effects of these interventions vary depending on co-interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 17 December 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with CKD stages 4 or 5 comparing treatments (pharmacological, topical, exposure, dialysis modality) for CKD associated itch to either placebo or other established treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently abstracted study data and assessed study quality. Data were analysed using a random effects meta-analysis design estimating the relative effects of treatment versus placebo. Estimates of the relative effects between treatments are included where possible. For continuous measures of severity of itch up to three months, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) were used. When reported, adverse effects were tabulated. The certainty of the evidence was estimated using GRADE.

Main Results

Ninety-two RCTs, randomising 4466 participants were included. Fifty-eight studies (3285 participants) provided sufficient data to be meta-analysed. Of these, 30 compared an intervention to a placebo or control. The 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was the dominant instrument utilized for itch reporting and the Duo score was used in a minority of studies. GABA analogues including, gabapentin and pregabalin, reduce itch in patients with CKD (5 studies, 297 participants: 4.95 cm reduction, 95% CI 5.46 to 4.44 lower in VAS compared to placebo; high certainty evidence). Kappa opioid agonists, including nalfurafine also reduced itch in this population (6 studies, 661 participants: 1.05 cm reduction, 95% CI 1.40 to 0.71 lower in VAS compared to placebo; high certainty evidence). Ondansetron had little or no effect on itch scores (3 studies, 183 participants: 0.38 cm reduction, 95% CI 1.04 lower to 0.29 higher in VAS compared to placebo; high certainty evidence). Reduction in the severity of itch was reported with oral montelukast, turmeric, zinc sulfate and topical capsaicin. For all other interventions, the certainty of the evidence was low to moderate, and the interventions had uncertain effects on uraemic pruritus. Six studies have disclosed significant financial support from their respective manufacturers, six were affected by lack of blinding, and 11 studies have 15 participants or less. Older, smaller RCTs often failed to follow intention-to-treat protocols with unexplained dropouts after randomisation. Adverse effects were generally poorly and inconsistently reported across all RCTs. No severe adverse events were reported for any intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

The RCTs of this meta-analysis contain a large array of interventions with a diverse set of comparators. For many interventions, trials are sparse. This served to make informative meta-analysis challenging. Of all treatments for uraemic pruritus, gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) were the most studied and show the greatest reduction in itch scores. Further RCTs, even of the scale of the largest trials included in this review, are unlikely to significantly change this finding. Kappa-opioid agonists (mainly nalfurafine) also may reduce itch, but indirect comparison suggests a much more modest effect in comparison to GABA analogues. Evidence for oral montelukast, turmeric, zinc sulfate, and topical capsaicin also showed an itch score reduction. However, these reductions were reported in small studies, and warrant further investigation. Ondansetron did not reduce itch. It is somewhat unlikely that a further study of ondansetron will change this result.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^114WjFyi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Morphine — all listed formulations — dosing in special populations: Information applies to all formulations of morphine listed. Elderly patients should be used with caution and at lower dose. In renal dysfunction, bioavailability is increased, clearance is decreased, and metabolites M3G and M6G accumulate significantly; reduce dose for CrCl of 30 to < 60 mL/min by 50 to 75%, and for CrCl of 15% to 30% reduce dose by 25% to 50% or avoid use.

### Opioids in renal failure and dialysis patients [^111cLPd9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

This article reviews the literature pertaining to the metabolism of several of the commonly used opioids, and the known activity of their metabolites. The effect of renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs and metabolites is then reviewed. Finally, the effect of renal dialysis on opioid drugs and metabolites is reviewed. Based on the review, it is recommended that morphine and codeine are avoided in renal failure/dialysis patients; hydromorphone or oxycodone are used with caution and close monitoring; and that methadone and fentanyl/sufentanil appear to be safe to use. Note is made that the "safe" drugs in renal failure are also the least dialyzable.

### The use of opioids in cancer patients with renal impairment-a systematic review [^117G3nCp]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Opioids are recommended for moderate to severe cancer pain; however, in patients with cancer, impaired renal function can affect opioid metabolism. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the current evidence for the use of opioids in cancer patients with renal impairment.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted and the following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966 to 2015), EMBASE (1980 2015) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (up to 2015). Eligible studies met the following criteria: patients with cancer pain taking an opioid (defined as per the WHO ladder); > 18 years; renal impairment (serum creatinine > normal range (study dependent), creatinine clearance (CrCl) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurements < 90 ml/min, or as per the study definition); clinical outcome related to renal impairment. All eligible studies were appraised using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system.

Results

Eighteen studies (n = 2422) were eligible but heterogeneity meant meta-analysis was not possible. Morphine was examined in eight studies (n = 1418), oxycodone in two studies (n = 325), and fentanyl, alfentanil or sufentanil were discussed in six studies in total (n = 442). No recommendations could be formulated on the preferred opioid in patients with renal impairment.

Conclusion

There is lack of consensus within the existing literature on the relationship between morphine, creatinine levels and morphine-related side effects. Based on the current evidence, morphine should be used with caution; however, more evidence is needed. Fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil are recommended in patients with renal impairment based on pharmacokinetics and clinical experience. However, the present systematic review found very little clinical evidence for this. Overall, the quality of the existing evidence on opioid treatment in cancer patients with renal impairment is low. There remains a need for high-quality clinical studies examining opioids in patients with renal impairment.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112kFuNT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids — morphine: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 10 to 30 mg every 4 hr. There is no optimal or maximum dose of morphine; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 30, Peak (min): 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 5, and t½ (hr): 2 to 4 in adults. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated give with extreme caution and use a lower dose; for hepatic dysfunction use carefully in patients with cirrhosis and consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval by 1.5 to 2 times, noting half-life may be doubled (3 to 4 hr) and bioavailability is increased; and for renal dysfunction reduce dose or, if severe renal impairment exists, avoid use. Other considerations include that M6G, an active metabolite, may accumulate in renal impairment, and M3G, a metabolite without analgesic activity, may accumulate in renal impairment and has been implicated in morphine-induced neurotoxicity, hyperalgesia, and allodynia.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^112VG6kk]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background pain control

If the patient is opioid naïve, commence a safe opioid at the lowest effective dose (select an opioid that does not have clinically relevant active metabolites that depend on renal excretion) and titrate to effect. The authors recognise that opioids are not considered appropriate for chronic pain. However, this is an acute pain arising in response to tissue injury and death and therefore, we recommend an opioid as first line therapy.

In opioid naïve patients who are starting an opioid for the first time a starting dose of alfentanil 0.5 mg continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) over 24 h is proposed. This is approximately equivalent to morphine 7.5 mg/24 h by subcutaneous infusion. The authors recommend alfentanil as it is not removed by dialysis, it does not cause toxicity in an ESRD population and it occupies a low volume in syringe drivers. This guidance is drawn from literature on the use of opioids in cancer patients with severe and end stage terminal illness and is supported by the clinical pharmacology literature. Fentanyl by CSCI is an alternative.

Where the patient is not opioid naïve, convert their existing opioid to alfentanil by CSCI. Palliative medicine team can help with conversions if this is outside of the usual scope of practice of the general clinician. Titrate daily to either pain relief or toxicity. Increases in background analgesia are usually of the order of 30–50% every 24 h having checked for any signs or symptoms of opioid neurotoxicity. Symptoms of neurotoxicity include troublesome confusion or cognitive slowing, misperceptions or visual hallucinations. If neurotoxicity occurs reduce the dose of opioids by 30% and add adjuvant analgesics e.g. gabapentinoid.

Thirty percentage of patients will experience nausea for 3–5 days on starting an opioid. Ensure that an antiemetic is available for use as and when needed e.g. metoclopramide 10 mg per oral (PO) or subcutaneously (SC) three times a day. Patients will experience constipation and need to be prescribed a regular daily laxative. Senna 7.5 mg twice a day is recommended as a starting dose.

### Morphine sulfate (Mitigo) [^112x8S34]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Morphine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Hepatic or Renal Impairment

The elimination half-life of morphine may be prolonged in patients with reduced metabolic rates and with hepatic and/or renal dysfunction. Hence, care should be exercised in administering MITIGO®epidurally to patients with these conditions. High blood morphine levels, due to reduced clearance, may take several days to develop.

Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm. (8.1)
Hepatic and Renal Impairment: May affect the metabolism and excretion of MITIGO®. (8.6)

Opioids versus NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring dialysis — associations with outcomes and utilization: In a prospective cohort followed for a median of 6.8 years, baseline full-agonist opioid and NSAID use were 9.9% and 15.5% respectively; baseline opioid use was associated with increased risk for a kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and death, whereas baseline NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite outcome and hospitalization, with outcomes not consistent among subgroups, and overall opioid use had a stronger association with adverse effects than NSAIDs. Given benefits and risks, some reviews now recommend considering cautious time-limited use of NSAIDs with consideration of individual risk factors, SDM, and careful monitoring.

VA/DoD CKD — opioid selection and buprenorphine use in chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) emphasizes that concomitant use of other sedating medications should be avoided, and that use of opioids whose metabolites are less dependent on kidney function, such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine, is preferred; patients should be provided with overdose education as well as a prescription for naloxone. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist available in several different formulations (e.g., patch, buccal, sublingual), which has a beneficial effect on pain intensity in the general population; due to its partial agonism, it has lower risk for respiratory sedation and overdose, and it is metabolized in the liver, requires no dose adjustment in CKD, and is not dialyzed. In patients with CKD who have an indication for opioid initiation or are already on full agonist opioids, Buprenorphine may provide a safer alternative for pain management, and sublingual (but not buccal or transdermal) buprenorphine is also indicated for the treatment of OUD; the 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain suggests the use of buprenorphine instead of full agonist opioids due to lower risk of overdose and misuse, and a waiver is no longer required for prescribing any formulation of buprenorphine.

### Morphine-6-glucuronide is responsible for the analgesic effect after morphine administration: a quantitative review of morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, and morphine-3-glucuronide [^1151Dbsg]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) is a strong µ-receptor agonist with higher affinity than morphine itself. It has been suggested that M6G contributes to the analgesic effect after administration of morphine, but the extent of its contribution remains unclear.

Methods

In order to elucidate the relative contribution of both drugs to the overall analgesic effect mediated by the µ-receptor, published data on µ-receptor binding, plasma protein binding, concentrations [preferably area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)] of morphine and M6G in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or concentration ratios were used to calculate free CSF concentration corrected for receptor binding for each compound. To compare different routes of administration, free CSF concentrations of M and M6G corrected for potency were added and compared with oral administration.

Results

Based on AUC data, there is a major contribution of M6G to the overall analgesic effect; the mean contributions being estimated as 96.6%, 85.6%, 85.4%, and 91.3% after oral, s.c., i.v., and rectal administration of morphine, respectively. In patients with renal insufficiency, 97.6% of the analgesic effect is caused by M6G when morphine is given orally. Owing to accumulation of M6G over time in these patients, morphine may be regarded as a prodrug.

Conclusions

When administering morphine to patients, the analgesic effect is mainly caused by M6G instead of morphine itself, irrespective of the route of administration. Therefore, the patient's kidney function plays a key role in determining the optimal daily dose of morphine.

Data Evaluation and Discussion

Opioids for Cancer Pain

Prior to evaluating best practices for interventional methods of pain relief in the cancer patient it is valuable to review the current evidence for commonly used non-invasive options.

As pain can be moderate to severe in up to 50% of all individuals with cancer, opioids are commonly used in this patient population. The WHO developed a three step "Ladder" for treatment of cancer pain that recommends non-opioid medications first, followed by mild opioids, and lastly by strong opioids until the patient has achieved pain control. Adjuvant medications may be initiated at any step in the treatment process. Methadone has numerous clinical and pharmacological considerations differentiating it from other opioids and is addressed separately below.

Opioid agent selection should be individualized to account for the variance in pain presentations and co-existing medical comorbidities. Morphine and codeine should be avoided in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); hydromorphone or oxycodone can be used with caution, while methadone and fentanyl appear to be safe to use. Similarly, liver function plays a key role in the activation, transformation, and metabolism of opioid medications. Opioid selection and dosing schedule should be carefully reviewed in patients with liver dysfunction. Methadone, meperidine, and codeine should be avoided in patients with liver dysfunction, while dose adjustments might be required with morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and tramadol. Certain long-acting opioids with known immunosuppressive properties (ie, morphine, fentanyl, methadone) have been found to have increased incidence of infections compared to those without immunosuppressive properties (ie, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tramadol), and this must be carefully considered given the cancer-induced immunocompromised state in this patient population. Ultimately, the choice of opioid might be limited by the insurance coverage. Codeine, morphine, fentanyl, and methadone are the opioids listed on the WHO essential drug list and might be more accessible compared to some of the newer opioids, such as buprenorphine.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1126CHor]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid prescribing guidelines — older adults on chronic opioid therapy: Chronic opioid therapy in older adults may be associated with multiple adverse effects related to reduced hepatic and renal function, increased susceptibility to accumulation of opioids within a small therapeutic window, exacerbation of cognitive impairment, increased risk of medication errors, risk of falls, and finally, multiple comorbidities related to medical conditions and other drug therapies. While opioid therapy can improve the QOL in this population, it is essential to exercise additional caution in older adults when providing chronic opioid therapy, and pharmacological titration must be carefully adjusted due to declining organ function, presence of concurrent diseases, and polypharmacy.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112dgYFH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### A history of chronic opioid usage prior to kidney transplantation may be associated with increased mortality risk [^116s5TEm]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic opioid usage (COU) for analgesia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease. In order to test whether a prior history of COU negatively affects post-kidney transplant outcomes, we retrospectively examined clinical outcomes in adult kidney transplant patients. Among 1064 adult kidney transplant patients, 452 (42.5%) reported the presence of various body pains and 108 (10.2%) reported a prior history of COU. While the overall death or kidney graft loss was not statistically different between patients with and without a history of COU, the cumulative mortality rate at 1, 3, and 5 years after transplantation, and during the entire study period, appeared significantly higher for patients with than without a history of COU (6.5, 18.5, and 20.4 vs. 3.2, 7.5, and 12.7%, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for potential confounding factors in entire cohorts and Cox regression analysis in 1:3 propensity-score matched cohorts suggest that a positive history of COU was significantly associated with nearly a 1.6- to 2-fold increase in the risk of death (hazard ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.04–2.60, and hazard ratio 1.92, 95% confidence interval 1.08–3.42, respectively). Thus, a history of chronic opioid usage prior to transplantation appears to be associated with increased mortality risk. Additional studies are warranted to confirm the observed association and to understand the mechanisms.

### Intradialytic clearance of opioids: methadone versus hydromorphone [^115LTD5v]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Opioids are commonly prescribed to patients with chronic pain associated with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. The stability of opioid analgesia during dialysis may vary among different opioids. No studies to date have corroborated this clinical observation by directly comparing plasma concentrations of different opioids during dialysis. We compared changes in peridialysis plasma concentrations of 2 pharmacokinetically distinct opioids, methadone and hydromorphone (HM). Fourteen dialysis patients with chronic pain received either methadone or HM for at least 2 weeks before beginning the study. Blood samples were obtained immediately before, during, and after hemodialysis in 2 separate dialysis sessions, 1 week apart, and were analyzed for opioid concentrations. Methadone plasma concentrations were more stable during hemodialysis compared to HM: the mean percent change of methadone plasma levels was 14.9% ± 8.2% (± SD) compared with 55.1% ± 8.1% in the HM treatment group, a difference of 40.2% (95% confidence interval 17.14 to 63.14). The mean plasma clearance of methadone was 19.9 ± 8.5 mL/min (± SD) compared with 105.7 ± 8.3 mL/min for HM, a difference of 85.7 mL/min (95% confidence interval 61.9 to 109.1). There were no differences between the 2 opioid groups in pain scores, side effect profile, and quality of life. Methadone therapy was not associated with an increased rate of adverse events. If confirmed by larger clinical studies, methadone could be considered as one of the opioids of choice in dialysis patients.

Morphine — other considerations: Morphine SR is preferred first-line long-acting agent because of similar efficacy to other long-acting opioids, comparable safety profile, provider familiarity with use, and lower cost. The metabolite M6G may accumulate in renal impairment and contribute to excessive opioid effects, and M3G, a metabolite without analgesic activity, may accumulate in renal impairment and has been implicated in morphine-induced neurotoxicity, hyperalgesia, and allodynia.

Short-acting opioids — hydromorphone: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 2 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and an initial dose of 4 to 8 mg may be given for severe pain. There is no optimal or maximum dose of hydromorphone; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 4, and t½ (hr): 2 to 3. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated use with caution and start at 25% to 50% of usual dose at the low end of the dosing range, and for hepatic or renal dysfunction reduce initial dose by 25% to 50% of usual dose depending on degree of impairment. Other considerations note women appear to have a 25% higher Cmax than men, and hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation to active metabolites (mainly hydro-morphone 3-glucuronide) can accumulate in renal impairment.

### Pain management in older adults [^112mqZbs]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults but is underrecognized and undertreated. The approach to pain assessment and management in older adults requires an understanding of the physiology of aging, validated assessment tools, and common pain presentations among older adults.

Objective

To identify the overall principles of pain management in older adults with a specific focus on common painful conditions and approaches to pharmacologic treatment.

Methods

We searched PubMed for common pain presentations in older adults with heart failure, end-stage renal disease, dementia, frailty, and cancer. We also reviewed guidelines for pain management. Our review encompassed 2 guidelines, 10 original studies, and 22 review articles published from 2000 to the present. This review does not discuss nonpharmacologic treatments of pain.

Results

Clinical guidelines support the use of opioids in persistent nonmalignant pain. Opioids should be used in patients with moderate or severe pain or pain not otherwise controlled but with careful attention to potential toxic effects and half-life. In addition, clinical practice guidelines recommend use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with extreme caution and for defined, limited periods.

Conclusion

An understanding of the basics of pain pathophysiology, assessment, pharmacologic management, and a familiarity with common pain presentations will allow clinicians to effectively manage pain for older adults.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^1133xnWv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Avoid morphine, oxycodone, tramadol or codeine as background analgesia as they can rarely be titrated to effect in this population without opioid-induced neurotoxicity. Once pain is stable, transdermal fentanyl or buprenorphine may be used in place of opioids by continuous subcutaneous infusion. If the lesions heal and pain resolves it is important to reduce the opioids step by step and aim to withdraw them fully.

To address the neuropathic element of pain secondary to calciphylaxis, gabapentin 100 mg after each haemodialysis session or pregabalin 25 mg after each haemodialysis session may be used in conjunction with opioids. If the patient is not on haemodialysis, start with a dose of 100 mg of gabapentin on alternate days or 25 mg of pregabalin on alternate days. Caution is needed as gabapentinoids accumulate in ESRD though they are removed by dialysis.

Discuss the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the nephrology team as they are very effective for the management of the inflammatory aspect of pain secondary to calciphylaxis. If residual renal function is not important, use an oral or parenteral NSAID (e.g. ketorolac) by continuous subcutaneous infusion for pain that is not controlled with the measures outlined above. Cover with a proton pump inhibitor is recommended. In general, NSAIDs are best used at the minimally effective dose and for a short duration but their harms are weighed against their opioid sparing effect.

If background pain remains problematic or dose-limiting toxicity is encountered, consider the addition of methadone as a co-analgesic or rotation to methadone from the current opioid. This step may require hospice inpatient care and should only be undertaken with specialist palliative care guidance.

Breakthrough pain control

Even when background pain control is achieved, the patient may continue to experience spontaneous breakthrough pain. Oxycodone 1–2 mg may be used by oral or by subcutaneous injection on a four hourly to 6 hourly basis. In countries where hydromorphone is available, 0.5 mg of hydromorphone sublingually four hourly is useful.

### Cautious use and optimal dose of morphine for relieving malignant pain in a complex patient with multiple comorbidities [^115sdLTH]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Oral morphine remains the drug of choice for the management of severe pain due to cancer as per WHO ladder of analgesia. Providing adequate pain relief in palliative care settings for pain due to cancer is challenging. Options become limited in cases of associated systemic comorbidities such as renal dysfunction, hypoproteinaemia, anaemia. Patients with renal dysfunction and other comorbidities may develop drug overdose due to abnormal pharmacokinetics. Renal dysfunction affects the pharmacokinetics of morphine by altering its absorption, metabolism and clearance. Plasma albumin also influences drug availability, its plasma distribution and thus available free morphine for its clinical effect. Morphine should be used cautiously for the treatment of pain in patients with renal failure, hypoproteinaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and anaemia. In such patients, alternate opiates like fentanyl, hydromorphone, or oxycodone may be used as these drugs are not significantly excreted by the kidneys.

### Mortality risk in chronic kidney disease patients transitioning to dialysis: impact of opiate and non-opiate use [^115S4yZo]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Population-based studies show there is a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients suffering from chronic pain. While opiates are frequently prescribed in non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) patients, there may be toxic accumulation of metabolites, particularly among those progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We examined the association of opiate versus other analgesic use during the pre-ESRD period with post-ESRD mortality among NDD-CKD patients transitioning to dialysis.

Methods

We examined a national cohort of US Veterans with NDD-CKD who transitioned to dialysis over 2007–14. Among patients who received ≥ 1 prescription(s) in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System within 1 year of transitioning to dialysis, we examined associations of pre-ESRD analgesic status, defined as opiate, gabapentin/pregabalin, other non-opiate analgesic, versus no analgesic use, with post-ESRD mortality using multivariable Cox models.

Results

Among 57,764 patients who met eligibility criteria, pre-ESRD opiate and gabapentin/pregabalin use were each associated with higher post-ESRD mortality (ref: no analgesic use), whereas non-opiate analgesic use was not associated with higher mortality in expanded case-mix analyses: HRs (95% CIs) 1.07 (1.05–1.10), 1.07 (1.01–1.13), and 1.00 (0.94–1.06), respectively. In secondary analyses, increasing frequency of opiate prescriptions exceeding 1 opiate prescription in the 1-year pre-ESRD period was associated with incrementally higher post-ESRD mortality (ref: no analgesic use).

Conclusions

In NDD-CKD patients transitioning to dialysis, pre-ESRD opiate and gabapentin/pregabalin use were associated with higher post-ESRD mortality, whereas non-opiate analgesic use was not associated with death. There was a graded association between increasing frequency of pre-ESRD opiate use and incrementally higher mortality.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115bZfD2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥ 65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

### Pain management in CKD: a guide for nephrology providers [^111Y2m1v]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Although pain is one of the most commonly experienced symptoms by patients with chronic kidney disease, it is under-recognized, the severity is underestimated, and the treatment is inadequate. Pain management is one of the general primary palliative care competencies for medical providers. This review provides nephrology providers with basic skills for pain management. These skills include recognition of types of pain (nociceptive and neuropathic) syndromes and appropriate history-taking skills. Through this history, providers can identify clinical circumstances in which specialist referral is beneficial, including those who are at high risk for addiction, at risk for adverse effects to medications, and those with complicated care needs such as patients with a limited prognosis. Management of pain begins with the development of a shared treatment plan, identification of appropriate medications, and continual follow-up and assessment of efficacy and adverse effects. Through adequate pain management, providers can positively affect the health of individual patients and the performance of health care systems.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114eCzcq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent use. Because of the longer half-life and longer duration of effects (e.g. respiratory depression) of ER/LA opioids (e.g. methadone, fentanyl patches, or extended-release versions of oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, or morphine), clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for the treatment of acute pain. ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain and should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of immediate-release opioids daily (e.g. 60 mg daily of oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral oxycodone, or equianalgesic dosages of other opioids) for at least 1 week. When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate-release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross-tolerance. Clinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to accumulation of medications to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations. Although in certain situations clinicians might need to prescribe immediate-release and ER/LA opioids together (e.g. when transitioning patients from ER/LA opioids to immediate-release opioids by temporarily using lower dosages of both, for temporary postoperative use of short-term opioids in a patient already receiving ER/LA opioids, or in patients with opioid use disorder treated and stabilized on methadone who need short-acting opioids for acute pain), clinicians should consider the potential for increased overdose risk and use caution when prescribing immediate-release opioids in combination with ER/LA opioids.

### Dosimetrically administered nebulized morphine for breathlessness in very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized, controlled trial [^116WK1Fj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Subjects

Subjects were recruited from the Pomeranian Model of Integrated Care for Patients With Severe COPD led by the Department of Allergology and Pneumonology at the University Clinical Centre, Gdańsk, Poland. Recruitment took place from 04.03.2014 to 01.03.2016. A total of 270 patients were screened, 30 of whom met the following inclusion criteria: (a) age above 50 years; (b) diagnosis of COPD group D, according to 2013 Global Initiative For Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines (considering most recent FEV₁% values from spirometry, performed in stable state) which are consistent with their 2017 version; (c) stage IV airflow limitation i.e. FEV₁% < 30%, according to 2011 GOLD classification; (d) breathlessness rated 3 or 4 in the modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC) breathlessness scale; (e) current non-smoker; (f) written informed consent. Exclusion criteria included: (a) other coexisting severe chronic lung diseases, such as lung cancer; (a) breathlessness caused by other than COPD chronic diseases, such as heart failure or renal failure; (c) inability to give informed consent; (d) previous history of respiratory depression after opioid administration or allergic reactions to opioids; (e) ongoing opioid treatment for any indication; and (f) COPD exacerbation within the last month.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^115tP37h]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methadone — For long-acting opioid therapy, methadone is available as 5 and 10 mg tablets and an oral solution, 5 or 10 mg/ 5 ml, for every 8 to 12 hr administration. Initial dosing should start low and go slow and should not be used for as-needed supplemental OT; an initial dose of 2.5 to 5 mg orally every 8 to 12 hr may be used, with more frequent administration (every 6 hr) during initiation if needed to maintain analgesia. Dose change increments of 2.5 mg every 8 hr may be made every 5 to 7 days; delayed analgesia or toxicity may occur due to accumulation after repeated doses (e.g., days 2 to 5), and if excessive sedation occurs, temporarily hold doses, lower the dose, and/or slow titration; once a stable analgesic dose is reached, the dosing interval may be extended to every 8 to 12 hr or longer. In special populations, consider reduced dosing in elderly or debilitated patients; in hepatic dysfunction, no dosage adjustments are required in stable chronic liver disease or mild-to-moderate hepatic dysfunction and avoid in severe liver disease; in renal dysfunction, dosage reduction by up to 50–75% is recommended in patients with CrCl < 10 mL/ min. Other considerations include that prescribers of methadone should be thoroughly familiar with its complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties or consult an experienced clinician; the plasma half-life is 22 to 128 hr short- term and 24 to 48 hr at steady-state and may be longer than the analgesic duration; methadone has little cross-tolerance with other opioids and even patients with a high degree of opioid tolerance may be at risk for overdose when switched; methadone is the only long-acting opioid available as an oral solution.

Oxycodone extended-release (ER) — formulations, initial dosing, titration, bioequivalence, special populations, and administration are specified as follows: Tablets are available in 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 mg strengths for every 12 hr administration and capsules in 9, 13.5, 18, 27 and 36 mg strengths for every 12 hr administration. Opioid-naïve patients start at 10 mg (tablets) or 9 mg (capsules) orally every 12 hr; opioid tolerant patients should convert to the equianalgesic daily dose of oxycodone ER and reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for the initial start dose. Dose change increments may increase to 20 mg (tablets) or 18 mg (capsules) every 12 hr after 1 or 2 days, and thereafter the total daily dose may be increased by 25–50% every 1 or 2 days. ER tablets are not bioequivalent to ER capsules; 10 mg oxycodone HCl (ER tablet) = 9 mg oxycodone base (ER capsule), and steady state is achieved in 24 to 36 hr with repeat dosing. In special populations, plasma concentrations are increased ~15% in the elderly, ~50% in patients with renal dysfunction with CrCl < 60 ml/min, and patients with hepatic dysfunction should reduce initial dose to 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose and monitor closely. Other considerations include that it is recommended for patients who experience intolerable, unmanageable adverse effects to long- acting morphine; both ER tablets and ER capsules have abuse deterrent labeling; ER tablets should be swallowed whole, not broken, chewed, or crushed; and ER capsules may be opened and sprinkled on soft food or administered via feeding tube.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^116131ng]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid prescribing — agent selection and cautions: Reasonable, first line opioid choices for mild pain often include tramadol, codeine, Tapentadol, or hydrocodone; for second line mild to moderate pain therapy, clinicians can start with hydrocodone or oxycodone; and for severe pain, first line therapy may begin with hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, or morphine, with second line therapy with fentanyl and third line therapy with methadone. Buprenorphine should be considered as a viable alternative to strong opioids in moderate to severe chronic pain therapy, and the literature suggests that codeine and tramadol may confer a lower abuse risk than more potent opioids. Meperidine is not recommended for chronic pain treatment due to adverse neurological events, which are increased with long-term use, renal insufficiency, and concurrent benzodiazepine use.

### African Americans with cancer pain are more likely to receive an analgesic with toxic metabolite despite clinical risks: a mediation analysis study [^115kGRpb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Renal impairment is highly prevalent among patients with cancer, and many patients have undiagnosed chronic kidney disease (CKD) from underlying disease, treatment, or both. African American individuals have disproportionate risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) predisposing them to CKD. We investigated whether African American patients are more likely than white patients to receive morphine with 3- and 6-glucuronide metabolites, which are known to be neurotoxic and accumulate in CKD; whether insurance type mediates the relationship between race and the prescriber's opioid selection; and whether the chosen opioid has a resultant negative effect according to race.

Patients and Methods

Patients (N = 182) were recruited from oncology clinics within the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Inclusion was based on self-identified African American or white race, age older than 18 years, and the presence of cancer-related pain plus a prescription for morphine or oxycodone. Kidney function was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.

Results

Patients with CKD who received morphine reported a greater severity of analgesic-related adverse effects than patients with CKD who received oxycodone (P = 0.010). Controlling for health insurance type, African American patients had 71% lower odds of receiving a prescription of oxycodone than white patients (P < .001). Limiting analysis to those with CKD, the effect of private insurance became insignificant. However, race still remained a significant predictor of the prescribed opioid selection. Race was a strong predictor of adverse effect severity in the presence of CKD, and the type of opioid selection partially mediated this relationship.

Conclusion

Reducing racial disparities in the type of opioid prescription and understanding mechanisms of disproportionate opioid-related adverse effects in African American patients might decrease the clinical disparities in cancer pain outcomes.

### Kidney function modifies the effect of intraoperative opioid dosage on postoperative delirium [^111ZJC5w]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There are few studies demonstrating how kidney function affects the risk of developing delirium in older adult surgical patients administered opioids. This study determined whether baseline kidney function influences the relationship between morphine equivalent dose and the development of delirium on postoperative day (POD) 2 in patients with hip fracture.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed emergency department (ED) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), perioperative serum creatinine, intravenous morphine equivalents, and POD2 delirium assessment by the Confusion Assessment Method in 652 patients aged 65years or older without preoperative delirium. ED eGFR was used to divide subjects into groups by presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and associations of opioid dose with POD2 delirium were compared using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

POD2 delirium incidence was 29.8% (N = 194). Intraoperative and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) morphine equivalent dosage as well as ED eGFR were similar comparing patients with and without POD2 delirium. Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, and dementia were associated with delirium on POD2. The odds of POD2 delirium increased significantly with increase of intraoperative opioid in patients with CKD (odds ratio = 1.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.2–2.2), but not in patients without CKD (P-interaction = .04). PACU or POD1 opioid doses were not associated with POD2 delirium after covariate adjustment.

Conclusion

This study suggests that incremental increases in intraoperative opioids combined with CKD increase odds of POD2 delirium after hip fracture repair, compared with patients without CKD.

Short-acting, orally administered opioids — codeine (alone or in combination with APAP or ASA) — initial oral dosing in opioid-naïve adults is 15 to 30 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and for combination products the Maximum APAP dose: 4000 mg/d (2000 mg/d in chronic alcoholics or in hepatic impairment). Pharmacokinetics are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 4 to 6, and t½ (hr): ~3. In special populations: Elderly or debilitated: Use with caution; Hepatic dysfunction: Conversion to active metabolite (morphine) may be reduced in patients with cirrhosis; avoid use in patients with liver disease; and Renal dysfunction: Use lower dosage or an alternative analgesic. Other considerations note that Codeine may be less effective in patients with decreased CYP-2D6 activity (due to poor CYP-2D6 metabolism or CYP-2D6 inhibiting drugs) because of decreased conversion to the active metabolite, morphine, and that CYP-2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers can have extensive conversion to morphine with increase in opioid-mediated effects.

### Association of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs with outcomes in CKD: findings from the CRIC (chronic renal insufficiency cohort) study [^111WPBbA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Safe analgesic choices are limited in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a comparative analysis of harm from opioids versus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in CKD.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

3,939 patients with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.

Exposures

30-day analgesic use reported at annual visits.

Outcomes

A composite outcome of 50% glomerular filtration rate reduction and kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT), as well as the outcomes of kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and pre-kidney failure death.

Analytical Approach

Marginal structural models with time-updated exposures.

Results

Participants were followed up for a median of 6.84 years, with 391 (9.9%) and 612 (15.5%) reporting baseline opioid and NSAID use, respectively. Time-updated opioid use was associated with the kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure with KRT, death (HRs of 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2–1.7], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1–1.7], and 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2–2.0], respectively), and hospitalization (rate ratio [RR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6–1.9) versus opioid nonusers. Similar results were found in an analysis restricted to a subcohort of participants reporting ever using other (nonopioid and non-NSAID) analgesics or tramadol. Time-updated NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.5) and hospitalization (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0–1.3); however, these associations were not significant in the subcohort. The association of NSAID use with the kidney disease composite outcome varied by race, with a significant risk in blacks (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7). NSAID use was associated with lower risk for kidney failure with KRT in women and individuals with glomerular filtration rate < 45mL/min/1.73 m² (HRs of 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45–0.88] and 0.77 [95% CI, 0.59–0.99], respectively).

Limitations

Limited periods of recall of analgesic use and potential confounding by indication.

Conclusions

Opioid use had a stronger association with adverse events than NSAIDs, with the latter's association with kidney disease outcomes limited to specific subgroups, notably those of black race.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^116uanhy]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Pain is a common symptom among patients with kidney disease. However, little is known about use of analgesics among patients aged 65 years or older with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who do not receive dialysis treatment.

Objective

To assess national trends and geographic variations in use of opioids and prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in older adults with and without CKD in the US (2006–2015) and examine associations between use of opioids and patient outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used the 5% Medicare claims data (2005–2015) to select 10 retrospective annual cohorts of Medicare Part D beneficiaries aged 65 years and older from 2006 to 2015 and a retrospective longitudinal cohort. Data were analyzed in August 2019.

Exposures

CKD status and other comorbidities identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Analgesic use was measured by overall use (proportion of ever used opioids/NSAIDs), long-term use (prescribed > 90 days), and cumulative use (total annual days' supply). Patient outcomes included progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and all-cause mortality.

Results

A total of 6 260 454 beneficiaries (9.6% identified with CKD by claims) were selected in the annual cohorts and 649 339 beneficiaries (8.3% identified with CKD) were selected in the longitudinal cohort. There was significant growth in opioid use (31.2%-42.4%) and NSAID use (10.7%-16.6%) among patients aged 65 years and older with CKD from 2006 to 2015. Long-term use of opioids increased during 2006 to 2014 (25.8%-36.7%) but decreased through 2015 at 35.6%, while long-term use of NSAIDs remained stable. Opioid use was higher in patients with CKD, particularly CKD stages 4 to 5 (odds ratio [OR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.33–1.37; P < .001) compared with non-CKD. NSAID use was lower in patients with CKD stages 4 to 5 (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.54–0.56; P < .001). Substantial geographic variations in analgesic use were observed across states (opioid use in CKD: 24.7%-54.3%; NSAID use in CKD: 11.2%-20.8%, 2012–2015). Opioid use was associated with progression to ESKD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04–1.16; p = 0.001) and death (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.18–1.20; P < .001) independent of CKD status and other covariates. There was an inverse association between NSAID use and death (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.83–0.85; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among Medicare patients with CKD, use of prescription analgesics, both opioid and NSAID, increased from 2006 to 2015. Optimizing pain management in a complex condition such as kidney disease should remain a priority for clinicians and researchers alike.

Oxymorphone extended-release (ER) tablets — dosing in special populations specifies that in renal dysfunction, bioavailability is increased by 57% in moderate impairment and by 65% in severe impairment; in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min, oxymorphone should be started with the lowest dose and titrated slowly. For hepatic dysfunction, use with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment, starting with lowest dose and titrating slowly, and it is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^114JUPfa]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, there is wide variation in the current management of pain in calciphylaxis, amongst renal and palliative care physicians. The rarity of the condition and severity of pain are particularly challenging for non-pain specialists who have a tendency to revert to familiar drugs such as opioids. Moreover, there are no published guidelines or recommendations to support clinicians with decision-making.

### Drug dosing adjustments in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1157QyjE]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition (e.g., absorption, drug distribution, nonrenal clearance [metabolism]). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

### High-dose opioid utilization and mortality among individuals initiating hemodialysis [^111B8TpD]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals undergoing hemodialysis frequently report moderate to severe pain, and receive three-fold more opioid prescriptions than the general United States population. Since 2007 over half of individuals on hemodialysis received at least one opioid prescription. In 2010, almost one-quarter of individuals on dialysis received opioids for 90 or more days. Together, these data suggest high-dose opioid utilization among hemodialysis patients may be common.

Between 1999 and 2011, aggressive marketing of prescription opioids and other forces, converged to drive unprecedented increases in opioid prescribing, addiction and overdose death in the United States. While numerous investigations have examined these matters in the general population, fewer have characterized the impact of the opioid epidemic among individuals with kidney disease, including those on hemodialysis. This is important because individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) may be likely to be prescribed high doses of opioids and those undergoing hemodialysis, in particular, face a disproportionately high risk of opioid-related adverse events. For example, hydrocodone and oxycodone, which are the two most commonly prescribed opioids among adults undergoing hemodialysis, are recommended to be used with caution among patients with renal impairment due to the possible accumulation of parent drug and/or metabolites. We sought to expand upon prior investigations examining the impact of opioid utilization among adults undergoing hemodialysis by accounting for large variations in opioid doses across people and time.

The goals of our study were to: 1) characterize the prevalence of high-dose opioid utilization among individuals undergoing hemodialysis and 2) quantify the relationship between opioid dose and risk of death. A more thorough understanding of what doses of opioids may increase the risk of mortality may assist clinicians, patients and policy-makers in improving pain management and reducing mortality among hemodialysis patients in the United States.

### Methylnaltrexone bromide (Relistor) [^116gLcef]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Information

Be within close proximity to toilet facilities once RELISTOR is administered.
Discontinue RELISTOR if treatment with the opioid pain medication is also discontinued.
In adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC:
Patients receiving opioids for less than 4 weeks may be less responsive to RELISTOR [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
Discontinue all maintenance laxative therapy prior to initiation of RELISTOR. Laxative(s) can be used as needed if there is a suboptimal response to RELISTOR after three days.
Re-evaluate the continued need for RELISTOR when the opioid regimen is changed to avoid adverse reactions.
In patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, take RELISTOR tablets with water on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.

2.2 Opioid-Induced Constipation in Adult Patients with Chronic Non-Cancer Pain

The recommended dosage of RELISTOR tablets is 450 mg taken orally once daily in the morning.
The recommended dosage of RELISTOR injection is 12 mg administered subcutaneously once daily.

2.3 Opioid-Induced Constipation in Adult Patients with Advanced Illness

The pre-filled syringe is only for patients who require a RELISTOR injection dose of 8 mg or 12 mg. Use the vial for patients who require other doses of RELISTOR injection.

Table 1 below shows the recommended weight-based dose of RELISTOR injection and the corresponding injection volume. The recommended dosage regimen is one dose administered subcutaneously every other day, as needed. Do not administer more frequently than one dose per 24-hour period.

2.4 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

The recommended dosage of RELISTOR in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (i.e., creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)], is shown below by indication:

OIC in Adult Patients with Chronic Non - Cancer Pain

RELISTOR tablets: 150 mg once daily in the morning.
RELISTOR injection: 6 mg administered subcutaneously once daily

OIC in Adult Patients with Advanced Illness

RELISTOR injection: The recommended dosage regimen is one dose every other day, as needed is shown in Table 2.

*Calculate the injection volume for these patients by multiplying the patient weight in kilograms by 0.00375 and then rounding up the volume to the nearest 0.1 mL.

### An approach to pain management in end stage renal disease: considerations for general management and intradialytic symptoms [^115FFPCH]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence and severity of symptoms in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is higher than those of the general population and comparable to those with other chronic and serious medical conditions. Despite the prevalence and severity in this population, symptoms continue to be under-recognized and inadequately managed. The recognition of specific intradialytic pain syndromes such as pain related to arteriovenous access, headaches, muscle cramps or generalized pain by providers may aid in improving patient compliance and quality of life. The approach to pain management in end stage renal disease patients follows that of the general population with specific considerations regarding clearance and potential side effects guiding selection of agents. Overall, evidence is limited regarding the pharmacology of many medications in this population.

### Oxycodone (Xtampza) [^113934eM]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.7 Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment, as evidenced by decreased creatinine clearance (< 60 mL/min), the concentrations of oxycodone in the plasma are approximately 50% higher than in subjects with normal renal function. Follow a conservative approach to dose initiation and adjust according to the clinical situation. Use of alternative analgesics is recommended for patients who require a dose of XTAMPZA ER less than 9 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Sex Differences

In pharmacokinetic studies with XTAMPZA ER, healthy female subjects demonstrate up to 20% higher oxycodone plasma exposures than males, even after considering differences in body weight or BMI. The clinical relevance of a difference of this magnitude is low for a drug intended for chronic usage at individualized dosages. In the Phase 3 clinical trial there was a greater frequency of typical opioid adverse events for females than males; there was no male/female difference detected for efficacy.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^1117eLiJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Examination of a 2010 study illustrates the shortcomings of clinical trial data for guiding opioid prescribing practices. In this open-label, prospective study, patients with chronic pain of cancer or noncancer origin (n = 326), which was not controlled by a long-acting opioid, were rotated to morphine immediate release (IR) 5 or 10 mg every 4 hours until adequate pain relief was achieved; they were then switched to a long-acting opioid different from baseline. The choice of the long-acting opioid used for rotation was left to the discretion of the investigator. In all, 70% of patients achieved adequate pain control after switching to morphine IR; after the subsequent rotation to a substitute long-acting opioid, the mean proportion of patients reporting breakthrough pain decreased from 73%–93% to 29%–49%, depending on the long-acting opioid. However, patients were excluded if they were on high doses of opioids, had a history of substance abuse, or had psychiatric, pulmonary, renal, and/or hepatic comorbidities.

Upon consideration, it becomes apparent that data from studies such as this, while of value, may be difficult to extrapolate to clinical practice. In a chronic pain practice most physicians, either knowingly or unknowingly, will approach a patient's treatment individually, using an "n of 1" approach. When prescribing opioids, this approach may start with an opioid that the physician is familiar and comfortable with and that has shown efficacy in the past; however, tailoring therapy will ultimately require consideration of the individual patient in ways that are not sufficiently addressed by clinical trials. Since clinical trials deal with distributions of a large number of patients whereas individual practitioners deal with individual patients, the "n of 1 trial" is a more empiric and common approach to treatment.

Case series have described a process wherein patients are prescribed sequential trials of up to five individual opioids in search of an agent that is effective and sufficiently well tolerated. However, the selection of agents and the sequence in which they are prescribed were not defined, leaving the reader without clear guidance. In addition, published case series typically do not provide specific information about patients' health status, making it difficult to estimate how certain patient characteristics may have influenced the outcomes observed following rotation. In short, rotation methodology presented in published studies or case series appears to be fixed or random rather than patient-specific.

### An Italian expert consensus on the use of opioids for the management of chronic non-oncological pain in clinical practice: focus on buprenorphine [^11298LQC]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate use of NSAIDS is particularly frequent in elderly people: a large population-based study conducted in Southern Italy recently demonstrated that 36.6% of elderly patients were incident NSAID users, and 9.2% were prescribed ketorolac/indomethacin, which should be avoided in elderly subjects. Furthermore, at least half of all elderly people with chronic kidney disease or congestive heart failure were prescribed NSAIDs, though these drugs should be avoided.

The 3-step approach of the WHO analgesic ladder for oncological pain is appropriate also for non-oncological chronic pain (Statement 3).

Comments: Complete disagreement with this statement was achieved both in the first (45.2%, median 3) and second (34.8%, median 3) round, confirming the need to identify treatment strategy alternatives to the WHO analgesic ladder, which better meet the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of CNCP.

The WHO analgesic ladder, proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986, is a strategy developed following the recommendations of an international group of experts to provide adequate pain relief for cancer patients. Such strategy has undergone several modifications over the years and is currently applied for managing cancer pain, as well as non-cancer painful conditions associated with degenerative disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, neuropathic pain disorders, and other types of chronic pathologies.

The advantage of the analgesic ladder is its ease of use, even by non-pain medicine experts. However, one important limitation of the WHO pain ladder derives from the role attributed to NSAIDs as first step drugs, which could lead to a false belief that this represents the most secure treatment, favoring its long-term use. In fact, long-term use of NSAIDs combined with opioids for the treatment of moderate pain (second step) can lead to much more serious side effects than those described for opioids.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^116bgxqN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest investigation of real-world use of prescription analgesics among older adults with and without CKD in the US, covering 2006 to 2015. Use of analgesics, particularly opioids, was high in the Medicare CKD population, increasing substantially between 2006 and 2013, then stabilizing or decreasing slightly thereafter. A higher proportion of opioid vs prescription NSAID use was found in patients with CKD compared with non-CKD Medicare beneficiaries. As expected, cumulative use of analgesics, both opioids and prescription NSAIDs, decreased with CKD progression. This prescription pattern could be associated with patients with advanced CKD being more susceptible to toxic effects and adverse effects in the setting of reduced kidney function. Additionally, NSAIDs were widely used in earlier stages of CKD while opioids were more frequently used in patients with advanced CKD. This finding may reflect both the variation in severity of pain by CKD stage, as opioids are typically used to treat moderate to severe pain, and avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with more advanced CKD, in whom risk of progression is higher with use of this class of medication owing to the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on prostaglandin synthesis in the kidneys, with resultant potential for intrakidney ischemia.

Opioid prescribing in renal impairment — evidence base and agent selection are summarized. Worsening renal function occurs frequently in patients with lung cancer requiring palliative care and renal impairment increases the possibility of opioid toxicity. A review for cancer pain in renal impairment identified Fifteen clinical studies were identified, but no RCTs were included and the evidence was considered of very low quality. The direct clinical evidence is insufficient to permit a recommendation but suggests that the risk profile differs between opioids; from pharmacokinetics, extrapolation from noncancer pain, and clinical experience, fentanyl, alfentanil, and methadone are identified, with caveats, as being the least likely to cause harm. If morphine is used, either increasing the dosing interval or reducing the total dose can minimize the side effects, and the SIGN guidelines on cancer pain are recommended for guidance on individual opioids in this situation.

### Continuous infusion of IV morphine for cancer pain… [^113nqz5G]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Morphine sulfate is a strong opioid that is often used to treat moderate to severe chronic pain in patients with cancer. Oral administration is preferred, and doses should be given at regular intervals around the clock to provide good pain control. The use of oral morphine provides effective pain control in most cancer patients with pain. When oral morphine is ineffective, the next option is parenteral morphine. The preferred route is intravenous because it provides good analgesic effect and can be titrated quickly. Most studies about this route were small or short-term. Glare and associates studied the effectiveness of continuous intravenous morphine in the pain management of patients with advanced cancer. They also studied the adverse effects of this pain-management strategy. The study was a retrospective review of cancer patients who were managed in a palliative care program and had moderate to severe pain.

Data collected included information about pain mechanism, preinfusion opioid choice and dosage, other medications used, indication for parenteral morphine infusion, and information about adverse effects. Demographic data and information about primary and secondary cancer sites also were collected. Pain control was rated as good, partial, poor, or uncertain, based on the assessment of the palliative care team. The most common indication for continuous infusion of morphine was to relieve uncontrolled pain. Pain control was considered good in 69 percent of the patients, partial in 23 percent, and poor in 6 percent. The two main reasons for discontinuing intravenous morphine were patient death or a switch back to oral morphine. Forty-eight percent of the patients reported having no side effects. The most common side effect was constipation, followed by sedation and confusion.

Five percent of patients had respiratory depression, most often resolving with a morphine dosage reduction. Only 26 patients had side effects that were serious enough to require a dosage reduction. The authors also noted that the conversion to oral morphine was consistent with information from previous publications suggesting that the conversion ratio should be 3: 1, oral to parenteral. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The authors conclude that continuous-infusion intravenous morphine sulfate provides safe and effective pain management in cancer patients with moderate to severe pain. Dose-limiting side effects are unusual, and many patients with side effects respond favorably to dosage reduction.

### Low-dosage oral morphine relieves refractory dyspnea… [^112JhdSF]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, some physicians have found them effective, and Australian consensus guidelines for palliative care indicate that opioids contribute to the management of refractory dyspnea. Abernethy and colleagues evaluated the use of sustained-release oral morphine in the management of refractory dyspnea. They studied 48 patients attending hospital clinics for respiratory, cardiac, general, or palliative medicine in Australia. These patients had refractory dyspnea at rest despite optimal medical treatment but had not been treated previously with long-term opioids. Patients were required to have creatinine levels within twice the normal range; to have stable needs for medication and oxygen; and to be free of confusion, substance abuse, or contraindications to opioids. Five patients withdrew during the placebo treatment, and five withdrew during the opioid therapy.

About one half of the withdrawals were attributed to opioid therapy, mainly because of nausea, but one patient requested morphine therapy for pain during the placebo period. The 38 patients who completed the study were mainly elderly men who used supplemental oxygen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. More than 70 percent were unable to carry out any work activities. After four days, patients taking morphine reported a highly significant improvement in dyspnea on visual analog scales and improvement in sleep. Exertional performance and overall sense of well-being were not significantly different during morphine therapy. Respiratory rates, sedation, vomiting, confusion, and anorexia were similar during the morphine treatment compared with the placebo therapy. Side effects generally were mild and transient. Constipation, the most common side effect, often began to resolve by the fourth day.

The authors conclude that oral sustained-release morphine can benefit patients with intractable breathlessness who already receive optimal conventional therapy. No evidence of respiratory depression was found, and side effects were predictable and controllable. The authors call for larger studies to evaluate the safety of morphine therapy and to clarify the side effects, but stress that oral sustained-release morphine could provide significant relief to severely ill patients with COPD. editor's note: The authors are careful to point out that until safety is confirmed and other studies are done, the message of this study is not that opiates are fine to use in patients with COPD, but that they might have a role as an adjunctive therapy in selected situations. The opportunity to relieve breathlessness and the fear of suffocation in very ill patients is compelling, and these patients were willing to risk side effects and respiratory depression for the chance to relieve dyspnea.
