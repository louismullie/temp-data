## Question

What does decrease strain mean in a cardiac ultrasound?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "decrease strain" means in a cardiac ultrasound and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic definition of myocardial strain and its normal values. Then, I should verify the convention for negative strain and what constitutes a "decrease". Next, I will examine the pathophysiology behind reduced strain, especially longitudinal strain. After that, I should review clinical contexts where a decrease in strain is meaningful, including heart failure, cardio-oncology, valvular disease, ischemia, and infiltrative disease. Finally, I need to check technical pitfalls, vendor variability, and how to report and act on changes in strain over time.

> Let me first confirm the definition. Myocardial strain is the percentage change in myocardial length from end-diastole to end-systole, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) is typically a negative number reflecting shortening during systole, with normal adult GLS around −18% to −22% depending on vendor and methodology, and values less negative than about −16% considered abnormal in consensus statements [^111uPxdv].

> Wait, let me verify the sign convention so I don't misstate this. Because GLS is negative, a "decrease in strain" means the absolute value gets smaller, i.e., the number becomes less negative, which corresponds to less shortening and therefore worse systolic function. For example, a change from −20% to −15% is a decrease in strain magnitude and indicates impaired longitudinal function even if ejection fraction is unchanged [^112qMumc] [^113Aksiq].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. Longitudinal fibers are concentrated in the subendocardium, which is particularly vulnerable to ischemia, fibrosis, and pressure overload, so longitudinal strain often declines before ejection fraction falls, making GLS a more sensitive marker of early systolic dysfunction in many disease states [^112ShYa7] [^112L6GZa].

> Next, I should review clinical contexts where a decrease in strain carries diagnostic or prognostic meaning. In heart failure, worse GLS predicts mortality and adverse outcomes independent of EF, with consensus thresholds such as GLS less negative than about −7% indicating markedly impaired mechanics and higher risk. In cardio-oncology, a relative decrease in GLS of about 10–15% from baseline during therapy predicts subsequent LVEF decline and cardiotoxicity, prompting closer surveillance or modification of therapy. In valvular disease, particularly aortic stenosis and primary mitral regurgitation, less negative GLS identifies patients at higher risk even when EF is preserved. In ischemia, stress and rest strain can detect regional dysfunction before wall motion abnormalities. And in infiltrative disease like cardiac amyloidosis, a characteristic apical-sparing pattern with globally reduced strain supports the diagnosis and correlates with prognosis [^111XH7vf] [^1148ie7g] [^1141pUML] [^112RK3PR] [^11411XJs] [^111WmXbV] [^113dM1Bv] [^115ke1X2] [^116F6PuN].

> Hold on, I should verify technical caveats before concluding. Strain is load-dependent, so blood pressure and volume status matter. It is also vendor- and software-dependent, so serial comparisons should use the same platform and version when possible. Foreshortening and poor tracking can artifactually lower strain, and more than two uninterpretable segments in a view should prompt caution or omission of GLS. These issues argue for standardized acquisition, careful quality control, and cautious cross-platform interpretation [^116iHFXa] [^113wJ53g] [^112qMumc].

> Let me consider how to report and act on changes. A relative decrease in GLS exceeding about 15% from baseline is considered clinically significant in several settings, including cardio-oncology and serial heart failure follow-up, and should be documented with directionality. In patients with preserved EF and suspected HFpEF, reduced GLS supports subclinical systolic dysfunction and worse prognosis, though it is not itself a diastolic index. In atrial disease, reduced left atrial reservoir strain predicts AF and HF events and can be tracked over time [^1141pUML] [^113ZSWD8] [^113ACytL] [^116akGSC] [^111gESWE].

> But wait, what if the "decrease" is just inter-test variability. I should double-check that small changes, typically under about 8–10% relative, are within test-retest variability and should not trigger action by themselves; this is why consensus emphasizes trending on the same system and using relative thresholds rather than single absolute cutoffs in isolation [^115ywX4P] [^112qMumc].

> In summary, a decrease in strain on cardiac ultrasound means the myocardium shortens less in systole, i.e., the GLS becomes less negative, reflecting impaired longitudinal function that often precedes a fall in ejection fraction. Clinically, it signals higher risk across multiple conditions and should be interpreted in disease-specific contexts, with attention to acquisition quality, vendor consistency, and serial change rather than a single value [^112qMumc] [^113Aksiq] [^1145XiYE].

---

In cardiac ultrasound, "decrease strain" means **reduced myocardial deformation** (shortening) during systole, most often detected as a less negative global longitudinal strain (GLS) [^112qMumc]. This reflects **early subclinical dysfunction** — often before ejection fraction falls — and is linked to worse outcomes in heart failure, ischemia, valvular disease, and cardiotoxicity [^1145XiYE] [^111XH7vf] [^1141pUML]. Clinically, a GLS less negative than about −16% is abnormal, and a relative drop > 15% from baseline is significant and should prompt closer follow-up or intervention [^113Aksiq] [^113ZSWD8].

---

## Definition and measurement of strain

Strain quantifies **myocardial deformation** as the percentage change in length from end-diastole to end-systole: strain (%) = (L(t) − L0)/L0 × 100, where L0 is the initial length and L(t) is the length at time t [^112qMumc]. By convention, longitudinal strain is negative because the myocardium shortens in systole; normal adult GLS is about −18% to −22% [^116NWMJh] [^111uPxdv]. Strain is measured by **speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE)**, which tracks acoustic markers in the myocardium to calculate deformation in longitudinal, circumferential, and radial directions [^115SPW1v].

---

## Clinical significance of decreased strain

A decrease in strain — a less negative GLS — signals **reduced myocardial deformation** and early systolic dysfunction, often before EF declines [^1145XiYE]. It is a sensitive marker of subclinical disease and correlates with worse prognosis across several conditions [^1145XiYE].

---

## Conditions associated with decreased strain

Several **cardiac conditions** show reduced strain:

- **Heart failure**: Impaired GLS is common in HFrEF and HFpEF and predicts adverse outcomes [^111XH7vf] [^113ACytL].
- **Ischemic heart disease**: Reduced strain reflects regional dysfunction from ischemia or infarction and predicts events after MI [^114qiJpD] [^113nmpDe].
- **Valvular heart disease**: Pressure or volume overload (e.g. aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation) reduces strain and worsens prognosis [^11411XJs] [^1168XK4r].
- **Cardiomyopathies**: Hypertrophic, dilated, and infiltrative cardiomyopathies (e.g. amyloidosis) show reduced strain, often with characteristic patterns [^114UuX4C] [^115ke1X2].
- **Cardiotoxicity**: Cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunction is heralded by early GLS decline, often before EF falls [^1141pUML] [^112RK3PR].

---

## Clinical thresholds and interpretation

Consensus defines **normal GLS as more negative than −18%**, borderline as −16% to −18%, and abnormal as less negative than −16% [^113Aksiq]. A relative GLS decrease > 15% from baseline is clinically significant and should trigger closer monitoring or intervention [^113ZSWD8] [^1141pUML].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Strain is **load-dependent** and influenced by blood pressure, volume status, and heart rate; it is also vendor- and software-dependent, so serial studies should use the same platform and methodology [^112qMumc] [^111uPxdv]. Artifacts from poor tracking or foreshortening can bias strain and must be avoided [^114bSvRE].

---

## Clinical implications and management

When strain decreases, clinicians should:

- **Confirm measurement quality**: Ensure adequate image quality, appropriate ROI, and valid tracking [^114bSvRE].
- **Consider underlying causes**: Evaluate for ischemia, valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, or cardiotoxicity [^1145XiYE].
- **Monitor serially**: Track changes over time, especially in patients at risk (e.g. chemotherapy, heart failure) [^1141pUML] [^1169VRyj].
- **Integrate with clinical context**: Use strain alongside EF, biomarkers, and symptoms to guide management [^114e9HuT].

---

In sum, "decrease strain" on cardiac ultrasound reflects **reduced myocardial deformation**, indicating early systolic dysfunction. It is a **sensitive, prognostically meaningful** parameter that should be interpreted in clinical context and monitored serially to guide care [^1145XiYE].

Cardiac chambers and strain reporting — left and right ventricular assessment: The echocardiographic report should include an assessment of the LV size indexed to body surface area (BSA), wall thickness, and systolic and diastolic function, and the report should also describe RV morphology, structure, and systolic function. When strain evaluation is performed, results should be reported as either positive or negative; LV and RV global longitudinal strain (GLS) are conventionally expressed as negative values, strain values should be classified as normal, abnormal, or borderline, and significant changes from prior studies (e.g., relative GLS change exceeding 15%) should be documented with directionality. Strain results may vary with imaging platform and data compression type, and these data should be captured in the demographics section.

Mitral stenosis — strain studies show reduced LV stroke volume and decreased LVGLS versus normal subjects; nearly 85% of patients with severe MS have LVGLS in the lowest quartile of controls, and LV end-diastolic volume is the strongest determinant of LVGLS, indicating preload influence on LV contractile performance in MS.

Key points — because LVGLS is a continuous parameter, in valvular heart disease absolute cutoffs are less meaningful than recognizing that prognosis worsens as strain magnitude decreases; there should be supranormal LVGLS when LV contractile function is normal in valvular disease with increased preload and reduced volumetric afterload (aortic regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and primary mitral regurgitation).

Heart failure longitudinal strain prognostication — worsening LV global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) less negative than −6.95% predicted poorer long-term adverse events in chronic heart failure (HF) regardless of whether left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was ≥ 25% or < 25% (P < .05 for both). In HFrEF, mortality risk increased with decreasing tertiles of global longitudinal strain (GLS), with tertile 1 versus tertile 3 showing hazard ratio 3.38 (95% CI, 2.3–5.1; P < .001). In acute HF, the estimated probability of 5-year all-cause mortality was related to GLS, and "mortality decreased with decreased strain", while the relationship with LVEF "was not prominent"; addition of GLS "offers a significant additional benefit over conventional parameters" and is presented as a global χ2 value.

Global longitudinal strain (GLS) by age group — normal GLS is defined by individual-patient meta-analysis from eight recent studies with cohort characteristics 2,396 subjects; mean age, 42 years; mean weight, 66 ± 12 kg; mean height, 169 ± 9 cm; mean body surface area, 1.7 ± 0.2 m2; mean systolic blood pressure, 120 ± 13 mm Hg, and GLS progressively decreases after the age of 60 years but appears to be relatively stable up until this age.

Stages C and D heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — prognostic use of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS): In HFrEF (LVEF < 40%), LVEF and LVGLS show a significant correlation, but for a given EF, LVGLS shows a wide distribution, and LVGLS independently predicts outcomes after adjusting for clinical factors and conventional echocardiographic parameters. Absolute LVGLS equal to or less negative than −6.95% predicted worse long-term adverse events, including death, cardiac transplantation, and HF hospitalization, and each 1% decrease of LVGLS was associated with 15% increased odds for mortality in HFrEF. LVGLS also provides superior prognostic values than LVEF in predicting mortality, and among patients with acute HF, moderate and severe LVGLS reductions correlated with higher mortality, but LVEF was not associated with mortality after multivariable analysis.

Cardio-oncology — global longitudinal strain (GLS) and cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD): The percentage of patients with abnormal or low-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline is "between 1% and 10%", and in those with borderline LVEF (50% to 59%) a baseline strain "less negative than −16%" was associated with symptomatic heart failure and cardiac death. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) "decreases early during treatment with anthracyclines, trastuzumab, or radiotherapy" and these decreases "predict later decrease in LVEF". A meta-analysis reported an odds ratio of "12.2" for CTRCD when LVGLS was abnormal during chemotherapy, and a relative decrease after initiation made patients "15.8 times more likely to develop CTRCD". Reported predictive thresholds include a relative decrease of "10%" with sensitivity "78%" and specificity "79%", and "11%" with sensitivity "65%" and specificity "94%". "Conservatively, a relative decrease of 15% (e.g., 3% absolute decrease from a baseline of −20%) during chemotherapy, is considered to be preclinical cardiac dysfunction", and guidelines "recognize an isolated relative decrease of ≥ 15% in GLS as mild CTRCD". Current cardio-oncology guidance "advocate against the interruption of chemotherapy in the context of preserved LVEF and isolated falls in GLS", and a SUCCOUR magnetic resonance imaging analysis showed "a significant improvement in magnetic resonance imaging–defined LVEF… after the detection of CTRCD as defined by a > 12% relative reduction in LV GLS". In patients with isolated strain decrease, "optimizing risk factors and replacing an anthracycline treatment regimen by cardioprotective therapies if feasible is justified".

HFpEF strain echocardiography — HFpEF is defined by an ejection fraction (EF) of ≥ 50% with impairments in diastolic, systolic, and microvascular functioning accompanied by reduced exercise tolerance and symptoms of HF; LVGLS is usually impaired in suspected HFpEF, and there is growing evidence that impaired LVGLS has prognostic value in HFpEF, with incrementally impaired LVGLS portending a poorer prognosis.

Left ventricular GLS monitoring and 3D strain — "the optimal use of LVGLS is in sequential follow-up, by comparison with baseline", and when used this way, "a relative change of 10% to 15% is likely to be significant", whereas "the use of 3D strain is still in development… and is not endorsed for clinical use".

### Myocardial strain imaging: how useful is it in clinical decision making? [^112pgoMF]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Key points

Numerous studies have shown that myocardial strain imaging provides unique diagnostic information. Global longitudinal strain by STE is more sensitive than LVEF as a marker of LV dysfunction. The strain imaging methodology is still undergoing development and further clinical trials are needed to determine if clinical decisions based on strain imaging results in better outcome. With this important limitation in mind, strain may be applied clinically as a supplementary diagnostic method and in the following conditions it appears to be useful.

– In patients with preserved or normal LVEF, reduced GLS may be used to identify systolic dysfunction.
– Strain imaging can be used to identify sub-clinical LV dysfunction in individuals who are evaluated for cardiomyopathy. This includes family screening for HCM and the finding of reduced GLS indicates early disease.
– In patients with valvular heart disease reduced GLS reflects negative impact of the valve lesion on myocardial function prior to fall in LVEF, but so far this application is not recommended for use in clinical routine.
– Strain imaging is recommended in addition to LVEF in patients undergoing chemotheraphy to identify sub-clinical LV dysfunction.
– Mechanical dispersion as a measure of dyssynchrony, can identify patients with high risk of ventricular arrhythmias, but this approach is not ready for clinical implementation.
– Strain may be used to diagnose myocardial ischaemia, but the technology is not sufficiently standardized to be recommended as a general tool for this purpose. In unclear clinical cases, however, it may be considered as a supplementary method.
– Strain imaging may be applied in patients eligible for CRT to guide placement of the LV pacing lead, but is currently not recommended for selection of CRT responders.
– Peak systolic longitudinal LA strain is a promising supplementary index of LV filling pressure, but needs further validation in prospective trials.

### Global longitudinal strain: the best biomarker for predicting prognosis in heart failure? [^113H1BJx]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Disease screening is a difficult topic and with a number of controversies including costs, false‐positive and false‐negative results. An effective screening of a disease is dependent on high pre‐test probability, and has so far been limited to patients with risk of oncological diseases. However, cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of death in Western societies, and screening for early cardiovascular diseases seems reasonable. Clearly, a single, easily available, non‐expensive blood sample biomarker would be the most desirable screening method, but this blood marker is yet to be found and still multimarker samples are considered the best approach so far. 13 The obvious disadvantage of echocardiographic screening for HF is the availability and the costs of an echocardiographic examination. An eventual echo screening should clearly be restricted to high‐risk patients and there is currently no reason to screen patients for HF other than those described in the paper of Yang et al. 4 Furthermore, screening should only be performed if there is available treatment for the screened condition and effective HF treatment is well established.

The diagnostic tool and treatment regimen are already available. So, what are we waiting for before we can recommend the cardiology community to start large‐scale echocardiographic screening programmes of patients at high risk of developing HF? The answer is quite easy and straightforward, together with its complexity: we will need a carefully performed cost‐effectiveness study that demonstrates improved survival and morbidity when treating patients with reduced GLS and preserved EF.

Conflict of interest: none declared.

### Strain rate echocardiography uncovers subclinical left ventricular dysfunction in cystic fibrosis [^113L8zND]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

CFTR is expressed in cardiac myocytes. In mice, lack of CFTR alters cardiomyocyte contraction and Ca2+ signaling, and decreases cardiac reserve. We undertook a pilot study evaluating left ventricular (LV) function in CF patients using strain and strain rate echocardiography.

Methods

Echocardiography with tissue Doppler and strain and strain rate imaging were performed in 8 CF adults following pulmonary function tests. Results were compared to literature values obtained in healthy subjects.

Results

All CF individuals had normal LV ejection fractions. In contrast, 50% of men and 100% of women with CF had decreased LV systolic strain. Strain rates were significantly decreased in 100% of CF individuals. RV function was normal and LV function did not correlate with lung function.

Conclusions

Strain and strain rate echocardiography identified LV systolic abnormalities in CF individuals not detected by conventional echocardiography. We propose that this echocardiography modality may identify subclinical cardiac dysfunction in CF.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Clinical consensus statements — (1) LVGLS is a useful prognostic factor in AS, and a meta-analysis suggests LVGLS less negative than −14.7% increases death risk by 2.5-fold in severe asymptomatic AS; (2) less negative LVGLS is associated with worse outcomes in AR, though no optimal cutoff is defined; (3) in severe primary MR, LVGLS should be supranormal, with adverse prognosis when strain is less negative than −20%, and patients with LVGLS less negative than −20% should be carefully monitored with mitral valve intervention as clinically indicated; (4) strain is less established in functional MR with no well-established cutoff for timing; and (5) RVFVLS may be used in significant TR to risk stratify before intervention, with values less negative than −23% suggestive of poorer outcomes.

Mitral regurgitation — LVGLS should be more negative than −20% in patients with augmented preload and decreased volumetric afterload as occurs in MR, and as LVGLS decreases prognosis worsens; in asymptomatic patients with significant primary MR and preserved LVEF who underwent mitral valve surgery, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and LVGLS provided synergistic risk stratification.

### Guidelines for the standardization of adult echocardiography reporting: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113ZSWD8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Adult echocardiography reporting — examples of findings that are new or significant and may warrant consultation and/or follow-up testing include the following. Left ventricle: significant reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as more than 10-point reduction for any reason and worsening in global longitudinal strain (GLS), including a relative change in GLS > 15% from baseline. Right ventricle: change from normal to abnormal right ventricular (RV) systolic function as assessed by a combination of qualitative and quantitative parameters. Atria: change in left atrial (LA) or right atrial (RA) size from normal to abnormal. Valves: changes in the severity of native or prosthetic valvular stenosis or regurgitation, especially if progression to severe. Aorta: severe dilation thresholds include aneurysm ≥ 5.5 cm and > 5.0 cm in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, and interval enlargement such as increased from 4.0 cm to 4.5 cm. Pericardium: changes in pericardial effusion size, especially if changes are rapid, and changes in hemodynamic significance including development of cardiac tamponade physiology.

### Measurement of strain and strain rate by echocardiography: ready for prime time? [^116wdJkX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Strain and strain rate (SR) are measures of deformation that are basic descriptors of both the nature and the function of cardiac tissue. These properties may now be measured using either Doppler or two-dimensional ultrasound techniques. Although these measurements are feasible in routine clinical echocardiography, their acquisition and analysis nonetheless presents a number of technical challenges and complexities. Echocardiographic strain and SR imaging has been applied to the assessment of resting ventricular function, the assessment of myocardial viability using low-dose dobutamine infusion, and stress testing for ischemia. Resting function assessment has been applied in both the left and the right ventricles, and may prove particularly valuable for identifying myocardial diseases and following up the treatment response. Although the evidence base is limited, SR imaging seems to be feasible and effective for the assessment of myocardial viability. The use of the technique for the detection of ischemia during stress echocardiography is technically challenging and likely to evolve further. The clinical availability of strain and SR measurement may offer a solution to the ongoing need for quantification of regional and global cardiac function. Nonetheless, these techniques are susceptible to artifact, and further technical development is necessary.

### Can changes in systolic longitudinal deformation quantify regional myocardial function after an acute infarction? An ultrasonic strain rate and strain study [^113nmpDe]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the additional value of ultrasonic strain rate and strain to myocardial velocity in the identification and quantification of regional asynergy after an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Methods

Forty patients (59 ± 13 years) were investigated 3 ± 2 days after a first infarction and compared with 14 age-matched controls with normally contracting segments (group A, n = 146). Longitudinal myocardial velocities, strain rate (SR) and strain (epsilon) were postprocessed from basal, mid, and apical segments interrogated using apical views. In a subset of patients with coronary angiograms (n = 24), myocardial segments were divided into 3 groups: normally contracting segments supplied by a normal coronary artery (group B1), normally contracting segments supplied by a diseased coronary artery (group B2), and segments with abnormal motion (group B3). Velocities were decreased in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) (P < .05 vs controls) but failed to accurately differentiate normally from abnormally contracting segments. At the opposite end, systolic SR and epsilon decreased significantly with segmental asynergy severity and could identify infarct-involved segments (group B3) with a sensitivity/specificity of 85% (systolic SR and epsilon cutoff values of -0.8 s(-1) and -13%, respectively).

Conclusion

Strain rate and strain can better assess segmental dysfunction severity than myocardial velocities alone after an acute MI.

### Myocardial strain imaging: how useful is it in clinical decision making? [^112ShYa7]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiomyopathies and sub-clinical left ventricular dysfunction

When there is an overt clinical cardiomyopathy with typical findings by conventional echocardiography, strain imaging is usually not needed. In early stages of disease, however, strain imaging can be of considerable help in the diagnostic evaluation and to define prognosis. In a number of cardiac disorders, the ability of GLS to predict cardiovascular outcome may be superior to LVEF. The reason why GLS appears to be more sensitive than LVEF to detect myocardial dysfunction may in part reflect the limited ability of LVEF to assess systolic function in ventricles with hypertrophy. This is well known from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in whom LVEF may be normal or even supernormal when systolic function is markedly reduced. The same principle applies to other conditions with hypertrophy because hypertrophic ventricles thicken more in absolute terms, which reduces cavity volumes more than in ventricles with normal wall thickness. As an example, a normal ventricle with end-diastolic wall thickness 10 mm and radial strain of 40% and a ventricle with 20 mm wall thickness and with reduced systolic function and reduced radial strain to 20%, will both thicken by 4 mm. This principle is one reason why LVEF may overestimate systolic function in hypertrophic ventricles. Furthermore, since longitudinal myocardial fibres are located predominantly in the subendocardium, which is the wall layer which is most susceptible to ischemia, reductions in longitudinal strain may be found prior to reduction in EF.

### ASNC / AHA / ASE / EANM / HFSA / ISA / SCMR / SNMMI expert consensus recommendations for multimodality imaging in cardiac amyloidosis: part 1 of 2-evidence base and standardized methods of imaging [^116F6PuN]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis echocardiography — standardized acquisition, interpretation, and reporting specifies required 2D and Doppler parameters with explicit thresholds and recommends strain markers. LV wall thickness is abnormal with Increased LV wall thickness (> 1.2 cm) and increased relative wall thickness (> 0.42), and reporting is Required. Diastolic function uses Grade 2 or worse diastolic dysfunction with high E/A ratio (> 1.5) and reduced E deceleration time (< 150 ms), marked Required. Hemodynamic estimates define Increased pressures (> 35mmHg for PA, ≥ 10mmHg for RA) as abnormal, marked Required. Tissue Doppler velocities are Reduced tissue Doppler s', e', and a' velocities (all < 5 cm/s), with the 5-5-5 sign (all TDI velocities < 5 cm/s) noted; reporting is Required. Strain imaging is Recommended with Decreased global longitudinal LV strain (absolute value less than -15%) and the "Cherry-on-the-top" sign on STE longitudinal strain bullseye map (preservation of apical longitudinal strain with severely abnormal basal and mid-LV longitudinal strain) designated Recommended. Additional required structural findings include Thickening of the interatrial septum and valves (> 0.5 cm), Pericardial effusion, and Atrial enlargement and dysfunction.

### Expert consensus for multimodality imaging evaluation of adult patients during and after cancer therapy: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^112a7Rsi]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Global longitudinal strain (GLS) for early detection of cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunction is supported by defined deformation thresholds. ΔGLS measured at the 6-month visit was the strongest predictor, and an 11% reduction (95% confidence interval, 8.3%–14.6%) was the optimal cutoff with sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 94%. In patients with baseline strain measurements, reductions of GLS of < 8% compared with baseline appear not to be clinically meaningful, whereas those > 15% are very likely to be of clinical significance. In patients without baseline strain measurements, a proposed absolute GLS cutoff of −19% conforms to the confidence interval around −20.5% found in the study, and GLS is described as the optimal parameter of deformation for the early detection of subclinical LV dysfunction.

Negative sign usage in strain values — Task Force advice specifies that if presenting segmental values of strain, the negative sign should be kept for differentiating dyskinetic from normal myocardial contractility. If presenting global longitudinal strain (GLS), it is advised that the negative sign be used. If the negative sign is omitted, then the term global longitudinal shortening should be used to correctly refer to the values presented and should be communicated accordingly in the methodology of scientific papers.

### Myocardial strain imaging: how useful is it in clinical decision making? [^114KtARf]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Myocardial strain is a principle for quantification of left ventricular (LV) function which is now feasible with speckle-tracking echocardiography. The best evaluated strain parameter is global longitudinal strain (GLS) which is more sensitive than left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as a measure of systolic function, and may be used to identify sub-clinical LV dysfunction in cardiomyopathies. Furthermore, GLS is recommended as routine measurement in patients undergoing chemotherapy to detect reduction in LV function prior to fall in LVEF. Intersegmental variability in timing of peak myocardial strain has been proposed as predictor of risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Strain imaging may be applied to guide placement of the LV pacing lead in patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy. Strain may also be used to diagnose myocardial ischaemia, but the technology is not sufficiently standardized to be recommended as a general tool for this purpose. Peak systolic left atrial strain is a promising supplementary index of LV filling pressure. The strain imaging methodology is still undergoing development, and further clinical trials are needed to determine if clinical decisions based on strain imaging result in better outcome. With this important limitation in mind, strain may be applied clinically as a supplementary diagnostic method.

### ASNC / AHA / ASE / EANM / HFSA / ISA / SCMR / SNMMI expert consensus recommendations for multimodality imaging in cardiac amyloidosis: part 1 of 2-evidence base and standardized methods of imaging [^115wqZQd]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2021). High credibility.

Echocardiography — standardized acquisition, interpretation, and reporting for cardiac amyloidosis identifies key abnormal findings with explicit thresholds: increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (> 1.2 cm) and increased relative wall thickness (> 0.42); thickening of the interatrial septum and valves (> 0.5 cm); grade 2 or worse diastolic dysfunction with high E/A ratio (> 1.5) and reduced E deceleration time (< 150 ms); increased pressures (> 35mmHg for PA, ≥ 10mmHg for RA); and reduced tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) s′, e′, and a′ velocities (all < 5 cm/s). Strain imaging features include decreased global longitudinal LV strain (absolute values less than −15%) and a "Cherry-on-the-top" speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) longitudinal strain bullseye pattern, while the "5-5-5" sign (all TDI velocities < 5 cm/s) is noted as typically highly suggestive.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically with respect to cardiac imaging, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend to reassess LVEF/strain every 3 months in asymptomatic patients receiving any cardiotoxic anticancer therapy with normal LVEF but a decrease in average global longitudinal strain from baseline assessment (≥ 12% relative decrease or ≥ 5% absolute decrease). Reassess LVEF/strain with suspected cardiac toxicity based on cardiac physical examination or symptoms.

### Assessment of myocardial deformation with CMR: a comparison with ultrasound speckle tracking [^11184K5v]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Myocardial deformation integrated with cardiac dimensions provides a comprehensive assessment of cardiac function, which has proven useful to differentiate cardiac pathology from physiological adaptation to situations such as chronic intensive training. Feature tracking (FT) can measure myocardial deformation from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine sequences; however, its accuracy is not yet fully validated. Our aim was to compare the accuracy and reproducibility of FT with speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in highly trained endurance athletes.

Methods

Ninety-three endurance athletes (> 12-h training/week during the last 5 years, 52% male, 35 ± 5.1 years old) and 72 age-matched controls underwent resting CMR and transthoracic echocardiography to assess biventricular exercise-induced remodeling and biventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) by CMR-FT and STE.

Results

Strain values were significantly lower when assessed by CMR-FT compared to STE (p < 0.001), with good reproducibility for the left ventricle (bias = 3.94%, limit of agreement [LOA] = ± 4.27%) but wider variability for right ventricle strain. Strain values by both techniques proportionally decreased with increasing ventricular volumes, potentially depicting the functional biventricular reserve that characterizes athletes' hearts.

Conclusions

Biventricular longitudinal strain values were lower when assessed by FT as compared to STE. Both methods were statistically comparable when measuring LV strain but not RV strain. These differences might be justified by the lower in-plane spatial and temporal resolution of FT, which is particularly relevant for the complex anatomy of the RV.

Key Points

- Strain values were significantly lower when assessed by FT as compared to STE, which was expected due to the lower in-plane spatial and temporal resolution of FT versus STE.
- Both methods were statistically comparable when measuring LV strain but not for RV strain analysis.
- Characterizing the normal ranges and reproducibility of strain metrics by FT is an important step toward its clinical applicability, since it can be assessed offline and applied to routinely acquired cine CMR images.

### Focused cardiac ultrasound: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^111ro3eg]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) — guideline rationale emphasizes that ultrasound as a diagnostic cardiac modality is more portable and less expensive compared with other imaging modalities, with no known adverse effects of ultrasound used at diagnostic imaging intensities that allow safe, serial evaluation. Echocardiography permits rapid assessment of cardiac size, structure, function, and hemodynamics, and images are evaluated in real time, allowing rapid diagnostic interpretation across outpatient clinic, inpatient ward, critical care unit, emergency department, operating room, remote clinic, and cardiac catheterization laboratory. Cardiac ultrasound is used across the entire spectrum of patient care from in utero to the frail elderly patient, is sensitive and specific for a broad range of clinical disorders with well-documented prognostic utility, and platforms incorporate advanced imaging capabilities (three-dimensional [3D], strain imaging) and complex algorithms for quantitative analysis. The training of the clinicians who use it is equally important, and the article notes keywords of Cardiac ultrasound, Guideline, Point-of-care.

Pediatric LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) — reference values and age trends are described as follows: the determination of normal STE reference values for children has been limited by variable techniques and segmentation methodologies from multiple ultrasound platforms; in general, the lower limit of normal for LV endocardial GLS ranges from −17% to −18%; beyond the newborn period, pediatric strain values decrease mildly with age.

### Myocardial strain imaging: how useful is it in clinical decision making? [^114UuX4C]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Prognosis in HCM is closely related to LV function and morphology. In contrast to LVEF which very often is normal in HCM, longitudinal strains are reduced in early stages of the disease, whereas radial and circumferential strains may be preserved (Figure 7). Longitudinal strain is reduced at the site of hypertrophy, commonly in the interventricular septum. Current clinical practice guidelines for management of HCMinclude strain echocardiography for evaluating longitudinal function in early disease. Longitudinal function can be abnormal even before development of increased wall thickness in mutation positive family members(Figure 7). The finding of reduced longitudinal strain, particularly in the presence of an abnormal ECG, increases the probability of disease.

Figure 6
Longitudinal strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography (two-chamber view) in a patient with acute myocardial infarction the day after percutaneous coronary intervention of an occluded left anterior descending coronary artery. Follow-up late enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (lower left) showed myocardial scarring represented by the white area in apex and anterior wall. Strain curves display typical features of ischaemic dysfunction, ranging from lengthening throughout systole in a segment with transmural infarction and different degrees of dysfunction in other segments. The color of each trace corresponds to anatomical points on the 2-D color image and the white dotted line shows the average of the six strain curves. The yellow curve shows normal contraction in a non-infarcted segment.

The diagnosis of pathological hypertrophy in young healthy athletes is challenging and preliminary data suggest that strain imaging may be of help as reduction in systolic strain, which is typical for HCM, is not found in physiological hypertrophy. Further validation is needed, however, before this application of strain imaging can be recommended as routine. Of the echocardiographic parameters, the single most important discriminator is LV end-diastolic diameter since hypertrophy in HCM occurs at the expense of cavity size, resulting in a small LV cavity (< 45 mm), whereas almost all athletes with physiological LV hypertrophy have concomitant enlargement of the LV cavity (between 55 and 65 mm). Reduced early diastolic mitral annular velocity by tissue Doppler is also consistent with pathological hypertrophy, but cannot be used confirm or refute the diagnosis of physiological hypertrophy in every case.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is diagnosed according to the 2010 Task Force Criteriausing different modalities including imaging by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Reduced RV function by reduced RV-free wall strain and a dyssynchronous RV contraction pattern have been shown to be early markers of ARVC, and may help diagnosis in early phases of disease.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^116NWMJh]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular systolic function — Recommendations state that LV systolic function should be routinely assessed using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) or three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) by calculating ejection fraction (EF) from end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV). LV EFs of < 52% for men and < 54% for women are suggestive of abnormal LV systolic function. To provide some guidance, a peak global longitudinal strain (GLS) in the range of −20% can be expected in a healthy person, and the lower the absolute value of strain is below this value, the more likely it is to be abnormal.

### Novel approach to artefact detection and the definition of normal ranges of segmental strain and strain-rate values [^114JBueN]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Our results showed that the presence of curve artefacts lowers segmental systolic S/SR values, regardless of segment localisation. Because of their similarity to pathology, these artefacts must be identified to avoid misinterpretation of the biased low values as evidence of regionally reduced heart function. In contrast, foreshortening artefacts systematically increased S/SR values, which did not change the interpretation of the presence or absence of pathologies during clinical examination. Pathologically reduced strain curves have a curve with reduced segmental peak strain is followed by PSS, and after the PSS peak, all segments display parallel stretching at the end of the early diastolic and atrial filling phases.

In this study, we described an approach for defining strain-curve artefacts using subjective visual assessment. If this subjective approach is robust as compared with objective 2D imaging artefact detection, curve artefact algorithms can potentially be integrated into automated reading programmes. Timely manual or automated detection of artificial curve shapes facilitates the correct interpretation of strain results without repeated assessment of tracking. Finally, during real-time strain recordings, curve artefact detection might be performed to provide immediate feedback on imaging quality. Other algorithms can be developed taking both, curve artefacts, noise, reverberations, or missing segments into account to help reconstruct discarded segments on the base of the ventricular shape, size and strain curves of artefact-free segments.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) thresholds — clinical consensus statements specify that normal LV myocardial GLS is more negative than −18%, borderline GLS is −16% to −18%, and abnormal GLS is less negative than −16%. Comparisons in GLS should ideally use the same software vendor and software version, and care should be taken when comparing values derived from different vendors, with vendors encouraged to maintain fidelity as software is updated.

### Novel approach to artefact detection and the definition of normal ranges of segmental strain and strain-rate values [^111aP3vF]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Effect of artefacts on global S/SR

Discarding artefacts from the average strain calculation reduced the ES strain values by < 0.5%. Average GLS and artefact-free strain differed by the same amount. Unexpectedly, subendocardial GLS was also lower than the segmental average with artefacts. This may be explained by a software algorithm that reduces the percentage of apical strain contribution to GLS, which affects endocardial GLS, with the highest apical to basal gradients. The difference between the segmental average of the LV and global values was even more noticeable for SR values. The lower global longitudinal (GL) SR values than the average of segmental peaks are expected because the non-simultaneous time points of segmental peaks do not sum up to one blunted peak of the GL SR curve. Thus, when using SR-E as a clinical parameter, the average of peak values at different time points should be used. Although significant, the detection of segmental artefacts had little effect on GLS values and, accordingly, should not be considered when measuring GLS. To date, several studies on larger populations have suggested normal ranges for GLS or SR. Accordingly, the normal ranges were integrated into the 2016 American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging chamber quantification recommendations. Our GLS results are in concordance with results of a recent meta-analysis, where the mean normal values of mid-myocardial GLS varied from −15.9% to −22.1% (mean: 19.7%).

### Strain echocardiography to predict cardiotoxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy containing doxorubicin… [^115MFBYc]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

- Blood draw to measure Troponin and BNP levels
- Pharmacogenomic biomarkers as predictors of composite cardiotoxicity
- **Blood draw for genotyping Primary Objective**:

1. Determine if a 20% reduction in global longitudinal strain by echocardiography can predict subsequent composite cardiotoxicity in a collection of patients with either HER2 breast cancer, sarcoma, or lymphoma receiving modern chemotherapy regimens containing anthracyclines. Echocardiograms with strain will be performed to determine cardiac structure and mechanical function during the course of treatment. All echocardiograms will include the addition of a new signal processing method, called strain echocardiography. This technology allows precise analysis of the individual regions of the heart to determine cardiac function. Echocardiograms with strain will be done on four visits using GE strain-capable technology.

Echocardiograms will be performed in a manner compatible with strain calculation by either GE or Tomtec software depending on which software the echocardiography lab has experience using. The baseline echocardiogram will be within a window of 28 days prior to starting doxorubicin-based chemotherapy regimen. For IUH studies, following the initial examination sonographers will recalculate strain on the same images or they will have another strain sonographer recalculate strain on the same images. Efforts will be made to blind the 2nd measurer to the results of the previous strain calculations. For non-IUH facilities, this same process may be performed offline using either sonographers or staff echo readers. Sample Size: The primary objective is to show that change of strain echocardiography parameters is associated with the 1-year event rate of the primary endpoint.

Based on existing literature, the overall 1-year event rate is about 8% in the targeted cancer population. Hence, we will only consider performing a multivariate analysis if the event rate is at least 16–20%. All analysis will be performed in SAS and SPSS. Strain cut-off levels defining risk vs. non-risk will be a 20% relative decrease in global longitudinal strain. For the secondary objectives, the cutoff value for troponin will be ≥ 0. 08 ng/mL at any time. For BNP the cutoff value will be ≥ 200 pg/mL at any time.

### Three-dimensional global left ventricular myocardial strain reduced in all directions in subclinical diabetic cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HQiqw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article and its online supplementary files. The study was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (CRD42020197825).

Search Strategy

We performed this systematic review and meta‐analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis guidelines. Under the guidance of a librarian at the University of Sydney, we searched 5 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials) for the key terms "myocardial strain/function, dysfunction", "speckle tracking echocardiography, deformation imaging/analysis", and "diabetes mellitus". The search was limited to human articles published in English and completed on March 30, 2020. Search hedges created are listed in Data S1. The reference lists of relevant studies were manually searched for any possible additional appropriate study.

Study Selection

From these lists, studies were included if the articles reported strain values using 3D‐STE in patients with asymptomatic diabetes mellitus and a control group. Two independent investigators reviewed (S.G. and A.G.) and chose studies if the articles met the following criteria: (1) studies reported LV strain values of adult patients with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2), (2) studies included a control group, and (3) patients were > 18 years of mean age. The definition of each group and exclusion criteria vary with the studies and are shown in Table S1. If one study had multiple groups of patients, we selected the lower‐risk group for our meta‐analysis to avoid extreme cases.

Study Exclusion

Our exclusion criteria were reduced LVEF, presence of known coronary artery disease, or any structural heart disease. We also excluded studies in which strain was calculated using Doppler tissue imaging or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or there were no 3D‐STE data reported. In addition, case reports, conference presentations, review articles, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded.

Data Collection

All demographic, ultrasound system and software, common clinical characteristics, and strain information was extracted from texts, tables, and graphs and summarized into a standardized extraction sheet. Authors of eligible studies were contacted by e‐mail to obtain missing information.

### The diagnostic and prognostic value of echocardiographic strain [^1145XiYE]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Myocardial deformation or strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) has become an established echocardiographic modality for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of cardiac dysfunction. Current literature supports the incremental value of strain in diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognostication of a multitude of cardiac disease states.

Observations

Strain has been studied across the clinical spectrum from common to obscure pathologic conditions. This review presents the current literature evaluating characteristic strain patterns across this clinical spectrum, discusses prognostic implications, and provides a case series of classic strain polar maps, which are also known as bull's-eye plots.

Conclusions and Relevance

Characteristic bull's-eye patterns can be used to guide patient evaluation and management.

### Myocardial strain imaging: how useful is it in clinical decision making? [^115SPW1v]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

If we denote L (t) as the segment length along one of these directions at any time t in the cardiac cycle and L 0 as initial length, 1D strain is defined as ɛ (t) = (L (t) −L 0)/ L 0. This is also called Lagrange strain, and it is measured by the distance between two material points in the myocardium, both following the motion during contraction and relaxation. Note that positive strain means elongation, whereas negative strain is shortening. To avoid confusion when communicating about strain, it is recommended to refer an increase or decrease in the absolute value of strain.

Strain ɛ (t) in the myocardium can be measured by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) or by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE). The theoretical basis for measuring strain by TDI is that myocardial velocity gradient is an estimate of strain rate, and natural strain ɛ N can be calculated as the temporal integral of strain rate. Lagrange strain can then be found by the formula ɛ = exp(ɛ N) − 1. Speckle-tracking echocardiography utilizes the phenomenon in which natural acoustic markers in grey scale ultrasound images form interference patterns (speckles) within myocardial tissue. These patterns are quite stable over the short time period between two consecutive frames, and the 2D displacement for each point in the myocardium is found by automatic search for similar patterns in the two frames (block matching). This process is repeated for all frames through the cardiac cycle to produce a 2D displacement curve for each point in the myocardium. Subsequently, strains are calculated from each LV segment in circumferential, longitudinal, or radial directions. In 2D STE, only two directions of strain can be measured at a time; e.g. longitudinal/radial from long-axis views, and circumferential/radial from short-axis views. In 3D STE, strain in all three directions is available from the same 3D recording, but with lower temporal and spatial resolution. Currently, 3D strain is undergoing development and is yet not ready for clinical routine use.

Note that strain measurement by STE is only possible for muscular structures which are larger than the resolution cell in the ultrasound image. Thin structures such as the atria will not give reliable regional strain information. However, successful tracking of the cavity boarder with STE can be used to estimate the percentage change in cavity circumference. In this case, average longitudinal strain should correlate well with, e.g. percentage left atrial (LA) circumference change.

### Reduced longitudinal cardiac strain in asthma patients [^113N6jNx]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is limited knowledge about the potential relationship between asthma and heart function. Aim of our present study was to examine if asthma may be associated with manifest or subclinical heart dysfunction.

Methods

Seventy-two allergic mild-to-moderate and severe asthma patients and 20 matched controls were enrolled in the study. Depending on the anti-asthmatic therapy, four subgroups of asthma patients were created: patients under long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) and inhaled cortisone without oral cortisone treatment with (1a) versus without (1b) additional omalizumab therapy; patients with LABA, inhaled cortisone and omalizumab treatment with (2a) versus without (2b) oral cortisone. Standard echocardiographic parameters as well as global longitudinal left and right ventricular strains as determined by ultrasound-based speckle-tracking method were evaluated. Furthermore, NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), immunoglobulin E (IgE), C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood count were assessed in asthma and control groups.

Results

There were no relevant differences in standard echocardiographic measures between both asthma groups and the control collective. Longitudinal left ventricular strain values were reduced significantly in severe and mild-to-moderate asthma groups (-12.91 ± 0.84% and -13.92 ± 1.55%, respectively), whereas longitudinal right ventricular strain values were additionally relevantly decreased in severe asthma (-10.35 ± 1.04%) compared to the control (-16.55 ± 0.49% and -18.48 ± 1.90%, respectively). Cardiac strains were similar in subgroups 1a and 1b. In contrast, patients from subgroup 2a presented reduced heart strains and decreased lung function compared to those from 2b. CRP, IgE, and eosinophils were significantly increased in asthma versus control individuals.

Conclusions

Allergic asthma, especially severe asthma is associated with subclinical impaired left and right ventricular function as determined by speckle-tracking analysis.

The authors report 1-year prospective data on eight patients with Friedreich ataxia. Idebenone did not halt the progression of ataxia. At the end of therapy, cardiac ultrasound demonstrated significant reduction of cardiac hypertrophy in six of eight patients. Cardiac strain and strain rate imaging showed that the reduction of hypertrophy is preceded by an early and linear improvement in cardiac function. Idebenone reduced erythrocyte protoporphyrin IX levels in five of six patients with elevated baseline levels; however, changes did not consistently relate to cardiac improvement.

Heart failure (HF) clinical applications of strain — ejection fraction (EF) remains the cornerstone, but detection of early disease, serial quantification, prediction of outcomes, and decision-making are potentially benefited by the addition of strain; HF has a life-time prevalence of about 20% and patients with risk factors including hypertension, diabetes and obesity are considered to have stage A HF (SAHF), while stage B HF (SBHF) is essentially asymptomatic LV dysfunction; with HF with preserved EF now accounting for more than half of all patients with HF, LV diastolic dysfunction, LA enlargement, and impaired LVGLS should be considered in this definition; in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, LVGLS should be reported to provide further prognostic information.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic examination in adults: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^116iHFXa]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography — strain imaging protocols and standardization emphasize that "the most useful clinical data come from application of longitudinal strain obtained by 2D speckle-tracking derived from apical imaging planes", and the writing committee "recommends that echocardiography laboratories that have ultrasound equipment capable of strain imaging develop laboratory protocols for acquiring appropriate apical images to calculate peak systolic strain of the segments of the left ventricle (note that ultrasound systems may display a 16-, a 17-, or an 18-segment model), display the results as a bull's-eye map, and calculate global longitudinal strain indices". Because "standardization among vendors continues to evolve, so precise normal ranges of values are not yet available", "serial strain imaging studies should therefore be performed on the same ultrasound system", "the timing definitions for end-diastole and end-systole should be standardized", and "minimum frame rates for high-quality image acquisition (generally > 40 frames/sec) should be established"; technical performance details "should be fully reviewed with application specialists before adopting strain imaging into the echocardiography laboratory work flow".

Detection of myocardial ischemia — diagnostic performance of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) at rest and stress shows modest accuracy with variable cutoffs. LVGLS analysis has the potential to detect latent LV dysfunction that is associated with myocardial ischemia due to significant coronary artery stenosis. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of LVGLS to predict significant coronary artery stenosis in patients presenting with acute and chronic chest pain (six studies, 781 patients, 97 with significant coronary artery stenosis) revealed that LVGLS measurements at rest have only modest diagnostic accuracy. The cutoff values of LVGLS for prediction of significant coronary artery stenosis varied between −17.4% and −19.7% with sensitivity of 51% to 81% and specificity of 58% to 81%. A preferential reduction of endocardial layer strain has been reported in patients who had normal wall motion but flow-limiting coronary stenosis (≥ 90% diameter stenosis), but these results need to be verified in larger studies. Compared with visual analysis, 2D strain analysis with use of GLS or SLS values at peak stress had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity, resulting in the similar diagnostic accuracy of the two methods. There are no definite and universal cutoff values for diagnosing significant coronary artery stenosis.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^116pj7yS]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Two‑dimensional speckle‑tracking echocardiography (STE) during stress echocardiography — frame‑rate limitations and study focus are as follows: Assessment of myocardial deformation using 2D STE is the most recently developed quantitative technique, but frame rates with STE are lower (50 to 90 frames/sec) than rates achievable with Doppler strain imaging (≥ 100/sec), potentially decreasing the accuracy of timing parameters and leading to underestimation of peak strain. The majority of clinical studies have focused on assessment of longitudinal strain utilizing apical views, and ischemia has been shown to affect longitudinal strain earlier than radial strain. Global peak longitudinal systolic strain is the quantitative parameter most often investigated, decreases in strain from rest to low dose have been shown in normal subjects, and the optimal STE parameter for detection of ischemia remains uncertain.

### Effects of ultrasound contrast during tissue velocity imaging on regional left ventricular velocity, strain, and strain rate measurements [^116HmYYp]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Strain (epsilon) rate (SR) imaging and left ventricular (LV) opacification with intravenous (IV) contrast both potentially decrease operator dependency in interpretation of stress echocardiography. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether contrast present during tissue velocity imaging (TVI) significantly affected measurements of velocity, epsilon, and SR. Secondly, we sought to evaluate whether increased scan line density improved feasibility of simultaneous TVI and contrast echocardiography.

Methods

The 4-chamber LV view in 15 healthy volunteers and 25 patients was acquired at rest before and after IV injections of contrast using: (1) conventional TVI; (2) LV opacification with standard TVI added; and (3) modified LV opacification with doubled TVI line density. Velocity, SR, and epsilon curves, along with peak systolic velocity, peak systolic SR, and end-systolic epsilon, were assessed from midwall segments.

Results

IV contrast significantly reduced feasibility of TVI with standard settings, giving noisy data for SR and epsilon, particularly in the septum. Absolute values of peak systolic SR and end-systolic epsilon from adequately shaped curves were significantly higher with contrast compared with baseline. However, increased TVI line density significantly improved feasibility of velocity traces with contrast and decreased the level of noise in SR and epsilon. Furthermore, higher line density improved agreement between peak systolic velocity, peak systolic SR, and end-systolic epsilon measured with contrast, and corresponding precontrast values from the conventional TVI setting.

Conclusions

SR imaging was not feasible performed with IV contrast during conventional TVI settings, and we do not recommend the clinical use of this combination. Increased TVI line density made velocity curves with contrast feasible and resulted in less noisy SR and epsilon curves, but variability in SR and epsilon measurements with contrast is still too high for clinical use.

### Clinical applications of strain echocardiography: a clinical consensus statement from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the European association of cardiovascular imaging of the European Society of Cardiology [^114nBaSt]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Clinical consensus statements — global longitudinal strain (GLS) for Stage A/B heart failure: Abnormal GLS (less negative than −16%) or borderline GLS (−16% to −18%) in the presence of other echocardiographic abnormalities should be considered a marker of SBHF. GLS should be obtained and reported in patients with increased left ventricular (LV) mass, on the basis that an apical sparing of regional longitudinal strain (mean of the apex > 2 times the mean of the rest of the heart) points toward the possibility of cardiac amyloidosis. GLS is currently not advised for the screening of SAHF, but there may be some utility in the recognition and monitoring of treatment of SBHF, and although patients with abnormal LVGLS in the setting of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are at risk for HF, there remains no evidence that screening for SBHF alters outcomes.

### Myocardial strain and association with clinical outcomes in danon disease: a model for monitoring progression of genetic cardiomyopathies [^115fKKxy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive analysis of the standard echo and strain measurements of patients with DD. In this cohort, we observed (1) a reduction in GLS with an apical‐sparing pattern; (2) a significant decrease in GLS in patients who experienced the composite outcome of death, advanced therapies, and ICD for secondary prevention compared with those who did not; and (3) a sizeable and significant area under the curve for GLS with a proposed cutoff of GLS < 10% to predict the composite outcome. These results suggest a potential role for using myocardial strain in DD to monitor disease progression, predict clinical outcomes, and evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions.

In this relatively small study, GLS appeared to outperform EF with regard to association with clinical outcomes and reliability as a marker to trend over time. Using speckle‐tracking of echocardiograms to quantify GLS has advantages over using EF to measure myocardial function. While EF and GLS are correlated, it is important to note that EF predominantly measures radial myocardial function while GLS measures longitudinal myocardial function. The myocardial fibers that are at greatest risk for disarray are located in the innermost area of the myocardium, the subendocardial region, and are responsible for longitudinal deformation. Therefore, GLS predominantly measures subendocardial function, which is more sensitive to ischemia and changes in wall stress, and can predict subclinical disease before reduction in EF. It has been hypothesized that strain may be most useful in settings of significant LV hypertrophy where EF often inadequately assesses systolic function. Patients with HCM represent a cohort that has preserved or hyperdynamic EF despite overall systolic function being considerably reduced. The hypertrophied ventricles lead to reductions in cavity volumes, which affect the inputs of calculated EF. On a more mechanistic level, the contractility of individual cardiac myocytes may be impaired because of various reasons including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fiber disarray, and interstitial fibrosis, which may not be captured by traditional echocardiographic parameters. Furthermore, impaired cardiac performance may be related to the extent of hypertrophy based on observations that LV mass and regional wall thickness affect global and regional myocardial mechanics. Although the pathophysiology driving hypertrophy in DD is very different compared with sarcomeric HCM, interstitial fibrosis is a common end‐stage finding in both diseases. It is possible that strain is a more sensitive mechanical marker for interstitial fibrosis than EF and thus can be used to predict outcomes earlier.

### Alteration in left ventricular strains and torsional mechanics after ultralong duration exercise in athletes [^115R3ZyZ]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous studies have reported evidence of cardiac injury associated with transient left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction after prolonged and strenuous exercise. We used 2D ultrasound speckle tracking imaging to evaluate the effect of an ultralong-duration exercise on LV regional strains and torsion. We speculated that systolic dysfunction after exercise is associated with depressed LV strains and torsion, and diastolic dysfunction results from decreased and delayed untwisting, a key factor of LV suction and early filling.

Methods and Results

Twenty-three triathletes underwent conventional and speckle tracking imaging echocardiography at rest before and immediately after an ultralong distance triathlon. Measurements included LV longitudinal, circumferential and radial strains, LV rotations, and LV torsion. After the race, LV systolic dysfunction was characterized by a decrease in LV longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strains, especially for apical radial strains (44.6 ± 15.1% versus 31.1 ± 13.8%, P < 0.001). Peak torsion was slightly decreased (8.3 ± 5.1 degrees versus 6.4 ± 3.9 degrees, respectively, P = 0.09) and significantly delayed (91 ± 18% versus 128 ± 31% of systolic duration, P < 0.001) beside end-ejection. Peak untwisting was also depressed and delayed beside isovolumic relaxation.

Conclusions

This study documented major alterations in cardiac strains and torsion after an ultralong distance triathlon. LV systolic strains were depressed but not delayed, whereas twisting was decreased and delayed. This altered pattern hampered the rapid untwisting during isovolumic relaxation phase, reducing LV diastolic suction and early filling.

### Current and evolving echocardiographic techniques for the quantitative evaluation of cardiac mechanics: ASE / EAE consensus statement on methodology and indications endorsed by the Japanese society of echocardiography [^115yQZhK]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular myocardial deformation — Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) strain and strain rate (SR) can be used to assess RV dynamics and were found to be feasible and roughly comparable, correlating with radionuclide right ventricular ejection fraction (RV EF); at the basal RV free wall, cutoff points of −25% (systolic strain) and −4 sec−1 (SR) yielded sensitivities of 81% and 85% and specificities of 82% and 88% for prediction of RV EF > 50%. In RV disease or dysfunction, peak systolic strain and SR are significantly reduced and delayed versus normal RV, abnormalities can be detected in pulmonary hypertension, amyloidosis, congenital heart diseases, and arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, and Doppler-derived strain/SR may identify subtle responses to vasodilator treatment and early RV involvement, including early alterations in systemic sclerosis with normal pulmonary pressures.

### Global longitudinal strain as a major predictor of cardiac events in patients with depressed left ventricular function: a multicenter study [^117NsiXm]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The risk stratification of patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can be performed using echocardiographic parameters such as the ejection fraction (EF). Recently, new technologies based on deformation measurements have been shown to identify early myocardial dysfunction before EF decrease. Consequently, tools such as two-dimensional strain have been incorporated into echocardiographic systems, allowing for fast, reliable, and reproducible calculation of longitudinal components of LV systolic deformation. The hypothesis in this study was that as a more sensitive marker of LV dysfunction, longitudinal strain would allow for the risk stratification of patients with heart failure.

Methods

This multicenter study included 147 patients with heart failure with LV EFs ≤ 45% (mean age, 64 ± 14 years; 74% men; mean LV EF, 29.9 ± 8.9%). Conventional echocardiographic parameters as well as global and segmental longitudinal strain were measured and compared with these values in a control population. Patients were monitored for cardiac events, defined as a composite criterion, over 12 months.

Results

Clinical events were observed in 20% of patients during the 12-month follow-up period. On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, global longitudinal strain had the highest prognostic value (area under the curve, 0.83) and the highest combination of sensitivity (73%) and specificity (83%), using a cutoff value of -7%.

Conclusion

Strain assessment is highly feasible and reliable in patients with LV dysfunction and allows for cardiovascular risk stratification in patients with heart failure with greater accuracy than LV EF.

### Therapeutic use of contrast ultrasound in acute coronary artery… [^112KavRY]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Initial safety and feasibility human studies demonstrated that intermittent high MI aimed at the myocardial microcirculation could improve capillary blood flow within the risk area and epicardial recanalization rates. In light of this, the investigators published the first prospective randomized human study showing the added value of sonothrombolysis to percutaneous coronary intervention. Sonothrombolysis improved recanalization rates and reduced infarct size, leading to sustained improvements in systolic function after STEMI. A total of 540 subjects will be included in this study. Subjects will be randomized to either receive DUS guided high MI impulses within and outside the risk area during a continuous infusion of intravenous 3% Definity® or placebo.

Comparisons between the two groups will be made on door to dilation times, survival, angiographic recanalization rates at initial angiography and reduction in microvascular obstruction and in infarct size determined by the salvageability index at cardiac magnetic resonance imaging post-STEMI and using myocardial perfusion imaging. The study will be divided into 6 subprojects: subproject 1
- safety and efficacy of the therapeutic use of intermittent high-energy ultrasound and microbubbles in the recanalization of acute STEMI treated with primary PCI. Additionally, the investigators will assess the effect of sonothrombolysis on autonomic function, cardiac function and intracellular signaling. All patients will receive conventional PCI approach, including aspirin 325 milligram, clopidogrel 600 milligrams and heparin bolus, followed by primary PCI using glycoprotein 2b/3a inhibitors as anti-thrombotic agents using established protocols.

Subproject 4: safety and efficacy of the therapeutic use of intermittent high-energy ultrasound and microbubbles in reducing microvascular obstruction and myocardial infarction size after primary PCI in patients with anterior wall myocardial infarction. Participants will receive STEMI/PCI approach as per guidelines likewise subprojects 1 and 2. Participants with NSTEMI or with high-risk unstable angina will receive intravenous infusion of microbubbles with therapeutic ultrasound with 4–20 usec and custom designed high mechanical index impulses designed for the

1. 8 MHz S5-1 transducer while waiting for percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Strain echocardiography in septic shock-a comparison with systolic and diastolic function parameters, cardiac biomarkers and outcome [^114YiqYR]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myocardial dysfunction in septic shock was first described as a condition of systolic depression despite normal or high cardiac output, demonstrating reversibility on remission. Since the introduction of echocardiography in intensive care clinical practice, the character and incidence of myocardial dysfunction in septic shock has been studied further. Systolic as well as diastolic dysfunction, or a combination of the two, has been described, but the true characteristics of this particular septic organ failure remain unclear. Moreover, there is still lack of consensus on the definition and clinical spectrum of this entity. Numerous studies have investigated the prognostic importance of myocardial depression in septic shock and its impact on mortality, with conflicting results.

Echocardiographic measurement of systolic function by assessing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is dependent on volume and pressure load on the myocardium, and the systolic function may be overestimated in cases of severe septic vasodilatation. The accuracy of echocardiographic measurements of diastolic dysfunction by Doppler measurements of blood or tissue velocity is dependent on the ultrasonic angle towards the tissue. Furthermore, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and vasoplegia, all of which are common in septic shock patients, pose challenges to a correct echocardiographic assessment. In recent years, strain echocardiography, an echocardiographic method measuring global left-ventricular longitudinal myocardial deformation (global longitudinal peak strain, GLPS), has been introduced. This method has been claimed to be less pressure- and angle-dependent and in cardiology settings has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting cardiac dysfunction than conventional echocardiography. In a paediatric population with septic shock, early myocardial dysfunction was identified with strain echocardiography, and in a recent experimental study in porcine septic shock, strain echocardiography revealed myocardial dysfunction before significant changes in LVEF were seen. Furthermore, a recent clinical study in severe sepsis and septic shock patients has shown similar results with a higher prevalence of impaired GLPS than LVEF.

With the high mortality in septic shock, the recognition of complicating factors, in this case myocardial dysfunction, is paramount. However, the role of strain echocardiography in septic shock patients is not yet established. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate strain echocardiography as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in septic shock by examining its relationship to other commonly used left ventricular function parameters, to cardiac biomarkers and clinical parameters, its change over time and its relation to outcome. We hypothesize that strain echocardiography can be used as a sensitive tool in the early recognition of septic cardiac dysfunction.

### Prognostic utility and clinical significance of cardiac mechanics in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: importance of left atrial strain [^111gESWE]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Left atrial (LA) enlargement is associated with adverse events in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the role of LA mechanics (ie, LA strain measures) in HFpEF has not been well studied. We hypothesized that in HFpEF, reduced (worse) LA strain is a key pathophysiologic abnormality and is a stronger correlate of adverse events than left ventricular or right ventricular longitudinal strain.

Methods and Results

We evaluated baseline LA function in 308 patients with HFpEF who were followed up longitudinally for adverse outcomes. All patients underwent speckle-tracking echocardiography for measurement of left ventricular longitudinal strain, right ventricular free wall strain, and LA booster, conduit, and reservoir strains. The clinical and prognostic significance of left ventricular, right ventricular, and LA strain measures was assessed by regression analyses. The mean age was 65 ± 13 years, 64% were women, 26% had atrial fibrillation, and LA enlargement was present in the majority of patients (67%). Decreased LA reservoir strain was associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance (P < 0.0001) and decreased peak oxygen consumption (P = 0.0001). Of the left ventricular, right ventricular, and LA strain measures, LA reservoir strain was the strongest correlate of adverse events and was independently associated with the composite outcome of cardiovascular hospitalization or death (adjusted hazard ratio per 1-SD decrease in LA strain, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.15–2.07; P = 0.006).

Conclusions

Abnormal indices of LA mechanics (particularly LA reservoir strain) are powerful clinical and prognostic factors in HFpEF. Unloading the LA and augmentation of LA function may be important future therapeutic targets in HFpEF.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^116akGSC]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) — in some patients with diastolic dysfunction and normal ejection fraction (EF), including those with and without HFpEF, LV global longitudinal function is reduced; abnormal LV longitudinal systolic function can be detected by speckle‑tracking measurement of GLS; although not an index of LV diastolic function, reduced LV GLS is one of the criteria used for HFpEF evaluation and is associated with worse outcomes in cardiovascular diseases associated with diastolic dysfunction.

Myocardial work indices — consensus use statements: Noninvasive echocardiography derived myocardial work indices are not advised for routine clinical use because of a lack of evidence for standardization and reliable cutoff values in the presence of pathology; in select cases where blood pressure is significantly altered, myocardial work indices may be appropriate as an alternative measure to GLS; RV myocardial work cannot be advised for clinical application at this time; and continued research is encouraged to establish standardization and clinical application of myocardial work indices.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Early detection of LV dysfunction using strain and strain rate — by 2014, 21 peer‑reviewed studies reported the sensitivity of deformation indices (strain, strain rate, and twist) for detecting subclinical LV dysfunction in cancer‑treated patients; anthracycline‑induced systolic impairment can occur as early as 2 hours after the first dose. In most studies, decreases in deformation indices preceded the decrease in LVEF and persisted during subsequent cancer treatment, with early decreases in radial and longitudinal strain and strain rate noted using DTI and speckle‑tracking echocardiography (STE).

### 2-and 3-dimensional myocardial strain in cardiac health and disease [^112L6GZa]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Advances in speckle-tracking echocardiography allowed the rise of deformation imaging as a feasible, robust, and valuable tool for clinical routine. The global or segmental measurement of strain can objectively quantify myocardial deformation and can characterize myocardial function in a novel way. However, the proper interpretation of deformation measurements requires understanding of cardiac mechanics and the influence of loading conditions, ventricular geometry, conduction delays, and myocardial tissue characteristics on the measured values. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the basic concepts of deformation imaging, briefly describe imaging modalities for strain assessment, and discuss in depth the underlying physical and pathophysiological mechanisms which lead to the respective findings in a specific disease.

### Cardiac mechanics and dysfunction with anthracyclines in the community: results from the PREDICT study [^111dL9gB]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Similar to our previous work and the work of others, we determined the predictive utility of longitudinal strain rate. We also found diagnostic associations between longitudinal and circumferential strain and cardiac dysfunction. However, we did not find changes in longitudinal or circumferential strain to be predictive of subsequent outcomes. Although initially counterintuitive, there are a number of potential reasons for this finding, including differences in image acquisition, strain software or tracing methodology across studies; variations in study design, analytic methods and participant characteristics across studies; and sample size limitations. It is also plausible that measurement error played a role, although our reproducibility analyses suggest very low variability.

There may, however, also be biological factors that explain these findings, particularly with regard to circumferential strain. Longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain measurements each reflect different dimensions of myocardial contractility and contribute to the global measure of EF. When myocardial injury occurs, dysfunction is typically not uniform across these dimensions. Studies performed in a variety of HF populations have suggested that longitudinal deformation is the first dimension of myocardial strain to become impaired, potentially reflecting vulnerability of the subendocardium. In this setting, circumferential strain may initially play a compensatory role in response to early cardiac injury, thereby resulting in preservation of EF. However, with further cardiac injury, the response may be deterioration of circumferential strain accompanied by reduced EF. It may be that temporal factors dictate the predictive relevance of circumferential strain. More specifically, it may be that circumferential strain is predictive in the longer, but not shorter term. In this study, follow-up was only 12 months, whereas in our prior study, participants were followed for up to 3 years.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) pathophysiology and LA strain — AF is associated with thromboembolism, heart failure (HF), and substantial health care costs; LA enlargement is a clear predictor of AF development and recurrence after cardioversion but is a late marker of disease progression; impairments of LA reservoir function can be detected with LA strain imaging even before atrial dilatation, and LA fibrosis increases LA stiffness and worsens reservoir and contractile function.

Strain and strain rate normal values by Doppler — In a large European population, the lower limits of normal range with the Doppler method were 18.5% longitudinal strain, 44.5% radial strain, 1.00 sec−1 longitudinal strain rate, and 2.45 sec−1 radial strain rate; longitudinal velocities are higher in the lateral wall than the septum, there is a base-to-apex gradient with higher velocities at the LV base, subendocardial values exceed subepicardial, and velocities and deformation are affected by age and loading conditions.

### Left ventricular myocardial strain by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography in healthy subjects: reference values and analysis of their physiologic and technical determinants [^112jvwKi]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite growing interest in applying three-dimensional (3D) speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) to measure left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation in various diseases, normative values for 3D speckle-tracking echocardiographic parameters and the effects of demographic, hemodynamic, and technical factors on these values are unknown.

Methods

In 265 healthy volunteers (age range, 18–76; 57% women), longitudinal strain (3DLε), circumferential strain (3DCε), radial strain (3DRε), and area strain (3DAε) were measured by using vendor-specific (Vsp) 3D speckle-tracking echocardiographic equipment. LV strain was also measured by using Vsp two-dimensional (2D) and vendor-independent 3D speckle-tracking echocardiographic software packages, for comparison.

Results

Reference values (lower limit of normality) for Vsp 3D STE were -17% to -21% (-15%) for 3DLε, -17% to -20% (-14%) for 3DCε, -31% to -36% (-26%) for 3DAε, and 47% to 59% (38%) for 3DRε. Three-dimensional longitudinal strain decreased, whereas 3DCε increased, with aging (P < .003), with different trends in men and women. Men had lower 3DLε, 3DRε, 3DAε, and 2D longitudinal strain than women (P < .02). LV 3D strain parameters were also influenced by LV volumes and mass, image quality, and temporal resolution (P < .02). Reference values obtained by Vsp 2D STE were -20% to -23% (-18%) for 2D longitudinal strain, -20% to -24% (-17%) for 2D circumferential strain, and 39% to 54% (28%) for 2D radial strain (P < .001 vs Vsp 3D STE). Significantly different 3DCε and 3DRε values were obtained with vendor-independent versus Vsp 3D STE (P < .001).

Conclusions

In healthy subjects, reference values of LV 3D strain parameters were significantly influenced by demographic, cardiac, and technical factors. Limits of normality of LV strain by Vsp 3D STE should not be used interchangeably with Vsp 2D STE or with Vin 3D STE software.

### Clinical applications of strain echocardiography: a clinical consensus statement from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the European association of cardiovascular imaging of the European Society of Cardiology [^111uPxdv]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Normal ranges of speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE)–derived global longitudinal strain (GLS) in adults — population metrics and determinants are summarized as follows: The mean GLS was −21% with variability quantified by SD 2.6%, yielding distribution-based limits where only 2.5% of normal people have GLS less negative than −15.9% and 32% are less negative than −18.4%. Endocardial strain shows higher absolute values than myocardial strain, and using endocardial strain with TomTec, the lower limit cutoff was −17% in men and −18% in women, in contrast to −16% reported elsewhere. A comprehensive meta-analysis across 47 studies including 23,208 healthy adults identified −16% as the lower limit of normal (LLN) for left ventricular GLS (LVGLS). Interindividual variation has been attributed to loading conditions, age, and gender, while race does not seem to make a major contribution; in elderly subjects (age > 65 years) with risk factors, the impact of age was evident again. Both acquisition equipment and analysis software should have a potentially important impact on GLS, though intervendor differences have been minimized; manufacturers may report myocardial or endocardial GLS, with the latter having about 10% greater absolute magnitude. For longitudinal follow-up and cross-system comparisons, studies on different vendors' machines should ideally use vendor-independent software and the same software version, and regional/segmental strain shows greater variability across vendors, including in a study of 58 patients. Test-retest variation is emphasized as the key metric for follow-up; intervendor work reported no statistically significant differences in test-retest variability of peak systolic or early systolic strain measures, but this was not the case for segmental strain.

Exercise and dobutamine stress echocardiography strain — Temporal resolution and dose-response features constrain quantification. With tachycardia it "requires a much higher frame rate than usual (ideally > 100 Hz) to maintain sufficient temporal resolution", and "Strain has a nonlinear response to stress with no further increment or decline at dobutamine infusion rates > 20 μg/kg/min", whereas "strain rate continues to increase to peak dose dobutamine, in proportion to LV dP/dt, and is therefore the optimal quantitative deformation marker for this purpose". Methodologic limits include that "The temporal resolution of current speckle tracking is inadequate for reliable measurement of strain rate", and "The ASE/EACVI task force on strain standardization has shown differences in test-retest variability and measured values that lead to significant concern about the ability of myocardial deformation to reliably quantify regional function". For ischemia detection, "Postsystolic shortening is a sensitive but nonspecific marker for ischemia and may also be seen in a regional scar", and "it may persist following resolution of ischemia: the phenomenon of ischemic memory". Consensus states: "Two-dimensional strain analysis at rest or during stress echocardiography may be appropriate for predicting significant coronary artery stenoses, especially in patients with good image quality. However, there is no specific quantitative cutoff, and the best results are obtained by analysis of the strain".

Strain imaging in cardiac amyloidosis — speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) highlights decreased global longitudinal LV strain (absolute value less than −15%) and a characteristic "cherry-on-the-top" bullseye map pattern with preserved apical longitudinal strain and severely abnormal basal and mid-LV strain; this bullseye pattern is likely the most specific sign to rule in the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, although it does not differentiate ATTR versus AL amyloidosis, and 2D and STE show a characteristic deformation appearance in affected patients.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive pediatric transthoracic echocardiogram: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1175kKms]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2024). High credibility.

Other measures of left ventricular size and systolic function in pediatrics include three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE), tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), myocardial performance index (MPI), and speckle-tracking strain. The use of 3DE to measure LV volumes and EF in children has gained popularity, and several pediatric studies have shown that 3DE measurements of LV volumes and EF have better reproducibility and correlate better with cardiac MRI measurements than M-mode and 2DE measurements, although limitations include lower temporal resolution, challenges with imaging the entire LV using a single transducer position, and lack of validation of 3DE assessment of LV mass and dyssynchrony. TDI measurement of velocity at the lateral and septal aspects of the MV annulus (s') is a measure of LV systolic function that is independent of geometry, although it has variable utility in pediatrics. MPI is a geometrically independent measure of combined LV systolic and diastolic function, but significant measurement variability of isovolumic times and the inability to determine which component is abnormal have precluded routine use at many pediatric centers. LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) provides early detection of myocardial dysfunction before abnormal changes in SF or EF and can be measured in apical four-, three-, and two-chamber views with good reproducibility when using a single ultrasound platform, using the average value to assess LV function. Because circumferential deformation appears to compensate for decreased longitudinal function in patients with LV pressure overload, global circumferential strain may have additive value; evaluation of LV peak segmental strain is recommended in some guidelines for adult patients, but its reproducibility is poor in children. Regional pattern analysis to identify electromechanical dyssynchrony and discoordination may be helpful in children with pacemakers or candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy, and this can be done by looking for patterns of abnormal LV contraction timing in LV longitudinal strain curves.

### Strain rate imaging after dynamic stress provides objective evidence of persistent regional myocardial dysfunction in ischaemic myocardium: regional stunning identified? [^1147zHBW]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether persistent ischaemic dysfunction of the myocardium after dynamic stress can be diagnosed from changes in ultrasonic strain rate and strain.

Design

Prospective observational study, with age matched controls.

Setting

University hospital.

Patients and Methods

26 patients (23 men, mean (SD) age 58.9 (8.1) years) with coronary artery disease but no infarction and 12 controls (9 men, aged 56.1 (8.8) years) with normal coronary arteriography and negative exercise test underwent treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol). Tissue Doppler echocardiography was performed at baseline, at peak exercise, and at intervals up to one hour. Systolic and diastolic velocity, strain, and strain rate were recorded in the basal anterior segment of 16 patients with proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease.

Results

Patients developed ischaemia, since they experienced angina, exercised for less time, and reached a lower workload than the control group, and had ST segment depression (-2.4 mm). Myocardial systolic velocity immediately after exercise increased by 31% and strain rate fell by 25% compared with increases of 92% and 62%, respectively, in the control group (p < 0.05). During recovery, myocardial systolic velocity and strain rate normalised quickly, whereas systolic strain remained depressed at 30 and 60 minutes after exercise, by 21% and 23%, respectively, compared with baseline (p < 0.05 versus controls). Myocardial diastolic velocities and strain rate normalised but early diastolic strain remained depressed by 32% compared with controls for 60 minutes (p < 0.05). Strain during atrial contraction was abnormal for 30 minutes.

Conclusions

Myocardial strain shows regional post-ischaemic dysfunction in systole and diastole and may become a useful diagnostic tool in patients presenting with chest pain with a normal ECG.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of Cardiovascular imaging [^112RxqYe]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Novel indices of left ventricular diastolic function — strain and untwisting rate: Several indices of LV and LA systolic and diastolic function have been proposed as indices of LV relaxation and LV and LA filling pressures. In general, patients with HFpEF usually have abnormally depressed LV GLS such that LVEDP varies directly with LV GLS, and a lower absolute value for GLS denotes more impaired LV global longitudinal function, but there is wide scatter so the relation cannot be used for estimation of LV filling pressures. LV global longitudinal diastolic strain rate measurements during the isovolumic relaxation period and during early diastole by STE have a significant association with the time constant of LV relaxation (τ), and these parameters have been used with mitral E velocity to estimate LV filling pressures and to predict outcomes in several disease states; however, technical challenges and variability based on ultrasound systems and software do not allow for easy day-to-day application. LV untwisting rate has garnered interest as a surrogate of LV relaxation, yet both animal and human studies show that LV relaxation is not the sole determinant and that LV filling pressures and LV recoil and thus LV systolic function affect it; several studies have shown normal LV untwisting rate in patients with HFpEF.

### Update in imaging of cancer therapy-related cardiac toxicity in adults [^115ywX4P]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Myocardial deformation

STE quantifies myocardial deformation by tracking speckle displacement during the cardiac cycle. Strain is expressed as percentage, which corresponds with the amount of deformation in a region of interest (ie, shortening or lengthening) in respect to the initial length, often measured at the end of diastole. The most evaluated STE parameter is 2D global longitudinal strain (GLS), which is the average of the strain values in the longitudinal direction of all 17 segments according to the ASE/EACVI LV segmentation model. Recently, 3D strain measurements are emerging, for which, similar to 3D LVEF assessment, no multiple apical images are required.

In the last decade, landmark reports demonstrated the additive value of strain assessment after cardiotoxic treatments. These results revealed that early decreases in deformation parameters during or after cancer therapy in adults allowed to predict subsequent LVEF deterioration. The ASE/EACVI Expert Consensus therefore strongly supports the use of GLS during follow-up, with a clinically significant deterioration of LV deformation supported by a relative percentage decrease of > 15% when compared with baseline. Changes of < 8% are considered normal as this concerns inter-variability and intra-variability of measurements. A recent prospective study in adults with lymphoma or leukaemia who were treated with a cumulative anthracyclines dose up to 300 mg/m 2, demonstrated that (2D) GLS > −17.45% at a cumulative anthracycline dose of > 150 mg/m 2 is an independent predictor of future CTRCD, defined as a decrease in the LVEF of > 10% points to a value < 53%. Pretreatment measurements of GLS in this cohort were significantly lower in the CTRCD group than in the non-CTRCD group, which may suggest an increased baseline risk profile for cardiovascular disease. This finding is supported by the study of Ali et al; their results demonstrated that reduced baseline GLS was a strong predictor of cardiac events in patients with haematologic cancers. A GLS threshold of −17.5% before anthracycline therapy would have correctly identified 86% of the patients who develop a cardiac event after start of chemotherapy, defined as symptomatic heart failure or cardiac death.

Common pitfalls and clinical advice for LV strain acquisition and quantification highlight that foreshortening of the LV apical windows erroneously increases apical segmental strain values; avoid using foreshortened LV images for strain quantification and ensure the true apex is visualized during acquisition. Poor visualization of myocardium and/or endocardial to blood interface in LV segments has the effect of poor endocardial/myocardial tracking; do not incorporate segments with areas of poor image quality and tracking into global strain calculations (if overall more than three segments are uninterpretable, do not report LVGLS values). Using excessively large myocardial region of interest (ROI) leads to underestimating strain values; ensure that only the full myocardial wall is included in the ROI, as inclusion of the pericardium artificially lower strain values.

### Myocardial strain imaging: how useful is it in clinical decision making? [^113wJ53g]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Quantification of global and regional left ventricular function

Myocardial strain and strain rate using TDI was introduced in the late 1990s, but has several limitations, including angle dependency. Currently, the most widely used strain modality is STE which can track speckles essentially independent of angle. Importantly, the measurements are still angle dependent because radial strain has opposite polarity of longitudinal and circumferential strains. Therefore, with increasing deviation from the major axis, there will be progressive reduction in absolute strain. To avoid underestimation, it is important to minimize foreshortening when using apical views, and in the short axis one should try to obtain circular LV images. Due to poorer spatial resolution in the lateral direction, best strain performance is always achieved in the direction of the ultrasound beam. Furthermore, similar to all measures of myocardial fibre shortening, systolic strain is load dependant and therefore blood pressure should be considered when interpreting measurements of strain. Other sources of variation in strain are age and gender.

Strain rate may also be measured by STE and has a strong relationship to contractility, but is limited by signal noise and relatively low frame rate which implies that information may be lost. Left ventricular twisting motion may also be measured by STE but this modality needs further development and is not ready for use in clinical routine.

Most laboratories record LV strain in the long axis and use global longitudinal strain (GLS) calculated as the average from all segments, as a measure of global LV function. Figure 1 shows typical segmental strain traces in a normal heart. Images for GLS are made in standard apical two-, three-, and four-chamber views and aortic valve closure (AVC) is used for timing of end-systole. When regional speckle tracking is suboptimal and recordings need to be rejected in more than two myocardial segments in a single view, the calculation of GLS should be avoidedand other methods for measuring global LV function should be used. Normal GLS for most echocardiography systems is reported between 18 and 25% in healthy individuals, a variation, which in part may be explained by inter-software and inter-vendor variability. Technically, good recordings can be achieved along any axis, but interpretation of radial and circumferential strains are complicated by substantial transmural non-uniformity in the normal left ventricle. Figure 2 illustrates and explains this phenomenon which is entirely a geometric effect and does not imply differences in contractility between LV wall layers. For longitudinal strain, however, such geometrical effects are of less magnitude.

### Myocardial strain imaging: how useful is it in clinical decision making? [^113XPZUT]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Directions for the future

Further development of strain imaging should be focused on even better standardization of the methodology between different vendors, and the ongoing development of 3D strain should improve the diagnostic potential from the technology. Furthermore, automated image analysis which takes into account more information than just peak strain is expected to improve the diagnostic power of strain imaging. This applies in particular to myocardial ischaemia where there are so many well-defined features in the strain trace that differs from normal myocardium and this information is wasted when using GLS as the only parameter. Since strain imaging can identify LV dysfunction earlier than conventional methods this opens a new perspective in heart failure prophylaxis and primary prevention with institution of therapeutic measures before the patients develop symptoms and irreversible myocardial dysfunction. Prospective clinical trials should be started to investigate the added clinical value that strain may represent in patient management. In the meantime, strain may be applied in routine clinical diagnostics with the limitations of the technology kept in mind.

### Global longitudinal strain: the best biomarker for predicting prognosis in heart failure? [^114gFHwR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

In fact, the Australian research team was one of the first to demonstrate the usefulness and the predictive value of GLS as a biomarker of cardiac prognosis. 7 Since the introduction of strain echocardiography almost two decades ago, the technique has struggled to become a clinical tool, which can partly be explained by scepticism in the cardiology community, time‐consuming analyses, and questions regarding reproducibility. The transition from a pure research tool to clinical praxis has been cumbersome, but has been facilitated by evolving techniques and strain analyses that are now partly automated. The senior author has strongly contributed to the transition of strain echocardiography into clinical practice and was visionary in his belief in the clinical value of GLS, when the majority of the community remained sceptical. 7, 10 The superior clinical value of GLS was again shown in the current article, and GLS has thereby strengthened its role as a reliable biomarker for HF.

The greatest advantage of GLS and why it may be the rising star of biomarkers in HF is the fact that GLS can be used as a direct measure of HF. While some biomarkers, such as NT‐proBNP, measure hormonal consequences of atrial stretch and elevated filling pressures, GLS gives us an accurate measure of reduced myocardial function.

NT‐proBNP is an excellent and easy to perform biomarker in patients with established HF, but has limited ability to assess HF in patients with normal EF. 11 This indicates that NT‐proBNP is most useful in HF at a later stage, when EF already is reduced. The non‐ischaemic failure of the left ventricle is a continuum, starting slowly in most patients, and when EF is finally reduced the process has been ongoing for some time. The poor sensitivity of EF to detect subtle myocardial dysfunction has led to the understanding that HF can exist without reduction in EF, i.e. HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). GLS has the ability also to assess mild systolic impairment and has revealed that patients with HFpEF already have reduced systolic function. 12 Therefore, with the help of GLS, our understanding of HF has changed to the more intuitive idea that HF is a disease affecting both systolic and diastolic function simultaneously.

Global longitudinal strain (GLS) — definition and measurement state Strain(%) = (Lt − L0)/L0, and on 2DE, peak GLS describes the relative length change of the LV myocardium between end-diastole and end-systole. Because MLS is smaller than MLd, peak GLS is a negative number, and we recommend that all references to strain changes specifically mention an increase or decrease in the absolute value of strain, to avoid confusion. After optimizing image quality, maximizing frame rate, and minimizing foreshortening, GLS measurements should be made in the three standard apical views and averaged, and should begin with the apical long-axis view to visualize aortic valve closure. When regional tracking is suboptimal in more than two myocardial segments in a single view, the calculation of GLS should be avoided; in such cases, alternative indices may be used, such as mitral annular plane systolic excursion or pulsed Doppler tissue imaging (DTI)–derived mitral annular peak systolic velocity (s'). Because of intervendor and intersoftware variability and age and load dependency, serial assessment of GLS in individual patients should be performed using the same vendor's equipment and the same software.

### Association between resting global longitudinal strain and clinical outcome of patients undergoing stress echocardiography [^1135p9bi]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS) of the left ventricle is associated with adverse prognosis in healthy subjects and in different cardiovascular conditions. Resting GLS may enable risk assessment independently from stress echocardiography (SE). We assessed whether there is an association of GLS measured at rest before SE with long-term outcome, independent of clinical parameters or reversible wall motion abnormalities and Doppler coronary flow velocity reserve.

Methods

Five hundred thirty patients who underwent SE for ischemia evaluation between 2010 and 2012 and who had rest images available were selected. Resting GLS was measured off-line (absolute value < 15% was considered abnormal). Cox models were used to examine the association between clinical variables, ejection fraction, SE variables, and resting GLS with mortality and cardiac events (cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction). The independent prognostic value of GLS over known rest and stress variables was assessed.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 137 patients died from any cause and 50 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction. Patients with resting GLS < 15% had significantly lower event-free survival (log-rank P < .0001). Resting GLS was significantly associated with risk of all-cause death and hard cardiac events, after adjustment for clinical risk factors, reversible wall motion abnormalities, and coronary flow velocity reserve. Adding resting GLS into a model with clinical, rest, and stress imaging variables significantly increased the model C index (P = 0.031).

Conclusions

In a large cohort of patients with suspected coronary artery disease referred for SE, resting GLS < 15% was independently associated with mortality and hard cardiac events, incremental to SE data. Model discrimination including resting GLS measurement was comparable to discrimination including SE results.

### Novel approach to artefact detection and the definition of normal ranges of segmental strain and strain-rate values [^114Gi674]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe artefact recognition using a qualitative assessment of strain curves. The main findings were as follows: (1) The presence of curve artefacts matched the presence of noise or other 2D image artefacts in 88% of participants; (2) in the presence of curve artefacts, strain values were systematically reduced, and they were increased by foreshortened long-axis projections; (3) discarding strain-curve artefacts rendered segmental strains with higher mean values and lower variability, whereas global strain was not affected and (4) this studydescribes the artefact-free normal ranges for layer-specific segmental strain in a large randomly selected population with normal heart structure and function.

Methodological considerations in curve-artefact detection

Artefacts caused by errors in automatic tracking generally result in low peak strain and low SR results, leading to misinterpretation as false pathological results. The concept of curve artefacts was built on the following considerations:

'Diastolic mismatch'

Normal and pathological strain curves display distinct patterns, where systolic deformation patterns can change due to pathologies causing reduced or delayed regional or global systolic shortening. In contrast to the systolic and early diastolic strains, the late diastolic strain is expected to display uniform strain curves with parallel stretching patterns. At the time of maximal postsystolic shortening (when present), all segments reached a relaxed state at approximately equal segment lengths. After this time point, all segments stretch in parallel at the end of the early filling phase through diastasis of the ventricle and atrial contraction until reaching the initial segment length at end-diastole. As shown in figure 2 -I, curves with deviating (often reduced) deformations of a single segment in late diastole can only represent an artefact. Thus, we called this type of artefact 'diastolic mismatch', describing strong positive deviation of the late diastolic curve from the diastolic strain-curve of other segments.

### Strain imaging in cardio-oncology [^113vkBdF]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic imaging is crucial for patient management during cardiotoxic cancer therapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction is the most commonly used parameter for identifying left ventricular dysfunction. However, it lacks sensitivity to detect subclinical changes in cardiac function due to cardiotoxic treatment. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is the best studied strain parameter with established diagnostic and prognostic value. Multiple studies have demonstrated changes in GLS as an early marker of cardiotoxicity. This document serves as a primer to help clinicians in the acquisition and interpretation of strain in cardio-oncology. Cases with embedded videos illustrate a step-by-step approach to obtaining GLS measurements and common pitfalls to avoid. The document includes a concise summary of the indications of GLS in cardio-oncology and its role in guiding oncological therapy. Practical approaches on how to implement strain in the echo laboratory with guidance on training and quality assurance are also discussed.

### Unveiling the diagnostic value of strain parameters across all 4 cardiac chambers in patients with acute myocarditis with varied ejection fraction: a cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature-tracking approach [^114iWfVb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, we did not observe a statistically significant decrease in radial strain in both the AMY group and the AMY‐pEF subgroup, whereas noteworthy reduction in AMY‐rEF subgroup was observed, suggesting a complex interplay of pathologic processes at different myocardial layers. This indicates that myocarditis has not progressed to a severity level affecting the endocardium. We believe that this observation prompts a deeper exploration of how pathologic changes at different myocardial layers affect myocardial strain in future research.

The findings from Secchi et aland Lee et alprovide a contrasting perspective to our study's results. Secchi et al observed a significant reduction in global RS in patients with preserved EF; Lee et al's segmented approach demonstrated a reduction in RS in both the midsection of the left ventricular short axis and the long‐axis view of the bichamber heart. Our study's differing results, with no significant decrease in RS observed in the EF‐preserved group, might reflect the diverse nature of myocarditis and its impact on the myocardium. The results underscore the importance of considering the method used for strain assessment, global versus segmental, and the specific patient population when interpreting strain data. This divergence in findings also emphasizes the need for further research to understand the implications of these differences and to establish a more comprehensive understanding of myocardial strain alterations in myocarditis. Such research could lead to more nuanced diagnostic criteria and tailored treatment strategies based on the specific pattern of myocardial involvement.

### Novel approach to artefact detection and the definition of normal ranges of segmental strain and strain-rate values [^112vmxx8]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

Strain artefacts are known to hamper the correct interpretation of segmental strain and strain-rate (S/SR). Defining the normal ranges of myocardial segmental deformation is important in clinical studies and routine echocardiographic practice. In order to define artefact-free normal ranges for segmental longitudinal S/SR parameters, we investigated the extent to which different types of artefacts and their segmental localisation in the three different myocardial layers created a bias in the results of echocardiographic strain measurements.

Methods

The study included echocardiograms from men and women aged 40–69 years from two population-based studies, namely the Know Your Heart study (Russia) and the Tromsø Study (Norway). Of the 2207 individuals from these studies, 840 had normal results, defined as the absence of hypertension or indicators of any cardiovascular disease. Two-dimensional (2D) global and segmental S/SR of the three myocardial layers were analysed using speckle tracking echocardiography. Artefacts were assessed with two different methods: visual identification of image-artefacts and a novel conceptual approach of 'curve-artefacts' or unphysiological strain-curve formation.

Results

Segmental strain values were found to have significantly reduced in the presence of strain-curve artefacts (14.9% ± 5.8% towards −20.7% ± 4.9%), and increased with the foreshortening of the 2D image. However, the individual global strain values were not substantially altered by discarding segmental artefacts. Reduction due to artefacts was observed in all segments, layers, systolic and diastolic strain, and SR. Thus, we presented normal ranges for basal-septal, basal, medial and apical segment groups after excluding artefacts.

Conclusion

Strain-curve artefacts introduce systematic errors, resulting in reduced segmental S/SR values. In terms of artefact-robust global longitudinal strain, the detection of curve-artefacts is crucial for the correct interpretation of segmental S/SR patterns. Intersegmental S/SR gradients and artefacts need to be considered for the correct definition of normalcy and pathology.

### Normal fetal cardiac deformation values in pregnancy; a prospective cohort study protocol [^112o4yCR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies have been published regarding normal values for strain and strain rate in the fetus during gestation using speckle tracking. Cardiac deformation imaging in the fetus is still experimental. Di Salvo et al. and Krause et al. showed that STE is a feasible and reproducible approach to assess fetal cardiac function. However, contradictory findings of cardiac function values are shown. This can be explained by differences in STE software that was used, study limitations as cross sectional study design, low number of included fetuses and low frame rates in the heart cycle clips. Even more, in the fetus, some technical challenges while using speckle tracking remain to be solved. An ECG cannot be performed synchronised with the ultrasound of the fetal heart as it is performed in adults. A simultaneously performed fetal ECG and ultrasound could possibly improve the reliability and reproducibility of the measurements. Next to technical challenges, functional cardiac evaluation in the fetus using speckle tracking remains difficult, as the quality of the imaging is dependent on fetal movements, fetal position, fetal heart rate, maternal movements and maternal habitus. Suboptimal imaging might cause suboptimal contrast between the ventricular cavity and the myocardial wall resulting in poor tracking of the endocardial border.

STE in the fetus can be easily performed from early gestation, is non-invasive, non-expensive and easy to apply in already existing daily practice. Fetal heart deformation is thought to be the first sign of fetal adaptation to impaired placental function. Therefore, the measurement of fetal heart deformation using STE could be a promising clinical tool in the daily follow up of pregnancies complicated by placental dysfunction. Preclinical deformation of the fetal heart could help to distinguish the endangered fetus from a constitutional small fetus.

However, before STE can be used as a clinical tool in complicated pregnancies, the establishment of normal strain and strain rate reference values in a healthy cohort during gestation is mandatory, prerequisite for its use in evaluating (pathologic) changes of function of both ventricles during pregnancy. There is a need for age specific reference values, assessed using the same ultrasound and software package, in a longitudinal study design, for the adequate interpretation of measurements of STE.

To obtain reliable reference values during pregnancy, this study will assess cardiac deformation values with the same ultrasound and software package in 100 uncomplicated pregnancies. These reference values are mandatory before cardiac deformation values in complicated pregnancies can be evaluated for clinical use.

Increased risk in cardiovascular disease during lifetime is expected in children born from a pregnancy complicated by placental dysfunction. In the future, for follow up, neonatal and infant growth and development might be examined to assess the long-term consequences of fetal cardiac remodelling.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1114yTmo]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Echocardiography — left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) is a measure of LV systolic function, with impaired LV GLS common in some patients with HFpEF indicating subclinical LV dysfunction. Reported advantages are that it is a more sensitive index than EF, can provide earlier detection of myocardial disease when EF is normal, can be more reproducible than EF, and may better discriminate outcomes in HFrEF and HFpEF. Reported limitations include the need for dedicated software, susceptibility to suboptimal image quality, load dependence, and inter-vendor variability that may limit interchangeability of results.

### Strain improves risk prediction beyond ejection fraction in chronic systolic heart failure [^111U8WFM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, representing a leading cause of death and hospitalization. As such, accurate assessment of cardiac function is critical in order to gauge prognosis and guide therapy, particularly in chronic systolic HF. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is an established predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in these patients, – but its prognostic utility across the full spectrum of HF is limited. – As such, there is an important need to determine the value of novel quantitative imaging measures of cardiac function and mechanics in order to improve upon the identification of HF patients at increased risk of adverse outcomes.

Speckle‐tracking is an emerging technology that enables the noninvasive characterization of regional myocardial strain and strain rate in longitudinal, circumferential, and radial dimensions. – Strain is defined as the change in length of a tissue normalized to its original length ([L−L 0]/L 0), and strain rate describes the rate at which this change occurs, representing the time‐derivative of strain. These measurements are independent of ultrasound scanline angle and are readily derived using semi‐automated methods. Longitudinal strain represents shortening and lengthening of the subendocardial and subepicardial myocardium, which is believed to be more sensitive to early changes such as those induced by subendocardial ischemia. Short‐axis function is a composite action of both longitudinal and circumferential fibers, and is characterized by fibers that thicken and thin in the radial direction, and shorten and lengthen in the circumferential direction. These measures are all highly quantitative and provide insight into regional and global cardiac function.

### A test in context: myocardial strain measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography [^112K2Ny1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Strain-based imaging techniques (and specifically speckle-tracking echocardiography) have been shown to have clinical utility in a variety of settings. This technique is being embraced and increasingly adopted in many echocardiography laboratories worldwide. This review appraised speckle-tracking echocardiography in a clinical context by providing a critical evaluation of the prognostic and diagnostic insights that this technology can provide. In particular, we discuss the use of speckle-tracking strain in selected areas, such as undifferentiated left ventricular hypertrophy, cardio-oncology, aortic stenosis, and ischemic heart disease. The potential utility of regional and chamber strains (namely segmental left ventricular strain, left atrial strain, and right ventricular strain) are also discussed. Future directions for this technology are explored. Before its clinical application, it is particularly important that physicians be cognizant of the technical challenges and inherent limitations of strain data, which are also addressed here.

Risk stratification after myocardial infarction — LVGLS predicts long-term adverse outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with absolute GLS cutoffs ranging from 9.3% to 15.1% and meta-analysis showing that for each 1% reduction in LVGLS, the hazard ratio for adverse outcome was increased by 34%; these findings were verified after adjustment, including in patients with left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) > 40%. Right ventricular (RV) strain also has prognostic value; in 621 patients after AMI, right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) was significantly associated with all-cause mortality and provided independent incremental value over clinical variables and LV function parameters including LVEF, E/e' ratio, and mitral regurgitation.

### Atrial strain rate is a sensitive measure of alterations in atrial phasic function in healthy ageing [^115fSTYK]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Strain and strain rate measure local deformation of the myocardium and have been used to evaluate phasic atrial function in various disease states. The aim of this study was to define normal values for tissue Doppler-derived atrial strain measurements and examine age-related changes by decade in healthy individuals.

Methods

Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed on 188 healthy subjects. Tissue Doppler-derived strain and strain rate were measured from the apical four and two-chamber views of the left atrium, and global values were calculated as the mean of all segments. Measurements included peak systolic strain, systolic strain rate, early and late diastolic strain rate. Phasic left atrial volumes and fractions were calculated. Mitral inflow and tissue Doppler imaging were employed to estimate left ventricular diastolic function.

Results

A significant reduction in global systolic strain was observed from decade 6. Alterations in atrial strain rate were apparent from decade 5; systolic strain rate and early diastolic strain rate decreased, while late diastolic strain rate increased significantly. Changes in phasic atrial volume and function occurred in conjunction with age-related changes in left ventricular diastolic function. Importantly, age-related changes in global atrial systolic strain rate and early diastolic strain rate occurred a decade before corresponding changes in atrial phasic volume parameters.

Conclusion

Atrial strain and strain rate can be used to quantify atrial phasic function and appear to be altered before traditional parameters with ageing. Strain analysis may therefore be more sensitive in detecting subclinical atrial dysfunction with alterations in strain rate parameters observed before traditional parameters.

### Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular structure and function: new modalities and potential applications in clinical trials [^114fPQvY]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Advances in modern echocardiography for quantification of cardiac structure and function have not been translated in clinical trial or practice applications to date. Imaging endpoints are especially well-suited for early trials with investigational therapies for heart failure as most drugs and devices approved for heart failure have shown favorable effects on cardiac structure and function also. Echocardiography is versatile and can be performed in most clinical settings. The modest interobserver and test-retest reproducibility of specific structural and functional parameters with conventional echocardiography can be improved on by using contemporary modalities, including 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography for assessment of volumes and ejection fraction and speckle tracking for detailed functional assessment of the ventricles with mechanics-based parameters (strain and strain rate). The appropriate imaging endpoints (global vs. regional, systolic vs. diastolic) should be tailored to the specific research question and the mode of action of the therapy under investigation. The newer echocardiographic modalities, namely 3D echocardiography and speckle tracking, are more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel and therefore are better suited for implementation in experienced research centers with central interpretation. However, these modalities provide the best opportunity currently available to demonstrate treatment effects on the myocardium with investigational therapies and provide mechanistic insights for future directions.

### Longitudinal strain in the management of cardiac AL amyloidosis: do we need it? [^114XjE2W]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

This editorial relates to 'Longitudinal strain is an independent predictor of survival and response to therapy in patients with systemic AL amyloidosis', by O.C. Cohen et al.

Over the last years, research on light-chain (AL) amyloidosis has focused on the search for variables able to detect and quantify cardiac and renal involvement, predict survival, and monitor disease progression and response to treatment, in terms of the plasma cell disorder and organ damage. Finding reliable indicators of disease status becomes increasingly important given the growing number of therapeutic options.

Graphical Abstract
The place of longitudinal strain (LS) alterations in the natural history of amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. The three concentric circles report, from outside to inside, the mechanisms of cardiac damage, the main pathophysiological abnormalities, and the corresponding echocardiographic findings. The order of the pathophysiological abnormalities and echocardiographic findings broadly reflect the timing of their development. LS, longitudinal strain; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MAPSE, mitral anular plane systolic excursion; MCF, myocardial contraction fraction; NPs, natriuretic peptides; RFP, restrictive filling pattern; SV, stroke volume.

In this issue of the European Heart Journal, Cohen et al. report the results of a detailed characterization of echocardiographic and haematology findings in 915 patients with AL amyloidosis [69% of whom had cardiac amyloidosis (CA)]. The authors report that longitudinal strain (LS) of the left ventricle provides important information about the whole natural history of AL amyloidosis. Indeed, LS values at baseline testify to the presence of cardiac involvement, which is an established predictor of outcome in patients with AL amyloidosis. Accordingly, LS also predicted survival independently of several variables from standard echocardiographic examination. Interestingly, patients with the most severe impairment in LS had a poor prognosis even regardless of the Mayo staging system (which includes biomarkers of cardiac damage) and other variables including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Changes in LS over time also reflect variations in cardiac function and, in treated patients, the response to therapy, with a possible added value over indicators reflecting the plasma cell disorder alone, such as the difference between involved and non-involved free light chains (dFLCs). Using this, the authors identify patients with an absolute improvement of LS ≥ 2% and a final dFLC < 10 mg/L after 12 months of treatment as the subgroup with the best prognosis.

Despite some methodological limitations acknowledged by the authors, the study is very stimulating and raises a number of questions.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Right ventricular longitudinal strain (RV LS) — measurement and reporting guidance emphasizes technique and clinical use. To obtain accurate and reproducible RV LS by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), an RV-focused apical four-chamber view acquired between 60 and 90 frames/sec should be used, and dedicated RV software or left-atrial–derived software with a manually adapted region of interest and thickness reduced to 5 mm can be used, with assessment easier and more reproducible using dedicated software. Among RV longitudinal deformation parameters, the free wall LS has the most robust diagnostic and prognostic documentation; normal values of RVFWLS are sex-specific but do not change with age, and RVFWLS should be measured and reported (when technically feasible) in patients with evidence for RV enlargement, regional or global dysfunction, moderate or greater TR, or PH.
