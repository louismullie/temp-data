## Question

Acute testicular pain unilateral

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate acute unilateral testicular pain, with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification language preserved and enhanced. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and time-sensitive priorities, especially torsion. Then, I should verify the focused history elements that stratify risk. Next, I will examine the physical findings that meaningfully change pretest probability. After that, I need to check the initial laboratory tests and their limitations. Then, I will review imaging strategy, including ultrasound protocols and pitfalls. Next, I should synthesize a differential diagnosis and decision pathways. Finally, I will outline management by diagnosis, special populations, and follow-up, while double-checking for pitfalls and documenting key teaching points throughout.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and analgesia come first, but in acute unilateral scrotal pain I must simultaneously consider torsion as a surgical emergency and act within the ischemic window; I should not delay urologic consultation for imaging if torsion is suspected, and I should remember that salvage drops sharply after about 6 hours, so time is testis here [^116LJ873].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently shift pretest probability: onset and tempo matter — sudden severe pain favors torsion, whereas gradual pain over days suggests epididymitis; duration since onset directly correlates with salvage; associated symptoms such as nausea/vomiting, abdominal or groin pain, dysuria, fever, and urethral discharge refine the differential; I should also ask about trauma, recent strenuous activity, sexual exposures, urinary symptoms, prior similar episodes, and comorbidities like BPH or immunosuppression, while remembering that torsion can present with abdominal pain alone in children and adolescents, which is easy to miss if I don't examine the genitals [^116LJ873] [^115UAyUD] [^1153YEy5].

> Hold on, I should verify the physical exam maneuvers and their reliability: inspect for scrotal erythema/edema, a high-riding or transverse lie testis, and a reactive hydrocele; palpate for focal epididymal tenderness versus diffuse testicular tenderness; test the cremasteric reflex — its absence increases suspicion for torsion, but its presence does not exclude it; Prehn's sign is not reliable enough to rule in or out torsion; I should also examine the groin for hernia and the abdomen for referred pain sources, and I need to remember that in prepubertal boys, torsion is more likely to present atypically and with delayed care, worsening salvage [^113Narxy] [^113qrQLN] [^116NGyfv].

> I need to check the initial laboratory tests and their limitations: urinalysis helps if positive for pyuria/bacteriuria supporting infection, but a negative urinalysis does not exclude epididymitis; a CBC and CRP may support inflammation but are nonspecific; in sexually active patients, I should obtain NAATs for gonorrhea and chlamydia; importantly, normal labs do not exclude torsion, so I must not anchor on normal results when the clinical picture is concerning [^116MHJiF].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy, and I must not jump to conclusions: ultrasound with color Doppler is first-line for acute scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass; however, I should double-check for pitfalls — early torsion, intermittent torsion, or torsion with preserved flow can mimic epididymitis; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, I should escalate to urology for surgical exploration rather than delay for more imaging; adjuncts like contrast-enhanced ultrasound or MRI can help in select scenarios, but they should not delay emergent management when torsion is suspected [^111gKjps] [^112oF2w3] [^1172eu2q] [^116gHceD].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis and how to triage it: torsion of the spermatic cord is the must-not-miss emergency; torsion of the testicular appendage is common in children and can mimic epididymitis; epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis is common in adolescents and adults and may be STI- or enteric-related; trauma-related entities include rupture, hematocele, and traumatic epididymitis; less common but important mimics include segmental testicular infarction, spontaneous intratesticular hemorrhage, Fournier's gangrene, incarcerated hernia, vasitis, hydrocele/varicocele with acute symptoms, and referred pain from abdominal or retroperitoneal sources; I should also remember that COVID-19 can precipitate epididymo-orchitis and that torsion of an undescended testis presents with a groin mass and delayed care [^115UAyUD] [^111byu86] [^112i7sqQ] [^114JMtd5] [^112uMwaK] [^116Jpxdx].

> I will now examine the decision pathway when torsion is suspected: if the history and exam are highly suggestive, I should call urology immediately and not delay for imaging; manual detorsion can be attempted as a temporizing measure while arranging surgery, ideally within 6 hours; if the diagnosis is uncertain but concern persists, I should obtain emergent Doppler ultrasound and proceed to exploration if imaging is nondiagnostic or unavailable; I need to ensure the contralateral testis is fixed at the time of exploration to prevent asynchronous torsion [^116LJ873] [^112aMqbU] [^114GWicZ].

> For suspected epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis, let me think about targeted therapy: empiric antibiotics should cover likely STI pathogens in sexually active men and enteric organisms in older men or those with urinary risk factors; I should arrange close urologic follow-up and consider ultrasound if the diagnosis is uncertain, if symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours, or if complications are suspected; complications include abscess, infarction, and testicular rupture, which may require surgical intervention despite antibiotics [^111aACwo] [^1143wztB].

> But wait, what if the presentation is trauma-related: I should stabilize, provide analgesia, and obtain scrotal ultrasound to assess for hematoma, hematocele, testicular rupture, or tunica injury; if rupture is suspected, urgent urologic exploration is indicated; if managed conservatively, repeat ultrasound within 48 hours is prudent to ensure stability and evolving complications are not missed [^112kQrUX] [^111gsDG5] [^1174UBCp].

> I should double-check special populations and atypical presentations: in prepubertal boys, torsion is more likely to present with abdominal pain and delayed care, worsening salvage; in patients with cryptorchidism, torsion of an undescended testis presents as a tender groin mass and ultrasound may be misleading, so surgical exploration should not be delayed; in older adults, I must consider referred pain from AAA or retroperitoneal processes when the scrotal exam is unrevealing; in patients with recent COVID-19, epididymo-orchitis is a recognized complication and should be considered to avoid unnecessary surgery [^116NGyfv] [^112uMwaK] [^11699nTq] [^114JMtd5].

> Next, I should review documentation and disposition: I need to record onset, duration, severity, associated symptoms, exam findings including cremasteric reflex and testicular lie, labs, imaging results, and the working diagnosis; if torsion is suspected, I should document the time of urology consultation and any attempts at manual detorsion; disposition ranges from emergent surgery for torsion to urgent urology follow-up for complex infections or trauma, with clear return precautions for worsening pain, fever, or new swelling [^112aMqbU].

> Hold on, I should verify key pitfalls and pearls to prevent misdiagnosis: a normal ultrasound does not exclude torsion, especially early or intermittent; an absent cremasteric reflex supports torsion but a present reflex does not rule it out; Prehn's sign is unreliable; torsion can present solely with abdominal pain; and patient delay is the biggest driver of orchiectomy, so education and rapid triage are critical to improving salvage [^113Narxy] [^113qrQLN] [^1153YEy5] [^115mbyVQ].

> Let me reconsider the imaging protocol to ensure completeness: high-frequency linear transducers with grayscale and color/power Doppler are essential; comparing the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides in transverse views improves diagnostic confidence; documenting testicular size, echotexture, and flow asymmetries is necessary; if standard Doppler is equivocal, advanced techniques like microvascular imaging or contrast-enhanced ultrasound can help, but they should not delay surgical exploration when torsion remains likely [^1163qvxL] [^113SukRU] [^113dQDuj].

> Finally, I need to ensure the management summary is actionable: torsion requires emergent urology consultation and surgical exploration with contralateral fixation; epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis warrants empiric antibiotics tailored to STI versus enteric risk with close follow-up; trauma requires ultrasound and urology input for potential exploration; and when the diagnosis remains uncertain with persistent high suspicion for torsion, I should escalate to exploration rather than waiting for more imaging, because time is the key determinant of testicular salvage [^114GWicZ] [^111gsDG5] [^112oF2w3].

Acute unilateral testicular pain is a **urologic emergency** [^112oF2w3] in which testicular torsion must be excluded immediately [^112uAxv1] because salvage drops sharply after 6 hours [^117L1kG2]. Ultrasound with Doppler is the **first-line imaging** [^111gKjps] to assess perfusion and differentiate torsion from epididymitis, but a normal scan does not exclude torsion when clinical suspicion is high [^112aMqbU]. Immediate urology consult is required for suspected torsion; surgical exploration should not be delayed for imaging [^116gHceD]. Epididymitis is suggested by gradual onset, fever, dysuria, and positive urinalysis [^113DBVti]; treat empirically for STIs or enteric organisms and arrange close follow-up [^111aACwo]. Other causes include trauma, hernia, tumor, and referred pain; a focused history, exam, and ultrasound guide management [^113baDKy].

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for acute unilateral testicular pain includes:

| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Imaging findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Testicular torsion | - Sudden severe pain <br/> - Nausea/vomiting <br/> - High-riding testis <br/> - Absent cremasteric reflex [^113Narxy] | - Absent or reduced blood flow on Doppler [^1111ZvFU] |
| Epididymitis | - Gradual onset <br/> - Fever <br/> - Dysuria <br/> - Positive urinalysis [^notfound] | - Increased epididymal blood flow [^112uAxv1] |
| Torsion of testicular appendage | - Mild pain <br/> - Blue dot sign [^1111ZvFU] | - Avascular nodule [^116BQCdy] |
| Testicular trauma | - History of trauma <br/> - Hematocele [^112nt1Cu] | - Hematoma or rupture [^112nt1Cu] |
| Incarcerated inguinal hernia | - Groin mass <br/> - Bowel sounds [^notfound] | - Herniated bowel [^111NzRCr] |
| Testicular tumor | - Painless mass <br/> - Rarely painful [^114b3aAa] | - Intratesticular mass [^114b3aAa] |
| Referred pain (e.g. renal colic, AAA) | - Flank/abdominal pain <br/> - Hematuria [^116Jpxdx] | - Normal scrotal ultrasound [^116Jpxdx] |

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Obtain a focused history covering onset and duration (sudden onset suggests torsion; gradual onset suggests epididymitis) [^113DBVti], associated symptoms (nausea/vomiting, fever, dysuria, trauma, sexual activity) [^116LJ873], and relevant medical history (prior torsion, undescended testis, recent surgery, urinary tract infection) [^115UAyUD].

---

### Physical examination

Perform a focused exam assessing testicular tenderness, position, and cremasteric reflex; an absent cremasteric reflex supports torsion [^113Narxy]. Also evaluate for scrotal swelling/erythema, a blue dot sign (appendage torsion) [^1111ZvFU], and a groin mass suggesting hernia [^114b3aAa].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Ultrasound with Doppler is the **first-line imaging** [^111gKjps] to assess perfusion and differentiate torsion from epididymitis; however, a normal scan does not exclude torsion when clinical suspicion is high [^112aMqbU]. If ultrasound is inconclusive and suspicion persists, obtain an MRI [^1142ehw1].

---

## Management

### Testicular torsion

- **Immediate urology consult**: Do not delay for imaging [^116gHceD].
- **Manual detorsion**: Attempt if surgery is delayed [^116SFhGb].
- **Surgical exploration**: Within 6 hours for best salvage [^114b3aAa].

---

### Epididymitis

- **Empiric antibiotics**: Cover STIs (ceftriaxone + doxycycline) or enteric organisms (levofloxacin) [^notfound].
- **Supportive care**: Analgesia, scrotal elevation, rest [^notfound].
- **Follow-up**: Ensure improvement within 48–72 hours [^notfound].

---

### Other causes

For other causes, manage trauma conservatively or with surgery as indicated [^111gsDG5], reduce and repair hernias emergently [^111GAB4p], and refer testicular tumors to urology for oncologic management [^114b3aAa].

---

## Complications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed treatment of testicular torsion can cause testicular loss, impaired fertility, and psychological distress [^116LJ873]. Delays in treating epididymitis can lead to abscess, infarction, or chronic pain [^113FsJKR].

---

## Follow-up and patient education

Arrange urology follow-up for torsion, epididymitis, or tumor, and counsel on testicular self-examination and prompt presentation for recurrent pain. Emphasize that torsion is a surgical emergency and that early treatment preserves testicular viability [^116LJ873].

---

Acute unilateral testicular pain requires **rapid exclusion of torsion** [^115oYZq8] and early targeted therapy. Ultrasound with Doppler is the key diagnostic test, but clinical judgment guides urgency; immediate urology involvement is essential when torsion is suspected [^112uAxv1].

### Spontaneous idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage as a differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain [^112i7sqQ]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We reported a case of idiopathic spontaneous intratesticular hemorrhage which is a rare entity. It is still challenging to diagnose this entity and decide how to save the testis if this is possible. This rare entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of unilateral acute scrotal pain. Clinical, radiologic, and histopathological correlation are mandatory to reach the diagnosis.

### The nontraumatic, acute scrotum [^114RR9oX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Regardless of age, any presentation of an acute scrotum requires prompt triage and immediate evaluation. The potential for significant reduction in morbidity and mortality exists if timely diagnosis and treatment are provided. Often overlooked, an early scrotal examination in the emergency department may produce the most accurate information into the underlying pathologic process, be it systemic or localized to the scrotum. Although the immediately lethal conditions presenting as acute scrotal pain should be considered, the combined incidence and morbidity associated with testicular torsion make its exclusion paramount in acute scrotal presentations. Similarly, a painless scrotal mass must be assumed to be a testicular neoplasm until proven otherwise, with appropriate work-up and rapid urologic follow-up assured.

### Spontaneous idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage as a differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain [^112FmC1L]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

The final diagnosis for most of the cases was made only after surgical exploration and unilateral orchiectomy, but the best course of action might be to quickly remove the affected tissue for a frozen section in order to potentially save the testicle. This is decisive but invasive as well, and it may be prevented if the diagnosis of spontaneous intratesticular hemorrhage is determined with certainty by other diagnostic modalities. One of the reported cases in the literature discussed the first testicular salvage in an adult with idiopathic spontaneous testicular hemorrhage based on sonographic and perioperative findings, accordingly, the testicle was preserved. Additionally, there is a similar first case report in the pediatric population. Accordingly, the accurate diagnosis of a spontaneous intratesticular hemorrhage depends on many factors including the physician's having a high degree of suspicion for this rare entity, in addition to the clinical history and sonographic findings. MRI can be crucial in making the diagnosis of spontaneous intratesticular hemorrhage when sonographic results are inconclusive. It is very crucial to rule out bleeding disorders, predisposing factors, and trauma before the diagnosis of spontaneous intratesticular hemorrhage.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to suspect spermatic cord (testicular) torsion in patients with a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis, especially in adolescents and patients without evidence of inflammation or infection.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute onset of Scrotal pain-without trauma, without antecedent mass [^117L1kG2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as testicular swelling with acute pain and can reflect multiple etiologies including epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the spermatic cord, or torsion of the testicular appendages. Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum and its etiology with imaging is necessary because a delayed diagnosis of torsion for as little as 6 hours can cause irreparable testicular damage. Ultrasound duplex Doppler of the scrotum is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for the acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass in an adult or child. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

### In emergency settings, can a negative Prehn's sign be used to aid diagnosis of testicular torsion? [^113qrQLN]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Prehn's sign describes the eradication of testicular pain on lifting the scrotum and has been proposed as a method to differentiate causes of acute testicular pain. A short systematic review was conducted to evaluate the question: in patients presenting with acute unilateral testicular pain, is a negative Prehn's sign an accurate sign for diagnosis of testicular torsion (TT)?Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched using the OVID interface from inception to 26 February 2025. Following the removal of duplicates, the search strategy yielded a total of 11 papers. Study information, participant group, relevant outcomes and study weaknesses were extracted from each article. Four studies addressed the three-part question. The only study that had the full text available for review found that 33% of patients with TT had a positive Prehn's sign, which equated to an OR of 5.941 (95% CI 1.432 to 24.658). Of the three remaining retrospective cohort studies, Prehn's sign was reported to be positive in 10.5%, 37.5% and 100% of patients with TT, respectively. Therefore, the negativity of Prehn's sign ranged from 0% to 89.5% in patients with TT. The clinical bottom line is that Prehn's sign is insufficiently sensitive to rule out TT; however, its negativity increases the likelihood of a TT diagnosis.

### Best evidence topic report: in emergency settings, can an absent cremasteric reflex be used to aid diagnosis of testicular torsions? [^113Narxy]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A short systematic review was completed to answer the three-part question: in patients presenting with acute unilateral testicular pain, is an absent cremasteric reflex an accurate sign for diagnosis of testicular torsion (TT)? MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched on 05 January 2025 using the outlined search strategy. 67 unique papers were found and screened for relevance. 13 relevant papers were identified. Study information, participant group, relevant outcomes and study weaknesses were extracted from each paper and presented in a table. Results revealed up to 100% of patients with TT had an absent cremasteric reflex; however, due to small sample sizes, there was wide variation in sensitivities (21–100%) between the papers. Small sample sizes and the inclusion of retrospective studies were significant limitations within this paper. The clinical bottom line proposes that although an absent cremasteric reflex is common in TT, the presence of a cremasteric reflex cannot be used to rule out TT.

### Spontaneous idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage as a differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain [^1163DXfF]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A previously healthy 15-year-old boy presented with acute-onset left testicular pain for 12 h. He was afebrile, denied having any dysuria or hematuria, and denied any history of previous trauma. Physical examination showed a left testicle that was diffusely enlarged without any discrete masses, On palpation, the left testis was tender and swollen. The right testis was normal. Ultrasonography shows heterogeneous enlargement of the left testis with areas of decreased echogenicity. No associated masses are identified. Testicular doppler ultrasonography shows absent blood flow. Surgical exploration was decided urgently to save the testicles.

Upon surgical exploration, the whole testis and epididymis were diffusely enlarged and dusty dark (Fig. 1), consequently, unilateral left orchiectomy was performed. The Microscopic sections show diffuse interstitial hemorrhage with intact seminiferous tubules and full spermatogenesis (Fig. 2 A–D). There was no sign of thrombosis, vasculitis, tumors, tumor necrosis, or any other pathologies that could be concurrently present or lead to testicular bleeding.

### Spontaneous idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage as a differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain [^1142ehw1]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage is a rare disease that was first described in 1914. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature. Most patients present with acute onset of unilateral scrotal pain associated with swelling. The differential diagnosis for this presentation is wide and includes epididymitis, torsion, trauma, or testicular tumors, and this rare entity should also be taken into consideration.

Scrotal sonography is the gold standard imaging modality for evaluating patients with testicular pain and swelling, especially since it is fast, simple, and noninvasive. It helps in determining the nature of the swelling, and whether it is solid or cystic. The addition of color Doppler imaging aids in the identification of the lesion's vascularity. In the present case, the distinction between intratesticular hemorrhage and testicular torsion was not possible, especially since color Doppler ultrasonography shows absent blood flow. Despite the fact that sonography is the gold standard for diagnosing intratesticular masses, there are no pathognomic findings for this rare entity as reported in different cases reported in the literature. An echogenic solid or cystic mass with no internal color Doppler flow signals is the most likely appearance. Absence of blood flow is caused by this spontaneous hemorrhage that lead to compression of blood vessels, moreover, it is one of the signs that make the distinction between this entity and testicular torsion very difficult and challenging.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to evaluate an acute scrotum when the results of color Doppler are equivocal. Intratesticular hematomas appear as a homogeneous mass with a moderate to intermediate signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences. To exclude the possibility of malignant tumors, a dynamic MRI contrast enhancement approach can be applied to distinguish the intratesticular hemorrhage that can be treated conservatively from tumors that require surgery since malignant tumors exhibit contrast enhancement with good diagnostic accuracy.

The gross features, absence of blood flow and the black discoloration of the testis in idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage could resemble the necrotic testicle as in our case, and mandates its removal. However, one of the cases reported the normal color of the involved spermatic cord, which would lessen the likelihood of testicular torsion. Additionally, this entity could mimic testicular neoplasm, because malignancy cannot be ruled out at an early stage of diagnosis, the majority of patients and healthcare professionals choose surgical exploration with a potential orchiectomy.

### Paediatric acute epididymo-orchitis temporally related to SARS-CoV-2 infection: a case series and review of the literature [^114JMtd5]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute epididymo-orchitis (AEO) is becoming an increasingly common differential diagnosis in children with acute scrotal pain. It has been noted in adult men that SARS-CoV-2 has a propensity for involving the testis and epididymis, affecting sperm and testosterone production. Our literature search revealed only one case report of COVID-19 presenting with epididymo-orchitis in a child. We present three more children who presented with AEO, all recovering from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This article reviews the post-inflammatory aetiology of paediatric epididymo-orchitis, and the propensity SARS-CoV-2 has for the testis.

Patients and Methods

Two pre-pubertal ten-year-old patients presented to the emergency department with a 48-h history of gradual onset unilateral scrotal pain and increasing erythema of the ipsilateral scrotal skin. One fifteen-year-old boy was referred for ongoing symptoms four days following a diagnosis of AEO made by his General Practitioner. On further questioning, all three had PCR-confirmed COVID infection two weeks prior to the onset of their scrotal symptoms and had just ended their isolation period. A literature search was then performed using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, testes and paediatric acute epididymo-orchitis.

Discussion

The SARS-Cov-2 virus has a propensity for affecting the testis and epididymis. This puts patients at increased risk of acute epididymo-orchitis during COVID infections. The inflammation induced by the virus appears to affect the cells responsible for testosterone production and sperm quality. However, there is no evidence that viral transmission can happen via semen.

Conclusion

SARS-Cov-2 infection can lead to acute epididymo-orchitis. Knowledge of this is clinically significant, firstly to avoid unnecessary surgical intervention due to a mistaken diagnosis of testicular torsion and secondly, due to the potential of the virus to affect sperm quality and testosterone production.

### Diagnosis and surgical management of male pelvic, inguinal, and testicular pain [^116GwsfH]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pain occurs in the male genitourinary organs as for any organ system in response to traumatic, infectious, or irritative stimuli. A knowledge and understanding of chronic genitourinary pain can be of great utility to practicing nonurologists. This article provides insight into the medical and surgical management of subacute and chronic pelvic, inguinal, and scrotal pain. The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and medical and surgical treatment options of each are discussed.

### Scrotal pain in the absence of torsion; need for vigilance [^1127KrQs]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Epididymitis is a common presentation of acute testicular pain seen in the emergency department, the differential diagnosis being testicular torsion. The vast majority of young men with epididymitis have an infective aetiology and this settle with antibiotic treatment. The clinical course of a patient who presented with testicular pain is described. At ultrasonography, the patient was found to have the uncommon condition of testicular microlithiasis, a condition that has been linked to malignant disease. Emergency doctors should be aware of the potential consequences of returning scrotal pain consistent with epididymitis to the community on antibiotic treatment alone. All patients with probable epididymitis should have either a scrotal ultrasound or specialist follow up.

### The utility of scrotal ultrasonography in the emergent setting: beyond epididymitis versus torsion [^113baDKy]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Scrotal pain is a common acute presentation for medical care. Testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis are two diagnoses for which early detection is critical and their sonographic imaging features have been thoroughly described in the radiologic literature. Other important conditions for which radiologists must be aware have received less attention. This article will highlight key traumatic and non-traumatic causes of acute scrotal pain other than testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis that may present in the emergency department setting.

### Spontaneous idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage as a differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain [^112gd9bM]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous idiopathic testicular hemorrhage is an extremely rare entity with few published reports in the literature.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 15-year-old boy who had been experiencing intense, left scrotal pain for the previous twelve hours. No previous history of trauma or bleeding disorders. The left testis was enlarged and tender. Left orchiectomy was performed. The entire testis was dusty and dark grossly. Microscopic sections show diffuse intratesticular bleeding with intact seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis.

Conclusions

### Acute scrotal pain and a different use of an old imaging method [^112v3ka9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The differential diagnosis of scrotal pain in childhood is a challenge for every primary care physician. We report the case of a 5-year-old boy presenting to the emergency department owing to acute left scrotal pain. Ultrasound screening revealed a Morgagni hydatid in the left testis, which was surgically removed. X-rays revealed microcalcifications of the cyst wall and stroma, signs indicative of chronic inflammation. Results of histological examination confirmed radiographic evaluation. No similar use of x-rays has been described in literature before, to the best of our knowledge. A brief discussion also follows about Morgagni hydatid in childhood.

### Spontaneous idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage as a differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain [^116qLF6C]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous idiopathic testicular hemorrhage is an extremely rare entity with few published reports in the literature.

Case presentation

We report a case of a 15-year-old boy who had been experiencing intense, left scrotal pain for the previous twelve hours. No previous history of trauma or bleeding disorders. The left testis was enlarged and tender. Left orchiectomy was performed. The entire testis was dusty and dark grossly. Microscopic sections show diffuse intratesticular bleeding with intact seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis.

Conclusions

Spontaneous idiopathic testicular hemorrhage should be considered when evaluating patients with acute scrotal pain. Clinical and ultrasonographic findings and histopathologic evaluation are mandatory to diagnose it.

### Does color Doppler sonography improve the clinical assessment of patients with acute scrotum? [^111rnJWQ]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction and Objectives

Our experience concerning the use of color Doppler sonography (CDS) in the differential diagnosis of acute scrotum is reported.

Material and Methods

From July 2000 to July 2005, 155 patients (median 17.2 years) were admitted with a diagnosis of acute scrotum (unilateral in 150 cases, bilateral in 5). Along with a careful anamnesis and the physical exam, all patients underwent a CDS study of the scrotal content using a sonograph GE Logiq 500 with a multifrequency (7.5–10 MHz) linear probe Small Part. The following CDS parameters were evaluated: intensity of the color-power signal on the testicular parenchyma and on the epididymis; systolic peak velocity (SPV) and telediastolic velocity (TDV) in correspondence of the gonadal hilum. Ultrasound and flowmetry parameters registered on the painful testis were compared with those registered on the healthy controlateral testis. The reduction/absence versus the increase of color-power signal in the parenchyma and the reduction/absence versus the increase of SPV and TDV in the centripetal intratesticular arteries were considered presumptive of testicular torsion versus orchiepididymitis.

Results

The results only refer to the 150 patients (300 testis) with acute monolateral scrotum. The clinical picture and the physical exam suggested a torsion of the spermatic cord in 40 cases, a spontaneous de-torsion in 5, an orchiepididymitis in 80, a blunt scrotal trauma in 15, a bulky epididymal cyst or a hydrocele in 4 and a testicular pain of unknown etiology in the remaining 6 cases. Standard US was pathological in 95 patients (63.3%); CDS was pathologic in 70 patients and in 42 of them suggested a testicular torsion. Fifty-three patients underwent surgical exploration: among 42 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of testicular torsion, the diagnosis was confirmed in 22 cases, no anomaly was found in 16 cases and in 4 patients a torsion of testicular appendix was found. The rupture of the tunica albuginea was present in six out of seven patients submitted to surgical exploration for previous blunt trauma and the sonographic diagnosis of hematocele was documented in all cases. The single false-negative diagnosis of testicular torsion in CDS occurred in an 18-month-old child. In presence of funicular torsion, the sensitivity and specificity of physical exam and CDS were 100% versus 95.7% and 86.5% versus 85.3%, respectively; sensitivity and specificity of SPV, TDV and color-Doppler signal on the testis were 100% and 94.8% versus 100% and 90.1% versus 95.7% and 90.8%. In the pre-operative assessment of scrotal trauma, the B-mode US showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 90%, respectively; the color Doppler analysis has not supplied with additional elements for planning a surgical exploration. In presence of orchiepididymitis, the sensitivity and specificity of the physical exam in association to CDS was equal to 100%. In all patients with torsion of the testicular appendix, physical exam and CDS parameters were within normal limits.

Discussion and Conclusions

In our experience CDS is an indispensable imaging modality for the clinical assessment of patients with acute scrotum; however, the informations it can afford are operator-dependent and have to be supported by the history and physical exam of the patient. CDS findings constitute probably an important medico-legal support when the necessity of surgical exploration is excluded; anyway, in presence of a clinical suspicion of testicular torsion, even with an apparently normal CDS, the surgical exploration is recommended.

### Spontaneous idiopathic intratesticular hemorrhage as a differential diagnosis for acute scrotal pain [^1127xY9R]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute scrotal pain is one of the urological emergencies that can be attributed to different causes and leads to testicular hemorrhage. The differential diagnosis of testicular hemorrhage is wide including trauma, torsion, infection, coagulopathy, tumors, or, rarely, vasculitis. One of the rare causes of testicular bleeding that should be also taken into consideration is idiopathic spontaneous intratesticular hemorrhage which has no identifiable risk factors. This entity was first described in 1914.

### Nonscrotal causes of acute scrotum [^116Jpxdx]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute scrotum is characterized by intense acute scrotal pain, which may be associated with other symptoms and signs such as abdominal pain, inflammation, and fever. Many pathologic conditions can present in this way, most which involve the scrotal contents. Nonscrotal conditions, however, can rarely present clinically only as acute scrotum: among them, renal colic, aneurysm rupture or other causes of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, primary abdominal or pelvic tumors and metastases, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammation, and muscle injuries. The pathophysiologic characteristics of the clinical presentation, clues for diagnosis, and imaging features of a series of nonscrotal lesions presenting clinically with acute scrotal pain are herein reported and illustrated. In patients presenting with acute scrotal symptoms and normal scrotal ultrasound findings, nonscrotal causes of acute scrotal pain should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Therefore, an ultrasound investigation of the abdomen, groin, and thighs is indicated.

### Segmental testicular infarction: report of seven new cases and literature review [^111byu86]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Segmental testicular infarction is a relatively rare acute or subacute condition which is infrequently thought of in the differential diagnosis for testicular pain. However, missing or misdiagnosing this entity on clinical evaluation and/or imaging has significant implications for patients as they may undergo unnecessary surgery for suspected testicular torsion or tumor. Knowledge and recognition of the features of segmental testicular infarction on ultrasound and MRI will aid in the diagnosis of this disease early in the patient's course. The common imaging features of segmental testicular infarction and the clinical literature are reviewed, with an emphasis on ultrasound, utilizing seven recent cases from three institutions.

### Scrotal emergencies [^112R1AC5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as an acute painful swelling of the scrotum or its contents, accompanied by local signs or general symptoms. Early identification and skillful management of testicular torsion is critical, as it may threaten testicular viability and future fertility if not managed expediently and appropriately. The cremasteric reflex and testicular sonography are frequently used, yet imperfect, diagnostic tools in assessing for testicular torsion. Other emergent conditions include incarcerated inguinal hernia, Fournier's gangrene, and any form of genitourinary trauma until proven otherwise. This article reviews the evaluation and management of the acute scrotum in the emergency department.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: testicular torsion [^112aMqbU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of testicular torsion, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that occurs with rotation of the testicle along its supporting ligaments leading to obstruction of vascular flow. A key risk factor is the presence of a bell-clapper deformity. The most common population affected includes children in a bimodal distribution with the most cases occurring in the first year of life and between 12 and 18 years, although cases do occur in adults. Acute, severe, unilateral scrotal pain is the most common presenting symptom. Nausea and vomiting are common, but the presence or absence of a cremasteric reflex is not a reliable indicator of disease. The TWIST score may assist with clinical decision making in patients presenting with acute testicular pain but should not be used in isolation. If torsion is suspected or confirmed, consultation with the urology specialist should not be delayed, as outcomes are time sensitive. Ultrasound can be used for diagnosis, but a normal ultrasound examination cannot exclude the diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent urology consultation for surgical exploration and detorsion, as well as symptomatic therapy in the ED. Manual detorsion can be attempted in the ED while awaiting transfer or consultation.

Conclusions

An understanding of testicular torsion can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

### Pediatric testicular torsion [^114GWicZ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The pediatric patient presenting with acute scrotal pain requires prompt evaluation and management given the likelihood of testicular torsion as the underlying cause. Although other diagnoses can present with acute testicular pain, it is important to recognize the possibility of testicular torsion because the best chance of testicular preservation occurs with expeditious management. When testicular torsion is suspected, prompt surgical exploration is warranted. A delay in surgical management should not occur in an effort to obtain confirmatory imaging. When torsion is discovered, the contralateral testicle should undergo fixation to reduce the risk of asynchronous torsion.

### Testicular torsion: diagnosis, evaluation, and management [^116LJ873]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord and its contents and is a surgical emergency affecting 3.8 per 100,000 males younger than 18 years annually. It accounts for 10% to 15% of acute scrotal disease in children, and results in an orchiectomy rate of 42% in boys undergoing surgery for testicular torsion. Prompt recognition and treatment are necessary for testicular salvage, and torsion must be excluded in all patients who present with acute scrotum. Testicular torsion is a clinical diagnosis, and patients typically present with severe acute unilateral scrotal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination may reveal a high-riding testicle with an absent cremasteric reflex. If history and physical examination suggest torsion, immediate surgical exploration is indicated and should not be postponed to perform imaging studies. There is typically a four- to eight-hour window before permanent ischemic damage occurs. Delay in treatment may be associated with decreased fertility, or may necessitate orchiectomy.

### Do not forget to include testicular torsion in differential diagnosis of lower acute abdominal pain in young males [^1153YEy5]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Management and outcomes of pediatric patients with testicular torsion initially presenting as acute abdominal pain were evaluated.

Patients and Methods

The case records of 84 children operated on for testicular torsion from January 1999 through May 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Of the total number of operated patients, 9 presented with abdominal pain but without initial scrotal pain, and only they were included in the study. The diagnosis of testicular torsion was made clinically and confirmed by Doppler ultrasound and scrotal exploration.

Results

The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient's scrotum and testicles were not examined during the first evaluation in 6 cases, while in 3 cases the testicles were examined during the first physical examination. At surgery, 4 testes were salvaged, while 5 have been lost because of testicular necrosis. The mean duration of symptoms was 4 h in the group of salvaged testes and 39 h in the orchidectomy group. There were no major complications.

Conclusion

Testicular torsion should always be included in differential diagnosis when evaluating lower abdominal pain in young males. The external genital organs should be examined in every child or adolescent with acute abdominal pain.

### Vasitis: a rare diagnosis mimicking inguinal hernia: a case report [^111NzRCr]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical symptoms include localized pain or palpable mass in the scrotal or inguinal region, some of them with leukocytosis or fever. Acute vasitis could be classification as three groups depending on involved site: scrotal, suprascrotal, and prepubic. It can be easily confused when there is isolated site involvement. The common differential diagnoses include orchitis, epididymitis, testicular torsion, and inguinal hernia. Correct diagnosis is essential because the treatment of vasitis is via antibiotics, and operation is not required.

The diagnosis of vasitis could be a challenge by its rarity and unclear image findings. We review past reports that suggest appropriate tools include ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasound can be used to exclude orchitis, epididymitis, and testicular torsion by color Doppler. Acute vasitis often reveals heterogeneous, hypoechoic spermatic cord and echogenic fat surrounding the lesions. However, ultrasound is relatively challenging to differentiate from incarcerated inguinal hernia to vasitis. CT and MRI are more recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Spiral CT has high resolution and short scanning time. Acute vasitis typically reveals unilateral edematous spermatic cord without evidence of herniated bowel loop. MRI can provide more soft tissue detail, abnormal signal intensities of inflamed or ischemic structures, with the additional benefits of no radiation exposure.

Based on the available literature, the majority of the reported vasitis can be resolved with the use of anti-inflammatories and antibiotics alone. Some authors prescribed oral antibiotics while others started with intravenous antibiotics in combination with oral antibiotics. A reported pediatric vasitis case suggested only partial regression of the inguinal swelling symptoms with 7 days of oral antibiotic use, and the patient was later admitted and treated successfully with intravenous antibiotics. Surgical exploration and drainage may be necessary in more severe cases that are not responsive to antibiotic treatment. En bloc excision of the vas deferens is uncommon and is usually performed for the exceptionally rare cases of Tuberculous vasitis. For our patient, we prescribed empirical antibiotic treatment with 500 mg of Levofloxacin once daily for two weeks. The patient's symptoms improved drastically upon the scheduled weekly follow-ups.

In summary, we present a rare case mimicking incarcerated inguinal hernia, and although vasitis is very rare, physicians should keep in mind that patients might present with similar symptoms, especially when the patient has risk factors such as previous vasectomy and concurrent leukocyturia. CT or MRI scan can play an important role to prevent unnecessary surgery.

### Testicular infarction and spontaneous scrotal rupture secondary to acute epididymo-orchitis [^1143wztB]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Epididymo-orchitis is a common cause of acute unilateral testicular pain. Both infectious or non-infectious causes have been proposed and, rarely, testicular abscess formation and even infarction can occur as a severe complication. We present here a case of acute epididymo-orchitis leading to testicular abscess formation, infarction and spontaneous rupture through the scrotal wall despite appropriate antibiotic treatments. Orchidectomy and partial scrotectomy were performed during surgical exploration for management of the non-viable testis and associated scrotal sinus. Clinical vigilance is important to prevent this complication by close clinical follow up with ultrasonography and even early surgical decompression to prevent testicular loss.

### Infarction of paratesticular inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor mimicking testicular torsion [^112NCrWh]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

This report describes a 14-year-old male with a rare paratesticular inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor that presented atypically with acute unilateral scrotal pain and swelling. This presentation, which raised suspicion for testicular torsion, contrasts with the typical presentation of a slow-growing scrotal mass. Scrotal exploration revealed an infarcted right testis, demonstrating this locally aggressive tumor can undergo vascular invasion and occlude testicular blood supply. Thus, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute scrotal pain suspicious for testicular infarction.

### Testicular ultrasound [^1179od32]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Acute scrotal pain makes up approximately 0.5% of all complaints presenting to an emergency department. Some of the most com-mon diagnoses for this complaint are testicular torsion and epididymitis. Misdiagnosing testicular torsion can lead to organ loss, cosmetic deformity, and compromised fertility. Modem ultrasound examination of the scrotum is the test of choice for acute scrotal pathology and yields high accuracy compared with surgical exploration. A key component of the testicular examination is use of power and spectral Doppler ultrasonography. Examination of the acute scrotum should not be undertaken unless Doppler capability is available because the evaluation of blood flow is such an important part of diagnosis of testicular torsion, orchitis, epididymitis, trauma, and hemorrhage into a mass.

### Vasitis: a rare diagnosis mimicking inguinal hernia: a case report [^115qyZem]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute vasitis or inflammation of the vas deferens is an extremely rare disease, with only about twenty adult case reports published since 1980. Few of these contain computed tomography (CT) images. Clinically, it presents with nonspecific symptoms of inguinal swelling and local pain that can mimic orchitis, epididymitis, testicular torsion, and inguinal hernia. Familiarity with symptoms, image findings, and differential diagnoses is essential to prevent unnecessary surgery, especially when symptoms mimic an inguinal hernia.

### Occult splenic rupture presenting as acute scrotal swelling [^114FvFrq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Scrotal pain and swelling is a common complaint encountered in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis includes testicular, scrotal, and intra-abdominal pathology.

Case Report

We present a case of an 80-year-old man on warfarin therapy presenting with acute atraumatic scrotal pain and swelling initially diagnosed as a hydrocele. The diagnosis was subsequently determined to be a communicating hematocele secondary to occult splenic rupture.

Conclusion

Intra-abdominal pathology can result in scrotal pain and swelling due to passage of intra-abdominal contents into the scrotum via a patent processus vaginalis. Therefore, any cause of hemoperitoneum may also cause hematocele and hematocele should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute scrotal swelling in any patient with risk factors for bleeding. In these patients, both scrotal and abdominal imaging should be considered.

### Imaging of the scrotum in children [^116f67xX]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical examination of the scrotum is difficult due to the small size of the testes and the epididymis in infants and young children, and eliciting patients' history is challenging. Therefore imaging of the scrotum in childhood bears great importance. Ultrasound is the standard imaging technique of choice providing the clinicians with a definitive diagnosis in most cases. However, in conditions of testicular torsion and epididymoorchitis — the most common differential diagnosis of scrotal pain — ultrasound findings can be inconclusive and further evaluation is required. Since there is a large overlap between paediatric and adult pathology, differences from adults in anatomy and pathology must be considered when evaluating the paediatric scrotum.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of pyocele: a rare complication of testicular infection [^113FsJKR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Epididymo-orchitis is one of the common causes of acute scrotal pain that requires an accurate diagnosis as delayed management can result in complications such as pyocele, abscess, or testicular infarction. Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool in the management of testicular emergencies in the emergency department (ED) including testicular infections CASE REPORT: Here we report a case of an elderly man who presented to the ED with a complaint of right-sided testicular pain and swelling. The diagnosis of pyocele was made using a PoCUS, facilitating an early referral to urology services. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case underscores the important role of PoCUS in the timely and accurate diagnosis of pyocele. The prompt identification of pyocele enabled early referral to urology services, highlighting the significance of integrating PoCUS into the management of testicular emergencies in the ED.

A 55-year-old man presented with an acute, painful groin mass with signs of sepsis. On examination, it was difficult to tell whether this was a strangulated hernia or a testicular torsion. Biochemical investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers and radiological investigations showed a rare inflammatory condition, vasitis, which could be mistaken for various other 'surgical' groin masses. This case report summarises the importance of realising the vast differential diagnoses that come with acute groin masses and how imaging can prevent unnecessary surgery.

### Acute abdominal pain in children: evaluation and management [^114RHyy1]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children is a common presentation in the clinic and emergency department settings and accounts for up to 10% of childhood emergency department visits. Determining the appropriate disposition of abdominal pain in children can be challenging. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, including gastroenteritis, constipation, urinary tract infection, acute appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, testicular torsion, and volvulus, and the diagnostic approach vary by age. Most causes of acute abdominal pain in children are self-limited. Symptoms and signs that indicate referral for surgery include pain that is severe, localized, and increases in intensity; pain preceding vomiting; bilious vomiting; hematochezia; guarding; and rigidity. Physical examination findings suggestive of acute appendicitis in children include decreased or absent bowel sounds, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing sign, and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation may include urinalysis; complete blood cell count; human chorionic gonadotropin, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels; and a comprehensive metabolic profile. Ultrasonography, including point-of-care ultrasonography, for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain in children is the preferred initial imaging modality due to its low cost, ease of use, and lack of ionizing radiation. In addition to laboratory evaluation and imaging, children with red-flag or high-risk symptoms should be referred for urgent surgical consultation. Validated scoring systems, such as the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, can be used to help determine the patient's risk of appendicitis.

Epididymitis

Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting < 6 weeks. Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index of suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should be maintained among men who have a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition is a surgical emergency.

Acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g. C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e. Escherichia coli). Acute epididymitis caused by an STI is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic. Acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur among men who are the insertive partner during anal sex. Nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (e.g. benign prostatic hyperplasia). Among older men, nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression. Uncommon infectious causes of nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis (e.g. Fournier's gangrene) should be managed in consultation with a urologist.

Chronic epididymitis is characterized by a ≥ 6-week history of symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis. Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently observed with conditions associated with a granulomatous reaction. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is the most common granulomatous disease affecting the epididymis and should be suspected, especially among men with a known history of or recent exposure to TB. The differential diagnosis of chronic noninfectious epididymitis, sometimes termed orchialgia or epididymalgia, is broad (e.g. trauma, cancer, autoimmune conditions, or idiopathic conditions). Men with this diagnosis should be referred to a urologist for clinical management.

### Concurrent testicular torsion and acute incarcerated inguinal hernia in an adolescent boy [^111GAB4p]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion and acute incarcerated inguinal hernia are both common surgical emergencies in the paediatric population. We present the unusual case of a 16-year-old adolescent boy who presented with both of these conditions concurrently. He had a history of a right inguinal hernia, but ultrasound confirmed a testicular torsion and we employed manual detorsion in the emergency department prior to taking him to the operating room. We successfully salvaged the testicle in addition to performing inguinal hernia reduction and repair. The goal of this report is to emphasise the importance of maintaining a broad differential and early utilisation of ultrasound in the patient with acute groin pain.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^112J8bVt]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain — chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS): Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of CP/CPPS in patients who experience chronic perineal pain, bilateral scrotal content pain, penile pain, suprapubic pain, dysuria, or pain with ejaculation (Expert Opinion). Patients with CP/CPPS have symptoms of chronic pain or discomfort in the pelvic region in the absence of other causes of pain, and the pain can occur in the perineum, lower abdomen/suprapubic area, testes (typically bilateral), or penis; the pain may occur with ejaculation or during urination. It is important to note that men with CP/CPPS also commonly have LUTS such as urgency, frequency and nocturia, while the symptom that distinguishes IC/BPS is pain attributed to the bladder (e.g., painful bladder filling, relief with urination, or painful urge to urinate).

The ability of US to diagnose the pathogenesis of the acute scrotum is unsurpassed by any other imaging modality. It is the first imaging performed in patients with acute scrotum. Knowledge of the normal and pathologic sonographic appearance of the scrotum and proper sonographic technique is essential for accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum. High-frequency transducer sonography combined with color flow Doppler sonography provides the information essential to reach a specific diagnosis in patients with testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, and testicular trauma.

Chronic pelvic pain in men — scrotal examination and ultrasound guidance: "Clinicians should perform a thorough scrotal examination in patients with chronic pelvic pain; a scrotal ultrasound may be performed. (Clinical Principle)". A comprehensive genital examination is essential and should include assessment of the scrotum and penis in both standing and supine positions with careful palpation of scrotal structures including testicles, epididymis, vas deferens, and spermatic cord; other causes of scrotal pain should be excluded. Scrotal ultrasound may not be necessary when a comprehensive examination is performed and the diagnosis is unambiguous. In a retrospective analysis of 7,668 scrotal ultrasounds, the majority (80.4%) revealed benign or normal findings, with only 2.2% indicating a necessity for surgery. Nevertheless, when clinical evaluation raises suspicion of an acute surgical pathology and the diagnosis is uncertain, expedient scrotal ultrasound imaging can serve as a useful tool for confirming diagnoses such as testicular mass or torsion.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^112hQ1U4]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP) — definition, burden, presentation, and evaluation are described as follows: "CSCP or chronic testicular pain or chronic orchialgia is defined as unilateral scrotal pain interfering with activities of daily living that has persisted for greater than three months of time", and it "is usually diagnosed after excluding other potential causes (e.g., testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, abscess, testicular mass, varicocele)". The condition's impact is noted as "CSCP constitutes approximately 2.5% to 4.8% of all urology visits and is believed to affect over 100,000 men annually". Patients often have tenderness and neuropathic features: "The pain is commonly described in the testes with tenderness in the epididymis and/or spermatic cord appreciated on physical examination", and "Neuropathic changes such as hypersensitivity or hyperalgesia in the region of the groin may accompany these findings", with a fluctuating course — "The pain typically waxes and wanes". Care "requires a multi-disciplinary approach to management", and "Managing patient expectations through supportive counseling during this path is important to overall success". For workup, "potential underlying causes should be ruled out with a thorough physical exam and detailed history", and examples include "post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS), post-inguinal hernia repair, pain caused by trauma, after abdominal surgery, radiation, and radicular pain from spinal or sacral issues".

### Sonography of the acute scrotum: the four T's of testicular imaging [^115Q5SUh]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The scrotum is frequently imaged on an emergent basis. The differential diagnosis of the acute scrotum can be divided into four categories-torsion, trauma, tumor, and "testiculitis" (epididymo-orchitis). Although testicular neoplasms are not imaged emergently, 15% are detected incidentally when performing an emergent scrotal ultrasound. Therefore, the emergent sonographic examination of the testicles should include a thorough search for malignancy. Images demonstrating the sonographic and color Doppler appearances of each of the "four T's" will be reviewed. The radiographic review will focus on the imaging features, which are the keys to arriving at the correct diagnosis.

### Acute segmental testicular infarction at contrast-enhanced ultrasound: early features and changes during follow-up [^113dQDuj]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound is useful for characterization of acute segmental testicular infarction.

Materials and Methods

Twenty men with acute scrotal pain and suspected segmental testicular infarction underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Three patients underwent orchiectomy. For the other patients, the final diagnosis was based on the absence of tumor markers and a change in the size or shape of the tumor during follow-up. Forty-nine color Doppler ultrasound studies (16 within 24 hours of the onset of pain; 14, 2–17 days after pain onset; 19 after 1 month or more), and 38 contrast-enhanced ultrasound studies (13 within 24 hours after pain onset; nine, 2–17 days; 16 after 1 month or more) were performed.

Results

Fourteen of 16 lesions examined within 24 hours were oval, and two were wedge shaped. Eight lesions were isoechoic to the testis, six were hypoechoic, and two had mixed echogenicity. Twelve lesions were avascular and four were hypovascular at color Doppler examination. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed avascular parenchymal lobules in all cases and without perilesional rim enhancement in 12 of 13 studies. Two to 17 days after the symptoms appeared, contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed avascular lobules in all cases and perilesional rim enhancement in eight examinations. After 1 month or more, contrast-enhanced ultrasound depicted intralesional vascular spots in 12 of 14 infarcts. Perilesional enhancement was absent.

Conclusion

Recognition of lobular morphologic characteristics and the presence of perilesional rim enhancement at contrast-enhanced ultrasound can increase confidence in the diagnosis of segmental testicular infarction compared with reliance on gray-scale and color Doppler findings. Changes in lesion features during follow-up confirm the differential diagnosis from other testicular lesions and allow conservative management.

### Imaging of the acute scrotum [^112nt1Cu]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

The scrotum is a superficial structure and clinical examination is frequently not enough for making a specific diagnosis. In acute scrotal pain US can confirm the presumptive clinical diagnosis and provide additional relevant information. In testicular torsion, color-Doppler imaging has a central role since it has become possible to identify it at early stage by showing absence of perfusion in the affected testis before any gray-scale abnormality. Scintigraphy remains a satisfactory alternative in evaluating testicular torsion and should be used when color Doppler is inadequate, raising doubts about the suspected torsion. Diagnosis of torsion of testicular appendages is particularly difficult. Ischemic infarction shows a characteristic pattern at gray-scale and color Doppler imaging, whereas hemorrhagic ischemia may require MRI. Inflammatory diseases of the scrotum can be easily investigated by echo color Doppler and conventional radiography, and CT can be particularly useful in the detection of gas bubbles. In scrotal trauma, scrotal hematoma, hematocele, intratesticular hematoma, and testicular rupture can be identified using gray-scale US with very good reliability. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated when a small tear of tunica albuginea is suspected but not visualized on US.

### A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient with bilateral orchitis [^111T7txM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

During the development of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), a myriad of complications has emerged and although rare, several genitourinary complications have been reported. The bulk of these complications have been secondary to hypercoagulable states, such as priapism. Previous SARS family infections have caused orchitis, though no adult cases of orchitis have been reported. We describe a novel case of SARS-CoV2 bilateral orchitis in a previously healthy 37-year-old male who presented for testicular pain with constitutional symptoms. Additionally, there was no epididymitis associated with the bilateral orchitis. Based on both data in SARS-CoV2 infected males and previous data from prior SARS infections, spermatocyte function may be compromised secondary to this infection. With the various symptoms associated with this virulent pathogen, we characterize the potential complications and importance of fertility follow up.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- acute epididymitis is characterized by pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis lasting < 6 weeks

- sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis

- acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (such as C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or Mycoplasma genitalium) or enteric organisms (such as E. coli)

- acute epididymitis caused by STIs is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic

- acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur in males who are the insertive partner during anal sex

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (such as BPH)

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis in older males is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression.

### Evaluation of scrotal masses [^114b3aAa]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Scrotal masses are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from benign conditions to those requiring emergent surgical intervention. Painful scrotal masses require urgent evaluation. Characteristics that suggest testicular torsion include rapid symptom onset, nausea and vomiting, high position of the testicle, and abnormal cremasteric reflex. Doppler ultrasonography or surgical exploration is required to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical repair must occur within six hours of symptom onset to reliably salvage the testicle. Epididymitis/orchitis have a slower onset and are associated with a C-reactive protein level greater than 24 mg per L (228.6 nmol per L) and increased blood flow on ultrasonography. Acute onset of pain with near normal physical examination and ultrasound findings is consistent with torsion of the testicular appendage. Testicular malignancies cause pain in 15% of cases. If ultrasonography shows an intratesticular mass, timely urology referral is indicated. Inguinal hernias are palpated separate to the testicle and can cause pain. Emergent surgery is indicated for a strangulated hernia. Hydrocele, varicocele, and scrotal skin lesions may be managed in nonurgent settings. A biopsy should be performed to rule out cancer in patients with scrotal skin lesions that are erosive, vascular, hyperkeratotic, or nonhealing, or that change color or have irregular borders.

### Case report on secondary testicular necrosis due to fulminant epididymitis: ultrasonographic evaluation and diagnosis [^1168jrcR]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute scrotal pain is frequently encountered at the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad, with sometimes difficult differentiation. Different causes consist of acute epididymitis, testicular torsion, Fournier's gangrene, torsion of appendix testis, trauma, post-vasectomy pain, inguinal hernia, mumps orchitis, testicular cancer, immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, and acute idiopathic scrotal edema. Due to the extensive list of diagnosis the standard of care is to identify causes that need immediate action. Testicular torsion and Fournier's gangrene are examples needing urgent surgical intervention. In acute epididymitis/ epididymo-orchitis medical treatment should start promptly, ultrasonography can help to prove the diagnosis and help with the prognosis of this infection.

Testicular torsion and major epididymo-orchitis can be difficult to distinguish. This distinction is made on blood results with infectious episodes resulting in higher C-reactive protein levels. One rare complication in epididymitis is testicular necrosis, with an incidence of 1–2% of epididymitis cases. In case of post-infectious necrosis, the presentation to surgery-time was significantly longer than in testicular torsion.

On ultrasonography epididymo-orchitis necrosis can be recognized by a juxta-epididymal string-of-bead sign, contrasting the whirlpool/knot sign, seen in testicular torsion. Reduction of color doppler signalling with high intratesticular resistive indices and negative diastolic flow increase the likelihood of testicular necrosis associated with epididymo-orchitis. Further assessment of suspected testicular necrosis and its vascularity can be performed using ultrasound microbubble contrast.

Surgical management in necrosed testis is an orchiectomy. Fasciotomy in early hypoperfusion has been suggested in the past, but no clinical outcomes have been reported. This is therefore not routinely done. Partial hypoperfusion and necrosis of the testis can be treated conservatively with close follow-up.

A Medline search was initiated to discuss similar cases and their treatment approaches using MeSH terms: testis, orchitis, epididymitis, necrosis and infection. There is currently a lack of data and clinical guidance in patients presenting with these complications. Together with the available literature, this case report can support clinicians in their daily practise.

### Testicular pain as A warning symptom of a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm: case report and review of the literature [^11699nTq]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Isolated testicular pain is an unusual clinical presentation of symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). We present two patients hemodynamically stable with an isolated acute testicular pain related to an AAA and a review of the published literature up to present.

Methods

Two adult-old males with an acute isolated testicular pain presented to the emergency department. Although both cases had their symptoms for more than 24 hours and were hemodynamically stable, the misdiagnosis of a urological condition in one case and a delay of the intervention in the second resulted in a sudden drop of vital signs and the need of an urgent open surgery.

Results

A bibliographic review of the 15 published cases is presented. Most cases occurred without a previous diagnosis of AAA. Aneurysms were characteristically very large (mean 10 cm). The initial diagnosis was frequently wrong, attributing the pain mostly to genito-urinary conditions. The testicular pain presented days and even weeks before rupture, which may offer a convenient window of hemodynamic stability for repair.

Conclusions

Acute testicular pain in adult-old patients with aneurysm risk factors and specially with a first urological evaluation discarding a genitourinary disorder should alert clinicians to consider the diagnosis of a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm. The early and accurate recognition of these cases may increase the survival.

### A case report of acute testicular pain secondary to segmental testicular infarction [^112gKrEg]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The development of imaging has greatly improved the accuracy of diagnosis of segmental testicular infarction. This case study examined the pathological mechanisms of testicular infarcts size reduction and the increased peri-infarct blood flow after administrating conservative treatment. The causes of blood flow changes within the testicular infarcts after conservative treatment have been deduced mainly from infarcts studies in other organs such as the heart and brain. Further experimental verification of the specific underlying pathological mechanisms is needed.

The clinical differential diagnosis of scrotal pain with a mass in a prepubertal boy is difficult. Often conditions such as testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis are diagnosed. We present a rare cause of scrotal pain, idiopathic scrotal fat necrosis. This condition has a typical clinical presentation and ultrasound findings that have been described in a limited number of case reports. However, if it is diagnosed correctly and confirmed with ultrasound, we hope that people will be treated without surgical intervention. We present a case of scrotal wall necrosis and a literature review.

### The clinical findings in young adults with acute scrotal pain [^11634dPD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute scrotal pain (ASP) is a common symptom of young adults. Testicular torsion is the most important diagnosis in these cases. It is a medical emergency in which the diagnosis must be made rapidly to prevent testicular loss. This requires a high index of clinical suspicion and prompt surgical intervention. This study was conducted to examine the spectrum of diagnoses in young man with ASP in a prehospital setting, the frequency of significant diagnoses, and their outcomes.

Methods

The medical records of young adults in their obligatory military service presenting with ASP to primary care clinics from 2004 to 2014 were reviewed using the keywords: pain, testis, torsion, and orchialgia. Anamnestic data, physical findings, primary care physician decisions, and final outcomes were analyzed.

Results

A total of 9922 medical visits were recorded. Idiopathic scrotal pain, varicocele, scrotal trauma, and genital tract infections were the most common diagnoses. In 3 visits (0.03%), testicular cancer was diagnosed. Testicular torsion was the etiology of ASP in only 12 (0.12%) visits, and 60% the testes were salvaged. The mean duration of symptoms in the salvaged group was 6.33 hours; and in the nonsalvaged group, 44 hours.

Conclusions

Testicular torsion is the etiology of ASP in only 0.12% of the visits to the primary care clinic. Patient delay before attending the primary care is responsible for most of the testes lost. Patient education in addition to high index of suspicion of primary care physicians is needed for salvage of more testicles.

### Acute scrotal pain in pediatric patients: diagnosis with an innovative Doppler technique (microV) [^113SukRU]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute scrotal pain is one of the most frequent symptoms in pediatric patients visited in the Emergency Department. Ultrasonography with color and power Doppler represents the first-line method that clinicians use to carry out the differential diagnosis between spermatic cord torsion and inflammation, but sensitivity and specificity are 63–100% and 97–100%, respectively; this variability may be related to operator's experience and testis vascular hemodynamics and also to machine performance and patient age. Recent technological innovations have made possible to create a new Doppler mode called ultrasound microvascular imaging. This technique exploits algorithms capable of separating low frequencies of static tissue artifacts from ones of very weak flows. It is known as MicroV (from Esaote) and Superb microvascular imaging (from Toshiba). It provides both macrocirculation vascular maps, as a typical Doppler feature, and microcirculation vascular maps. Furthermore, the use of background subtraction could improve the visibility of small vascular structures. We report a case of a pediatric patient suffering from acute scrotal pain assessed ultrasonographically with this innovative Doppler technique (MicroV) that may give more confidence in detecting testicular vascular signals if compared with traditional Doppler techniques.

### A case report of acute testicular pain secondary to segmental testicular infarction [^113DPSuY]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Segmental testicular infarction is a rare condition that often occurs in the upper pole of the left testicle and usually presents with acute onset of scrotal pain. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound and MR are essential for diagnosing and differentiating segmental testicular infarction in clinical practice, and conservative treatment can only be adopted after a definitive diagnosis. In the present case, after conservative treatment, the infarct volume was reduced, the blood flow around the infarct was increased, and blood flow signals appeared in the infarct. We performed a correlation analysis to investigate the causes of these changes.

Case presentation

A 33-year-old male, without any specific disease history, was admitted to the hospital with a 5-day history of left testicular pain, and the imaging showed focal necrosis of the left testicle with hemorrhage. He was diagnosed with segmental testicular infarction after differentiating and excluding it from malignant tumors. Conservative medical treatment was given, and the symptoms of testicular pain were relieved after treatment. After discharge, regular reexamination at follow-ups showed that the infarct's size was reduced, the blood flow around the infarct was increased, and blood flow signals appeared in the infarct.

Conclusion

Conservative treatment has become the standard treatment currently adopted after confirming the diagnosis of segmental testicular infarction through contrast-enhanced ultrasound and MR. The blood flow changes in and around the focus of testicular infarction can be related to various factors. At present, relevant conclusions of the underlying mechanisms were mainly deduced from infarction studies of other related organs such as the heart and brain; thus, the specific pathological mechanism needs further experimental verification.

### Emergency ultrasonography in the evaluation of the acute scrotum [^112VaJe3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Acute scrotal pain accounts for approximately 0.5% of total emergency department (ED) visits. Despite this relatively low percentage, these patients can present a considerable challenge to the treating emergency physician (EP) since the etiologies of acute scrotal pain range from organ-threatening disease to minor idiopathic pain. Few data exist on EP use of bedside ultrasound to evaluate scrotal pain, but there is some suggestion that this may represent a beneficial future application for emergency ultrasonographers. This paper briefly describes the technology and technique involved with the performance of testicular ultrasound examination and briefly discusses its potential application at bedside in the ED.

### Tension hydrocele: an unusual cause of acute scrotal pain [^1175KwpV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The etiology of acute scrotal pain can vary from a benign process such as mild trauma, appendicular torsion, or epididymo-orchitis to an emergent process such as an incarcerated inguinal hernia, testicular torsion, or rupture. Furthermore, testicular insult often results in a reactive hydrocele that can both cloud the diagnosis and impair the physical examination. Traditionally, the acute scrotum was managed with immediate exploration, but emergency physicians and urologists have increasingly used Doppler ultrasonography to assess vascular flow, aide in the diagnosis, and ultimately guide triage of those patients who require urgent intervention. We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with 2 days of increasing testicular pain and swelling, confirmed to have a large hydrocele with compromised testicular perfusion, and was managed by emergent operative drainage and repair of a "tension hydrocele" with immediate return of testicular perfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tension hydrocele causing intratesticular vascular compromise in a pediatric patient.

### Experiences and perceptions of acute testicular pain, with a focus on reasons for delayed presentation to hospital: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^115mbyVQ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The annual incidence of testicular torsion is approximately 1 in 4000 males under the age of 25. Despite the 97% testicular salvage rate when surgical intervention is within 6hours of onset, orchidectomy is required in 40% of cases. These comparatively poor outcomes are driven by delays to intervention, the majority of which take place prior to presentation to healthcare. This study synthesises existing evidence to understand factors leading to delayed presentation to hospital in individuals with acute scrotal pain.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed with support from an information scientist. Two authors performed article screening, data extraction and inductive thematic synthesis independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion at each stage. An assessment of confidence in the review findings was performed using the ConQual approach.

Results

The search identified 1251 unique articles for screening, with five eligible for inclusion; all included publications were drawn from two PhD projects. Synthesis of these articles revealed five descriptive themes with five subthemes. A lack of knowledge and education about testicular health, embarrassment and reliance on others for access to healthcare are major factors leading to delays in presentation. Societal and cultural impacts on health-seeking behaviour and denial were also causes of delayed presentation to healthcare.

Discussion

A lack of knowledge about testicular anatomy and health among both adults and children is amenable to improvement through education, and would likely impact many of the factors identified as contributory to delays. Communication was an overarching factor connecting the descriptive themes.

### Should manual detorsion be a routine part of treatment in testicular torsion? [^116SFhGb]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Testicular (spermatic cord) torsion (TT), which was first described by Hunter, is an emergency urological diagnosis that results in ischemic organ injury in the affected testis, and requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. Cold weather, activation of the cremasteric reflex, trauma, undescended testis, and fast enlargement of testis during puberty are the known risk factors in susceptible individuals. It shows a bimodal distribution, and peaks in the neonatal period and puberty. Prevalence has been reported as 8.6/ 100,000 between the ages of 10 and 19 years in the United States.

With the exception of neonates, patients usually present with unilateral severe pain that has been present for a few hours. Pain is rarely mild, and it radiates to the inguinal region and abdomen. The most frequent physical examination findings are testicular tenderness and loss of the cremasteric reflex. An abnormal position of the testis is more common than other causes for acute scrotal pain. Doppler ultrasonography (USG), scintigraphy, dynamic magnetic resonance (MR), and high-resolution USG are the diagnostic imaging modalities.

The most important factors for testicular salvage before it atrophies are known to be the duration between the onset of symptoms and detorsion, and the degree of the torsion. Emergency surgery after the diagnosis aims to shorten the duration of ischemia. Manual detorsion (MD), as described by Nash, has been suggested before surgery to return blood flow faster, and some authors have indicated it as an alternative to surgery.

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the efficiency of MD, whether it could be a routine part of treatment or an alternative to surgery in patients with TT due to time saved by the application, and the reliability of elective orchiopexy rather than emergency orchiopexy in the light of information provided in literature.

### Testicular-sparing excision for benign paratesticular IgG4-related disease [^114T7c3v]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Most of the epididymal lesions are attributed to benign cases, with adenomatoid tumour of the epididymis being the most common. Other differential diagnoses can include benign epididymal cysts, sarcoidosis and infective aetiologies, such as tuberculosis and epididymal abscess. Malignant epididymal lesions are relatively rare and can be due to primary tumour, such as epididymal leiomyosarcoma or metastases. Certain clinical attributes, such as more acute pain presentation and associated systemic symptoms, can differentiate some infective pathologies compared with other causes. The presence of colour Doppler flow can also be beneficial in distinguishing malignant from benign lesions.

### Comparison of radionuclide imaging and ultrasonography in the differentiation of acute testicular torsion and inflammatory testicular disease [^114c7t7r]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Torsion of the testis is a urologic emergency that requires early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment for testicular survival. However, the early differential diagnosis of acute testicular torsion from epididymitis or orchitis is often difficult. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate and compare the value of Tc-99m pertechnetate radionuclide imaging and ultrasonography in the differentiation of acute testicular torsion and inflammatory testicular diseases.

Methods

Twenty patients (age range, 5 to 38 years) with possible acute testicular torsion from July 2000 to July 2001 were enrolled in this study. Ultrasonography was performed in all patients in the emergency room. Within 3 hours of ultrasonography, radionuclide imaging was also performed after intravenous injection of 5 to 15 mCi Tc-99m pertechnetate in the forearms. All of the patients with clinically suspected acute testicular torsion underwent surgery. The surgical findings and pathologic reports of these patients were reviewed and definite diagnoses were established. None of the other patients had surgery and were followed clinically for at least 1 month after ultrasonography and radionuclide imaging.

Results

Four patients with testicular torsion, 13 patients with inflammatory testicular disease, and three healthy persons had a final surgical and pathologic diagnosis or clinical follow-up, and all were accurately diagnosed by Tc-99m pertechnetate radionuclide imaging. In contrast, ultrasonography was less accurate in the diagnosis and differentiation of acute testicular torsion from inflammation. Only 1 of 4 patients with testicular torsion, 5 of 13 patients with inflammatory testicular disease, and 2 of 3 healthy persons were diagnosed by ultrasonography.

Conclusions

The results indicate that Tc-99m pertechnetate radionuclide imaging is a more useful and accurate imaging method than ultrasonography in the detection and differentiation of acute testicular torsion from inflammatory testicular disease in patients with acute scrotal pain.

### A case report of acute testicular pain secondary to segmental testicular infarction [^114LsTsb]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Segmental testicular infarction occurs mainly at the upper pole of the testis because the blood supply of the upper pole is provided by the testicular artery only, thus lacking collateral blood supply; the lower pole, however, is supplied by both the testicular artery and the vas deferens artery. Partial testicular infarctions are likely to occur when the arterial blood flow is impaired due to abnormal centripetal arteries, testicular artery branches, or anterior epididymal arteries. The study by Bertolotto et al. showed that segmental infarction tends to be on the left testis, which could be related to its anatomy.

There are many reasons for segmental testicular infarction. According to the medical history and examination results, this case is idiopathic. Conservative treatment and follow-up are recommended if the imaging features suggest segmental testicular infarction and the tumor markers are negative. The conservative treatment of segmental testicular infarction faces some risks such as aggravation of the testicular infarction, testicular atrophy, decreased sex hormone levels, and contralateral testicular torsion, which may affect fertility in the future. The risks of surgical exploration include removal of the affected testis, postoperative bleeding, infection, unrelieved or even aggravated scrotal pain, aggravated testicular infarction, testicular atrophy, etc. Based on the results of laboratory tests and imaging examinations, conservative treatment was preferred to protect the patient's fertility.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^116BQCdy]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
Sonographic protocol for suspected testicular torsion

Swollen epididymis and testis with testicular flow that is only minimally decreased, normal, or increased in boys with incomplete or intermittent testicular torsion can mimic epididymo-orchitis. The most common cause of acute scrotal pain in children is torsion of appendix testis, which can also mimic epididymo-orchitis. Therefore it is important to evaluate for the presence of avascular nodule that might represent the torsed appendage (Fig. 8; videos 9, 10 and 11, online supplementary material). Any time a child presents with acute scrotal pain, and findings resembling epididymitis without findings of torsed appendage, testicular torsion should be excluded. Suspicion of intermittent or incomplete testicular torsion should be raised in a child with a history of recurrent epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, or abrupt pain that resolved or decreased at the time of diagnosis.

### Torsion of an undescended testis – A surgical pediatric emergency [^112uMwaK]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Torsion of an undescended testis is a surgical emergency whose frequency may be underestimated in the pediatric population. We describe this entity and focus on diagnostic challenges and optimal treatment of torsion of an undescended testis.

Methods

We present a two-center retrospective chart review of patients with torsion of an undescended testis treated between 2013 and 2018. Two instructive cases are used to depict characteristics of this rare entity.

Results

We identified 11 patients with previously diagnosed cryptorchidism undergoing surgery for torsion of an undescended testis, accounting for 9.7% (11/107) of all testicular torsions in the period. Mean age at diagnosis was 9.4 months (1–22 months). Mean duration from onset of symptoms to presentation was 19.3 h (8–48 h). At admission to hospital 10 patients presented with groin lump (10/11, 90.9%) with or without pain leading to a suspected diagnosis of inguinal testicular torsion (5/11, 45.5%), incarcerated inguinal hernia (4/11, 36.4%) and epididymitis (1/11, 9.1%). Ten patients had an ultrasound examination before surgery leading to the correct diagnosis in six patients. Ultrasound findings were misinterpreted as incarcerated inguinal hernia in three patients. In eight patients the testis had to be removed at time of surgery; one of the three salvaged testes atrophied, resulting in a salvage rate of 18%.

Conclusion

Torsion of an inguinal testis is not as rare as it might be presumed. Presentation of these patients is often deferred owing to equivocal signs and symptoms. In addition age at presentation differs from typical testicular torsion. As this might negatively influence testicular salvage rate, we advocate for special attention to this differential diagnosis in children with groin pathologies. Even if the child is not in pain, a tender groin in boys with undescended testes must prompt a quick and thorough examination to rule out torsion of an undescended testis. Ultrasound examination is of limited value and must not delay acute surgical treatment.

### Testicular torsion [^1111ZvFU]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Each year, testicular torsion affects one in 4,000 males younger than 25 years. Early diagnosis and definitive management are the keys to avoid testicular loss. All prepubertal and young adult males with acute scrotal pain should be considered to have testicular torsion until proven otherwise. The finding of an ipsilateral absent cremasteric reflex is the most accurate sign of testicular torsion. Torsion of the appendix testis is more common in children than testicular torsion and may be diagnosed by the "blue dot sign" (i.e., tender nodule with blue discoloration on the upper pole of the testis). Epididymitis/orchitis is much less common in the prepubertal male, and the diagnosis should be made with caution in this age group. Doppler ultrasonography may be needed for definitive diagnosis; radionuclide scintigraphy is an alternative that may be more accurate but should be ordered only if it can be performed without delay. Diagnosis of testicular torsion is based on the finding of decreased or absent blood flow on the ipsilateral side. Treatment involves rapid restoration of blood flow to the affected testis. The optimal time frame is less than six hours after the onset of symptoms. Manual detorsion by external rotation of the testis can be successful, but restoration of blood flow must be confirmed following the maneuver. Surgical exploration provides definitive treatment for the affected testis by orchiopexy and allows for prophylactic orchiopexy of the contralateral testis. Surgical treatment of torsion of the appendix testis is not mandatory but hastens recovery.

### A case report of acute testicular pain secondary to segmental testicular infarction [^116SwTvF]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The subject is a male patient, 33 years old. On March 11, 2021, he was admitted with a 5-day history of left scrotal pain and no history of chronic diseases or trauma. Physical examination showed that the upper part of the left testis was tender, hard, and swollen than the lower part. The Prehn's sign was negative, and the right testis showed no obvious abnormality. Laboratory tests revealed normal tumor markers (AFP, HCG) and decreased testosterone. Color Doppler ultrasonography showed that the upper part of the left testis had localized heterogeneous echogenicity and an avascular area, while the other testicular areas had normal echogenicity and blood flow. Thus, the possibility of infarction was considered (Fig. 1 A, B). MR of the testis showed focal necrosis of the left testis with thickening and distortion of the left spermatic vein (Fig. 2 A–D). Three-dimensional reconstruction of CT showed a low-density area in the upper part of the left testis, which did not show obvious enhancement (Fig. 3). According to the patient's physical signs and relevant results of laboratory tests, and after excluding the possibility of hypovascular testicular cancer, segmental infarction of the left testis was considered. The patient was then administered conservative treatment, including analgesia and oral testosterone undecanoate to supplement testosterone (80 mg, bid). Color Doppler ultrasound was repeated after 1 week, 3 weeks, and 5 weeks and the results showed that the infarct size was significantly reduced than before (Fig. 1 C, D, E, F, G, and H). Testosterone levels returned to normal on the retest 3 weeks later. MR of the testis showed that the abnormal signal lesion in the left testis was smaller than before (Fig. 2 E–H). Before the publication of this case report and any accompanying images, the patient's written informed consent had been obtained.

Intussusception management

There were 11 studies regarding intussusception management (10/23; 43%). Weiss et al described the most common abdominal surgery, which was intra-abdominal small bowel manipulation. No studies compared interventions and the quality of the evidence was weak. Due to the high risk of complications, the IgAV GDG agreed on a strong recommendation to obtain specialist advice.

Testicular involvement

Reports on testicular involvement were limited with orchiditis, defined as painful, acute scrotal oedema associated with palpable purpuric lesions. Five small studies described treatment, including the effective use of corticosteroids (a total of 15 patients in three studies). The literature highlighted that surgical exploration may be required to exclude differential diagnoses. The group agreed that a short course of corticosteroids could be considered for this complication and this aligned with the European SHARE initiative.

Atypical disease course

Three studies (3/83; 3.6%) included performing a skin biopsy in atypical disease and it forms part of the classification criteria, therefore it was recommended.

Persisting or recurrent disease

Eight studies (8/82; 9.8%) included a definition for persisting disease and agreed on skin lesions for > 1 month and 34 provided a definition for recurrent IgAV with the majority (n = 19/34; 56%) using rash reappearance after a 1-month symptom-free period.

Long-term follow-up

There were 22 studies (22/82; 27%) with indications for long-term follow-up, of which 17 related to nephritis. Based on low-quality evidence, the IgAV GDG made a strong recommendation to follow-up patients who had experienced biopsy-proven nephritis due to the risk of CKD.

### Focal orchitis presenting as bilateral testicular masses [^115mXE2q]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2007). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old male presented with bilateral scrotal pain. Ultrasound with Doppler revealed multiple bilateral testicular masses that were hypoechoic and hypervascular. Tumor markers and endocrinologic work-up were normal. Bilateral inguinal exploration of the testicles was done and biopsy revealed inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. The patient's pain resolved a few weeks postoperatively. Follow-up ultrasound revealed resolution of the masses. Multiple pathologic testicular entities can present as hypoechoic areas on sonography. Thorough work-up should be performed prior to advocating orchiectomy based only on ultrasound findings.

### A comparison of clinical outcomes of acute testicular torsion between prepubertal and postpubertal males [^116NGyfv]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Short Introduction/Background

Surgical intervention for acute testicular torsion can require either orchiopexy or orchiectomy. The decision of which surgery to perform is dependant on the amount of time that the testicle experienced ischemia and the viability of the testicle after reperfusion.

Objective

It is hypothesized that (1) there is a difference in orchiectomy and orchiopexy rates between prepubertal and postpubertal males with acute testicular torsion and (2) presenting symptoms may vary between the two age groups as prepubertal males may present with atypical symptoms, which could result in delayed presentation and diagnosis.

Study Design

A retrospective chart review was conducted on pediatric patients who were diagnosed with acute testicular torsion between June 2010 and August 2017. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted: age, ethnicity, referral pattern, primary insurance status, symptoms at presentation, prior history of ipsilateral testicular pain or intermittent torsion, recent trauma to genitalia, duration of symptoms (hours), gradual vs. acute onset of symptoms, time/weekday/season at presentation, and time interval from arrival at the study institution to surgical intervention (minutes). Patients were categorized into two groups: prepubertal group (age 1–12 years) and postpubertal group (age 13–18 years). Statistical analyses were performed using R, version 3.3.1.

Results

Ninety-one patients were included in the study. The overall orchiectomy rate was 30.8%. More prepubertal males underwent orchiectomy than postpubertal males (42.4% vs. 24.1%, respectively). Prepubertal males were more likely to present with abdominal pain than postpubertal males (27.3% vs. 10.3%, respectively). Those who underwent orchiectomy were more likely to present with longer duration of symptoms, testicular swelling, and abdominal pain than those who underwent orchiopexy. The risk of orchiectomy decreased by 14% per 1-year increase in age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94–1.00, p = .009). A steady decline in the proportion of patients undergoing orchiectomy was seen from 1 to 12 years of age.

Discussion

This study found that prepubertal males are at higher risk for orchiectomy than postpubertal males. The risk of orchiectomy decreases by 14–16% per 1-year increase in age. Prepubertal males are more likely to present with atypical symptoms and delayed presentation and diagnosis, leading to delayed surgical intervention. It is important for providers to perform a genital examination in prepubertal males who present with abdominal pain to rule out acute testicular torsion. Patients presenting with longer duration of symptoms, testicular swelling, and abdominal pain are at higher risk for orchiectomy. No correlation was found between orchiectomy rate and ethnicity, referral status, primary insurance status, and time/weekday/season at presentation.

Conclusion

Among patients presenting to a tertiary pediatric hospital with acute testicular torsion, prepubertal males (younger than 12 years) are at higher risk for orchiectomy than postpubertal males. Prepubertal males are more likely to present with atypical symptoms which results in delayed presentation and diagnosis, leading to delayed in surgical intervention.

### Testicular torsion after laparoscopic appendectomy: salvage by spermatic cord heparin flush and testicular decompression-a case report and literature review [^111MfkcX]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion is characterized by a sudden onset of scrotal pain, often occurring during sleep or after strenuous exercise. The pain manifests initially as a vague sensation and subsequently transitions into a severe, persistent or intermittent pain. Some patients may also experience concomitant pain in the lower abdomen or groin area, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or fever. Patients may also present with non-specific symptoms such as fever or lower urinary tract symptoms. It is noteworthy that cryptorchid torsion is a distinct type of testicular torsion, with a prevalence ranging from 21 to 53 times higher in children with cryptorchid testes. Its clinical manifestations include scrotal emptiness, atypical abdominal pain, and a palpable mass in the inguinal region, often accompanied by fever, nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms. A differential diagnosis is often necessary to rule out other potential pathologies, including inguinal incarcerated hernia, acute inguinal lymphadenitis, intestinal obstruction, and appendicitis, among others. Testicular torsion is also occasionally observed in conjunction with positive inguinal palpation, elevated, transverse, or oblique testicular position, thickening of the spermatic cord, and tenderness.

The diagnosis of testicular torsion is primarily determined by a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's symptoms, a physical examination, blood tests, and ultrasonography. Medical professionals meticulously examine the position, morphology, and tenderness of the testis through palpation and other investigative procedures. Ultrasound imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of testicular torsion, as it can reveal abnormalities such as testicular enlargement and reduced or absent blood flow signals. The utilization of ultrasound Doppler examination has the potential to diminish the necessity for patients experiencing acute scrotal discomfort to undergo scrotal exploration procedures. Nevertheless, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound Doppler examination for testicular torsion is contingent on the expertise of the operator and can be more challenging to interpret in prepubertal patients. In the early stages of testicular torsion and in patients with incomplete or intermittent testicular torsion, ultrasound Doppler examination can also show arterial blood flow and misdirect the diagnosis. The point is that the detection of persistent arterial flow does not completely exclude the possibility of testicular torsion either. In instances where there is a discrepancy in the intensity of arterial flow between the two testes, a meticulous differential diagnosis is imperative. TWIST holds considerable clinical value in the diagnosis of testicular torsion, with the potential to expedite the diagnostic process. Its utilization in conjunction with ultrasonography in medical institutions equipped with the necessary resources is recommended (Table 1).

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^114Bpgsp]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Testicular sonography has contributed greatly to the preoperative diagnosis of testicular torsion in the pediatric patient and is the mainstay for evaluation of acute scrotal pain. Despite its high sensitivity and specificity, both false-negative and false-positive findings occur. Presence of documented Doppler flow within the testis might be a dissuading factor for surgical exploration with resultant testicular loss in the false-negative cases. Our goal is to illustrate key sonographic features in the spectrum of testicular torsion with preserved testicular flow, and to describe how to differentiate testicular torsion from epididymitis in order to avoid the under-diagnosis of testicular torsion. We simplify the anatomy of the bell clapper testis. We also describe our sonographic protocol for testicular torsion and share valuable tips from our approach to challenging cases.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of scrotal ultrasound examinations [^1163qvxL]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Scrotal ultrasound — core imaging protocol specifies that the presence of 2 testes should be documented either on a single transverse, coronal, or coronal oblique image, a cine loop survey scan in both longitudinal and transverse projections can be obtained and stored, and the testes should be evaluated in at least 2 planes: longitudinal and transverse. Transverse images should be obtained in the superior, mid, and inferior portions, and longitudinal views should be obtained centrally as well as medially and laterally. Comparison of the testes is best accomplished with a side-by-side transverse image, and in the event that a testis is not identified within the scrotum, the ipsilateral inguinal canal and inguinal rings should be examined. In cases of acute swelling or pain, some authors suggest that the asymptomatic side should be evaluated first and the symptomatic side afterward with the same/similar grayscale and Doppler settings.

### Epididymitis-STI treatment guidelines… [^116NtnRz]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Epididymitis Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting < 6 weeks. Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index of suspicion for spermatic cord torsion should be maintained among men who have a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition is a surgical emergency. Chronic epididymitis is characterized by a ≥ 6-week history of symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis. Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently observed with conditions associated with a granulomatous reaction. Diagnostic Considerations Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis.

Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised. Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available.

Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization (.

### Diagnosing chronic testicular pain… [^111wpGVD]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic testicular pain is unilateral or bilateral scrotal pain lasting for more than three months and interfering with normal activities. Because of the innervation of the scrotum, testicular pain may originate in the abdomen or testis. The cause of testicular pain may be difficult to determine. In approximately 25 percent of cases, an underlying cause for orchalgia cannot be identified. A review by Kapoor and Nargund stresses a systematic approach to the diagnosis of chronic testicular pain. The history should include questions concerning lower urinary tract and bowel symptoms, as well as a complete genitourinary and sexual history. The onset and nature of the pain can give important clues to diagnosis. Intermittent testicular torsion is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe pain that may be accompanied by nausea and systemic symptoms. The pain may last from minutes to hours.

Pain following groin or scrotal surgery is often continuous and exacerbated by sexual intercourse. Following vasectomy, pain may result from a sperm granuloma in the epididymis or from entrapment of nerve fibers in granulation tissue. Chronic orchalgia is reported following about one per 1, 000 vasectomies. Varicocele-related pain is characteristically described as a persistent, aching discomfort or heavy sensation that is relieved by lying down. Although testicular tumors are usually described as painless, up to 40 percent of patients report dull aching or heaviness. Bleeding into a tumor or other abnormalities such as hydroceles, epididymal cysts, and spermatoceles can produce acute or severe pain. Testicular pain associated with chronic infection is usually associated with urinary symptoms or those of sexually transmitted diseases. The management of testicular lesions depends on the etiology. Patients should be cautioned that surgical treatment may not resolve pain.

For cases where the etiology cannot be determined, ilioinguinal nerve block or microsurgical denervation may relieve the pain. Systemic analgesia or orchidectomy may be required in individual cases. In such extreme cases, psychologic consultation is recommended to ensure that the pain is neurologic and not psychogenic in origin.

### Diagnostic studies… [^113DBVti]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Testicular pain or swelling, often referred to as the acute scrotum, can have a number of causes. Testicular torsion represents a surgical emergency because the likelihood of testicular salvage diminishes with the duration of torsion. Therefore, the family physician must act quickly to identify or exclude this condition in any patient who presents with an acute scrotum. This article reviews an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of the acute scrotum. The onset and duration of pain must be carefully determined. Testicular torsion usually begins abruptly, as if a switch has been flipped. The pain is severe, and the patient often appears uncomfortable. Moderate pain developing gradually over a few days is more suggestive of epididymitis or appendiceal torsion. With either of these conditions, the patient may appear relatively comfortable except when examined. A history of trauma does not exclude the diagnosis of testicular torsion.

Scrotal trauma incurred during sports activities or rough, boisterous play often causes severe pain of short duration. Pain that persists for more than one hour after scrotal trauma is not normal and merits investigation to rule out testicular rupture or acute torsion. Pain that resolves promptly after scrotal trauma only to recur gradually a few days later suggests traumatic epididymitis. Color Doppler ultrasonography also correctly diagnosed incarcerated hernias, varicoceles, hematomas and testicular ruptures. When the history and physical examination strongly suggest that testicular torsion is present and the duration of pain is less than 12 hours, urgent surgical intervention is indicated. No imaging studies are required because they may delay treatment and thereby jeopardize testicular survival. When pain has been present for more than 12 hours or the diagnosis is unclear, color Doppler ultrasound examination can be helpful in making clinical decisions.

It is important to remember that most patients with an acute scrotum do not have testicular torsion. SCROTAL TRAUMA Severe testicular injury is uncommon and usually results from either a direct blow to the scrotum or a straddle injury. Damage occurs when the testis is forcefully compressed against the pubic bones. A spectrum of injuries may occur. Traumatic epididymitis is a noninfectious inflammatory condition that usually occurs within a few days after a blow to the testis. Treatment is similar to that for nontraumatic epididymitis.
