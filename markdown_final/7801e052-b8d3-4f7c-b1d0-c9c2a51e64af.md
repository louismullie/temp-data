## Question

Family history hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about family history in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the inheritance pattern and why a detailed family history matters. Then, I should verify what exactly to elicit in the family history and how to document it. Next, I will review how family history informs pre-test probability and genetic testing strategy. After that, I need to check cascade screening protocols for relatives, including age-specific intervals and when to stop. I will then examine risk stratification implications, including SCD risk and the role of family history of sudden death. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, counseling and communication, and synthesize a practical algorithm with attention to evolving evidence and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the inheritance pattern and why family history is foundational. HCM is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, so each first-degree relative has a 50% a priori risk of carrying the familial variant, which makes a structured family history essential for diagnosis, cascade testing, and risk stratification [^112QXCSY]. Wait, let me verify the prevalence estimates; contemporary data suggest a prevalence around 1:200–1:500, higher than the older 1:500 figure, reflecting improved recognition and imaging, so I should be cautious not to undercall risk in relatives [^111k4Zww] [^1137NtqM].

> I need to ensure I am capturing the right elements in the family history. Guidelines recommend a three-generation pedigree documenting who has HCM, how it was diagnosed, age of onset, and any sudden cardiac death or unexplained cardiac events, along with syncope, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and any valve disease that could mimic or coexist with HCM; I should also ask about athletic status and hypertension to avoid misattributing physiologic or pressure-overload hypertrophy to HCM [^114bMXBc] [^116iXYVt] [^114vwEV2]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating aortic stenosis-related LVH with HCM; clarifying valve procedures and murmurs helps distinguish phenocopies and refine risk assessment in the family [^114vwEV2].

> Next, I should review how family history shapes pre-test probability and genetic testing yield. A positive family history substantially increases the likelihood of identifying a pathogenic sarcomere variant, with pooled detection rates around 59% in familial cohorts versus about 33% in sporadic cases; younger age at diagnosis and specific phenotypes further increase yield, so I should document these carefully before ordering testing [^115xsSZQ] [^116nfgxN]. Wait, I should double-check that I am not implying a negative family history rules out heritability; it lowers pre-test probability but does not exclude a genetic cause, so testing may still be appropriate in phenotype-positive individuals [^116nfgxN].

> I will now examine cascade screening logistics and intervals. For first-degree relatives, both clinical screening with ECG and echocardiography and cascade genetic testing should be offered when a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is identified in the proband; genotype-negative relatives can be discharged from further surveillance, whereas genotype-positive, phenotype-negative relatives require ongoing surveillance given age-dependent penetrance [^1126QYqu] [^11336Xxk] [^1143jEf6]. Let me verify the intervals: children and adolescents generally need screening every 1–2 years, and adults every 3–5 years, with adjustments for early-onset disease, malignant family history, or evolving clinical status; in gene-elusive families, continued periodic imaging remains prudent because late-onset disease can emerge [^1143jEf6] [^117BurYQ]. Hold on, I should confirm that stopping surveillance is reasonable only when a relative is both genotype-negative and phenotype-negative; otherwise, surveillance should continue into adulthood, often through midlife [^11336Xxk] [^117Jr4rY].

> Now, I should review risk stratification and how family history influences SCD risk. Family history of premature HCM-related sudden death in a close relative is a recognized risk marker incorporated into contemporary SCD risk assessment, and it should be systematically documented and updated at each visit; however, I need to be careful not to overinterpret family history in isolation, as overall risk is determined by a composite of clinical, imaging, and ambulatory parameters [^114P3DLL] [^112CzU3p]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a family history of SCD alone would mandate ICD, but I should correct that; while it increases estimated risk, decisions should still follow validated risk models and shared decision-making rather than a single factor [^114P3DLL].

> Let me consider special scenarios and edge cases. If the proband is genotype-negative or testing was not performed, first-degree relatives still require serial clinical screening because current genetic testing does not capture all causes and late-onset disease occurs; I should not falsely reassure families in this setting [^117BurYQ] [^113nJZSo]. But wait, what if there is a sudden unexplained death with postmortem diagnosis of HCM? In that case, postmortem genetic testing can facilitate cascade screening and should be considered to enable targeted family evaluation [^114SLSPF]. I should also remember that variants of uncertain significance require caution; cascade testing for a VUS is not recommended, and segregation studies in informative relatives may help clarify classification over time [^113HYV5b].

> I need to ensure counseling and communication are embedded throughout. Pre- and post-test genetic counseling is essential to explain autosomal dominant inheritance, penetrance variability, insurance implications, and the possibility of secondary findings; probands should be encouraged to share results with relatives, and programs that improve comprehension of inheritance improve family communication and cascade uptake [^112CHr5r] [^112MvKS7]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not overpromising certainty; variant interpretation evolves, so periodic re-evaluation of variant classification and family risk is necessary, and families should be prepared for reclassification that could alter screening recommendations [^111yZCED].

> Next, I should review pediatric nuances and thresholds. Early-onset disease is not rare, and a meaningful fraction of affected children are diagnosed before age 10, so rigid age cutoffs can miss disease; in children with a definitive family history or a positive genetic test, a z-score threshold greater than 2 may suffice for early diagnosis, whereas in those without family history, a higher z-score threshold may be more appropriate to avoid overdiagnosis [^113uB67x] [^1133ztNF]. I should double-check that continued surveillance into adulthood remains indicated for genotype-positive, phenotype-negative children because penetrance can be age-dependent and late expression is well described [^117Jr4rY].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, obtain a three-generation pedigree and document diagnoses, ages, sudden deaths, and valve disease; second, offer genetic testing to the most informative affected individual when HCM is confirmed or strongly suspected; third, if a pathogenic variant is found, offer cascade genetic testing and clinical screening to first-degree relatives with age-appropriate intervals; fourth, if the proband is genotype-negative or untested, provide serial clinical screening to first-degree relatives rather than relying on a negative genetic test; fifth, integrate family history into SCD risk assessment and update periodically; sixth, provide counseling on inheritance, reproductive options, and the limits of current knowledge, and coordinate care in a multidisciplinary HCM center when possible [^113GGkmx] [^114bMXBc] [^1126QYqu]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with contemporary guidance emphasizing proband-first testing, cascade screening, and longitudinal family management with periodic re-evaluation of genetic findings and clinical risk [^113GGkmx] [^111yZCED].

> Finally, I should acknowledge evolving evidence and uncertainties. Polygenic contributors and complex genetics explain some gene-elusive cases, and emerging polygenic risk scores may refine risk prediction and screening intensity in the future, but they are not yet ready to replace current family-based algorithms; I need to communicate this uncertainty transparently while continuing to apply established standards today [^116qLXc2] [^114hL7tU]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; until robust, prospectively validated models are available, family history remains a cornerstone that must be meticulously elicited, updated, and integrated with genotype and phenotype to optimize outcomes for patients and their relatives [^114bMXBc] [^113GGkmx].

A detailed family history is essential in **HCM** because it defines inheritance, guides genetic testing, and directs cascade screening of relatives [^114bMXBc] [^113GGkmx]. HCM is most often autosomal dominant, so each first-degree relative has a **50% risk** [^112QXCSY]; documenting affected relatives, sudden cardiac death, and age of onset improves diagnostic yield and risk stratification [^114P3DLL]. Family history of HCM or sudden death increases the likelihood of a positive genetic test and informs **cascade testing** and surveillance for at-risk relatives [^115xsSZQ] [^114Ds1Rk]. A structured pedigree and updated family history at each visit are core to guideline-based care and early detection of disease in relatives [^116iXYVt] [^114ea27E].

---

## Inheritance pattern and genetic implications

- **Autosomal dominant inheritance**: HCM is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with each child of an affected individual having a 50% risk of inheriting the disease-causing variant [^112QXCSY] [^111A63Re].

- **Genetic heterogeneity**: Mutations in sarcomere and sarcomere-related genes (e.g. MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3) account for a substantial proportion of HCM cases, but approximately 50% of patients may not have identifiable mutations on current panels [^116qLXc2] [^114bwSAp].

- **Penetrance and expressivity**: Penetrance is incomplete and expression is variable, meaning not all carriers develop clinical disease, and age of onset and severity vary widely within families [^112qnG46] [^113HZQPo].

---

## Clinical significance of family history in HCM

- **Diagnostic yield**: Family history significantly increases the likelihood of identifying pathogenic variants on genetic testing, with detection rates higher in familial cases (approximately 59%) compared to sporadic cases (approximately 33%) [^115xsSZQ] [^112qnG46].

- **Risk stratification**: Family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD) or malignant arrhythmias in close relatives is a major risk factor for SCD in HCM patients and influences decisions regarding implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement and risk management strategies [^114P3DLL] [^112Sr8SS].

- **Cascade screening**: Identifying affected family members enables cascade genetic testing and targeted clinical screening of at-risk relatives, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention [^114Ds1Rk] [^1126QYqu].

## Recommended approach to family history assessment

Guidelines recommend a **structured approach** to family history assessment in HCM:

| **Step** | **Recommended actions** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Obtain a detailed three-generation pedigree, documenting affected individuals, age of onset, clinical manifestations, and sudden cardiac deaths [^114bMXBc] [^116iXYVt] |
| 2 | Document family history of other cardiac conditions, including valvular disease, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmias [^114vwEV2] |
| 3 | Update family history regularly, as new diagnoses or events may occur in relatives [^113HYV5b] |
| 4 | Offer genetic counseling and testing to affected individuals and at-risk relatives, with cascade testing when a pathogenic variant is identified [^114Ds1Rk] [^1126QYqu] |

---

## Impact of family history on clinical management

- **Genetic testing**: Family history informs the decision to pursue genetic testing, with higher pre-test probability in familial cases increasing the likelihood of identifying causative variants [^116nfgxN] [^112qnG46].

- **Cascade screening**: Identification of pathogenic variants in probands enables cascade genetic testing and targeted clinical screening of relatives, allowing early detection and management of at-risk individuals [^114Ds1Rk] [^1126QYqu].

- **Risk management**: Family history of SCD or malignant arrhythmias influences risk stratification and decisions regarding ICD placement, lifestyle modifications, and surveillance strategies [^114P3DLL] [^112Sr8SS].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Incomplete penetrance**: Not all carriers of pathogenic variants develop clinical disease, complicating risk assessment and counseling [^112qnG46] [^111k4Zww].

- **Variable expressivity**: Age of onset and disease severity vary widely within families, necessitating longitudinal follow-up and repeated reassessment [^112qnG46] [^117Jr4rY].

- **Genetic testing limitations**: Current genetic testing may not identify causative variants in approximately 50% of cases, requiring ongoing clinical surveillance despite negative genetic results [^116qLXc2] [^116TEn2a].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize the importance of family history in HCM management:

- **ESC 2023 guidelines**: Recommend obtaining a detailed three-generation family history in all patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, and cascade genetic testing with pre- and post-test counseling for at-risk relatives [^114bMXBc] [^114Ds1Rk].

- **ACC/AHA 2024 guidelines**: Emphasize evaluation of familial inheritance, genetic testing, and cascade screening of relatives, with regular reassessment of variant classification and clinical significance [^113GGkmx] [^111yZCED].

---

Family history is a cornerstone of HCM care, guiding genetic testing, cascade screening, and risk stratification. A detailed pedigree and updated family history enable early detection and tailored management of at-risk relatives, improving outcomes for families affected by HCM [^114bMXBc] [^113GGkmx].

### Genetic testing in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112iPLWh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing is an important tool in the diagnosis and management of patients and families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Modern testing can identify causative variants in 30 to > 60% of patients, with probability of a positive test varying with baseline characteristics such as known family history of HCM. Patients diagnosed with HCM should be offered genetic counseling and genetic testing as appropriate. Standard multigene panels evaluate sarcomeric genes known to cause HCM as well as genetic conditions that can mimic HCM but require different management. Positive genetic testing (finding a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant) helps to clarify diagnosis and assists in family screening. If there is high confidence that an identified variant is the cause of HCM, at-risk family members can pursue predictive testing to determine if they are truly at risk or if they can be dismissed from serial screening based on whether they inherited the family's causative variant. Interpreting test results can be complex, and providers should make use of multidisciplinary teams as well as evidence-based resources to obtain the best possible understanding of pathogenicity.

### Update on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a guide to the guidelines [^117YTLxw]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disorder, affecting 1 in 500 individuals worldwide. Existing epidemiological studies might have underestimated the prevalence of HCM, however, owing to limited inclusion of individuals with early, incomplete phenotypic expression. Clinical manifestations of HCM include diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ischaemia, atrial fibrillation, abnormal vascular responses and, in 5% of patients, progression to a 'burnt-out' phase characterized by systolic impairment. Disease-related mortality is most often attributable to sudden cardiac death, heart failure, and embolic stroke. The majority of individuals with HCM, however, have normal or near-normal life expectancy, owing in part to contemporary management strategies including family screening, risk stratification, thromboembolic prophylaxis, and implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators. The clinical guidelines for HCM issued by the ACC Foundation/AHA and the ESC facilitate evaluation and management of the disease. In this Review, we aim to assist clinicians in navigating the guidelines by highlighting important updates, current gaps in knowledge, differences in the recommendations, and challenges in implementing them, including aids and pitfalls in clinical and pathological evaluation. We also discuss the advances in genetics, imaging, and molecular research that will underpin future developments in diagnosis and therapy for HCM.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cardiac screening — baseline testing, intervals, and modifiers: Baseline cardiology testing is recommended for all first-degree, at-risk relatives and should include echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, and examination by a cardiologist. It is recommended that genotype-positive relatives undergo serial cardiac screening by electrocardiogram and echocardiogram every 1–2 years through adolescence (< 20 years) and every 3–5 years in adulthood (≥ 21 years). A recent SER found an average penetrance of 62% across all studies and 24% during childhood. Indications to increase frequency may include young age of onset in the family, family history of severe disease and/or sudden cardiac death, and the presence of multiple genetic variants. Conversely, there may be indications where less frequent cardiac screening can be considered for at-risk family members; factors that may indicate lower risk include older age of HCM diagnosis, presence of modifiable risk factors (i.e., obesity, hypertension), negative family history of HCM, and sudden cardiac death. When at at-risk relatives present with cardiac symptoms, these should be immediately investigated. Clinical management, initiation of therapies, and lifestyle advice are typically only indicated based on a clinical diagnosis of HCM, and not for genotype-positive but clinically unaffected relatives.

### Family screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: is it time to change practice guidelines? [^113uB67x]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Current guidelines recommend initiating family screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) after age 10 or 12years unless early screening criteria are met. The aim was to evaluate if current screening guidelines miss early onset disease.

Methods and Results

Children who underwent family screening for HCM before age 18years were analysed. Major cardiac events (MaCEs) were defined as death, sudden cardiac death (SCD), or need for major cardiac interventions (myectomy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion, transplantation). Of 524 children screened, 331 were under 10years of age, 9.9% had echocardiographic evidence of HCM, and 1.1% were symptomatic at first screening. The median (interquartile range) age at HCM onset was 8.9 (4.7–13.4) years, and at MaCE was 10.9 (8.5–14.3) years with a median time to MaCE from HCM onset of 1.5 (0.5–4.1) years. About 52.5% phenotype-positive children and 41% with MaCEs were < 10years old. Only 69% children with early HCM met early screening criteria. Cox regression identified male gender, family history of SCD, and pathogenic variants in MYH7/MYBPC3 as a predictor of early onset HCM and MaCEs.

Conclusion

A third of children not eligible for early screening by current guidelines had phenotype-positive HCM. MYH7 and MYBC3 mutation-positive patients were at highest risk for developing early HCM and experiencing an event or requiring a major intervention. Our findings suggest that younger family members should be considered for early clinical and genetic screening to identify the subset in need of closer monitoring and interventions.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111k4Zww]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common often inherited global heart disease, with complex phenotypic and genetic expression and natural history, affecting both genders and many races and cultures. Prevalence is 1:200–1:500, largely based on the disease phenotype with imaging, inferring that 750,000 Americans may be affected by HCM. However, cross-sectional data show that only a fraction are clinically diagnosed, suggesting under-recognition, with most clinicians exposed to small segments of the broad disease spectrum. Highly effective HCM management strategies have emerged, altering clinical course and substantially lowering mortality and morbidity rates. These advances underscore the importance of reliable HCM diagnosis with echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. Family screening with noninvasive imaging will identify relatives with the HCM phenotype, while genetic analysis recognizes preclinical sarcomere gene carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy, but with the potential to transmit disease. Comprehensive initial patient evaluations are important for reliable diagnosis, accurate portrayal of HCM and family history, risk stratification, and distinguishing obstructive versus nonobstructive forms.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to screening of family relatives, follow-up, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to discharge first-degree relatives without a phenotype and not having the same disease-causing variant as the proband after cascade genetic testing from further follow-up, but advise seeking re-assessment in case symptoms develop or when new clinically relevant data emerge in the family.

### Genetics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy after 20 years: clinical perspectives [^111BtLae]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common familial heart disease with vast genetic heterogeneity, demonstrated over the past 20 years. Mutations in 11 or more genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere (> 1,400 variants) are responsible for (or associated with) HCM. Explosive progress achieved in understanding the rapidly evolving science underlying HCM genomics has resulted in fee-for-service testing, making genetic information widely available. The power of HCM mutational analysis, albeit a more limited role than initially envisioned, lies most prominently in screening family members at risk for developing disease and excluding unaffected relatives, which is information not achievable otherwise. Genetic testing also allows expansion of the broad HCM disease spectrum and diagnosis of HCM phenocopies with different natural history and treatment options, but is not a reliable strategy for predicting prognosis. Interfacing a heterogeneous disease such as HCM with the vast genetic variability of the human genome, and high frequency of novel mutations, has created unforeseen difficulties in translating complex science (and language) into the clinical arena. Indeed, proband diagnostic testing is often expressed on a probabilistic scale, which is frequently incompatible with clinical decision making. Major challenges rest with making reliable distinctions between pathogenic mutations and benign variants, and those judged to be of uncertain significance. Genotyping in HCM can be a powerful tool for family screening and diagnosis. However, wider adoption and future success of genetic testing in the practicing cardiovascular community depends on a standardized approach to mutation interpretation, and bridging the communication gap between basic scientists and clinicians.

Relatives of a proband with an unknown genotype — genetic testing guidance: While it is recommended that HCM panel testing be performed on the affected family member, this is not always possible; panel-based genetic testing (HCM panel or cardiomyopathy panel) is not recommended for at-risk individuals without an affected family member who has been tested. A negative result in this setting does not eliminate the risk of developing the condition. HCM panel testing yields at least one VUS in about 24% of patients, and a VUS may be misinterpreted in the absence of a phenotype or an affected relative's genotype to aid in its interpretation.

### Genetic testing and counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an evidence-based practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^116nfgxN]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

Pre-test probability and indications for genetic testing in HCM — Clinical information and family history inform the likelihood of a positive genetic test result, and establishing the pre-test probability is intended to guide interpretation of results and recommendations for additional testing and cardiac screening. Genetic testing prediction scoring systems that incorporate clinical phenotype and family history are available for adults and children, and younger age at diagnosis increases the likelihood of a positive result. The overall detection rate of a disease-causing variant among individuals ≤ 21 years is 78% compared to 33% among individuals diagnosed as an adult, and individuals assigned female at birth, those with a family history of HCM and/or sudden death, and those with greater asymmetric hypertrophy are more likely to have a positive genetic test result. Lower pre-test probability should not preclude offering testing; all individuals with a clinical diagnosis of HCM or unexplained LVH should be offered genetic testing regardless of age, onset, family history, or degree of hypertrophy, and genetic testing for HCM should be considered if the cause of LVH remains uncertain.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cascade genetic testing — availability, impact, and counseling: Where a causal genetic variant is identified in a proband, targeted variant testing (cascade genetic testing) of first-degree at-risk relatives becomes available. Importantly, first-degree at-risk relatives have a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic variant, and discussion to weigh the risks and benefits of cascade genetic testing should be offered. Relatives who test negative may be released from serial cardiac screening and cannot pass HCM onto their biological children, whereas those who test positive are at increased risk of developing HCM and their biological children have a 50% chance of inheriting the genetic variant. Being able to cease serial cardiac screening in ~50% of at-risk relatives is what drives HCM genetic testing being cost-effective compared to clinical screening alone. Pre-test genetic counseling should include a discussion of incomplete penetrance and variable expression, and discussion of genetic discrimination including that health insurance has protections but life, disability, and long-term care insurance do not; potential implications should be discussed according to the local context.

### Genetics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: established and emerging implications for clinical practice [^114bwSAp]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathogenic variation in genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere is responsible for 30%-40% of cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The main clinical utility of genetic testing is to provide diagnostic confirmation and facilitation of family screening. It also assists in the detection of aetiologies, which require distinct monitoring and treatment approaches. Other clinical applications, including the use of genetic information to inform risk prediction models, have been limited by the challenge of establishing robust genotype-phenotype correlations with actionable consequences, but new data on the interaction between rare and common genetic variation, as well as the emergence of therapies targeting disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms, herald a new era for genetic testing in routine practice.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) family history — clarify relatives with valve disease to refine risk assessment, asking what valve was affected and whether surgery was required, because aortic valve stenosis can cause left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and mitral valve pathology can be seen in people with HCM, sometimes before LVH or obstructive disease is identified.

### Cardiovascular genetics: the role of genetic testing in diagnosis and management of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115r3knT]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a valuable tool to manage patients and their families. Genetic testing can help inform diagnosis and differentiate HCM from other disorders that also result in increased left ventricular wall thickness, thereby directly impacting treatment. Moreover, genetic testing can definitively identify at-risk relatives and focus family management. Pathogenic variants in sarcomere and sarcomere-related genes have been implicated in causing HCM, and targeted gene panel testing is recommended for patients once a clinical diagnosis has been established. If a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is identified in a patient with HCM, predictive genetic testing is recommended for their at-risk relatives to determine who is at risk and to guide longitudinal screening and risk stratification. However, there are important challenges and considerations to implementing genetic testing in clinical practice. Genetic testing results can have psychological and other implications for patients and their families, emphasising the importance of genetic counselling before and after genetic testing. Determining the clinical relevance of genetic testing results is also complex and requires expertise in understanding of human genetic variation and clinical manifestations of the disease. In this review, we discuss the genetics of HCM and how to integrate genetic testing in clinical practice.

### The uptake and utility of genetic testing and genetic counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113bb8CC]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2022). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — uptake of genetic testing and cascade screening shows limited adoption, as only half to three-quarters of patients with HCM and their relatives undergo genetic testing or cascade testing; just over half of probands completed genetic testing, and the uptake of cascade screening is approximately 60%–70%, meaning approximately a third of at-risk relatives do not seek care related to their family history of HCM. Studies suggest most probands share genetic risk information with their relatives regardless of genetic testing status or result, yet a positive genetic test result in a proband is associated with greater uptake of cascade screening in their relatives. In this review, five studies demonstrated that cascade genetic testing is cost-effective for at-risk relatives who test positive as well as genotype-negative relatives.

### Genetic testing and counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an evidence-based practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^112CHr5r]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy genetic testing — secondary findings and counseling considerations: For patients with HCM undergoing more comprehensive genetic testing, there is risk of secondary genetic findings, including identification of variants in other cardiac genes; the ACMG/AMP secondary findings gene list includes definite HCM sarcomere genes and a number of other genes with well-established disease risk, and providers may be asked to provide post-test counseling related to secondary findings associated with HCM risk; importantly, the presence or absence of a cardiomyopathy diagnosis cannot be established without cardiac imaging as many affected individuals may be asymptomatic, and if an HCM-associated variant is identified in an unaffected individual with no family history of HCM, there may be lower disease penetrance.

### Role of imaging in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113QQFmg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is increasingly recognized and may benefit from the recent approval of new, targeted medical therapy. Successful management of HCM is dependent on early and accurate diagnosis. The lack of a definitive diagnostic test, the wide variation in phenotype and the commonness of phenocopy conditions, and the presence of normal or hyperdynamic left ventricular function in most patients makes HCM a condition that is highly dependent on imaging for all aspects of management including, diagnosis, classification, predicting risk of complications, detecting complications, identifying risk for ventricular arrhythmias, evaluating choice of therapy and monitoring therapy, intraprocedural guidance, and screening family members. Although echocardiographic imaging remains the mainstay in the diagnosis and subsequent management of HCM, this disease clearly requires multimethod imaging for various aspects of optimal patient care. Advances in echocardiography hardware and techniques, development and refinement of imaging with computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and nuclear scanning, and the emergence of very focused assessments such as diastology and fibrosis imaging have all advanced the diagnosis and management of HCM. In this review, we discuss the relative utility and evidence support for these imaging approaches to contribute to improve patient outcomes.

### Risk stratification of sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112Sr8SS]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common hereditary cardiac condition and the leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young adults. Given that SCD can be the first and most devastating clinical expression of HCM, identifying individuals at high risk is paramount. Determining an individual's risk for HCM-related SCD requires a thorough understanding of the recognized risk factors, of which there are seven established or 'major' and five 'possible'. Major risk factors can be identified by thoroughly reviewing a patient's personal medical history and noninvasive cardiovascular testing. The presence of major risk factors identify patients who are at high enough risk of SCD to warrant consideration of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; whereas the absence of any major risk factors provides considerable reassurance to both patient and physician. The risk of HCM-related SCD in patients with no major risk factors is, however, not zero. Possible risk factors gain importance in the presence of an isolated major risk factor. Here, we provide a contemporary review of established and possible risk factors for HCM-related SCD. We also examine microvolt T-wave alternans and cardiovascular MRI as emerging risk stratification tools that could further hone our ability to accurately identify the high-risk patient.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — family screening and genetic counseling/testing: The guideline states that "clinical and/or genetic screening of first- and second-degree family members of patients with HCM is important", and that "genetic counseling should precede genetic testing of family members". It specifies inheritance risk as "the risk that an affected patient will transmit disease to each offspring is 50%". For relatives with identified pathogenic mutations, "these mutation-positive individuals should be evaluated by physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography", and if HCM is found, "these individuals should undergo risk stratification". It adds that "gene-positive subjects without evidence of HCM may be at risk for future development of HCM and benefit from ongoing clinical evaluation". When the proband's causal mutation is confirmed, "mutation-negative family members and their descendants are not at an increased risk for developing HCM and do not need further evaluation", although "such mutation-negative family members must have an echocardiogram to ensure genotype and phenotype concordance".

Family communication — hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) probands should be encouraged to share diagnoses and genetic results with relatives, and counseling increases awareness of screening recommendations though test results alone do not predict communication. Many families have incomplete cascade testing leaving distant relatives uncertain despite elevated HCM risk; cascade testing of more distant relatives is indicated when intervening relatives are untested, and families need to be advised that a positive result in this context reveals genotype status of the untested intervening relatives. When the proband genotype is unknown or negative, serial cardiac screening remains appropriate; families should be informed that cardiomyopathy can be pre-symptomatic, and limitations of cardiac evaluation and symptom vigilance with prompt screening at the recommended interval should be discussed.

Genetics and family screening in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) emphasizes evaluation of inheritance and targeted testing: In patients with HCM, evaluation of familial inheritance, including a 3-generation family history, is recommended as part of the initial assessment. In patients with HCM, genetic testing is beneficial to elucidate the genetic basis to facilitate the identification of family members at risk for developing HCM (cascade testing). In patients with an atypical clinical presentation of HCM or when another genetic condition is suspected to be the cause, a workup including genetic testing for HCM and other genetic causes of unexplained cardiac hypertrophy ("HCM phenocopies") is recommended. In patients with HCM, genetic counseling by an expert in the genetics of cardiovascular disease is recommended so that risks, benefits, test results, and their clinical significance can be reviewed and discussed with the patient in a shared decision-making process. When performing genetic testing in a proband with HCM, the initial tier of genes tested should include genes with strong evidence to be disease-causing in HCM. In first-degree relatives of patients with HCM, both clinical screening (ECG and 2D echocardiogram) and cascade genetic testing (when a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband) should be offered. In families where a sudden unexplained death has occurred with a postmortem diagnosis of HCM, postmortem genetic testing is beneficial to facilitate cascade genetic testing and clinical screening in first-degree relatives. In patients with HCM who have undergone genetic testing, serial reevaluation of the clinical significance of the variant(s) identified is recommended to assess for variant reclassification, which may impact diagnosis and cascade genetic testing in family members. In affected families with HCM, preconception and prenatal reproductive and genetic counseling should be offered.

### Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and normal genetic Investigations have few affected Relatives [^114yhLij]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that relatives of index patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are offered clinical investigations to identify individuals at risk of adverse disease complications and sudden cardiac death. However, the value of family screening in relatives of index patients with a normal genetic investigation of recognized HCM genes is largely unknown.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to perform family screening among relatives of HCM index patients with a normal genetic investigation to establish the frequency of familial disease and the clinical characteristics of affected individuals.

Methods

Clinical and genetic investigations were performed in consecutive and unrelated HCM index patients. Relatives of index patients who did not carry pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in recognized HCM genes were invited for clinical investigations.

Results

In total, 60% (270 of 453) of HCM index patients had a normal genetic investigation. A total of 80% of their relatives (751 of 938, median age 44 years) participated in the study. Of these, 5% (34 of 751) were diagnosed with HCM at baseline, whereas 0.3% (2 of 717 [751–34]) developed the condition during 5 years of follow-up. Their median age at diagnosis was 57 years (IQR: 51–70 years). Two-thirds (22 of 36) were diagnosed following family screening, whereas one-third (14 of 36) had been diagnosed previously because of cardiac symptoms, a murmur, or an abnormal electrocardiogram. None of the affected relatives experienced adverse disease complications. The risk of SCD was low.

Conclusions

Systematic family screening of index patients with HCM and normal genetic investigations was associated with a low frequency of affected relatives who appeared to have a favorable prognosis.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) genetics — Approximately 50% of cases of HCM are genetically elusive, and new gene discovery is needed to identify additional causal genes while recognizing polygenic and environmental contributors. Improved algorithms for the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance are evolving, including expert variant curation by the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen). Additionally, better understanding of the complex genetics underlying HCM and developing polygenic risk scores will further advance patient stratification and family management, including refining longitudinal screening to be more limited when the predicted risk of heritable disease is low. Investigation into correlations between genotype, phenotype, and clinical outcomes continues to be important as the field moves toward more precise and tailored therapies — including gene-specific therapeutics.

### Genetic testing impacts the utility of prospective familial screening in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy through identification of a nonfamilial subgroup [^112y2bHy]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

PurposeHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is considered a hereditary autosomal dominant condition, but genetic testing is positive in only half of patients. In patients with negative genetic tests, the inheritance pattern and utility of family screening are unclear. MethodsSubjects with HCM were prospectively enrolled in a registry. A survey at a median follow-up of 4 years determined the yield of family screening. ResultsThe outcome of cardiac screening on 267 family members was reported by 120 survey respondents. Subjects with positive genetic test or family history (n = 74, 62%) reported an HCM diagnosis in 34 of 203 first-degree relatives who were screened (17%). Affected family members were diagnosed at a mean age of 30–39 years, and 22 of 34 experienced HCM-related adverse events (65%). Gene test-negative subjects with no prior family history of HCM (n = 46, 38%) reported an HCM diagnosis in only 2 of 64 first-degree relatives who were screened (3%, p < 0.001). These two individuals were diagnosed at age > 40 years without HCM-related adverse events. ConclusionHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous disorder, only half of which tracks with a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Negative genetic testing and family history indicates a more complex genetic basis corresponding to low risk for family members.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) family history intake — the table titled "Approach and suggested questions to elicit a complete family history for HCM". lists "Family history characteristic" and "Reasoning for additional clarification of family history", and provides example prompts across key relative types. For a "Healthy" first-degree relative of proband, prompts include "Do they have cardiac symptoms?" and "What tests were performed? ECG, ECHO, MRI, monitor, stress test?" and "What were the results?". For relatives with HCM, suggested prompts include "How was HCM diagnosed?" with follow-ups on arrhythmia history such as "Cardiac arrest, ICD, ICD discharges, atrial fibrillation, ablation?", imaging ("Were stress ECHO, MRI performed?"), treatments ("Medication, myectomy, ablation?"), and whether "Did they have genetic testing?". For relatives with heart attack (HA), questions include "What do you know about the HA?" with details on circumstances, treatments like "Surgery, stents, bypass, ICD, medications?", symptoms, and coronary risk factors. For relatives with sudden cardiac death or sudden unexplained death, prompts cover circumstances ("At rest, exertional, witness, CPR, AED used?"), prior cardiac history and therapies, and whether "Was an autopsy performed?". For relatives with heart failure (HF), prompts address cause ("Enlarged heart, dilated or hypertrophic, HCM/LVH, acquired?"), transplant history ("If yes, what age?"), coronary disease history, and risk factors. For relatives with enlarged heart/thick heart, prompts include "What part of the heart was enlarged? Dilated or thick?" and "Did the cardiologist recommend family screening?" with consideration of other causes such as "Competitive athlete, uncontrolled high blood pressure".

### Contemporary insights into the genetics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: toward a new era in clinical testing? [^112GaZJs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an established clinical technique, supported by 30 years of research into its genetic etiology. Although pathogenic variants are often detected in patients and used to identify at-risk relatives, the effectiveness of genetic testing has been hampered by ambiguous genetic associations (yielding uncertain and potentially false-positive results), difficulties in classifying variants, and uncertainty about genotype-negative patients. Recent case-control studies on rare variation, improved data sharing, and meta-analysis of case cohorts contributed to new insights into the genetic basis of HCM. In particular, although research into new genes and mechanisms remains essential, reassessment of Mendelian genetic associations in HCM argues that current clinical genetic testing should be limited to a small number of validated disease genes that yield informative and interpretable results. Accurate and consistent variant interpretation has benefited from new standardized variant interpretation guidelines and innovative approaches to improve classification. Most cases lacking a pathogenic variant are now believed to indicate non-Mendelian HCM, with more benign prognosis and minimal risk to relatives. Here, we discuss recent advances in the genetics of HCM and their application to clinical genetic testing together with practical issues regarding implementation. Although this review focuses on HCM, many of the issues discussed are also relevant to other inherited cardiac diseases.

### The uptake and utility of genetic testing and genetic counseling for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Qfog4]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2022). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — genetic testing and counseling background and clinical implications: HCM is described as an autosomal dominantly inherited condition affecting approximately 1/500 individuals, and genetic testing and genetic counseling have become a recommended and routine part of clinical care for individuals with HCM. Proband genetic testing enables cascade genetic testing of at-risk relatives, which can identify relatives who are negative for the familial variant and can, therefore, avoid serial cardiac screening; in the absence of a causative variant, serial cardiac screening is recommended for all first-degree relatives of an individual diagnosed with HCM. For this population, genetic testing and counseling are recommended for patients with HCM and their at-risk relatives, prior research on outcomes has been limited to small cohorts using diverse methodologies, and this systematic evidence review and meta-analysis summarizes the data, identifies inadequacies in the uptake of cascade screening by at-risk relatives, and notes that the uptake of genetic counseling is variable, but associated with high satisfaction and improved patient-reported outcomes.

Variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in HCM — family management and follow-up: Cascade genetic testing of at-risk relatives for a VUS is not recommended as the presence or absence of the VUS does not provide informative or actionable information, and these relatives need serial cardiology monitoring. Variant segregation testing of informative relatives, such as parents or other affected relatives, for the purposes of clarifying whether the variant is causal can be helpful, and testing other affected relatives for the presence of a VUS may show co-segregation with the condition or reveal non-segregation. Periodic review of family history is important and may help to inform variant classification, and clinical care teams should collaborate closely with laboratory colleagues to improve segregation analysis when care occurs across different laboratories and facilities.

### How hypertrophic cardiomyopathy became a contemporary treatable genetic disease with low mortality: shaped by 50 years of clinical research and practice [^111VEaAT]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common genetic heart disease encumbered throughout much of its almost 60-year history by a large measure of misunderstanding and the perception of a grim outcome without effective treatment options. However, it is now apparent that the majority of patients affected with HCM can achieve normal or near-normal life expectancy without disability, and usually do not require major treatment interventions. Nevertheless, for those patients with HCM who are at risk for (or experience) disease-related complications, a constellation of comprehensive nonpharmacologic management strategies have evolved over the last 15 years, altering the natural history and disease course for many, including implantable defibrillators, heart transplant, external defibrillation/therapeutic hypothermia, advances in surgical myectomy, and alcohol ablation. In particular, expanded contemporary risk stratification strategies have led to a more reliable selection of patients likely to achieve primary prevention of sudden death with implantable defibrillators. Most recently, large cohort studies using current management strategies and therapeutic measures have shown that it is now possible to achieve significantly improved survival with a low HCM-related mortality of 0.5% per year across all ages, and including children and young adults characteristically with the most aggressive disease course. These clinical management initiatives, instituted by the practicing cardiology community, have succeeded in preserving life and restoring an active lifestyle for thousands of patients with HCM, while providing many with a measure of reassurance and a reasonable expectation for an extended (if not normal) life span.

### What Do patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy die from? [^116gfXq7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) has become a contemporary and treatable genetic heart disease, now with disease-related mortality reduced to as low as 0.5% per year, based largely on more effective risk stratification and the use of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden death. This paradigm change in the natural history of HC has caused us to reconsider the overall mortality risk in this disease. We interrogated the databases of 2 HC referral centers, Minneapolis Heart Institute and Tufts Medical Center. Of 1,902 consecutive patients evaluated between 1992 and 2013, 1,653 patients (87%) have survived to the end of follow-up and 249 patients (13%) have died. Most deaths (178 of 249; 72%) were unrelated to HC, commonly because of cancer and predominantly in older patients. Non-HC mortality was significantly more common in adults presenting ≥ 60 years and least common in the youngest patients aged < 30 years (p < 0.001). Notably, deaths from non-HC causes substantially exceeded HC-related causes by 2.6-fold (p < 0.001). In conclusion, only about 25% of patients with HC ultimately died of their disease, including predominantly those who were < 30 years of age. These data allow patients with HC to develop a more realistic and reassured perception of their disease.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — genetic counseling, screening, and mutation burden are described as follows: Genetic counseling is important and "genetic screening of relatives is also important unless there are no living first- or second-degree relatives". Most disease is inherited, as "Most HCM is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in genes that encode sarcomere proteins or sarcomere-associated proteins", and "Presence of a pathogenic sarcomere protein gene mutation in patients with HCM identifies risk of LV dysfunction and adverse outcome irrespective of the myofilament involved". Mutation load may modify risk because "A single mutation in 1 of the 2 alleles (or copies) of a gene is sufficient to cause HCM; however, 5% of patients with HCM have ≥ 2 mutations in the same gene or different genes, which can be a marker for worse outcomes". Family screening is supported: "When genetic testing reveals a mutation in the index patient, ascertainment of genetic status in first- and second-degree relatives can be predictive of risk for developing HCM", and "Relatives with overt HCM will have the same pathogenic HCM mutation as the index patient".

### Family communication in a population at risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115iAtZe]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2015). Low credibility.

Encouraging family communication is an integral component of genetic counseling; therefore, we sought to identify factors impacting communication to family members at risk for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). Participants (N = 383) completed an online survey assessing: 1) demographics (gender, genetic test results, HCM family history, and disease severity); 2) illness representations; 3) family functioning and cohesiveness; 4) coping styles; 5) comprehension of HCM autosomal dominant inheritance; and 6) communication of HCM risk information to at-risk relatives. Participants were a national sample of individuals with HCM, recruited through the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Association. Data from 183 participants were analyzed using a logistic regression analysis, with family communication as a dichotomous dependent variable. We found that female gender and higher comprehension of autosomal dominant inheritance were significant predictors of participants' communication of HCM risk information to all their siblings and children. Our results suggest that utilizing interventions that promote patient comprehension (e.g., a teaching-focused model of genetic counseling) are important and may positively impact family communication within families with HCM.

### Narrative review: harnessing molecular genetics for the diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112YsfFC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Unexplained cardiac hypertrophy, the diagnostic criterion for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), occurs in 1 in 500 adults. Insights into the genetic cause and molecular pathophysiology of HCM are reshaping clinical paradigms for diagnosis and treatment of this common myocardial disorder. Human genetic studies have established that dominant mutations in the proteins that make up the contractile apparatus (the sarcomere) cause HCM. With the current availability of clinical gene-based diagnostics, pathogenic mutations in affected patients can be defined, which can suggest a clinical course and allow definitive preclinical identification of family members at risk for HCM. Genetic discoveries have also fostered mechanistic investigations in model organisms that are engineered to carry human HCM mutations. Novel therapeutic targets have emerged from these fundamental studies and are currently under clinical assessment in humans. The combination of contemporary gene-based diagnosis with new strategies to attenuate disease development and progression is changing the natural history of lifelong cardiac symptoms, arrhythmias, and heart failure from HCM.

Pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) diagnostic thresholds and screening context — Traditionally, a body surface area adjusted z-score of ≥ 2 standard deviations above the mean has been used, but this represents a significantly lower threshold than the 15-mm absolute value used in adults, and 15 mm represents a z-score of approximately 6 standard deviations above the mean in adults. We propose that the diagnosis of HCM in children should consider screening circumstances and pretest probability: a threshold of a z-score > 2.5 may be appropriate to identify early HCM in asymptomatic children with no family history, whereas for children with a definitive family history or a positive genetic test, a threshold of a z-score > 2 may suffice for early diagnosis. The emergence of genotype-positive/previously phenotype-negative status is recognized in young family members, and in the absence of increased wall thickness, such individuals should be considered at risk for subsequent development of, but not yet having, clinically evident HCM.

### Family screening in hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: identification of relatives with low yield from systematic Follow-up [^111RkHJA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited cardiac disease, and clinical and genetic family screening is recommended by guidelines.

Objectives

This study sought to investigate the diagnostic yield of screening relatives of HCM patients and identify predictive factors for HCM development during long-term follow-up in relatives from gene-elusive families.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of families screened at clinics for inherited cardiomyopathies in Eastern Denmark, from 2006 to 2023.

Results

We included 1,230 relatives (55% female; age: 42 ± 17 years) from 531 families. The combined clinical and genetic yield at baseline was 26% (n = 321). After 7 years (mean) of follow-up (6,762 person-years), 43 (4%) additional relatives developed HCM. The strongest predictors of developing HCM were carrying a likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant (HR: 4.58; 95% CI: 2.50–8.40; P < 0.001) and larger left ventricular maximum wall thickness (MWT) (HR: 2.21 per mm; 95% CI: 1.76–2.77 per mm; P < 0.001). In gene-elusive families, we found that an MWT of ≥ 10 mm represented the optimal classification threshold for developing HCM (area under the curve: 0.80), with only 2 (0.4%) relatives from gene-elusive families with an MWT of < 10 mm developing HCM during follow-up.

Conclusions

In HCM, the diagnostic yield of a single screening visit was 1 in 4, and the additional yield during 7 years of follow-up was 4%. Gene carriers and relatives from gene-elusive families with a baseline MWT of ≥ 10 mm were at the highest risk of developing HCM during follow-up. These findings may inform future recommendations on the management of relatives of HCM patients.

### Progress with genetic cardiomyopathies: screening, counseling, and testing in dilated, hypertrophic, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia / cardiomyopathy [^1168fvUr]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

This review focuses on the genetic cardiomyopathies: principally dilated cardiomyopathy, with salient features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, regarding genetic etiology, genetic testing, and genetic counseling. Enormous progress has recently been made in identifying genetic causes for each cardiomyopathy, and key phenotype and genotype information is reviewed. Clinical genetic testing is rapidly emerging with a principal rationale of identifying at-risk asymptomatic or disease-free relatives. Knowledge of a disease-causing mutation can guide clinical surveillance for disease onset, thereby enhancing preventive and treatment interventions. Genetic counseling is also indicated for patients and their family members regarding the symptoms of their cardiomyopathy, its inheritance pattern, family screening recommendations, and genetic testing options and possible results.

### Use of genetics in the clinical evaluation of cardiomyopathy [^115TRRrf]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Inherited forms of cardiomyopathy are frequently responsible for heart failure that is otherwise unexplained. Evaluation of familial cardiomyopathy should include not only the individual patient, but also the pattern of inheritance within the family and assessment for the presence of syndromic features. The last 10 years have seen remarkable advances in genetics. Improvements in technology have lowered costs, such that clinical use of genetic testing is rapidly expanding. Genetic counseling about the potential risks and benefits of such testing is an important part of the care of individuals and families with inherited heart disease. Among inherited types of cardiomyopathy, the likelihood of finding a responsible gene mutation varies. Both hypertrophic and right ventricular forms of cardiomyopathy have a relatively high likelihood of finding a responsible gene mutation when testing is properly applied. Because of prominent genetic heterogeneity in familial dilated cardiomyopathy, recognition of pathogenic mutations is more challenging. With or without genetic testing, screening of family members who are at risk for an inherited form of cardiomyopathy leads to earlier identification, earlier treatment, and improved outcomes.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a new mutation illustrates the need for family-centered care [^114b2u1n]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

This is a case series of a family positive for a previously undescribed mutation in the myofilament gene MYH7, causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a potentially lethal cardiac disease with strong hereditability. The family's significant disease became strikingly apparent with the unanticipated diagnosis of their newborn infant shortly after her birth. This led to the discovery of the MYH7 mutation in the infant, as well as her father and two siblings, all of whom had varying degrees of disease severity. Despite prior diagnosis of HCM for the paternal grandmother and great uncles, this family's situation points to the need for continued education of healthcare providers, when heritable diseases are encountered. Genetics consult should occur early and has been shown to be helpful in making an accurate diagnosis and identifying relatives at risk of developing the condition. It may, as in this case series, lead to the discovery of a novel mutation and contribute to the growing genetic database for familial HCM.

### Role of family history of sudden death in risk stratification and prevention of sudden death with implantable defibrillators in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114GqdEj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The selection of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) for the primary prevention of sudden death (SD) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) has been determined by the assessment of 5 risk factors. We examined one of these markers, the family history of HC-related SD in first-degree relatives, for which few data are available. The rate of appropriate ICD interventions was assessed in 177 consecutive patients with HC (63% men, age 45 ± 14 years) who had undergone prophylactic implantation at 2 tertiary centers, according to the identification of ≥ 1 risk markers. During a follow-up period of 4.6 ± 3 years, 25 patients (14%) had experienced appropriate ICD interventions for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. The patients with a risk profile that included a family history of SD experienced interventions at a similar rate (3.7/100 person-years) as the patients without a family history of SD (3.1/100 person-years, p = 0.2). The rate and frequency of appropriate ICD interventions in 42 patients who had undergone implantation solely because of a family history of SD was 2.2/100 person-years (4/42, 10%), similar to that for patients with one risk factor other than SD family history (3.4%/100 person-years; 7/50, 14%; p = 0.2) and patients with multiple risk factors with (4.5/100 person-years; 9/49, 18%) and without (3.5/100 person-years; 5/36, 14%) a family history of SD (p = 0.8). In conclusion, a family history of SD is an important risk marker in patients with HC. Patients receiving ICDs for primary prevention because of a family history of HC-related SD, whether as an isolated risk factor or combined with other markers, experienced rates of appropriate ICD discharge comparable to that of other patient subsets with increased risk.

### Mortality risk of untreated myosin-binding protein C-related hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: insight into the natural history [^112cSGXM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to assess the mortality of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), partly in times when the disease was not elucidated and patients were untreated.

Background

HCM is feared for the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Insight in the natural history of the disorder is needed to design proper screening strategies for families with HCM.

Methods

In 6 large, 200-year multigenerational pedigrees (identified by using genealogical searches) and in 140 small (contemporary) pedigrees (first-degree relatives of the proband) with HCM caused by a truncating mutation in the myosin-binding protein C gene (n = 1,118), we determined all-cause mortality using the family tree mortality ratio method. The study's main outcome measure was the standardized mortality ratio (SMR).

Results

In the large pedigrees, overall mortality was not increased (SMR 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72 to 1.03]), but significant excess mortality occurred between 10 and 19 years (SMR 2.7 [95% CI: 1.2 to 5.2]). In the small families, the SMR was increased (SMR 1.5 [95% CI: 1.3 to 1.6]) and excess mortality was observed between 10 and 39 years (SMR 3.2 [95% CI: 2.3 to 4.3]) and 50 and 59 years (SMR 1.9 [95% CI: 1.4 to 2.5]).

Conclusions

We identified specific age categories with increased mortality risks in HCM families. The small, referred pedigrees had higher mortality risks than the large 200-year multigenerational pedigrees. Our findings support the strategy of starting cardiological and genetic screening in the first-degree relatives of a proband from 10 years onward and including persons in the screening at least until the age of 60 years. Screening of more distant relatives is probably most efficient between 10 and 19 years.

American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) family screening — electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram intervals: Serial screening to include ECG and echocardiogram is organized by proband genotype and age. For genotype positive, genotype unknown, genotype VUS (compelling), or early-onset family history: children 0–20 years are screened at time of proband diagnosis regardless of age of onset in the affected relative and repeat every 1–2 years, while adults > 20 years are screened every 3–5 years. For genotype negative: children are screened at any age regardless of the age of onset in the affected relative, but no later than puberty and repeat every 2–3 years; adults > 20 years are screened every 3–5 years, with no recommended age at which screening can be discontinued. All first-degree relatives should have baseline cardiology screening; relatives of probands with no genetic testing or a VUS and those with family history of early-onset disease should be seen for routine and periodic screening, whereas relatives of genotype negative probands may delay and space out the screening interval.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) genetics — proband-first testing, cascade testing, and family clinical screening are outlined as follows: Genetic testing for HCM is first performed in an individual in the family with clear phenotype evidence of HCM, usually the proband (index case). If a definitely pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is identified, then cascade genetic testing at at-risk relatives can be offered. Cascade testing involves targeted testing of first-degree relatives for the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant found in the proband. When cascade testing is performed in an at-risk relative, those who are found not to carry the disease-causing gene variant can be released from further (lifelong) clinical surveillance, whereas those who are found to carry the disease-causing gene variant should undergo clinical screening at regular intervals. Family members of a patient where genetic testing is not done or is negative also require clinical screening at regular intervals because there is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity in age of onset and disease progression within members of the same family. Genetic testing in a phenotype-negative relative without a known genetic diagnosis in the proband has a very low yield of identifying a genetic cause of HCM, and a negative test in this situation will not change recommendations for ongoing clinical screening.

Central illustration recommendations for genetic counseling and testing in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) state that HCM management guided by genetic counseling and testing supports "Accurate diagnosis", "Disease-specific therapies", "Disease severity prognosis", "Assisted reproduction with preimplantation genetic diagnosis", and "Future HCM therapies including gene therapy". Under "RECOMMENDATION 1 Offer genetic counseling and testing", priorities include diagnosis, identifying phenocopies, evaluating family history, and identifying the most appropriate person for testing. "RECOMMENDATION 2 Genetic counseling informs appropriate test selection and interpretation" specifies phenotype-focused gene panel selection; considering exome or genome sequencing for "significant clinical presentation" or "Strong family history and negative phenotype focused genetic testing"; and using variant type, location, and frequency to inform classification. "RECOMMENDATION 3 Offer genetic counseling and testing" emphasizes cardiac screening and targeted genetic screening after counseling, including gene-specific risks, insurance and employment implications related to asymptomatic testing, and prognostic implications such as that "Disease causing variants correlate with more severe disease and higher penetrance".

### HRS / EHRA expert consensus statement on the state of genetic testing for the channelopathies and cardiomyopathies this document was developed as a partnership between the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) [^116AJPbL]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) prognostic implications of genetic testing — knowledge of the underlying gene and mutation has a limited role in risk assessment and management of the individual patient, which instead is based largely on clinical risk factors. Validated clinical risk factors include a family history of SCD, and patients with features of HCM but without pathogenic sarcomere mutations have a lower likelihood of a positive family history and, on average, a milder phenotype; thus, a negative genetic test may be of prognostic significance. There are only a few specific mutations that might carry a prognostic implication, and ordinarily a genetic test result in isolation will not constitute an indication for an ICD for primary prevention, and long-term efforts are needed to accumulate reliable evidence on genotype–phenotype correlations, especially those pertaining to specific mutations.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — hypertrophy, family history, and syncope as sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk features: Studies describe an independent relationship between hypertrophy and SCD when hypertrophy is ≥ 30 mm, with risk increasing in a linear manner and carrying more prognostic significance in younger patients; a young adult with hypertrophy that approaches 30 mm may have similar or greater SCD risk than an older patient with maximal wall thickness ≥ 30 mm. Patients are at increased SCD risk if a first‑degree relative experienced SCD presumably caused by HCM, and family history appears to be an independent predictor though supporting studies are small and observational. Unexplained or non–neurally mediated syncope was associated with SCD risk only when it occurred within the past 6 months.

### Aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with low-risk factors for SCD [^114ztktC]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Remarkable advancements have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), since the first implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was placed in a human, more than 25 years ago to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD). ICD has become the cornerstone in the management of HCM, with an ability to change the natural course of this complex disease. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines have been charted out to help risk stratify asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic adults with HCM, in order to prevent SCD in such individuals. Our patient with left ventricular outflow tract gradient < 30 mm Hg, left ventricular wall thickness < 30 mm, negative medical history of syncope and no family history of SCD, would have been at low risk for SCD.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) family screening — recommendation and uptake: Family screening is recommended for first-degree relatives of patients with HCM regardless of age and proband genotype. Failure to identify a causal variant after genetic testing in the proband does not rule out a genetic cause, and due to current knowledge gaps serial monitoring is recommended for first-degree relatives in the absence of informative genetic testing in the proband. Despite recommendations for serial screening, the average uptake is 69% and is significantly influenced by proband positive genotype.

### Diagnostic validity and clinical utility of genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qnG46]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study summarises the diagnostic validity and clinical utility of genetic testing for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and their at-risk relatives.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Library databases from inception through 2 March 2020. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were prespecified for individual sarcomere genes, presence/absence of pathogenic variants, paediatric and adult cohorts, family history, inclusion of probands, and variant classification method. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool.

Results

A total of 132 articles met inclusion criteria. The detection rate based on pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants was significantly higher in paediatric cohorts compared with adults (56% vs 42%; p = 0.01) and in adults with a family history compared with sporadic cases (59% vs 33%; p = 0.005). When studies applied current, improved, variant interpretation standards, the adult detection rate significantly decreased from 42% to 33% (p = 0.0001) because less variants met criteria to be considered pathogenic. The mean difference in age-of-onset in adults was significantly earlier for genotype-positive versus genotype-negative cohorts (8.3 years; p < 0.0001), MYH7 versus MYBPC3 cohorts (8.2 years; p < 0.0001) and individuals with multiple versus single variants (7.0 years; p < 0.0002). Overall, disease penetrance in adult cohorts was 62%, but differed significantly depending on if probands were included or excluded (73% vs 55%; p = 0.003).

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first, to our knowledge, to collectively quantify historical understandings of detection rate, genotype-phenotype associations and disease penetrance for HCM, while providing the answers to important routine clinical questions and highlighting key areas for future study.

### New perspectives on the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1137NtqM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important genetic heart muscle disease for which prevalence in the general population has not been completely resolved. For the past 20 years, most data have supported the occurrence of HCM at about 1 in 500. However, the authors have interrogated a number of relevant advances in cardiovascular medicine, including widespread fee-for-service genetic testing, population genetic studies, and contemporary diagnostic imaging, as well as a greater index of suspicion and recognition for both the clinically expressed disease and the gene-positive-phenotype-negative subset (at risk for developing the disease). Accounting for the potential impact of these initiatives on disease occurrence, the authors have revisited the prevalence of HCM in the general population. They suggest that HCM is more common than previously estimated, which may enhance its recognition in the practicing cardiovascular community, allowing more timely diagnosis and the implementation of appropriate treatment options for many patients.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with longevity to 90 years or older [^1143pYuX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is the most common cause of sudden death in the young, but survival to particularly advanced age is less well appreciated. The investigators report the prevalence, clinical features, and demographics of patients with HC surviving to ≥ 90 years of age. Of 1,297 patients with HC in the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center database (Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation), 26 (2.0%) were identified who had achieved the age of ≥ 90 years; 18 (69%) were women. HC diagnosis came late in life, at 61 to 92 years (mean 80 ± 8; ≥ 75 years in 21 patients), recognized fortuitously by the detection of a heart murmur or during family screening (n = 6) or after onset of new symptoms (n = 20). At most recent evaluation (or death) patients were aged 90 to 96.7 years (mean 92.2 ± 2), with 6 presently alive at 91 to 96 years of age; HC did not appear to be the primary cause of death in any patient. Left ventricular wall thicknesses were 15 to 31 mm (mean 20 ± 3); 8 patients (31%) had obstruction to left ventricular outflow at rest (peak instantaneous gradients, 38 to 135 mm Hg). Significant HC-related complications occurred in 13 patients (50%), including progressive heart failure symptoms, atrial fibrillation, and nonfatal embolic stroke. Although no patient died suddenly, 13 (50%) nevertheless carried conventional HC risk markers. A greater proportion of cohort patients reached ≥ 90 years of age (2.0%) than expected in the general population (0.8%) (p < 0.001). In conclusion, HC may be unrecognized until late in life and is consistent with survival to particularly advanced age into the 10th decade of life without the need for major HC-related treatment interventions, and with demise ultimately largely unrelated to this disease. This principle regarding the natural history of HC can afford a measure of reassurance to many patients.

Assessing clinical phenotype for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) genetic evaluation — An individual's clinical phenotype includes both their clinical cardiac diagnosis and family history. The clinical cardiac diagnosis of HCM or unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) should be confirmed by review of medical records with documentation of hypertrophy by imaging, myocardial scar by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and any left ventricle outflow obstruction, while considering other causes of hypertrophy such as pressure overload or infiltrative/storage disorders. Family history informs genetic test selection, pre-test probability, result interpretation, and family screening, and although it may be collected before genetic testing it can also be gathered after proband testing. When initiating genetic testing for HCM, it remains most informative to test the most severely affected person in the family, and in some situations the most informative individual may be deceased and options for post-mortem genetic testing should be explored.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to follow-up, clinical surveillance, ACC/AHA/AMSSM/HRS/PACES/SCMR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a comprehensive, systematic noninvasive SCD risk assessment every 1–2 years, including evaluation of the following risk factors, in adult patients with HCM:

- personal history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmia

- personal history of syncope suspected by clinical history to be arrhythmic

- family history in a close relative of premature HCM-related sudden death, cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular arrhythmia

- maximal LV wall thickness, ejection fraction, LV apical aneurysm

- nonsustained VT episodes on continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — genetic counseling and family screening: Genetic counseling is important and genetic screening of relatives is important unless there are no living first- or second-degree relatives. Most HCM is autosomal dominant due to sarcomere/sarcomere‑associated gene mutations, and a pathogenic sarcomere mutation identifies risk of LV dysfunction and adverse outcome. A single mutation in 1 of the 2 alleles is sufficient to cause HCM, but 5% of patients with HCM have ≥ 2 mutations, which can mark worse outcomes. When a mutation is found in the index patient, determining genetic status in first‑ and second‑degree relatives can be predictive of risk, and relatives with overt HCM will have the same pathogenic mutation as the index patient.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) family evaluation — careful family history, counseling about genetic transmission, and genetic testing are cornerstones of care; screening first-degree relatives can begin at any age using genetic testing, serial imaging, or electrocardiographic surveillance, and because recommendations hinge on variant pathogenicity, reported pathogenicity should be reconfirmed every 2 to 3 years with input from specialized HCM genetics expertise.

Genotype-positive, phenotype-negative hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — sports risk and monitoring indicate that sudden death in genotype-positive, phenotype-negative individuals is rare, and currently, no accurate risk prediction models for SCD in genotype-positive, phenotype-negative individuals are available. In a recent prospective registry, no arrhythmic events were observed in genotype-positive, phenotype-negative individuals (total of 126), including those exercising vigorously or participating in competitive athletics. Decisions about participation in competitive sports are usually made jointly with the patient and family taking into consideration family history of SCD, type of sports activity, and patient and family risk tolerance, and because of the low risk of sudden death, phenotype-negative individuals are not restricted from competitive sports and are not routinely monitored with ambulatory electrocardiography and exercise stress testing unless the family history indicates a high risk.

### Evaluation of polygenic scores for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the general population and across clinical settings [^115TWMbd]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, with pathogenic variants found in about a third of cases. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) demonstrate that common genetic variation contributes to HCM risk. Here we derive polygenic scores (PGS) from HCM GWAS and genetically correlated traits and test their performance in the UK Biobank, 100,000 Genomes Project, and clinical cohorts. We show that higher PGS significantly increases the risk of HCM in the general population, particularly among pathogenic variant carriers, where HCM penetrance differs 10-fold between those in the highest and lowest PGS quintiles. Among relatives of HCM probands, PGS stratifies risks of developing HCM and adverse outcomes. Finally, among HCM cases, PGS strongly predicts the risk of adverse outcomes and death. These findings support the broad utility of PGS across clinical settings, enabling tailored screening and surveillance and stratification of risk of adverse outcomes.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — screening of genotype-positive, phenotype-negative family members emphasizes early and continued evaluation across the lifespan. The ongoing screening of genotype-positive, phenotype-negative family members of all ages is important, and clinical HCM can develop in younger family members with 5% to 10% phenotype-positive at first screening and another 3% to 5% before 18 years of age; continued screening into adulthood is warranted, although frequency can be lowered in individuals who are > 18 years of age, and most physicians continue clinical screening until midlife (approximately 50 years of age).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) clinical interpretation — "clinical interpretation is the process of assessing variant pathogenicity in the context of the specific patient scenario", and "the clinical team should consider the laboratory classification, correlation of the gene to the clinical phenotype of the patient, and the family history and inheritance pattern". This step is "necessary when testing via a comprehensive multigene panel" that may include genes "with limited evidence", and for variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) "careful consideration is needed before acting clinically", because a variant may correlate clinically but "does not automatically meet the same prediction thresholds for clinical action", and "additional studies may be warranted to clarify causality". When suspicion remains, "testing of additional relatives may be informative", including cases where a variant is "de novo" or "tracks with the cardiac phenotype", and "working with a team experienced in cardiomyopathy genetics, including cardiac GCs, is essential", especially for VUS decisions.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — genotype-positive, phenotype-negative individuals need ongoing cardiac surveillance and generally have low risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD); treatment decisions are usually not based on subclinical findings alone, and participation in sports is generally permitted without routine ambulatory monitoring unless family history suggests high risk. Genotype-positive, phenotype-negative individuals are those who carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic HCM-causing variant but are asymptomatic without evidence of LVH on cardiac imaging, they need ongoing cardiac surveillance, and the clinical significance of subclinical abnormalities is unclear so treatment decisions are usually not made based on these findings alone. Sudden death is rare, no accurate SCD risk prediction models currently exist, and in a prospective registry no arrhythmic events were observed among genotype-positive, phenotype-negative individuals (total of 126), including those exercising vigorously or in competitive athletics. Because of the low risk of sudden death, these individuals are not restricted from competitive sports and are not routinely monitored with ambulatory electrocardiography and exercise stress testing unless the family history indicates a high risk for SCD or as part of precompetitive athletic screening, and such screening is appropriate every 1 to 2 years. ICDs are not offered for primary prevention and preemptive medical therapy is not offered; in a small pilot randomized trial, preemptive diltiazem was associated with a small improvement in LV diastolic function and thickness:dimension ratio on 3-year follow-up, but the trial was not powered to detect effects on clinical outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, ACC/AHA/AMSSM/HRS/PACES/SCMR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a comprehensive, systematic noninvasive SCD risk assessment at initial evaluation and every 1–2 years thereafter, including evaluation of the following risk factors, in pediatric and adolescent patients with HCM:

- personal history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmia

- personal history of syncope suspected by clinical history to be arrhythmic

- family history in a close relative of premature HCM-related sudden death, cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular arrhythmia

- maximal LV wall thickness, ejection fraction, LV apical aneurysm

- nonsustained VT episodes on continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring.

### Clinical care of family members of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [^115MtBC2]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetic family screening following the detection of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a proband with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains one of the main applications of genetic testing. While cardiac screening is recommended for all first-degree relatives, the a priori risk among family members varies. Consequently, screening regimens should be tailored according to both genetic and clinical information at the individual and familial level. This clinical consensus statement provides tools to help with the risk assessment and follow-up of screening for family members and discusses the utility for integration of genotype-specific information, cardiac imaging, and electrocardiogram findings to personalize cardiac screening regimens, which in conjunction will likely improve individualized risk prediction. Early phenotypic detection of DCM in family members remains an active area of research and innovation. In addition, data are starting to accrue on the utility of early therapeutic intervention in family members with very mild phenotypes that may inform future management in addition to screening. A systematic strategy is proposed to determine the a priori risk of developing DCM for a family member, and the potential of integrating genotype-phenotype knowledge towards family management. Lastly, there is a focus on the current knowledge gaps and ongoing and future opportunities to improve risk prediction, early disease detection, and treatment of family members of patients with DCM.

### Proposal for contemporary screening strategies in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114Dyhvi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Screening families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) presents a common clinical problem to practicing cardiologists, internists, and pediatricians. The traditional recommended strategy for screening relatives in most HCM families calls for such evaluations with echocardiography (and electrocardiogram [ECG]) on a 12- to 18-month basis, usually beginning at about age 12 years. If such tests show no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, i.e., without one or more segments of abnormally increased wall thickness by the time full growth and maturation is achieved (at the age of about 18 to 21 years), it has been customary practice to conclude that HCM is probably absent and reassure family members accordingly that further echocardiographic testing is unnecessary. However, novel developments in the definition of the genetic causes of HCM have defined both substantial molecular diversity and heterogeneity of the disease expression including (in some relatives) incomplete phenotypic penetrance and delayed, late-onset left ventricular hypertrophy well into adulthood. These observations have unavoidably reshaped the customary practice of genetic counseling and established a new proposed paradigm for clinical family screening of HCM families. Therefore, in the absence of genetic testing, strong consideration should be given to extending diagnostic serial echocardiography past adolescence and into mid-life for those family members with a normal echocardiogram and ECG. Of note, recent developments in laboratory DNA-based diagnosis for HCM could potentially avoid the necessity for serial echocardiography in many such relatives.

### Genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^1144BqHA]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide updated guidance for the genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy and for an approach to manage secondary findings from cardiomyopathy genes. The genetic bases of the primary cardiomyopathies (dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, and restrictive) have been established, and each is medically actionable; in most cases established treatments or interventions are available to improve survival, reduce morbidity, and enhance quality of life.

Methods

A writing group of cardiologists and genetics professionals updated guidance, first published in 2009 for the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), in a collaboration with the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). Each recommendation was assigned to teams of individuals by expertise, literature was reviewed, and recommendations were decided by consensus of the writing group. Recommendations for family history, phenotype screening of at-risk family members, referral to expert centers as needed, genetic counseling, and cardiovascular therapies, informed in part by phenotype, are presented in the HFSA document.

Results

A genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy is indicated with a cardiomyopathy diagnosis, which includes genetic testing. Guidance is also provided for clinical approaches to secondary findings from cardiomyopathy genes. This is relevant as cardiomyopathy is the phenotype associated with 27% of the genes on the ACMG list for return of secondary findings. Recommendations herein are considered expert opinion per current ACMG policy as no systematic approach to literature review was conducted.

Conclusion

Genetic testing is indicated for cardiomyopathy to assist in patient care and management of at-risk family members.

### Genetic variation and risk of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy… [^114hL7tU]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

A polygenic score was strongly associated with HCM, with concordant results in the Mass General Brigham Biobank. Genetic factors enhanced clinical risk prediction for HCM: addition of rare variant carrier status and the polygenic score to clinical risk factors improved the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve from 0. 71 to 0.
82. Analyses were conducted in the UK Biobank and the Mass General Brigham Biobank. In aggregate, the presence of any HCM-Panel variant was associated with 10. 18-fold increased odds of HCM. Specifically, presence of an HCM-ACMG variant was associated with 55. 04-fold increased odds of HCM.

In epidemiological analyses, baseline obesity, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease were associated with incident HCM. We then compared the relative contributions of rare variant carrier status, PRS, and the abovementioned clinical risk factors to risk for HCM. The single strongest risk factor for HCM was harboring an HCM-ACMG rare variant, which conferred a 49. 9-fold increase in risk of incident HCM; this was. We also highlight several clinical factors that are associated with incident HCM, including well-established risk factors like obesity and hypertension, but also less-established predictors such as atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia affecting patients with HCM.

30 Shared biological processes between the 2 conditions may yield an observational association between HCM and both antecedent and subsequent atrial fibrillation. However, the observed link between coronary artery disease and incident HCM is not well established and requires further study.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy… [^1122wZQf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

As part of the hypertrophy process, the normal pattern of muscle cells is upset and can lead to problems with electrical function of the heart, resulting in arrhythmias. The first case of HCM was diagnosed 50 years ago. It has since been found to affect 0. 2% to
0. 5% of the general population and appears in all racial groups. It is the most common cause of sudden death in young people, including trained athletes, and causes heart failure disability at any age. This disorder is different from left ventricular hypertrophy, which is usually caused by undertreated hypertension. The October 21, 2009, issue of JAMA includes an article about HCM transmitted by sperm donation. Cause Transmisison of HCM is genetic. HCM is transmitted to 50% of individuals in each subsequent generation. It is due to a mutation in at least 1 of 11 genes coding for sarcomere protein. In persons without a family history of HCM, the most common cause is a new mutation.

The most common test is 2-dimensional echocardiography, although magnetic resonance imaging is becoming more widely used. Genetic testing using a blood test is the most sensitive diagnostic test. Other tests used in evaluating HCM include electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Treatment Once HCM is identified in a person, all immediate family members should be tested as soon as possible. Medications such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are the primary way to control symptoms. Other possible treatments include septal myectomy, alcohol septal ablation, pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and heart transplantation. Diuretics should be avoided.

Prognosis HCM can cause sudden death even in children and young adults, often during or just after vigorous exertion. However, others with HCM have no symptoms and live a normal lifespan. Remarkably, the first patient identified with HCM is still alive. He received a heart transplant in 1989.
