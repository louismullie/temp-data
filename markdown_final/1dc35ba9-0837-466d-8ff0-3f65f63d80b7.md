## Question

The physiology of urinary concentrating mechanism in the kidney and its clinical significance.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the physiology of the kidney's urinary concentrating mechanism and its clinical significance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching countercurrent systems and the medullary osmotic gradient. Then, I should verify the specific roles of the loop of Henle, urea recycling, and the collecting duct. Next, I will examine hormonal regulation, especially vasopressin and AQP2 trafficking. After that, I need to consider modulatory pathways like the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, prostaglandins, and potassium signaling. Finally, I will connect these mechanisms to clinical disorders, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and I should double-check areas of uncertainty such as inner medullary passive models and biomarker interpretation before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: the kidney concentrates urine by generating and maintaining a corticomedullary osmotic gradient via countercurrent multiplication and countercurrent exchange, with the thick ascending limb actively exporting NaCl while remaining water impermeable, thereby creating a single effect that multiplies along the loop and vasa recta to build a hyperosmotic medulla [^117Q67fB] [^116BRByo].

> Wait, let me verify the outer versus inner medulla distinction because I initially thought the inner medulla relied on active NaCl transport as well. That would be incorrect, as the inner medulla lacks thick ascending limbs and instead uses a passive mechanism driven by urea recycling and countercurrent flows, though the exact model remains debated and current mathematical models still struggle to predict maximal urine osmolality, which underscores an unresolved aspect of the inner medullary concentrating process [^117Q67fB] [^112YNcoH].

> I will now examine the loop of Henle's role more closely: the thick ascending limb reabsorbs NaCl via NKCC2, generating a lumen-positive potential that drives paracellular reabsorption of cations, while the descending thin limb is water permeable but not solute permeable, and the ascending thin limb is water impermeable with low solute permeability, features that preserve the gradient and enable countercurrent multiplication. NKCC2 trafficking and phosphorylation are dynamically regulated and essential for this function [^116BRByo] [^115jkajK].

> Hold on, I should verify urea's contribution because it is easy to underappreciate: urea is recycled between the inner medullary collecting duct and the loop, augmenting the inner medullary gradient and contributing to maximal concentrating ability. Importantly, urea delivery to the distal nephron also modulates flow and can influence potassium excretion, which has practical implications for interpreting kaliuresis in clinical settings [^112YNcoH] [^1179ki6f].

> Next, I should review the collecting duct, where final urine concentration occurs: principal cells express AQP2, which is trafficked to the apical membrane in response to vasopressin via cAMP signaling, increasing water permeability and allowing water to exit the lumen along the medullary osmotic gradient. AQP2 undergoes regulated phosphorylation, ubiquitination, endocytosis, and recycling, and its abundance at the membrane determines the magnitude of water reabsorption [^113Ls6zu] [^114nW9yw] [^117QTvbc].

> Let me consider hormonal regulation carefully: vasopressin secretion is governed by osmotic, baroreceptor, and volume sensors, and upon binding V2 receptors it activates adenylate cyclase, increases cAMP, and induces AQP2 insertion. Vasopressin also enhances sodium reabsorption via ENaC in the distal nephron, which helps sustain the axial gradient needed for maximal water reabsorption, and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, including AT1 receptors in the collecting duct, modulates AQP2 abundance and concentrating capacity, while aldosterone further augments ENaC-mediated sodium reabsorption [^113Ls6zu] [^113U8Pq8] [^113tUZmF].

> I need to check modulatory pathways that can fine-tune or oppose vasopressin: prostaglandin E2 has complex, receptor-specific effects, with EP3 generally inhibiting water reabsorption and EP2/EP4 potentially enhancing it, and COX-2 inhibition can blunt PGE2 and paradoxically impair concentrating ability in some contexts. GSK3 also regulates AQP2 trafficking and vasopressin signaling, and potassium loading acutely activates an mTORC2–SGK1–Nedd4–2 axis that stimulates ENaC and can influence sodium and water handling, illustrating how diet and signaling crosstalk modulate concentration [^1138rZ7T] [^115ns9RL] [^115GQgZ6].

> But wait, what if vasopressin is absent or ineffective; can the kidney still concentrate urine to some degree? In vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats, dehydration increases NKCC2 expression and enhances countercurrent multiplication, producing a modest increase in urine osmolality even without AVP, supporting an AVP-independent component of concentrating ability that likely reflects transporter plasticity and medullary solute accumulation [^113yEG31].

> Next, I should review clinical disorders of impaired concentration: nephrogenic diabetes insipidus arises from AVPR2 or AQP2 mutations or acquired causes like lithium, producing polyuria with dilute urine. Chronic kidney disease, including ADPKD, reduces maximal urine osmolality even at comparable CKD stages, likely due to reduced AQP2/ENaC responses and structural injury. Dysnatremias reflect impaired dilution and concentration with CKD progression, and loop diuretics that inhibit NKCC2 blunt countercurrent multiplication and can precipitate concentrating defects [^113Ls6zu] [^1143YMJ9] [^113YC3Q1] [^117NSYqE] [^1168XssL].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic implications: water deprivation testing with desmopressin response distinguishes central from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and measuring urine osmolality, AQP2/ENaC excretion, and vasopressin/copeptin can help characterize the defect. In CKD, reduced maximal urine osmolality tracks with disease severity and can guide fluid and sodium counseling, while tubular secretion markers and novel biomarkers such as EGF, KIM-1, MCP-1, and α-1 microglobulin inform tubule health and prognosis, though they must be interpreted in clinical context and not in isolation [^113Ls6zu] [^1143YMJ9] [^113oS3c8] [^114vhWMB] [^1125mN4N].

> I should double-check therapeutic levers: for central DI, desmopressin restores AQP2-mediated water reabsorption. For nephrogenic DI, strategies include removing offending agents, using thiazides to induce mild volume contraction and paradoxically reduce polyuria, and employing prostaglandin synthase inhibitors in selected cases. In hyponatremia from SIADH or heart failure/cirrhosis, vasopressin V2 antagonists like tolvaptan produce aquaresis and raise serum sodium. In ADPKD, tolvaptan slows cyst growth and disease progression via cAMP reduction. Loop diuretics target NKCC2 to treat edema but can worsen concentrating ability, and SGLT2 inhibitors create osmotic diuresis and modulate proximal reabsorption with cardio-renal benefits distinct from effects on maximal concentrating capacity [^113Ls6zu] [^113woLhx] [^111PjRuv] [^1168XssL] [^1139Z5Zy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that SGLT2 inhibitors directly improve maximal urine concentrating capacity. Let me reconsider and correct that: SGLT2 inhibitors lower intraglomerular pressure and albuminuria and induce osmotic diuresis, but they do not enhance the countercurrent mechanism or maximal osmolality per se, so I should not attribute a direct concentrating effect to them even though their clinical benefits are substantial [^1139Z5Zy].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and evolving concepts: the inner medullary passive concentrating model remains incompletely resolved, with current models failing to predict maximal concentrating ability. Urea's role extends beyond osmotics to modulate tubular flow and potassium excretion. And emerging biomarkers and genetic insights, including uromodulin's regulation of NKCC2 and the ADME genetics of urinary metabolites, are refining our mechanistic and clinical understanding of concentrating defects and their consequences [^117Q67fB] [^1179ki6f] [^111Gn7fB] [^115Fuvsq].

The kidney concentrates urine through a **countercurrent multiplier** in the loop of Henle [^116BRByo], generating a medullary osmotic gradient, and **aquaporin-2 water channels** in the collecting duct [^114nW9yw] that are regulated by vasopressin [^113Ls6zu]. This system maintains water balance and plasma osmolality; defects cause polyuria, dehydration, and electrolyte disorders [^113Ls6zu]. Clinically, impaired concentration signals CKD progression [^117NSYqE], guides fluid/electrolyte management, and informs therapy with vasopressin analogs, loop diuretics, or V2 antagonists [^113woLhx].

## Physiological mechanisms of urinary concentration

### Countercurrent multiplication in the loop of Henle

- **Thick ascending limb**: actively reabsorbs NaCl via NKCC2 [^115jkajK], creating a single effect and a corticomedullary gradient [^117Q67fB].
- **Descending limb**: water-permeable, allowing water exit and raising tubular osmolality [^notfound].
- **Ascending limb**: water-impermeable, preserving the gradient by exporting solute without water [^117Q67fB].
- **Urea recycling**: augments the inner medullary gradient and maximal concentrating ability [^112YNcoH].

---

### Role of aquaporin-2 water channels

- **Vasopressin regulation**: AVP binds V2 receptors, increases cAMP, and inserts AQP2 into collecting duct apical membranes [^113Ls6zu], enabling water reabsorption [^114nW9yw].
- **Phosphorylation**: PKA phosphorylation at Ser256 is required for AQP2 trafficking and function [^notfound].
- **Internalization**: AQP2 is retrieved via endocytosis when AVP falls, reducing water permeability [^114nW9yw].

---

### Medullary blood flow and vasa recta

The **vasa recta** form a countercurrent exchanger that preserves the medullary gradient by minimizing solute washout, while **medullary blood flow** is precisely regulated to balance oxygen delivery and gradient maintenance [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of urinary concentration

### Diagnostic implications

- **Impaired concentration**: early sign of CKD progression and tubulointerstitial injury [^113YC3Q1] [^111Gn7fB].
- **Water deprivation tests**: differentiate central from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^notfound].
- **Urine osmolality**: helps classify hyponatremia and guide therapy [^notfound].

---

### Therapeutic implications

- **Vasopressin analogs**: desmopressin treats central diabetes insipidus and nocturnal enuresis [^notfound].
- **Loop diuretics**: inhibit NKCC2, reduce concentrating ability, and are used in edema/heart failure [^1168XssL].
- **V2 antagonists**: tolvaptan treats hyponatremia and ADPKD by blocking AQP2 insertion [^113woLhx].

---

### Pathophysiological implications

Pathophysiologically, **nephrogenic diabetes insipidus** results from AVP resistance due to AQP2 or V2 receptor defects, causing polyuria and dehydration [^113Ls6zu]. Chronic kidney disease impairs the concentrating mechanism and contributes to dysnatremias and volume disturbances [^117NSYqE]. Electrolyte disorders — including hyponatremia, hypernatremia, and potassium imbalances — are often linked to impaired urinary concentration [^117NSYqE].

## Key components of urinary concentration

| **Component** | **Function** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|
| NKCC2 transporter | Active NaCl reabsorption in TAL | Loop diuretics; Bartter syndrome [^115jkajK] |
| Aquaporin-2 | Water reabsorption in collecting duct | - Nephrogenic DI <br/> - Desmopressin [^117QTvbc] |
| Vasopressin | Regulates AQP2 trafficking | - Central DI <br/> - SIADH <br/> - Tolvaptan [^113woLhx] |
| Urea recycling | Augments medullary gradient | Impaired in CKD; affects max concentration [^117NSYqE] |
| Vasa recta | Countercurrent exchange | Preserves gradient; impaired in CKD [^notfound] |

---

The kidney's concentrating mechanism relies on countercurrent multiplication and AQP2-mediated water reabsorption; its clinical importance spans diagnosis, therapy, and pathophysiology, and **targeting these pathways** is central to managing fluid and electrolyte disorders.

### Doxycycline (doxycycline monohydrate) [^1124jKqW]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration.

Following a 200 mg dose of doxycycline monohydrate, 24 normal adult volunteers averaged the following serum concentration values:

Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40%/72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min). This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1–5%/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18–22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.

Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life.

Microbiology:

Mechanism of Action

Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cross resistance with other tetracyclines is common. Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the package insert for DOXYCYCLINE MONOHYDRATE.

### Tromethamine (Tham) [^111XGCgV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

When administered intravenously as a 0.3 M solution, tromethamine act as a proton acceptor and prevents or corrects acidosis by actively binding hydrogen ions (H+). It binds not only cations of fixed or metabolic acids, but also hydrogen ions of carbonic acid, thus increasing bicarbonate anion (HCO3‾). Tromethamine also acts as an osmotic diuretic, increasing urine flow, urinary pH, and excretion of fixed acids, carbon dioxide and electrolytes. A significant fraction of tromethamine (30% at pH 7.40) is not ionized and therefore is capable of reaching equilibrium in total body water. This portion may penetrate cells and may neutralize acidic ions of the intracellular fluid.

The drug is rapidly eliminated by the kidney; 75% or more appears in the urine after eight hours. Urinary excretion continues over a period of three days.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### Vasopressin regulation of renal sodium excretion [^113U8Pq8]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vasopressin promotes renal water reabsorption decreasing excretion of free water to dilute plasma and lower serum osmolality. We have good understanding of the causes, mechanisms and consequences of this vasopressin-dependent renal water movement. In comparison, vasopressin actions on renal electrolytes including sodium excretion and its consequences have been less well understood. This is so for investigation and discussions of the renal actions of vasopressin are framed primarily around water metabolism rather than any direct effect on salt handling. The fact that water moves in biological systems, to include the mammalian kidney, only by osmosis passively down its concentration gradient is implicit in such discussion but often not overtly addressed. This can cause confusion. Moreover, although vasopressin action on renal sodium excretion via the V2 receptor is critical to water transport, it is masked easily being situational — for instance, dependent on hydration state. It is now clear that an increase in sodium reabsorption along the distal nephron (CNT + CD) mediated by activation of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) by vasopressin makes an important contribution to maintenance of the axial corticomedullary osmotic gradient necessary for maximal water reabsorption. Thus, we need to modify slightly our understanding of vasopressin and its renal actions to include the idea that while vasopressin decreases free water excretion to dilute plasma, it does this, in part, by promoting sodium reabsorption and consequently decreasing sodium excretion via ENaC activated along the distal nephron.

### Nephrotoxicity biomarkers following propanil (3, 4-dichloropropionanilide) self-poisoning [^113ZG9pv]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Propanil toxicity is characterised by severe prolonged methaemoglobinaemia, cyanosis, acidosis, and progressive end-organ dysfunction. In vitro studies report propanil-induced kidney toxicity, which has not been studied clinically. This study determined the incidence of acute kidney injury and of methaemoglobinaemia after propanil self-poisoning and reported the diagnostic performance of novel and traditional biomarkers of acute kidney injury.

Methods

Sixty-seven previously healthy patients were recruited following acute propanil self-poisoning, between October 2010 and October 2014. Concentrations of serum biomarkers and urine biomarkers normalised for urine creatinine excretion were measured. Plasma and urine concentrations of propanil, its main metabolite 3,4-dichloroaniline, the antidote methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue), and methaemoglobin levels were measured.

Results

Kidney biomarkers were measured in 52 of the 67 patients, with 40% developing acute kidney injury (stage 1 [32%] and stage 2 [8%]). Blood methaemoglobin levels were recorded in 23 patients. Normalised urine biomarker concentrations of kidney injury molecule-1, trefoil factor 3, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and beta 2 microglobulin increased in patients who developed acute kidney injury, but only trefoil factor 3 and cystatin C showed a significantly predicted acute kidney injury at 16–24h and 8–16h post-ingestion, respectively. In contrast, serum creatinine concentrations had a very good diagnostic performance throughout the 24h post-ingestion period, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.79–0.96. Blood methaemoglobin levels were higher in patients with acute kidney injury and correlated with plasma propanil and 3,4-dichloroaniline concentrations. Concentrations of serum creatinine, urine beta 2 microglobulin, and trefoil factor 3 significantly correlated with plasma and urine concentrations of propanil, 3,4-dichloroaniline, and methylthioninium chloride.

Discussion

Severe methaemoglobinaemia can impair oxygen delivery and may cause acute ischaemic kidney injury. The poor diagnostic performance of novel biomarkers may be attributed to non-renal factors influencing creatinine concentration or an unusual site or mechanism of nephrotoxicity after propanil poisoning.

Conclusions

Patients with propanil self-poisoning exhibited reversible kidney injury diagnosable using serum creatinine concentrations within 4h. Although other biomarkers were increased, they were not effective for early diagnosis.

### Uromodulin: from monogenic to multifactorial diseases [^111Gn7fB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Uromodulin, the major protein secreted in normal urine, is exclusively produced in the thick ascending limb (TAL) cells of the kidney. The exact role uromodulin (UMOD) plays in renal physiology remains enigmatic. UMOD has been linked to water/electrolyte balance and to kidney innate immunity and it is believed to protect against urinary tract infections and renal stones. A renewed interest in UMOD has been triggered by the identification of UMOD mutations as cause of hereditary dominant renal diseases, now referred to as uromodulin-associated kidney diseases (UAKDs), presenting with tubulointerstitial fibrosis, defective urinary concentration, hyperuricaemia and gout, and progressive renal failure. In UAKDs, the key primary pathogenetic event is a delayed intracellular trafficking of mutant UMOD, causing its intracellular accumulation. In the last decade, multiple genome-wide association studies have identified common variants in the UMOD gene, causing independent susceptibility to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, two complex traits representing major global health problems. The biological mechanism underlying the association between UMOD risk variants and susceptibility to CKD and hypertension was not understood until last year, when the link between UMOD and hypertension was found to be caused by overactivation of the TAL sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter NKCC2, pointing to UMOD as a therapeutic target for lowering blood pressure and preserving renal function.

### Vasopressin, copeptin, and renal concentrating capacity in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease without renal impairment [^113YC3Q1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent hereditary renal disease, characterized by cyst formation in the kidneys leading to end stage kidney failure. It is clinically acknowledged that ADPKD patients have impaired urine concentrating capacity, but the mechanism behind this observation is unknown.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Fifteen ADPKD patients (estimated GFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m²) and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent a standard prolonged water deprivation test in which urine and plasma osmolality, vasopressin, and copeptin were measured. The effect of a synthetic vasopressin analog (desmopressin) injected at the moment of maximal urine concentrating capacity was also studied.

Results

After 14 hours of water deprivation, ADPKD patients tended to have higher plasma osmolality (P = 0.07) and significantly higher vasopressin and copeptin levels (both P < 0.05), whereas urine osmolality was similar in ADPKD patients and controls (710 versus 742 mOsmol/kg; P = 0.61). Maximal urine concentrating capacity was lower in ADPKD patients (758 versus 915 mOsmol/kg in controls; P < 0.001). At maximal urine concentrating capacity, plasma osmolality, vasopressin, and copeptin levels were significantly higher in ADPKD patients. The median increase in urine osmolality after desmopressin administration in ADPKD patients was less than in healthy controls.

Conclusions

Already early in their disease, ADPKD patients have impaired maximal urine concentrating capacity brought out upon dehydration, with no evidence of impaired hypothalamic response. To maintain fluid balance, vasopressin concentration increases, which is hypothesized to play a role in ADPKD disease progression.

### Proximal tubular secretory clearance: a neglected partner of kidney function [^1154nJtE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The secretion of small molecules by the proximal tubules of the kidneys represents a vital homeostatic function for rapidly clearing endogenous solutes and medications from the circulation. After filtration at the glomerulus, renal blood flow is directed through a network of peritubular capillaries, where transporters of the proximal tubules actively secrete putative uremic toxins and hundreds of commonly prescribed drugs into the urine, including protein-bound substances that cannot readily cross the glomerular basement membrane. Despite its central physiologic importance, tubular secretory clearance is rarely measured or even estimated in clinical or research settings. Major barriers to estimating tubular solute clearance include uncertainty regarding optimal endogenous secretory markers and a lack of standardized laboratory assays. The creation of new methods to measure tubular secretion could catalyze advances in kidney disease research and clinical care. Differences in secretory clearance relative to the GFR could help distinguish among the causes of CKD, particularly for disorders that primarily affect the tubulointerstitium. As the primary mechanism by which the kidneys excrete medications, tubular secretory clearance offers promise for improving kidney medication dosing, which is currently exclusively on the basis of filtration. The differing metabolic profiles of retained solutes eliminated by secretion versus glomerular filtration suggest that secretory clearance could uniquely inform uremic toxicity, refine existing measures of residual kidney function, and improve prediction of cardiovascular and kidney disease outcomes. Interdisciplinary research across clinical, translational, and laboratory medicine is needed to bring this often neglected kidney function into the limelight.

### Why are angiotensin concentrations so high in the kidney? [^116a6ZiM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies have reported that intrarenal angiotensin II content and angiotensin II concentrations in the proximal tubular fluid and renal interstitial fluid are much greater than the circulating angiotensin II levels. These high intrarenal angiotensin II levels are responsible for regulating renal hemodynamics and tubular transport.

Recent Findings

Intrarenal angiotensin II levels have been assessed from total tissue contents as well as renal interstitial fluid and proximal tubular fluid concentrations. Total tissue contents expressed per gram of tissue weight are greater than plasma angiotensin II concentrations; tubular fluid concentrations and renal interstitial fluid concentrations are even greater in the range of 3–10 pmoles/ml. In hypertensive states, there is also an increased intracellular accumulation of angiotensin II mediated by angiotensin type 1 receptor-dependent endocytosis. The high intrarenal angiotensin II levels are also caused by the presence of angiotensinogen messenger RNA and protein in the proximal tubule cells. Furthermore, there is positive amplification by which increases in circulating angiotensin II stimulate increased production and secretion of angiotensinogen, which is also manifested as an increased urinary excretion rate.

Summary

The ability of the kidney to generate high intratubular and interstitial concentrations allows the kidney to regulate intrarenal levels in accord with the homeostatic needs for the regulation of renal hemodynamics and tubular reabsorption and the regulation of sodium balance. When inappropriately stimulated, high intrarenal angiotensin II levels contribute to excessive salt and water retention, the development of hypertension, and long-term proliferative effects leading to renal injury.

Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement — factors affecting urinary ACR span preanalytical, biological, storage, non-renal creatinine variation, and analytical domains, including transient elevation in albuminuria from menstrual blood contamination, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), exercise, upright posture (orthostatic proteinuria), or other conditions increasing vascular permeability; intraindividual variability such as intrinsic biological and genetic variability; degradation of albumin before analysis; non-renal causes of variability in creatinine excretion such as age, race, muscle mass, and gender; non-steady state for creatinine in acute kidney injury (AKI); and analytical issues such as creatinine excess ("prozone") effect where samples with very high concentrations of albumin may be reported as low or normal using some assays.

### Genetic studies of urinary metabolites illuminate mechanisms of detoxification and excretion in humans [^115Fuvsq]. Nature Genetics (2020). High credibility.

The kidneys integrate information from continuous systemic processes related to the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of metabolites. To identify underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed genome-wide association studies of the urinary concentrations of 1,172 metabolites among 1,627 patients with reduced kidney function. The 240 unique metabolite-locus associations (metabolite quantitative trait loci, mQTLs) that were identified and replicated highlight novel candidate substrates for transport proteins. The identified genes are enriched in ADME-relevant tissues and cell types, and they reveal novel candidates for biotransformation and detoxification reactions. Fine mapping of mQTLs and integration with single-cell gene expression permitted the prioritization of causal genes, functional variants and target cell types. The combination of mQTLs with genetic and health information from 450,000 UK Biobank participants illuminated metabolic mediators, and hence, novel urinary biomarkers of disease risk. This comprehensive resource of genetic targets and their substrates is informative for ADME processes in humans and is relevant to basic science, clinical medicine and pharmaceutical research.

### A molecular mechanism explaining albuminuria in kidney disease [^117JUWTi]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Mammalian kidneys constantly filter large amounts of liquid, with almost complete retention of albumin and other macromolecules in the plasma. Breakdown of the three-layered renal filtration barrier results in loss of albumin into urine (albuminuria) across the wall of small renal capillaries, and is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease. However, exactly how the renal filter works and why its permeability is altered in kidney diseases is poorly understood. Here we show that the permeability of the renal filter is modulated through compression of the capillary wall. We collect morphometric data prior to and after onset of albuminuria in a mouse model equivalent to a human genetic disease affecting the renal filtration barrier. Combining quantitative analyses with mathematical modelling, we demonstrate that morphological alterations of the glomerular filtration barrier lead to reduced compressive forces that counteract filtration pressure, thereby resulting in capillary dilatation, and ultimately albuminuria. Our results reveal distinct functions of the different layers of the filtration barrier and expand the molecular understanding of defective renal filtration in chronic kidney disease.

### Dysnatremias in patients with kidney disease [^117NSYqE]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias are among the most common electrolyte disorders in clinical medicine. Recent studies have shown that individuals with chronic kidney disease also are afflicted by these electrolyte disorders. Furthermore, their presence imparts an increased risk of mortality. In this review, we discuss studies in experimental animals and in humans that have attempted to establish the mechanisms responsible for limiting urinary dilution and urinary concentration in progressive kidney disease. The clinical implications of these disorders in water excretion are discussed in the setting of optimal water intake as kidney disease progresses. This review emphasizes the management of patients with chronic kidney disease who have marked abnormalities in serum sodium concentrations and gives specific recommendations for modifications in renal replacement therapy prescription in hyponatremic patients with end-stage renal disease.

### Aquaporin-2 protein dynamics within the cell [^117QTvbc]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Aquaporin-2 is an aquaporin water channel protein present at the apical membrane of kidney collecting duct cells and plays a key role in urine concentrating ability. Like other membrane proteins, aquaporin-2 undergoes dynamic processes within the cells: synthesized, targeted to the subapical region, exocytosed to the apical membrane, endocytosed, recycled and finally degraded. The understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these events is advancing rapidly, and recent new findings characterizing such processes are reviewed.

Recent Findings

Hypertonicity itself stimulates aquaporin-2 expression through the tonicity-responsive enhancer and its transcription factors. Gene targeted mouse models for human nephrogenic diabetes insipidus show the importance of the C-terminus of aquaporin-2 in apical sorting and provide mechanistic insights. Evidence for the importance of actin cytoskelton in exocytosis of aquaporin-2 to the apical membrane is accumulating. Actin and other proteins bind to aquaporin-2 and make a multiprotein complex. New proteomic analyses indicate the involvement of a large series of proteins in aquaporin-2 dynamics.

Summary

The protein-level understanding of aquaporin-2 dynamics has advanced considerably over the past few years, and continuing studies will open a new way in developing new manoeuvres or drugs to manipulate kidney water homeostasis.

### Evaluation of hypomagnesemia: lessons from disorders of tubular transport [^111GMS12]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hypomagnesemia is a highly prevalent clinical condition affecting a large number of hospitalized patients. A decrease in systemic magnesium concentration may lead to impaired function of both neurologic and cardiovascular systems. The kidney has a pivotal role in magnesium handling by adjusting the urinary excretion of this ion in order to maintain systemic concentrations within a narrow range. As such, the cause of hypomagnesemia can be related to increments in the renal excretion of this cation. Many hypomagnesemic disorders also have characteristic changes in the renal reabsorptive capacity for other electrolytes, leading to symptoms that sometimes obscure the clinical presentation. For instance, changes in serum calcium concentration or its urinary excretion can aid in determining the underlying cause. Moreover, hypokalemia due to renal potassium losses often is associated with hypomagnesemia. Genetic defects in pathways controlling renal electrolyte transport impose the hypomagnesemic condition by facilitating renal losses. The discovery of the causative genes has greatly increased our understanding of how magnesium is transported by the kidney. Such knowledge is integral for the continued improvement of patient care with respect to bettering therapies and diagnosis.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^113Ls6zu]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Healthy kidneys maintain fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis by adjusting urine volume and composition according to physiological needs. The final urine composition is determined in the last tubular segment: the collecting duct. Water permeability in the collecting duct is regulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). Secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis is regulated by a complex signalling network that involves osmosensors, barosensors and volume sensors. AVP facilitates aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water reabsorption via activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2) in the collecting duct, thus enabling concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), inability of the kidneys to respond to AVP results in functional AQP deficiency. Consequently, affected patients have constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. Primary forms of NDI result from mutations in the genes that encode the key proteins AVPR2 and AQP2, whereas secondary forms are associated with biochemical abnormalities, obstructive uropathy or the use of certain medications, particularly lithium. Treatment of the disease is informed by identification of the underlying cause. Here we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various aetiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments.

### Tromethamine [^115AsMub]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

When administered intravenously as a 0.3 M solution, tromethamine act as a proton acceptor and prevents or corrects acidosis by actively binding hydrogen ions (H+). It binds not only cations of fixed or metabolic acids, but also hydrogen ions of carbonic acid, thus increasing bicarbonate anion (HCO3–). Tromethamine also acts as an osmotic diuretic, increasing urine flow, urinary pH, and excretion of fixed acids, carbon dioxide and electrolytes. A significant fraction of tromethamine (30% at pH 7.40) is not ionized and therefore is capable of reaching equilibrium in total body water. This portion may penetrate cells and may neutralize acidic ions of the intracellular fluid.

The drug is rapidly eliminated by the kidney; 75% or more appears in the urine after eight hours. Urinary excretion continues over a period of three days.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### Clinical association with urinary glycosaminoglycans and urolithiasis [^112KJQXD]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the clinical association between urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentration and kidney stone disease.

Methods

Thirty-five patients (14 women and 21 men) with a history of stone disease and 37 controls (13 women and 24 men) were evaluated for urinary GAG concentration. By using a new dye-binding assay, the total GAG concentration in the urine was measured and corrected to urinary creatinine levels (micrograms of GAG per milligram creatinine).

Results

The mean urinary GAG concentration in those with stones was significantly lower (31.5 ± 2.6 microg GAG/mg creatinine) than in the controls (43.8 ± 3.8 microg GAG/mg creatinine, P = 0.01). Male patients with stones also had a significantly lower mean GAG concentration (26.1 ± 1.8) than did the female patients (39.6 ± 5.3, P = 0.009). The mean GAG concentration between ureteral (n = 13) versus renal (n = 22), single (n = 19) versus multiple (n = 16), family history (n = 11) versus no family history (n = 24), large (n = 13) versus small (n = 20), and the presence (n = 22) versus absence (n = 13) of residual stones did not show any significant differences. However, patients with recurrent stone formation (n = 21) had significantly lower mean GAG levels (26.4 ± 1.6) compared with those with single stone formation (n = 14; 39.2 ± 5.5, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Lower urinary GAG levels are more common in patients with stone formation. This may play a more determinant role in male patients and those with recurrent stone formation.

### Tubular secretion in CKD [^113oS3c8]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Renal function generally is assessed by measurement of GFR and urinary albumin excretion. Other intrinsic kidney functions, such as proximal tubular secretion, typically are not quantified. Tubular secretion of solutes is more efficient than glomerular filtration and a major mechanism for renal drug elimination, suggesting important clinical consequences of secretion dysfunction. Measuring tubular secretion as an independent marker of kidney function may provide insight into kidney disease etiology and improve prediction of adverse outcomes. We estimated secretion function by measuring secreted solute (hippurate, cinnamoylglycine, p-cresol sulfate, and indoxyl sulfate) clearance using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assays of serum and timed urine samples in a prospective cohort study of 298 patients with kidney disease. We estimated GFR by mean clearance of creatinine and urea from the same samples and evaluated associations of renal secretion with participant characteristics, mortality, and CKD progression to dialysis. Tubular secretion rate modestly correlated with eGFR and associated with some participant characteristics, notably fractional excretion of electrolytes. Low clearance of hippurate or p-cresol sulfate associated with greater risk of death independent of eGFR (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.7; hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.1, respectively). Hazards models also suggested an association between low cinnamoylglycine clearance and risk of dialysis, but statistical analyses did not exclude the null hypothesis. Therefore, estimates of proximal tubular secretion function correlate with glomerular filtration, but substantial variability in net secretion remains. The observed associations of net secretion with mortality and progression of CKD require confirmation.

### Tolvaptan (Jynarque) [^113woLhx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist with an affinity for the V2-receptor that is 1.8 times that of native arginine vasopressin (AVP). Tolvaptan affinity for the V2-receptor is 29 times that for the V1a-receptor. Decreased binding of vasopressin to the V2-receptor in the kidney lowers adenylate cyclase activity resulting in a decrease in intracellular adenosine 3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations. Decreased cAMP concentrations prevent aquaporin 2 containing vesicles from fusing with the plasma membrane, which in turn causes an increase in urine water excretion, an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis) and a decrease in urine osmolality. In human ADPKD cyst epithelial cells, tolvaptan inhibited AVP-stimulated in vitro cyst growth and chloride-dependent fluid secretion into cysts. In animal models, decreased cAMP concentrations were associated with decreases in the rate of growth of total kidney volume and the rate of formation and enlargement of kidney cysts. Tolvaptan metabolites have no or weak antagonist activity for human V2-receptors compared with tolvaptan.

### Potassium chloride for oral solution [^114xCvvU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The potassium ion (K+) is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function.

The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent, and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Based on published literature, the rate of absorption and urinary excretion of potassium from KCl oral solution were higher during the first few hours after dosing relative to modified release KCl products. The bioavailability of potassium, as measured by the cumulative urinary excretion of K+ over a 24-hour post dose period, is similar for KCl solution and modified release products.

### Factors affecting urinary myoglobin stability in vitro [^114DGnKg]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Urine myoglobin concentrations are measured clinically to assess rhabdomyolysis and the related risk of renal damage. We studied urine myoglobin concentrations in vitro to explore the factors affecting stability. Myoglobin was very unstable in urine specimens, especially below pH 6.5, and its immunoreactivity deteriorated rapidly with increasing temperatures. The deterioration rate was influenced greatly by urine myoglobin concentration, suggesting rate-limiting kinetics. Myoglobin in acidic phosphate-buffered saline was significantly more stable than in acidic urine, indicating that urinary factors in addition to pH are involved in myoglobin instability. These unidentified urinary factors had a molecular weight of less than 10 kd. Our results provide additional insight into the mechanism involved in the instability of the urine myoglobin concentration. Understanding the stability of myoglobin in the preanalytic in vitro phase and its potential in vivo instability is essential in assuring the reliability and clinical usefulness of urine myoglobin measurements.

### Urine concentration ability is reduced to the same degree in adult dominant polycystic kidney disease compared with other chronic kidney diseases in the same CKD-stage and lower THAN in healthy control subjects-a CASE control study [^1143YMJ9]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Concentration of the urine is primarily regulated via vasopressin dependent aquaporin-2 water channels in the apical membrane of kidney principal cells. It is unclear whether urine concentration ability in ADPKD differs from other patients with similar degree of impaired renal function (non-ADPKD patients). The purpose of this case control study was to measure urine concentration ability in ADPKD patients compared to non-ADPKD patients and healthy controls.

Methods

A seventeen hour long water deprivation test was carried out in 17 ADPKD patients (CKD I-IV), 16 non-ADPKD patients (CKD I-IV), and 18 healthy controls. Urine was collected in 4 consecutive periods during water deprivation (12h, 1h, 2h and 2h, respectively) and analyzed for osmolality (u-Osm), output (UO), fractional excretion of sodium (FE Na), aquaporin2 (u-AQP2) and ENaC (u-ENaC). Blood samples were drawn trice (after 13-, 15-, and 17h after water deprivation) for analyses of osmolality (p-Osm), vasopressin (p-AVP), and aldosterone (p-Aldo).

Results

U-Osm was significantly lower and FE Na significantly higher in both ADPKD patients and non-ADPKD patients compared to healthy controls during the last three periods of water deprivation. During the same periods, UO was higher and secretion rates of u-AQP2 and u-ENaC were lower and at the same level in the two groups of patients compared to controls. P-AVP and p-Osm did not differ significantly between the three groups. P-Aldo was higher in both groups of patients than in controls.

Conclusions

Urine concentration ability was reduced to the same extent in patients with ADPKD and other chronic kidney diseases with the same level of renal function compared to healthy controls. The lower urine excretion of AQP2 and ENaC suggests that the underlying mechanism may be a reduced tubular response to vasopressin and aldosterone.

### Urine-concentrating mechanism in the inner medulla: function of the thin limbs of the loops of henle [^117Q67fB]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The ability of mammals to produce urine hyperosmotic to plasma requires the generation of a gradient of increasing osmolality along the medulla from the corticomedullary junction to the papilla tip. Countercurrent multiplication apparently establishes this gradient in the outer medulla, where there is substantial transepithelial reabsorption of NaCl from the water-impermeable thick ascending limbs of the loops of Henle. However, this process does not establish the much steeper osmotic gradient in the inner medulla, where there are no thick ascending limbs of the loops of Henle and the water-impermeable ascending thin limbs lack active transepithelial transport of NaCl or any other solute. The mechanism generating the osmotic gradient in the inner medulla remains an unsolved mystery, although it is generally considered to involve countercurrent flows in the tubules and vessels. A possible role for the three-dimensional interactions between these inner medullary tubules and vessels in the concentrating process is suggested by creation of physiologic models that depict the three-dimensional relationships of tubules and vessels and their solute and water permeabilities in rat kidneys and by creation of mathematical models based on biologic phenomena. The current mathematical model, which incorporates experimentally determined or estimated solute and water flows through clearly defined tubular and interstitial compartments, predicts a urine osmolality in good agreement with that observed in moderately antidiuretic rats. The current model provides substantially better predictions than previous models; however, the current model still fails to predict urine osmolalities of maximally concentrating rats.

### Renal function in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract [^117JM4eZ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract are a major cause of chronic and end-stage renal failure in children. The molecular mechanisms having been elaborated, there is now growing evidence that kidney function is to a large extent determined genetically at an early stage. Assessment of kidney function is an important tool in clinical medicine and is feasible in utero. Postnatally, determination of absolute glomerular filtration rate and also of split and excretory renal function play an important role in the determination of treatment and prognosis. This is supplemented by other biochemical, molecular and interventional prognostic factors, which are of help in preservation of kidney survival by minimizing modulating factors. If chronic or terminal renal failure ensues in childhood or even in early infancy, however, improved medical care has led to encouraging results, ultimately influencing the motivation in the care of children with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.

### Potassium activates mTORC2-dependent SGK1 phosphorylation to stimulate epithelial sodium channel: role in rapid renal responses to dietary potassium [^115GQgZ6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

Rapid renal responses to ingested potassium are essential to prevent hyperkalemia and also play a central role in blood pressure regulation. Although local extracellular K + concentration in kidney tissue is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of K + secretion, the underlying mechanisms that are relevant in vivo remain controversial. To assess the role of the signaling kinase mTOR complex-2 (mTORC2), the authors compared the effects of K + administered by gavage in wild-type mice and knockout mice with kidney tubule-specific inactivation of mTORC2. They found that mTORC2 is rapidly activated to trigger K + secretion and maintain electrolyte homeostasis. Downstream targets of mTORC2 implicated in epithelial sodium channel regulation (SGK1 and Nedd4–2) were concomitantly phosphorylated in wild-type, but not knockout, mice. These findings offer insight into electrolyte physiologic and regulatory mechanisms.

Background

Increasing evidence implicates the signaling kinase mTOR complex-2 (mTORC2) in rapid renal responses to changes in plasma potassium concentration [K +]. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that are relevant in vivo for these responses remain controversial.

Methods

We used Cre-Lox-mediated knockout of rapamycin-insensitive companion of TOR (Rictor) to inactivate mTORC2 in kidney tubule cells of mice. In a series of time-course experiments in wild-type and knockout mice, we assessed urinary and blood parameters and renal expression and activity of signaling molecules and transport proteins after a K + load by gavage.

Results

A K + load rapidly stimulated epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) processing, plasma membrane localization, and activity in wild-type, but not in knockout, mice. Downstream targets of mTORC2 implicated in ENaC regulation (SGK1 and Nedd4–2) were concomitantly phosphorylated in wild-type, but not knockout, mice. We observed differences in urine electrolytes within 60 minutes, and plasma [K +] was greater in knockout mice within 3 hours of gavage. Renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels were not acutely stimulated in wild-type or knockout mice, nor were phosphorylation of other mTORC2 substrates (PKC and Akt).

Conclusions

The mTORC2-SGK1-Nedd4–2-ENaC signaling axis is a key mediator of rapid tubule cell responses to increased plasma [K +] in vivo. The effects of K + on this signaling module are specific, in that other downstream mTORC2 targets, such as PKC and Akt, are not acutely affected, and ROMK and Large-conductance K + (BK) channels are not activated. These findings provide new insight into the signaling network and ion transport systems that underlie renal responses to K +in vivo.

### Iopamidol [^113J6r8N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Intravascular injection of iopamidol opacifies those vessels where the contrast agent is present, permitting radiographic visualization through attenuation of photons.

In imaging of the body, iodinated contrast agents diffuse from the vessels into the extravascular space. In normal brain with an intact blood-brain barrier, contrast does not diffuse into the extravascular space. In patients with a disrupted blood-brain barrier, contrast agent accumulates in the extravascular space in the region of disruption.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Following administration of iopamidol injection, the degree of enhancement is related to the iodine concentration in the tissue of interest. However, the exposure-response relationships and time course of pharmacodynamic response of iopamidol have not been fully characterized.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

Plasma concentrations of iodine fall within 5 to 10 minutes due to distribution into the vascular and extracellular fluid compartments. Equilibration with the extracellular compartments is reached in about 10 minutes.

The apparent volume of distribution suggests that iopamidol is distributed evenly between blood and extracellular fluid. Iopamidol may be visualized in the renal parenchyma within 30 to 60 seconds following rapid intravenous administration. Iopamidol did not bind to serum or plasma proteins at 1 hour after administration.

Elimination

The plasma half-life is approximately 2 hours; the half-life is not dose dependent.

Metabolism

Iopamidol does not undergo significant metabolism, deiodination, or biotransformation.

Excretion

Iopamidol is excreted primarily through the kidneys. In patients with normal renal function, the cumulative urinary excretion for iopamidol, expressed as a percentage of administered intravenous dose, is approximately 35% to 40% at 60 minutes, 80% to 90% at 8 hours, and 90% or greater in the 72- to 96-hour period after administration. In patients with normal renal function, approximately 1% or less of the administered dose appears in cumulative 72- to 96-hour fecal samples.

### Mannitol [^111Xyikw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Mannitol, when administered intravenously, exerts its osmotic diuretic effect as a solute of relatively small molecular size largely confined to the extracellular space. Mannitol hinders tubular reabsorption of water and enhances excretion of sodium and chloride by elevating the osmolarity of the glomerular filtrate.

This increase in extracellular osmolarity affected by the intravenous administration of mannitol will induce the movement of intracellular water to the extracellular and vascular spaces. This action underlies the role of mannitol in reducing intracranial pressure, intracranial edema, and intraocular pressure.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

Mannitol distributes largely to the extracellular space within 20 to 40 minutes after intravenous administration. The volume of distribution of mannitol is approximately 17 L in adults.

Elimination

In subjects with normal renal function, the total clearance is 87 to 109 mL/minute. The elimination half-life of mannitol is 0.5 to 2.5 hours

Metabolism

Only a relatively small amount of the mannitol dose is metabolized after intravenous administration to healthy subjects.

Excretion

Mannitol is eliminated primarily via the kidneys in unchanged form. Mannitol is filtered by the glomeruli, exhibits less than 10% of tubular reabsorption, and is not secreted by tubular cells. Following intravenous administration, approximately 80% of an administered dose of mannitol is estimated to be excreted in the urine in 3 hours with lesser amounts thereafter.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment, the elimination half-life of mannitol is prolonged. In a published study, in patients with renal impairment including acute renal failure and end stage renal failure, the elimination half-life of mannitol was estimated at about 36 hours, based on serum osmolarity. In patients with renal impairment on dialysis, the elimination half-life of mannitol was reduced to 6 and 21 hours during hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, respectively [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6), OVERDOSAGE (10)].

### Osmotic pressure in clinical medicine with an emphasis on dialysis [^113RL3eY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of life of the first multicellular organisms, the preservation of a physiologic milieu for every cell in the organism has been a critical requirement. A particular range of osmolality of the body fluids is essential for the maintenance of cell volume. In humans the stability of electrolyte concentrations and their resulting osmolality in the body fluids is the consequence of complex interactions between cell membrane functions, hormonal control, thirst, and controlled kidney excretion of fluid and solutes. Knowledge of these mechanisms, of the biochemical principles of osmolality, and of the relevant situations occurring in disease is of importance to every physician. This comprehensive review summarizes the major facts on osmolality, its relation to electrolytes and other solutes, and its relevance in physiology and in disease states with a focus on dialysis-related considerations.

### Urinary proteomics and metabolomics studies to monitor bladder health and urological diseases [^114Za6Mu]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Assays of molecular biomarkers in urine are non-invasive compared to other body fluids and can be easily repeated. Based on the hypothesis that the secreted markers from the diseased organs may locally release into the body fluid in the vicinity of the injury, urine-based assays have been considered beneficial to monitoring bladder health and urological diseases. The urine proteome is much less complex than the serum and tissues, but nevertheless can contain biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. The urine metabolome has a much higher number and concentration of low-molecular metabolites than the serum or tissues, with a far lower lipid concentration, yet informs directly about dietary and microbial metabolism.

Discussion

We here discuss the use of mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics for urine biomarker assays, specifically with respect to the underlying mechanisms that trigger the pathological condition.

Conclusion

Molecular biomarker profiles, based on proteomics and metabolomics studies, reliably distinguish patients from healthy controls, stratify sub-populations with respect to treatment options, and predict therapeutic response of patients with urological disease.

### Is there a role for PGE2 in urinary concentration? [^1138rZ7T]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Prostanoids are prominent, yet complex, components in the maintenance of body water homeostasis. Recent functional and molecular studies have revealed that the local lipid mediator PGE2 is involved both in water excretion and absorption. The biologic actions of PGE2 are exerted through four different G-protein-coupled receptors; designated EP1–4, which couple to separate intracellular signaling pathways. Here, we discuss new developments in our understanding of the actions of PGE2 that have been uncovered utilizing receptor specific agonists and antagonists, EP receptor and PG synthase knockout mice, polyuric animal models, and the new understanding of the molecular regulation of collecting duct water permeability. The role of PGE2 in urinary concentration comprises a variety of mechanisms, which are not fully understood and likely depend on which receptor is activated under a particular physiologic condition. EP3 and microsomal PG synthase type 1 play a role in decreasing collecting duct water permeability and increasing water excretion, whereas EP2 and EP4 can bypass vasopressin signaling and increase water reabsorption through two different intracellular signaling pathways. PGE2 has an intricate role in urinary concentration, and we now suggest how targeting specific prostanoid receptor signaling pathways could be exploited for the treatment of disorders in water balance.

### Renal albumin absorption in physiology and pathology [^114LRCTv]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant plasmaprotein serving multiple functions as a carrier of metabolites, hormones, vitamins, and drugs, as an acid/base buffer, as antioxidant and by supporting the oncotic pressure and volume of the blood. The presence of albumin in urine is considered to be the result of the balance between glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. Albuminuria has been accepted as an independent risk factor and a marker for renal as well as cardiovascular disease, and during the past decade, evidence has suggested that albumin itself may cause progression of renal disease. Thus, the reduction of proteinuria and, in particular, albuminuria has become a target in itself to prevent deterioration of renal function. Studies have shown albumin and its ligands to induce expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators, and it has been hypothesized that increased filtration of albumin causes excessive tubular reabsorption, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in the loss of renal function. In addition, it is known that tubular dysfunction in itself may cause albuminuria owing to decreased reabsorption of filtered albumin, and, recently, it has been suggested that significant amounts of albumin fragments are excreted in the urine as a result of tubular degradation. Thus, although both tubular and glomerular dysfunction influences renal handling of albumin, it appears that tubular reabsorption plays a central role in mediating the effects of albumin on renal function. The present paper will review the mechanisms for tubular albumin uptake and the possible implications for the development of renal disease.

### New insights into regulated aquaporin-2 function [^114nW9yw]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels in principal cells of the kidney collecting duct are essential for urine concentration. Due to application of modern technologies, progress in our understanding of AQP2 has accelerated in recent years. In this article, we highlight some of the new insights into AQP2 function that have developed recently, with particular focus on the cell biological aspects of AQP2 regulation.

Recent Findings

AQP2 is subjected to a number of regulated modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which are important for AQP2 function, cellular localization and degradation. AQP2 is likely internalized via clathrin and non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Regulation of AQP2 endocytosis, in addition to exocytosis, is a vital mechanism in determining overall AQP2 membrane abundance. AQP2 is associated with regulated membrane microdomains. Studies using membrane cholesterol depleting reagents, for example statins, have supported the role of membrane rafts in regulation of AQP2 trafficking. Noncanonical roles for AQP2, for example in epithelial cell migration, are emerging.

Summary

AQP2 function and thus urine concentration is dependent on a variety of cell signalling mechanisms, posttranslational modification and interplay between AQP2 and its lipid environment. This complexity of regulation allows fine-tuning of AQP2 function and thus body water homeostasis.

### Distal convoluted tubule [^1141BcjS]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The distal convoluted tubule is the nephron segment that lies immediately downstream of the macula densa. Although short in length, the distal convoluted tubule plays a critical role in sodium, potassium, and divalent cation homeostasis. Recent genetic and physiologic studies have greatly expanded our understanding of how the distal convoluted tubule regulates these processes at the molecular level. This article provides an update on the distal convoluted tubule, highlighting concepts and pathophysiology relevant to clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guideline on management of older patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3b or higher (eGFR [^117Ta7J7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, renal adjustment of medications, ACP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining regular measurements of serum drug concentrations for drugs with a narrow toxic/therapeutic range. Consider using different target levels of total drug concentration because of the differences in protein binding in relation to uremia.

### Torsemide [^1168XssL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Micropuncture studies in animals have shown that torsemide acts from within the lumen of the thick ascending portion of the loop of Henle, where it inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl–-carrier system. Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed this site of action in humans, and effects in other segments of the nephron have not been demonstrated. Diuretic activity thus correlates better with the rate of drug excretion in the urine than with the concentration in the blood.

Torsemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance.

### Mechanisms underlying increased TIMP2 and IGFBP7 urinary excretion in experimental AKI [^1139SZAJ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical data support the utility/superiority of a new AKI biomarker ("NephroCheck"), the arithmetic product of urinary TIMP × IGFBP7 concentrations. However, the pathophysiologic basis for its utility remains ill defined.

Methods

To clarify this issue, CD-1 mice were subjected to either nephrotoxic (glycerol, maleate) or ischemic AKI. Urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 concentrations were determined at 4 and 18 hours postinjury and compared with urinary albumin levels. Gene transcription was assessed by measuring renal cortical and/or medullary TIMP2/IGFBP7 mRNAs (4 and 18 hours after AKI induction). For comparison, the mRNAs of three renal "stress" biomarkers (NGAL, heme oxygenase 1, and p21) were assessed. Renal cortical TIMP2/IGFBP7 protein was gauged by ELISA. Proximal tubule-specific TIMP2/IGFBP7 was assessed by immunohistochemistry.

Results

Each AKI model induced prompt (4 hours) and marked urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 increases without an increase in renal cortical concentrations. Furthermore, TIMP2/IGFBP7 mRNAs remained at normal levels. Endotoxemia also failed to increase TIMP2/IGFBP7 mRNAs. In contrast, each AKI model provoked massive NGAL, HO-1, and p21 mRNA increases, confirming that a renal "stress response" had occurred. Urinary albumin rose up to 100-fold and strongly correlated (r = 0.87–0.91) with urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 concentrations. Immunohistochemistry showed progressive TIMP2/IGFBP7 losses from injured proximal tubule cells. Competitive inhibition of endocytic protein reabsorption in normal mice tripled urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 levels, confirming this pathway's role in determining urinary excretion.

Conclusions

AKI-induced urinary TIMP2/IGFBP7 elevations are not due to stress-induced gene transcription. Rather, increased filtration, decreased tubule reabsorption, and proximal tubule cell TIMP2/IGFBP7 urinary leakage seem to be the most likely mechanisms.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^111ZsEVo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Residual native kidney function (Kru) monitoring in hemodialysis — when the targeted dialyzer Kt/V has been reduced because of significant Kru and Kru changes abruptly (e.g., change in urine volume or risks during hospitalization), an unscheduled measurement should be done to avoid prolonged insufficient dialysis, and in patients whose prescriptions were modified by Kru, urine volume should be measured monthly. Current methods for measuring Kru include urine collection for urea and/or creatinine clearance and use of exogenous filtration markers like iothalamate; urea is particularly useful because renal and dialysis clearances can be combined using current equations, with the average serum urea concentration during the urine collection estimated from predialysis and postdialysis blood samples or mathematical modeling of the urea concentration profile. To combine intermittent Kt/V with Kru, methods have been developed to account for the higher efficiency of continuous Kru compared to intermittent "dialyzer clearance".

### Pathophysiology of hypocitraturic nephrolithiasis [^117WbgHC]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary citrate inhibits calcium stone formation by complexing calcium in a soluble form and by effects on urinary crystals to prevent growth to stones. Low urinary citrate has been recognized for several decades as a contributing factor in some stone forming patients, but recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms and derangements of the renal handling of citrate in various conditions. In addition, oral citrate as an alkalinizing agent can not only increase urinary citrate, but also favorably impact other stone-promoting conditions. This review will focus on the understanding of these concepts.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1142ujiR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Renal aspergillosis — management should combine medical and urologic care: we suggest a combined approach of medical and urologic management for renal aspergillosis; obstruction of one or both ureters should be managed with decompression if possible and local instillation of AmB deoxycholate, and parenchymal disease is best treated with voriconazole (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Nephrectomy should be performed only as a last option, and voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, AmB formulations, and the echinocandins all exhibit poor urinary concentrations. Irrigation via a nephrostomy tube with AmB deoxycholate allows high local concentrations and when given by this route is not absorbed and is not nephrotoxic; it thus may be useful in aspergillosis of the renal pelvis, but has no role in the treatment of parenchymal disease.

### Renal physiology of nocturia [^114amuNo]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

Renal function, diurnal fluctuations in arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion, sex, and advanced age affect urine formation and may contribute to nocturia. Renal effects of AVP are mediated by AVP V2 receptors in the kidney collecting duct. Changes in AVP concentration have the greatest relative effects on urine volume when AVP levels are low; therefore small changes can have a large effect on renal water excretion. AVP is the major regulator of water excretion by the kidneys, and AVP levels have been shown to affect nocturnal voiding. Results of several studies show that patients with nocturia had no significant variation in plasma AVP, whereas patients without nocturia had significant diurnal variation in plasma AVP. The V2 receptor gene is located on the X chromosome, which has important sex-specific consequences. For example, mutations in the V2 gene can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, predominantly in men. Age-related changes in water metabolism are associated with overall body composition, kidney, and brain. Older people generally experience decreased extracellular fluid and plasma volume, which leads to increased adverse consequences from net body water gain or loss. Renal function declines with age, and the ability to concentrate urine and conserve sodium is reduced in the elderly. Thirst perception is also decreased in the elderly, who, compared with younger people, tend to hypersecrete AVP in response to higher plasma osmolality, possibly resulting in hyponatremia. These aspects of renal physiology should be considered when antidiuretic drugs are prescribed for the treatment of nocturia.

### Benefits and risks of furosemide in acute kidney injury [^1159zCND]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is frequently used in different stages of acute kidney injury, but its clinical roles remain uncertain. This review summarises the pharmacology of furosemide, its potential uses and side effects, and the evidence of its efficacy. Furosemide is actively secreted by the proximal tubules into the urine before reaching its site of action at the ascending limb of loop of Henle. It is the urinary concentrations of furosemide that determine its diuretic effect. The severity of acute kidney injury has a significant effect on the diuretic response to furosemide; a good 'urinary response' may be considered as a 'proxy' for having some residual renal function. The current evidence does not suggest that furosemide can reduce mortality in patients with acute kidney injury. In patients with acute lung injury without haemodynamic instability, furosemide may be useful in achieving fluid balance to facilitate mechanical ventilation according to the lung-protective ventilation strategy.

### Impact of solute intake on urine flow and water excretion [^115ua5k6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

It is classically taught that when renal function is normal and the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (arginine vasopressin) is fully suppressed, the human kidney has the capacity to excrete large volumes of dilute urine, allowing for a broad range of water intake. This flexibility protects against the development of hyponatremia even in the face of water intake that can approach 20 L/d. What is not as widely recognized is the impact that alterations in solute intake, and therefore excretion, have on this process. As will be illustrated here, a decrement in solute intake markedly reduces the above-mentioned flexibility and puts the individual at risk for the unexpected development of hyponatremia. In contrast, an increment in solute intake can be used therapeutically to treat this electrolyte disorder and allow those prone to it to liberalize their water intake.

### Mild dehydration, vasopressin and the kidney: animal and human studies [^115SgcDN]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Water balance depends essentially on fluid intake and urine excretion. Mild dehydration and the consequent hypertonicity of the extracellular fluid induce an increase in vasopressin secretion, thus stimulating urine concentrating processes and the feeling of thirst. The osmotic threshold for the release of vasopressin is lower than that for thirst and also shows appreciable individual variation. Sustained high levels of vasopressin and low hydration induce morphological and functional changes in the kidney. However, they could also be risk factors in several renal disorders, such as chronic renal failure, diabetic nephropathy and salt-sensitive hypertension.

### Renal handling of albumin: a critical review of basic concepts and perspective [^114WgVFF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Biochemical and physiological processes that underlie the mechanism of albuminuria are completely reassessed in this article in view of recent discoveries that filtered proteins undergo rapid degradation during renal passage and the resulting excreted peptide fragments are not detected by conventional urine protein assays. This means that filtered protein and/or albumin levels in urine have been seriously underestimated. The concept that albuminuria is a result of changes in glomerular permeability is questioned in light of these findings and also in terms of a critical examination of charge selectivity, shunts, or large-pore formation and hemodynamic effects. The glomerulus appears to function merely in terms of size selectivity alone, and for albumin, this does not change significantly in disease states. Intensive albumin processing by a living kidney occurs through cellular processes distal to the glomerular basement membrane. Failure of this cellular processing primarily leads to albuminuria. This review brings together recent data about urinary albumin clearance and current knowledge of receptors known to process albumin in both health and disease states. We conclude with a discussion of topical and controversial issues associated with the proposed new understanding of renal handling of albumin.

### Novel concepts in nephron sodium transport: a physiological and clinical perspective [^11134if7]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

The kidneys play a critical role in maintaining total body sodium (Na +) balance across a wide range of dietary intake, accomplished by a concerted effort involving multiple Na + transporters along the nephron. Furthermore, nephron Na + reabsorption and urinary Na + excretion are closely linked to renal blood flow and glomerular filtration such that perturbations in either of them can modify Na + transport along the nephron, ultimately resulting in hypertension and other Na + -retentive states. In this article, we provide a brief physiological overview of nephron Na + transport and illustrate clinical syndromes and therapeutic agents that affect Na + transporter function. We highlight recent advances in kidney Na + transport, particularly the role of immune cells, lymphatics, and interstitial Na + in regulating Na + reabsorption, the emergence of potassium (K +) as a regulator of Na + transport, and the evolution of the nephron to modulate Na + transport.

### Torsemide (demadex) [^1122UXue]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanism of Action

Micropuncture studies in animals have shown that torsemide acts
from within the lumen of the thick ascending portion of the loop of Henle, where
it inhibits the Na+/K+/2CI — carrier system. Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed
this site of action in humans, and effects in other segments of the nephron have
not been demonstrated. Diuretic activity thus correlates better with the rate of
drug excretion in the urine than with the concentration in the blood.

Torsemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but
it does not significantly alter glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow,
or acid-base balance.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

The bioavailability of DEMADEX tablets is approximately 80%, with
little intersubject variation; the 90% confidence interval is 75% to 89%. The
drug is absorbed with little first-pass metabolism, and the serum concentration
reaches its peak (Cmax) within 1 hour after oral
administration. Cmaxand area under the serum
concentration-time curve (AUC) after oral administration are proportional to
dose over the range of 2.5 mg to 200 mg. Simultaneous food intake delays the
time to Cmaxby about 30 minutes, but overall
bioavailability (AUC) and diuretic activity are unchanged. Absorption is
essentially unaffected by renal or hepatic dysfunction.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide [^111e82YR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In man, absorption of metoprolol HCT is rapid and complete. Plasma levels following oral administration, however, approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism.

Hydrochlorothiazide is rapidly absorbed, as indicated by peak plasma concentrations 1 to 2.5 hours after oral administration. Plasma levels of the drug are proportional to dose; the concentration in whole blood is 1.6 to 1.8 times higher than in plasma.

Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic potency. Thiazides increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis causes a secondary loss of potassium.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not affect normal blood pressure.

Effect of Food

Gastrointestinal absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is enhanced when administered with food. Absorption is decreased in patients with congestive heart failure, and the pharmacokinetics are considerably different in these patients.

Distribution

Plasma levels achieved are highly variable after oral administration. Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin. Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers. Less than 5% of an oral dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no clinical significance.

### Urine podocyte mRNAs mark disease activity in IgA nephropathy [^114tHDQn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Podocyte depletion is a major mechanism driving glomerulosclerosis. We and others have previously projected from model systems that podocyte-specific mRNAs in the urine pellet might serve as glomerular disease markers. We evaluated IgA nephropathy (IgAN) to test this concept.

Methods

From 2009 to 2013, early morning voided urine samples and kidney biopsies from IgAN patients (n = 67) were evaluated in comparison with urine samples from healthy age-matched volunteers (n = 28). Urine podocyte (podocin) mRNA expressed in relation to either urine creatinine concentration or a kidney tubular marker (aquaporin 2) was tested as markers.

Results

Urine podocyte mRNAs were correlated with the severity of active glomerular lesions (segmental glomerulosclerosis and acute extracapillary proliferation), but not with non-glomerular lesions (tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis) or with clinical parameters of kidney injury (serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate), or with degree of accumulated podocyte loss at the time of biopsy. In contrast, proteinuria correlated with all histological and clinical markers. Glomerular tuft podocyte nuclear density (a measure of cumulative podocyte loss) correlated with tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, estimated-glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria, but not with urine podocyte markers. In a subset of the IgA cohort (n = 19, median follow-up period = 37 months), urine podocyte mRNAs were significantly decreased after treatment, in contrast to proteinuria which was not significantly changed.

Conclusions

Urine podocyte mRNAs reflect active glomerular injury at a given point in time, and therefore provide both different and additional clinical information that can complement proteinuria in the IgAN decision-making paradigm.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^111xF4ad]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Research recommendations of interest — Less critical issues include the development of prediction instruments to allow estimation of time to symptomatic kidney failure on the basis of serial GFR estimates, and less critical questions include measurement of patient preferences about the tradeoffs between the burdens and benefits of earlier therapy; investigation of dialysis creatinine kinetics would help assess the effect of muscle mass on outcome and compare somatic with visceral body mass as risk factors for survival, and studies of large patient populations to correlate urine output with RKF would help determine whether urine volume-related cutoff values for ignoring RKF are useful; although potential insults listed in CPR Table 16 are known to injure normal and partially damaged native kidneys, little is known about the threshold concentrations and duration of exposure required to incite each insult in patients with CKD stage 5, it is unlikely that controlled clinical trials will appear in the near future; therefore, observational studies are encouraged; the benefits of RKF may relate more to renal mass than urine volume, this possibility should be considered in outcome studies, and correlating kidney size with RKF may help determine whether RKF is predictable based on size.

### Chemical and physical sensors in the regulation of renal function [^117HkMPn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

In order to assess the status of the volume and composition of the body fluid compartment, the kidney monitors a wide variety of chemical and physical parameters. It has recently become clear that the kidney's sensory capacity extends well beyond its ability to sense ion concentrations in the forming urine. The kidney also keeps track of organic metabolites derived from a surprising variety of sources and uses a complex interplay of physical and chemical sensing mechanisms to measure the rate of fluid flow in the nephron. Recent research has provided new insights into the nature of these sensory mechanisms and their relevance to renal function.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 200 mg) [^11178ec8]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of celecoxib is believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, primarily via inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and at therapeutic concentrations in humans, celecoxib does not inhibit the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) isoenzyme. In animal colon tumor models, celecoxib reduced the incidence and multiplicity of tumors.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Platelets: In clinical trials using normal volunteers, celecoxib at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for up to 7 days duration (higher than recommended therapeutic doses) had no effect on reduction of platelet aggregation or increase in bleeding time. Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. It is not known if there are any effects of celecoxib on platelets that may contribute to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events associated with the use of celecoxib.

Fluid Retention: Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis may lead to sodium and water retention through increased reabsorption in the renal medullary thick ascending loop of Henle and perhaps other segments of the distal nephron. In the collecting ducts, PGE2 appears to inhibit water reabsorption by counteracting the action of antidiuretic hormone.

### Cefoxitin [^113f4p2y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Following an intravenous dose of 1 gram, serum concentrations were 110 mcg/mL at 5 minutes, declining to less than 1 mcg/mL at 4 hours. The half-life after an intravenous dose is 41 to 59 minutes. Approximately 85 percent of cefoxitin is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 6-hour period, resulting in high urinary concentrations. Probenecid slows tubular excretion and produces higher serum levels and increases the duration of measurable serum concentrations.

Cefoxitin passes into pleural and joint fluids and is detectable in antibacterial concentrations in bile. In a published study of geriatric patients ranging in age from 64 to 88 years with normal renal function for their age (creatinine clearance ranging from 31.5 to 174.0 mL/min), the half-life for cefoxitin ranged from 51 to 90 minutes, resulting in higher plasma concentrations than in younger adults. These changes were attributed to decreased renal function associated with the aging process.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Cefoxitin is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cefoxitin has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance

Resistance to cefoxitin is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Cefoxitin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)

Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)

Streptococcus agalactiae

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus pyogenes

Gram-negative bacteria

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae

Klebsiella spp.

Morganella morganii

Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Proteus mirabilis

Proteus vulgaris

Providencia spp.

Anaerobic bacteria

Clostridium spp.

Peptococcus niger

Peptostreptococcus spp.

Bacteroides spp.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

At least 90 percent of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for cefoxitin. However, the efficacy of cefoxitin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Gram-negative bacteria

Eikenella corrodens (non-β-lactamase producers)

Anaerobic bacteria

Clostridium perfringens

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^116WHuDE]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition in children admitted to hospital and existing serum and urine biomarkers are insensitive. There have been significant developments in stratifying the risk of AKI in children and also in the identification of new AKI biomarkers. Risk stratification coupled with a panel of AKI biomarkers will improve future detection of AKI, however, paediatric validation studies in mixed patient cohorts are required. The principles of effective management rely on treating the underlying cause and preventing secondary AKI by the appropriate use of fluids and medication. Further therapeutic innovation will depend on improving our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying AKI in children.

### Spot urinary citrate-to-creatinine ratio is a marker for acid-base status in chronic kidney disease [^113EnbaD]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Due to multiple compensating mechanisms, the serum bicarbonate concentration is a relatively insensitive marker of acid-base status; especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is a major drawback that impairs the ability to diagnose acid excess or monitor alkali therapy. We postulated that it is more logical to measure the compensatory defense mechanism(s) rather than the defended parameter, which remains normal if the compensation is successful. Therefore, a retrospective cross-sectional study was performed in 1733 stone formers along with a prospective cross-sectional study of 22 individuals with normal kidney function and 50 patients in different stages of CKD. While serum bicarbonate was flat and did not fall below the reference range until near CKD stage 5, citrate excretion (24-hour urinary citrate excretion rate; urinary citrate-to-creatinine ratio, in the retrospective analysis, and spot urinary citrate-to-creatinine ratio in the prospective study) progressively and significantly declined starting from CKD stage 2. Following an acute acid load in 25 participants with a wide range of estimated glomerular filtration rates, the urinary citrate-to-creatinine ratio inversely and significantly associated with acid accumulation, whereas serum bicarbonate did not. We compared changes in serum bicarbonate and urinary citrate-to-creatinine ratio in response to alkali therapy in patients with CKD stage 3 or 4 started on potassium citrate in our kidney stone database. With alkali therapy, there was no change in serum bicarbonate, but the urinary citrate-to-creatinine ratio rose consistently in all patients adherent to potassium citrate therapy. Thus, the urinary citrate-to-creatinine ratio (the defense mechanism) is a potential easily implementable, pragmatic, and a superior parameter to serum bicarbonate (the defended entity) to assess acid-base status, and monitor alkali therapy. Additional studies are needed before a clinical test can be devised.

### Intrarenal urea recycling leads to a higher rate of renal excretion of potassium: an hypothesis with clinical implications [^1179ki6f]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to illustrate why urea recycling may play an important role in potassium (K⁺) excretion and to emphasize its potential clinical implications.

Recent Findings

A quantitative analysis of the process of intrarenal urea recycling reveals that the amount of urea delivered to the distal convoluted tubule is about two-fold larger than the quantity of urea excreted in the urine. As the number of osmoles delivered to the late cortical distal nephron (CCD) determines its flow rate when aquaporin 2 water channels have been inserted in the luminal membrane of principal cells, urea recycling may play an important role in regulating the rate of excretion of K⁺ when the distal delivery of electrolytes is not very high.

Summary

Urea recycling aids the excretion of K⁺; this is especially important in patients with disorders or those who are taking drugs that lead to a less lumen-negative voltage in the CCD. As a large quantity of urea is reabsorbed daily in the inner medullary collecting duct, the assumption made in the calculation of the transtubular K concentration gradient that there is no appreciable reabsorption of osmoles downstream CCD is not valid.

### Effects of the environment on the evolution of the vertebrate urinary tract [^111uv3Zn]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2023). High credibility.

Evolution of the vertebrate urinary system occurs in response to numerous selective pressures, which have been incompletely characterized. Developing research into urinary evolution led to the occurrence of clinical applications and insights in paediatric urology, reproductive medicine, urolithiasis and other domains. Each nephron segment and urinary organ has functions that can be contextualized within an evolutionary framework. For example, the structure and function of the glomerulus and proximal tubule are highly conserved, enabling blood cells and proteins to be retained, and facilitating the elimination of oceanic Ca + and Mg +. Urea emerged as an osmotic mediator during evolution, as cells of large organisms required increased precision in the internal regulation of salinity and solutes. As the first vertebrates moved from water to land, acid-base regulation was shifted from gills to skin and kidneys in amphibians. In reptiles and birds, solute regulation no longer occurred through the skin but through nasal salt glands and post-renally, within the cloaca and the rectum. In placental mammals, nasal salt glands are absent and the rectum and urinary tracts became separate, which limited post-renal urine concentration and led to the necessity of a kidney capable of high urine concentration. Considering the evolutionary and environmental selective pressures that have contributed to renal evolution can help to gain an increased understanding of renal physiology.

### Pretransplant urine cytokine pattern predicts acute kidney rejection [^1128isJA]. Cytokine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute rejection (AR) remains a major problem after kidney transplantation and crucial determinant of long-term graft function. Potent mediators of alloimmune response leading to AR are cytokines. To further explore the relation between cytokine pattern and frequency of AR episodes we analyzed Th1/Th2 cytokine concentrations in the urine of 44 patients prior to the kidney transplantation. During the 6-month period following the transplantation AR was diagnosed in 11 patients. Urine samples were collected 1day before the transplantation. Samples were cytometrically tested for concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Analysis showed significantly higher pretransplant concentrations of IFN-gamma (P > .001), TNF-alpha (P < .05) and IL-10 (P < .001) in the urine of patients with diagnosed AR. No significant differences in the concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 between the two groups were observed. Elevated pretransplant concentrations of urine IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in AR patients, not accompanied by higher concentrations of IL-2, may suggest an ongoing undetected and local, non-specific Th1 immune response, capable of amplifying the alloimmune response in the early phase postsurgery. While higher concentrations of IL-10 can partially result from activation of monocytes/macrophages, and partially from peripheral regulatory mechanisms controlling the ongoing immune reaction.

### Mechanisms to concentrate the urine: an opinion [^112YNcoH]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our goal is to suggest how the renal concentrating mechanism is regulated in vivo.

Recent Findings

The majority of descending thin limbs of the loop of Henle lack aquaporin-1 water channels, and loops of Henle in the inner medulla lack urea transporters.

Summary

Lack of water permeability in the descending thin limbs of the loop of Henle offers several advantages. First, since much less water is added to the outer medullary interstitial compartment, inhibitory control mechanisms on sodium and chloride reabsorption from the medullary thick ascending of loop of Henle initiated by water addition from the medullary collecting duct can be effective. Second, recycling of urea is efficient, as little urea will be washed out of the medulla. Third, delivery of a larger volume of filtrate to the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle permits both an appreciable reabsorption of sodium along with only a small fall in the luminal concentration of sodium in each of these liters. Hence there need be only a small lumen positive voltage in the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The absence of urea transporters in the loop of Henle in the inner medulla is required for a passive mechanism of sodium and chloride reabsorption in the inner medulla. Control of urea reabsorption from the medullary collecting duct is needed to prevent excessive oliguria in electrolyte-poor urine.

### Earlier recognition of nephrotoxicity using novel biomarkers of acute kidney injury [^116XQY5k]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Context

A broad range of drugs and chemicals are capable of evoking acute kidney injury, which is conventionally determined by rising serum creatinine concentrations. However there are important limitations to this approach, and there has been interest in alternative biomarkers that might provide a more sensitive and rapid means of detecting acute kidney injury. Most of the available clinical data have thus far been ascertained in patients requiring critical care or with acute sepsis. However, if a sensitive indicator of acute kidney injury were developed, then this could provide a significantly improved means of detecting the effects of acute drug or toxin exposure.

Objective

To review the available data concerning potential biomarkers of acute kidney injury and to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses in comparison to existing methods based on serum creatinine concentrations. A large number of possible biomarkers have been proposed. Evidence for individual biomarkers is reviewed with a particular emphasis on those with potential application in clinical toxicology. Where available, comparative data are presented.

Methods

There were 236 papers identified using Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar databases, of which 52 were considered directly relevant. CREATININE: Creatinine is subject to glomerular filtration and, to a lesser extent tubular secretion. Serum concentrations are an insensitive marker of acute kidney injury, and the speed of an increase from baseline depends on the magnitude of the acute injury and pre-existing kidney functional reserve. A wide range of inter-individual concentrations means that single time-point determinations are difficult to interpret, and acute kidney injury may not manifest as a detectable increase in serum creatinine concentrations until at least 24–48 h after the primary insult. KIDNEY ENZYMES: Enzymes are often localised to specific anatomical locations, and acute injury may cause a detectable increase in urinary activity due to up-regulated activity or leakage due to cell membrane disruption. Key examples include gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), which are found predominantly in the proximal tubule and urinary enzyme activity increases after acute exposure to heavy metals and other nephrotoxins. NEUTROPHIL GELATINASE-ASSOCIATED LIPOCALIN: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is expressed by renal tubular epithelium, and a rise in urinary concentrations may provide an indicator of acute renal injury caused by any one of a broad range of provoking factors that is detectable before a rise in serum creatinine concentrations. CYSTATIN C: Serum and urinary cystatin C concentrations are closely related to kidney function and, for example, in acute tubular necrosis allow better prediction of the need for renal replacement therapy than serum creatinine concentrations. KIDNEY INJURY MOLECULE 1: Kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) is expressed in the proximal tubule in the setting of acute ischaemia. For example, urinary KIM-1 concentrations becomes detectable within 24 h of acute tubular necrosis. Urinary KIM-1 expression may be detected after exposure to a variety of nephrotoxic agents, even when serum creatinine concentrations do not increase, and this has been accepted by regulatory authorities as a sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury during early drug development.

Conclusions

Novel biomarkers appear capable of offering a more sensitive means of detecting acute kidney injury than existing approaches. Certain of these allow discrimination between the various mechanisms and anatomical site of acute injury. Ultimately, clinical assessment might incorporate a panel of different biomarkers, each informing on the integrated aspects of glomerular, tubular and interstitial function. Presence of biomarkers may in some cases detect mild or transient renal dysfunction that is presently undetected, and the clinical relevance needs further exploration. Whilst many potentially useful biomarkers have been proposed, comparatively few clinical data exist to support their validity in routine practice. Further prospective clinical studies are required to examine the validity of biomarkers after acute drug or toxin exposure, and to establish whether they might offer improved clinical outcomes in the setting of clinical toxicology.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide (Lopressor HCT) [^113x8LtL]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In man, absorption of metoprolol HCT is rapid and complete. Plasma levels following oral administration, however, approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism.

Hydrochlorothiazide is rapidly absorbed, as indicated by peak plasma concentrations 1 to 2.5 hours after oral administration. Plasma levels of the drug are proportional to dose; the concentration in whole blood is 1.6 to 1.8 times higher than in plasma.

Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic potency. Thiazides increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis causes a secondary loss of potassium.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not affect normal blood pressure.

Effect of Food

Gastrointestinal absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is enhanced when administered with food. Absorption is decreased in patients with congestive heart failure, and the pharmacokinetics are considerably different in these patients.

Distribution

Plasma levels achieved are highly variable after oral administration. Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin. Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers. Less than 5% of an oral dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no clinical significance. The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. Consequently, no reduction in dosage is usually needed in patients with chronic renal failure.

### Trafficking and regulation of the NKCC2 cotransporter in the thick ascending limb [^115jkajK]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The kidney Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) is essential for urinary concentration and renal electrolyte handling. Loss of function mutations in the NKCC2 gene cause urinary salt and potassium wasting, whereas excessive NKCC2 function has been linked to high blood pressure. Loop diuretics, targeting the transporter, are instrumental for relieving edema or hypertension. This review focuses on intrinsic mechanisms regulating NKCC2 activity at the posttranslational level, namely its trafficking and phosphorylation.

Recent Findings

Protein networks mediating cellular turnover of NKCC2 have recently received major attention. Several key components of its apical trafficking were identified, including respective chaperones, SNARE protein family members and raft-associated proteins. NKCC2 internalization has been characterized qualitatively and quantitatively. Kinase and phosphatase pathways regulating NKCC2 activity have been clarified and links between NKCC2 phosphorylation and trafficking proposed. Constitutive and inducible NKCC2 trafficking and phosphorylation mechanisms have been specified with focus on endocrine control of thick ascending limb (TAL) function by vasopressin.

Summary

Proper NKCC2 trafficking and phosphorylation are critical to the TAL function in the physiological context of urinary concentration and extracellular volume regulation. Clarification of the underlying mechanisms and respective protein networks may open new therapeutic perspectives for better management of renal electrolyte disorders and blood pressure control.

### Iopamidol (Isovue) [^113f2iVu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Intravascular injection of iopamidol opacifies those vessels where the contrast agent is present, permitting radiographic visualization through attenuation of photons.

In imaging of the body, iodinated contrast agents diffuse from the vessels into the extravascular space. In normal brain with an intact blood-brain barrier, contrast does not diffuse into the extravascular space. In patients with a disrupted blood-brain barrier, contrast agent accumulates in the extravascular space in the region of disruption.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Following administration of ISOVUE,
the degree of enhancement is related to the iodine concentration in
the tissue of interest. However, the exposure-response relationships
and time course of pharmacodynamic response of iopamidol have not
been fully characterized.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

Plasma concentrations of iodine fall within 5 to 10 minutes due to distribution into the vascular and extracellular fluid compartments. Equilibration with the extracellular compartments is reached in about 10 minutes.

The apparent volume of distribution suggests that iopamidol is distributed evenly between blood and extracellular fluid. Iopamidol may be visualized in the renal parenchyma within 30 to 60 seconds following rapid intravenous administration. Iopamidol did not bind to serum or plasma proteins at 1 hour after administration.

Elimination

The plasma half-life is approximately 2 hours; the half-life is not dose dependent.

Metabolism

Iopamidol does not undergo significant metabolism, deiodination, or biotransformation.

Excretion

Iopamidol is excreted primarily through the kidneys. In patients with normal renal function, the cumulative urinary excretion for iopamidol, expressed as a percentage of administered intravenous dose, is approximately 35% to 40% at 60 minutes, 80% to 90% at 8 hours, and 90% or greater in the 72- to 96- hour period after administration. In patients with normal renal function, approximately 1% or less of the administered dose appears in cumulative 72- to 96-hour fecal samples.

### Potassium chloride oral (Potassium chloride) [^115dNRSY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The potassium ion (K+) is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function.

The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent, and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Based on published literature, the rate of absorption and urinary excretion of potassium from KCl oral solution were higher during the first few hours after dosing relative to modified release KCl products. The bioavailability of potassium, as measured by the cumulative urinary excretion of K+over a 24-hour post dose period, is similar for KCl solution and modified release products.

### Salt-losing tubulopathies in children: what's new, what's controversial? [^1166MPZ1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal tubulopathies provide insights into the inner workings of the kidney, yet also pose therapeutic challenges. Because of the central nature of sodium in tubular transport physiology, disorders of sodium handling may affect virtually all aspects of the homeostatic functions of the kidney. Yet, owing to the rarity of these disorders, little clinical evidence regarding treatment exists. Consequently, treatment can vary widely between individual physicians and centers and is based mainly on understanding of renal physiology, reported clinical observations, and individual experiences. Salt-losing tubulopathies can affect all tubular segments, from the proximal tubule to the collecting duct. But the more frequently observed disorders are Bartter and Gitelman syndrome, which affect salt transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and/or the distal convoluted tubule, and these disorders generate the greatest controversies regarding management. Here, we review clinical and molecular aspects of salt-losing tubulopathies and discuss novel insights provided mainly by genetic investigations and retrospective clinical reviews. Additionally, we discuss controversial topics in the management of these disorders to highlight areas of importance for future clinical trials. International collaboration will be required to perform clinical studies to inform the treatment of these rare disorders.

### Regulation and dysregulation of aquaporins in water balance disorders [^111pFgb2]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The discovery of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) explained the long-standing biophysical question of how water specifically crosses biological membranes. These studies led to the identification of a whole new family of membrane proteins, the aquaporin water channels. At present, at least eight aquaporins are expressed at distinct sites in the kidney and four members of this family (AQP1–4) have been demonstrated to play pivotal roles in the physiology and pathophysiology for renal regulation of body water balance. In the present review, a number of inherited and acquired conditions characterized by urinary concentration defects as well as common diseases associated with severe water retention are discussed with relation to the role of aquaporins in regulation and dysregulation of renal water transport.

### Effects of the renal medullary pH and ionic environment on vasopressin binding and signaling [^115WmrTT]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The kidney has a cortico-medullary interstitial gradient of decreasing pH and increasing concentrations of sodium chloride and urea, but the influence of these gradients on receptor signaling is largely unknown. Here, we measured G-protein coupled receptor function in LLC-PK1 cells acutely exposed to conditions mimicking different kidney regions. Signaling through the parathyroid hormone receptor, normally expressed in the cortex, was greatly reduced at an acidic pH similar to that of the inner medulla. Parathyroid hormone receptor, tagged with green fluorescent protein, showed no ligand-induced internalization. In contrast, under both acidic and hyperosmotic conditions, vasopressin increased intracellular cAMP, and upon binding to its type 2 receptor (V2R) was internalized and degraded. Dose-displacement binding assays with selective vasopressin/oxytocin receptor ligands under inner medullary conditions indicated a shift in the V2R pharmacological profile. Oxytocin did not bind to the V2R, as it does under normal conditions and the vasopressin type 1 receptor (V1R) had reduced affinity for vasopressin compared to the V2R in low pH and high osmolality. We suggest that the cortico-medullary gradient causes a receptor-specific selectivity in ligand binding that is of functional significance to the kidney. While the gradient is important for urinary concentration, it may also play a substantial role in fine-tuning of the vasopressin response through the V2R.

### Modeling physiology of the urinary tract [^113TmFz7]. Journal of Endourology (2007). Low credibility.

We review mathematical and physical models of physiology of the organs of the urinary tract and their functions of producing, excreting, and voiding urine. Models for urine concentration in the kidney, urine flow in the ureters, bladder filling and emptying, urethral function during micturition, pelvic floor muscles, and neural control are reviewed in the context of their application to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. The focus of this review is on modeling of physiology and function at the tissue and organ level, as almost all research to date has been done in those areas. Although physiological models of the lower urinary tract are in their infancy, they have the long-term potential to improve our understanding of physiological mechanisms, as well as to provide environments for simulation or testing in silico of new therapies and techniques.

### Paracellular transport and renal tubule calcium handling: emerging roles in kidney stone disease [^113BDew6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The kidney plays a major role in maintenance of serum calcium concentration, which must be kept within a narrow range to avoid disruption of numerous physiologic processes that depend critically on the level of extracellular calcium, including cell signaling, bone structure, and muscle and nerve function. This defense of systemic calcium homeostasis comes, however, at the expense of the dumping of calcium into the kidney tissue and urine. Because of the large size and multivalency of the calcium ion, its salts are the least soluble among all the major cations in the body. The potential pathologic consequences of this are nephrocalcinosis and kidney stone disease. In this review, we discuss recent advances that have highlighted critical roles for the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb in renal calcium reabsorption, elucidated the molecular mechanisms for paracellular transport in these segments, and implicated disturbances in these processes in human disease.

### Glycogen synthase kinase-3 regulation of urinary concentrating ability [^115ns9RL]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is an enzyme that is gaining prominence as a critical signaling molecule in the epithelial cells of renal tubules. This review will focus on recent findings exploring the role of GSK3 in renal collecting ducts, especially its role in urine concentration involving vasopressin signaling.

Recent Findings

Recent studies using inhibition or tissue-specific gene deletion of GSK3 revealed the mechanism by which GSK3 regulates aquaporin 2 water channels via adenylate cyclase or the prostaglandin-E2 pathway. In other studies, postnatal treatment with lithium, an inhibitor of GSK3, increased cell proliferation and led to microcyst formation in rat kidneys. These studies suggest that loss of GSK3 activity could interfere with renal water transport at two levels. In the short term, it could disrupt vasopressin signaling in collecting duct cells and in the long term it could alter the structure of the collecting ducts, making them less responsive to the hydro-osmotic effects of vasopressin.

Summary

Ongoing studies reveal the crucial role played by GSK3 in the regulation of vasopressin action in the renal collecting ducts and suggest a possible use of GSK3 inhibitors in disease conditions associated with disrupted vasopressin signaling.

### Technetium tc 99m mertiatide [^111J4pcP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Following intravenous administration for renal imaging, Technetium Tc 99m Mertiatide is rapidly cleared from the blood. It is cleared by the kidneys and excreted in the urine.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Following intravenous injection of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide, the uptake, concentration, and excretion of the tracer by the kidney can be monitored to assess renal function.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution

After an intravenous administration in healthy adult subjects, 89% of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide was plasma-protein bound. The protein binding is reversible.

Elimination

Excretion

In healthy subjects, the plasma clearance was approximately 0.3 liters/minute and the amount of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide excreted in the urine in 3 hours was nearly 90% of the injected dose.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

In a study performed in three patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than 6.3 mg/dL), 78% of the tracer was plasma protein bound after intravenous injection. The mean plasma clearance of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide was 0.03 liters/minute and 21.3% was excreted in 3 hours on average. In both healthy subjects and patients with renal impairment, the plasma concentration-time profile showed a biexponential decline.

### ASN kidney health guidance on potassium and phosphorus food additives [^114XbkSR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Potassium additives — clinical relevance and homeostasis — Higher potassium consumption is shown to be associated with cardiovascular and kidney health, but as kidney function declines the risk of hyperkalemia increases and potassium additives are often overlooked as a source of potassium intake. There is strong evidence that dietary potassium can acutely raise serum potassium levels in the postprandial period, and once absorbed, potassium is shifted into the cells in an insulin-dependent and aldosterone-dependent process. Ingested potassium stimulates an acute kaliuretic response through feed-forward and feedback mechanisms with natriuretic effects, but these regulatory mechanisms are impaired as kidney function declines and are further blunted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### State-of-the-art-review: mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical implications [^1139Z5Zy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhibitors of the Na+-coupled glucose transporter SGLT2 (SGLT2i) primarily shift the reabsorption of large amounts of glucose from the kidney's early proximal tubule to downstream tubular segments expressing SGLT1, and the non-reabsorbed glucose is spilled into the urine together with some osmotic diuresis. How can this protect the kidneys and heart from failing as observed in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes?

Goal

Mediation analyses identified clinical phenotypes of SGLT2i associated with improved kidney and heart outcome, including a reduction of plasma volume or increase in hematocrit, and lowering of serum urate levels and albuminuria. This review outlines how primary effects of SGLT2i on the early proximal tubule can explain these phenotypes.

Results

The physiology of tubule-glomerular communication provides the basis for acute lowering of GFR and glomerular capillary pressure, which contributes to lowering of albuminuria but also to long term preservation of GFR, at least in part by reducing kidney cortex oxygen demand. Functional co-regulation of SGLT2 with other sodium and metabolite transporters in the early proximal tubule explains why SGLT2i initially excrete more sodium than expected and are uricosuric, thereby reducing plasma volume and serum urate. Inhibition of SGLT2 reduces early proximal tubule gluco-toxicity and by shifting transport downstream may simulate "systemic hypoxia", and the resulting increase in erythropoiesis, together with the osmotic diuresis, enhances hematocrit and improves blood oxygen delivery. Cardio-renal protection by SGLT2i is also provided by a fasting-like and insulin-sparing metabolic phenotype and, potentially, by off-target effects on the heart and microbiotic formation of uremic toxins.

### Potassium chloride (Pokonza) [^112gpwSW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The potassium ion (K+) is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function.

The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Specific Populations

Cirrhotics

Based on published literature, the baseline corrected serum concentrations of potassium measured over 3 h after administration in cirrhotic subjects who received an oral potassium load rose to approximately twice that of normal subjects who received the same load.

### Sodium phosphate, monobasic, monohydrate (sodium phosphates) [^115S5tSq]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Intravenously infused phosphate not taken up by the tissues is excreted almost entirely in the urine. Plasma phosphate is believed to be filterable by the renal glomeruli, and the major portion of filtered phosphate (greater than 80%) is actively reabsorbed by the tubules. Many modifying influences tend to alter the amount excreted in the urine.

Sodium is the principal cation of extracellular fluid. It comprises more than 90% of the total cations at its normal plasma concentration of approximately 142 mEq/L. While the sodium ion can diffuse across cell membranes, intracellular sodium is maintained at a much lower concentration than extracellular sodium through the expenditure of energy by the cell (so-called "sodium cation pump"). Loss of intracellular potassium ion is usually accompanied by an increase in intracellular sodium ion.

When serum sodium concentration is low, the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary is inhibited, thereby preventing water reabsorption by the distal renal tubules. On the other hand, adrenal secretion of aldosterone increases renal tubular reabsorption of sodium in an effort to re-establish normal serum sodium concentration.

### Thick ascending limb of the loop of henle [^116BRByo]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The thick ascending limb occupies a central anatomic and functional position in human renal physiology, with critical roles in the defense of the extracellular fluid volume, the urinary concentrating mechanism, calcium and magnesium homeostasis, bicarbonate and ammonium homeostasis, and urinary protein composition. The last decade has witnessed tremendous progress in the understanding of the molecular physiology and pathophysiology of this nephron segment. These advances are the subject of this review, with emphasis on particularly recent developments.

### Hypophosphatemia: an evidence-based approach to its clinical consequences and management [^115JQAXe]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Optimal cellular function is dependent on maintenance of a normal serum phosphorus concentration. Serum phosphorus concentration is affected by several determinants, the most important of which is regulation of phosphorus reabsorption by the kidney. The majority of this reabsorption (80%) occurs in the proximal tubule and is mediated by an isoform of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-II). Parathyroid hormone, via a variety of intracellular signaling cascades leading to NaPi-IIa internalization and downregulation, is the main regulator of renal phosphate reabsorption. Shift of phosphorus from extracellular to intracellular compartments, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, and increased urinary losses, are the primary mechanisms of hypophosphatemia, which affects approximately 2% of hospitalized patients. Hypophosphatemia has been implicated as a cause of rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, hemolysis and left ventricular dysfunction. With the exception of ventilated patients, there is little evidence that moderate hypophosphatemia has significant clinical consequences in humans, and aggressive intravenous phosphate replacement is unnecessary. By contrast, patients with severe hypophosphatemia should be treated. Intravenous repletion may be considered, especially for patients who have clinical sequelae of hypophosphatemia.

### Urinary tract infections in patients with chronic renal insufficiency [^111eJNGy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite an increasing population of patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the literature on the management of urinary tract infections (UTI) in these patients is sparse. Patients with underlying diabetes are a specific population at risk. Antimicrobial treatment of UTI requires adequate serum, renal, parenchymal, and urine concentrations of drugs with antibacterial activity versus the etiologic organism. Sulfamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin are examples of drugs with low and likely inadequate urine concentrations in patients with creatinine clearances of < 50 ml/min. Urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin remain sufficient as renal function fails, whereas the concentrations of gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin are too low to predict efficacy. More investigative work is needed in the management of UTI in patients with poor renal function.

### Advances in renal (patho) physiology using multiphoton microscopy [^113h7Lcv]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Multiphoton excitation fluorescence microscopy is a state-of-the-art confocal imaging technique ideal for deep optical sectioning of living tissues. It is capable of performing ultrasensitive, quantitative imaging of organ functions in health and disease with high spatial and temporal resolution which other imaging modalities cannot achieve. For more than a decade, multiphoton microscopy has been successfully used with various in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches to study many functions of different organs, including the kidney. This study focuses on recent advances in our knowledge of renal (patho)physiological processes made possible by the use of this imaging technology. Visualization of cellular variables like cytosolic calcium, pH, cell-to-cell communication and signal propagation, interstitial fluid flow in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), real-time imaging of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), and renin release mechanisms are reviewed. A brief summary is provided of kidney functions that can be measured by in vivo quantitative multiphoton imaging including glomerular filtration and permeability, concentration, dilution, and activity of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system using this minimally invasive approach. New visual data challenge a number of existing paradigms in renal (patho)physiology. Also, quantitative imaging of kidney function with multiphoton microscopy has tremendous potential to eventually provide novel non-invasive diagnostic and therapeutic tools for future applications in clinical nephrology.

### Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2 metabolizes endogenous methylarginines, regulates NO, and controls blood pressure [^114WF35o]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymmetric dimethylarginine is an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthesis that may mediate cardiovascular disease. Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2 (AGXT2) has been proposed to degrade asymmetric dimethylarginine. We investigated the significance of AGXT2 in methylarginine metabolism in vivo and examined the effect of this enzyme on blood pressure.

Methods and Results

In isolated mouse kidney mitochondria, we show asymmetric dimethylarginine deamination under physiological conditions. We demonstrate increased asymmetric dimethylarginine, reduced NO, and hypertension in an AGXT2 knockout mouse. We provide evidence for a role of AGXT2 in methylarginine metabolism in humans by demonstrating an inverse relationship between renal (allograft) gene expression and circulating substrate levels and an association between expression and urinary concentrations of the product. Finally, we examined data from a meta-analysis of blood pressure genome-wide association studies. No genome-wide significance was observed, but taking a hypothesis-driven approach, there was a suggestive association between the T allele at rs37369 (which causes a valine-isoleucine substitution and altered levels of AGXT2 substrate) and a modest increase in diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0052).

Conclusions

Although the effect of variation at rs37369 needs further study, these findings suggest that AGXT2 is an important regulator of methylarginines and represents a novel mechanism through which the kidney regulates blood pressure.

### Homeostasis, the milieu intérieur, and the wisdom of the nephron [^113wHnC9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The concept of homeostasis has been inextricably linked to the function of the kidneys for more than a century when it was recognized that the kidneys had the ability to maintain the "internal milieu" and allow organisms the "physiologic freedom" to move into varying environments and take in varying diets and fluids. Early ingenious, albeit rudimentary, experiments unlocked a wealth of secrets on the mechanisms involved in the formation of urine and renal handling of the gamut of electrolytes, as well as that of water, acid, and protein. Recent scientific advances have confirmed these prescient postulates such that the modern clinician is the beneficiary of a rich understanding of the nephron and the kidney's critical role in homeostasis down to the molecular level. This review summarizes those early achievements and provides a framework and introduction for the new CJASN series on renal physiology.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115exE8A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Proximal tubular dysfunction — serum and nonspecific indicators include electrolyte and acid–base patterns and limited-specificity urinary findings. Hypokalemia is defined as serum potassium concentration below laboratory reference range and trends are of more clinical relevance than single abnormal value, but it is neither sensitive nor specific. Low serum bicarbonate is defined as serum bicarbonate concentration below laboratory reference range and is nonspecific in the setting of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Hypophosphatemia is defined as serum phosphorous concentration below laboratory reference range, and normal value does not exclude urinary phosphorous wasting; however, hypophosphatemia combined with urinary wasting is diagnostic of renal tubular injury. Other laboratory indicators listed as nonspecific include proteinuria/albuminuria and hematuria.

### Vasopressin antagonists: role in the management of hyponatremia [^111PjRuv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with potentially serious or life-threatening consequences. Serum osmolality and sodium concentration [Na+] are regulated by thirst, the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), and renal water and sodium handling. Hyponatremia is frequently caused by dysregulation of AVP, which accompanies disorders of water retention, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Clinical trials with AVP receptor antagonists have confirmed the important role of AVP in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia and suggest these agents are efficacious in treating hyponatremia associated with SIADH, cirrhosis, and CHF. Acting directly at AVP receptors in the renal tubules, these agents promote aquaresis - the electrolyte-sparing excretion of free water - in patients with hyponatremia. In clinical trials, AVP receptor antagonists have been shown to increase the serum [Na+] and urine output while decreasing urine osmolality.

### Antidiuresis therapy: mechanism of action and clinical implications [^113Xpqnq]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2007). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of micturition occur in many different diseases, have a variety of causes and take several forms. This review will focus exclusively on those abnormalities in which antidiuretic therapy may be of benefit. These conditions are primarily characterized by an increase in the total amount of urine produced (polyuria) or a circadian shift in the control of urine production and/or voiding (nocturnal enuresis, nocturia).

### Glycine [^112MYRVa]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Glycine is an amino acid and a nonelectrolyte. A solution of glycine in water is therefore nonconductive and suitable for urologic irrigation during electrosurgical procedures. A 1.5% concentration of glycine in water (200 mOsmol/liter calc.) is sufficient to minimize the risk of intravascular hemolysis which can occur from absorption of plain water through open prostatic veins during transurethral resection (TUR). It is hypotonic in relation to the extracellular fluid (280 mOsmol/liter). Any solution absorbed intravascularly during transurethral prostatic or bladder surgery, although variable in amount depending primarily on the extent of surgery, will be excreted by the kidney. Studies have shown that the absorption of glycine does not cause significant hemolysis (increase of free hemoglobin) or release significant amounts of free ammonia in the blood. Glycine is rapidly degraded in the liver by glycine oxidase.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### Vasopressin-independent renal urinary concentration: increased rBSC1 and enhanced countercurrent multiplication [^113yEG31]. Kidney International (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A close association between the expression of the sodium transporter, rat bumetanide sensitive cotransporter (rBSC), in thick ascending limb of Henle and urinary concentration has been reported. However, direct evidence for this association and the mechanism of rBSC1 expression are still to be elucidated.

Methods

Brattleboro (BB) rats weighing approximately 200 g were dehydrated by water restriction for 4 hours, which induced around a 5% body weight reduction. Although plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) was undetectable even after the water restriction, BB rats concentrated urine from 182 ± 23 (mean ± SD) at baseline to 404 ± 65 mOsm/kg. H2O.

Results

Urinary volume was reduced from 5.8 ± 1.8 to 1.4 ± 0.6 mL/h. This treatment significantly increased sodium and urea accumulation in the renal medulla and reduced urinary sodium excretion. rBSC1 signals for both mRNA and protein were increased in dehydrated rats, although aquaporin type 2 (AQP2) expression was not enhanced in dehydrated BB rats. Subcutaneous infusion of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) intensified rBSC1 signals of BB rats more than those in dehydrated condition.

Conclusion

Dehydration increased rBSC1 expression and enhanced countercurrent multiplication even in AVP deficiency. These results supply strong evidence for the association between rBSC1 expression and urinary concentration, and indicate the presence of an AVP-independent mechanism for urine concentration.

### The void in using urine concentration to assess population fluid intake adequacy or hydration status [^111HAUG4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Urine concentration can be used to assess fluid intake adequacy or to diagnose dehydration. However, too often urine concentration is used inappropriately to draw dubious conclusions that could have harmful health and economic consequences. Inappropriate uses of urine concentration relate primarily to convenience sampling (timing) and problems related to convenience sampling (misapplication of thresholds), but a conceptual problem also exists with using urine concentration in isolation. The purpose of this Perspective article is to briefly explain the problematic nature of current practices and to offer a possible solution to improve practice with minimal added complication. When urine is used exclusively to assess fluid intake adequacy and hydration status in adults, we propose that only when urine concentration is high (> 850 mmol/kg) and urine excretion rate is low (< 850 mL/24 h) should suspicion of inadequate drinking or impending dehydration be considered. Prospective tests of the 850 × 850 thresholds will provide supporting evidence and/or help refine the best thresholds for men and women, young and old.

### The use of selected urine chemistries in the diagnosis of kidney disorders [^1125mN4N]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation, but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, to include kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

### AT1 receptors in the collecting duct directly modulate the concentration of urine [^113tUZmF]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Mice lacking AT(1) angiotensin receptors have an impaired capacity to concentrate the urine, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. To determine whether direct actions of AT(1) receptors in epithelial cells of the collecting duct regulate water reabsorption, we used Cre-Loxp technology to specifically eliminate AT(1A) receptors from the collecting duct in mice (CD-KOs). Although levels of AT(1A) receptor mRNA in the inner medulla of CD-KO mice were significantly reduced, their kidneys appeared structurally normal. Under basal conditions, plasma and urine osmolalities and urine volumes were similar between CD-KO mice and controls. The increase in urine osmolality in response to water deprivation or vasopressin administration, however, was consistently attenuated in CD-KO mice. Similarly, levels of aquaporin-2 protein in inner and outer medulla after water deprivation were significantly lower in CD-KO mice compared with controls, despite its normal localization to the apical membrane. In summary, these results demonstrate that AT(1A) receptors in epithelial cells of the collecting duct directly modulate aquaporin-2 levels and contribute to the concentration of urine.

### Kidneys: key modulators of high-density lipoprotein levels and function [^113hxbqM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review will examine advances in our understanding of the role kidneys play in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism and the effect on levels, composition, and function of HDL particles.

Recent Findings

Components of the HDL particles can cross the glomerular filtration barrier. Some of these components, including apolipoproteins and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, are taken up by the proximal tubule and degraded, modified, salvaged/returned to the circulation, or lost in the urine. Injury of the glomerular capillaries or tubules can affect these intrarenal processes and modify HDL. Changes in the plasma and urine levels of HDL may be novel markers of kidney damage or mechanism(s) of kidney disease.

Summary

The kidneys have a significant role in the metabolism of individual HDL components, which in turn modulate HDL levels, composition, and functionality of HDL particles. These intrarenal effects may be useful markers of kidney damage and have consequences on kidney-related perturbations in HDL.

### Urine biomarkers of kidney tubule health, injury, and inflammation are associated with progression of CKD in children [^114vhWMB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Novel urine biomarkers may improve identification of children at greater risk of rapid kidney function decline, and elucidate the pathophysiology of CKD progression.

Methods

We investigated the relationship between urine biomarkers of kidney tubular health (EGF and α -1 microglobulin), tubular injury (kidney injury molecule-1; KIM-1), and inflammation (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1] and YKL-40) and CKD progression. The prospective CKD in Children Study enrolled children aged 6 months to 16 years with an eGFR of 30–90ml/min per 1.73 m². Urine biomarkers were assayed a median of 5 months [IQR: 4–7] after study enrollment. We indexed the biomarker to urine creatinine by dividing the urine biomarker concentration by the urine creatinine concentration to account for the concentration of the urine. The primary outcome was CKD progression (a composite of a 50% decline in eGFR or kidney failure) during the follow-up period.

Results

Overall, 252 of 665 children (38%) reached the composite outcome over a median follow-up of 6.5 years. After adjustment for covariates, children with urine EGF concentrations in the lowest quartile were at a seven-fold higher risk of CKD progression versus those with concentrations in the highest quartile (fully adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 7.1; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.9 to 20.0). Children with urine KIM-1, MCP-1, and α -1 microglobulin concentrations in the highest quartile were also at significantly higher risk of CKD progression versus those with biomarker concentrations in the lowest quartile. Addition of the five biomarkers to a clinical model increased the discrimination and reclassification for CKD progression.

Conclusions

After multivariable adjustment, a lower urine EGF concentration and higher urine KIM-1, MCP-1, and α -1 microglobulin concentrations were each associated with CKD progression in children.

### Pravastatin therapy and biomarker changes in children and young adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^117A4hrk]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Disease-specific treatment options for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are limited. Clinical intervention early in life is likely to have the greatest effect. In a 3-year randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial, the authors recently showed that pravastatin decreased height-corrected total kidney volume (HtTKV) progression of structural kidney disease over a 3-year period. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Participants were recruited nationally from July 2007 through October 2009. Plasma and urine samples collected at baseline, 18 months, and 36 months from 91 pediatric patients enrolled in the above-mentioned clinical trial were subjected to mass spectrometry-based biomarker analysis. Changes in biomarkers over 3 years were compared between placebo and pravastatin-treated groups. Linear regression was used to evaluate the changes in biomarkers with the percent change in HtTKV over 3 years.

Results

Changes in plasma concentrations of proinflammatory and oxidative stress markers (9- hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [HETE]) over 3 years were significantly different between the placebo and pravastatin-treated groups, with the pravastatin group showing a lower rate of biomarker increase. Urinary 8-HETE, 9-HETE, and 11-HETE were positively associated with the changes in HtTKV in the pravastatin group.

Conclusions

Pravastatin therapy diminished the increase of cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived plasma lipid mediators. The identified biomarkers and related molecular pathways of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction may present potential targets for monitoring of disease severity and therapeutic intervention of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
