## Question

What is the first line treatment for postpartum psychosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first-line treatment for postpartum psychosis is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why postpartum psychosis is an emergency. Then, I should verify the core treatment elements that consistently appear across guidelines and algorithms. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence for each component, especially lithium versus antipsychotics. After that, I need to check whether combination therapy is truly first-line or if monotherapy is acceptable. Finally, I should consider special circumstances like breastfeeding, ECT, and monitoring, and then synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency with rapid onset after childbirth, high risk of suicide and infanticide, and fluctuating symptoms that mandate urgent inpatient care and rapid pharmacotherapy initiation, typically within a mother–baby unit when available, so I need to ensure my treatment recommendation aligns with this acuity and risk profile [^1179vv3N] [^113tvKnD] [^113tJY8q].

> Next, I should review which treatments consistently appear as core elements. Multiple contemporary algorithms converge on three pharmacologic pillars for acute management: an antipsychotic for psychosis, lithium as the mood stabilizer with the strongest evidence in PPP, and a benzodiazepine for agitation and sleep, with ECT reserved for severe, treatment-resistant, or life-threatening presentations; I should double-check that this triad is indeed the recurring theme across sources [^116Pre3a] [^113tvKnD] [^115orjhQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about lithium's role. I initially thought lithium might be the sole first-line agent, but wait, let me verify the comparative evidence. The most robust data indicate lithium has the strongest evidence for relapse prevention and is superior to antipsychotic monotherapy for maintaining remission, with 79.7% sustained remission at 9 months in a cohort where lithium maintenance was emphasized; however, for acute symptom control, antipsychotics are essential to treat psychosis, and benzodiazepines address agitation and insomnia that can worsen the course, so lithium alone is insufficient in the acute phase despite its prophylactic strength [^114AVoxx] [^112MsYwc] [^113tvKnD].

> I need to check whether combination therapy is truly first-line or if monotherapy is acceptable. Observational cohorts using a sequential algorithm report that 98.4% achieved remission within the first three steps (benzodiazepine, then add antipsychotic, then add lithium), with the majority requiring the full triad; ECT was rarely needed in that series, reinforcing that antipsychotic plus lithium, often with a benzodiazepine, is the practical first-line acute regimen in most cases, with ECT considered earlier for catatonia, suicidality, or refractory symptoms [^112MsYwc] [^116Pre3a] [^116Rck7q].

> Let me consider special circumstances that could modify the "first-line" choice. For breastfeeding, I should confirm lithium's status; although some recent data suggest that with careful infant monitoring lithium may not be absolutely contraindicated, most guidance still advises avoiding lithium in breastfeeding due to infant exposure and the need for lab monitoring, so if lithium is deferred, antipsychotic monotherapy may be used acutely with plans to introduce lithium post-weaning; conversely, if the clinical risk is extreme, breastfeeding may need to be interrupted to permit optimal pharmacotherapy, which should be discussed transparently with the family [^111YXhbt] [^113spB2W] [^112zmCXo].

> I should double-check ECT's role. ECT achieves high response rates in postpartum affective psychosis and is particularly indicated when rapid stabilization is required for suicidality, infanticidal ideation, catatonia, or severe agitation; it is safe to continue breastfeeding after ECT, which can be decisive when rapid control is needed and pharmacotherapy is insufficient or unsafe, so earlier ECT should not be withheld in severe presentations [^116Rck7q] [^113PcDRZ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and dosing pragmatics. In the immediate postpartum period, lithium pharmacokinetics shift, so levels should be checked frequently (about twice weekly initially) with higher early postpartum targets for relapse prevention, and dose adjusted accordingly; benzodiazepine choice should favor agents with low active metabolites and minimal sedation if breastfeeding is considered, with lorazepam often preferred in this context [^114jWAug] [^115orjhQ].

> But wait, what if someone argues for antipsychotic monotherapy as sufficient first-line? I need to ensure I address that. While antipsychotic monotherapy can induce remission in a subset, relapse rates are substantially higher without lithium maintenance, and the best outcomes in cohorts were achieved with lithium-containing regimens; thus, even if antipsychotic monotherapy is used initially, adding lithium early is advisable to optimize acute response and prevent relapse, aligning with the concept that combination therapy is the de facto first-line standard in PPP [^114AVoxx] [^112MsYwc] [^113tvKnD].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final synthesis. The first-line treatment for postpartum psychosis is a combination regimen comprising an antipsychotic for psychosis, lithium as the cornerstone mood stabilizer, and a short-acting benzodiazepine for agitation and sleep, initiated urgently in an inpatient setting with close maternal–infant safety planning; ECT should be considered early for severe, treatment-resistant, or life-threatening cases, and breastfeeding decisions should be individualized with attention to lithium exposure and sleep-related relapse risk, recognizing that lithium has the strongest evidence for relapse prevention even if it complicates breastfeeding logistics [^116Pre3a] [^113tvKnD] [^116Rck7q] [^111YXhbt].

---

The first-line treatment for postpartum psychosis is **inpatient hospitalization** with initiation of an **antipsychotic plus lithium** [^113tvKnD] [^116Pre3a] [^116SfwWN]. This combination addresses both psychotic and affective symptoms and is supported by the strongest available evidence [^112MsYwc]; **ECT is reserved for severe, treatment-resistant, or life-threatening cases** [^116Rck7q] [^114AVoxx]. Benzodiazepines may be added for agitation or insomnia, and antidepressants are generally avoided in the acute phase due to risk of mood destabilization [^115orjhQ] [^113o7hc5]. Treatment should be individualized, with close monitoring of maternal and infant safety, and lithium levels checked frequently postpartum because of altered pharmacokinetics [^114jWAug] [^115mkBUq].

---

## Clinical urgency and need for hospitalization

Postpartum psychosis is a **psychiatric emergency** [^113tvKnD] characterized by rapid onset, severe mood disturbance, psychotic symptoms, and a high risk of suicide and infanticide [^1179vv3N]. Immediate **hospitalization** is essential to ensure safety, enable rapid stabilization, and facilitate close monitoring of both mother and infant [^111FZSMD]. Admission to a **mother-and-baby unit (MBU)** is preferred when available, as it supports maternal-infant bonding and provides specialized perinatal psychiatric care [^111FZSMD].

---

## Pharmacological treatment

### Antipsychotic medications

Antipsychotics are **first-line** for managing psychotic symptoms in PPP [^notfound]. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are preferred due to their favorable safety profile and lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms compared to first-generation antipsychotics [^112Gc9HT]. Commonly used SGAs include:

- **Olanzapine**: Extensive evidence supports its safety and efficacy in breastfeeding mothers, with low levels detected in breast milk and minimal reported adverse effects in infants [^111hxpq5] [^114eoMMS].

- **Quetiapine**: Low relative infant dose and favorable safety profile make it a suitable alternative [^111hxpq5] [^111E4z4F].

- **Risperidone**: May be used cautiously, but higher relative infant dose necessitates careful monitoring [^111hxpq5].

Clozapine is generally **avoided** due to significant risks, including agranulocytosis and sedation [^114eoMMS] [^114vmhBJ].

---

### Mood stabilizers

Lithium is the **mood stabilizer of choice** in PPP, with robust evidence supporting its efficacy in acute treatment and relapse prevention [^113tvKnD] [^114AVoxx]. Lithium levels should be closely monitored postpartum due to altered pharmacokinetics, with frequent serum level checks recommended in the immediate postpartum period [^114jWAug]. Although traditionally considered contraindicated in breastfeeding, recent evidence suggests that with careful monitoring, lithium may be used cautiously in breastfeeding mothers [^111YXhbt].

---

### Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, may be used short-term to manage **agitation, anxiety, and insomnia** [^115orjhQ]. They are generally considered safe in breastfeeding when used at low doses and for short durations [^115orjhQ].

---

### Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)

ECT is a **highly effective treatment** for severe, treatment-resistant, or life-threatening cases of PPP [^116Rck7q]. It is particularly indicated for patients with severe psychotic symptoms, catatonia, or significant suicide or infanticide risk. ECT has a rapid onset of action and is considered safe during the postpartum period, including in breastfeeding mothers [^116Rck7q].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently recommend the following **first-line treatment approach** for PPP:

- **Immediate hospitalization**: Preferably in a mother-and-baby unit [^113tvKnD] [^113tJY8q].

- **Initiation of antipsychotic medication**: Second-generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine or quetiapine are preferred [^111E4z4F] [^111hxpq5].

- **Addition of lithium**: Lithium is recommended as adjunctive therapy for mood stabilization and relapse prevention [^113tvKnD] [^114AVoxx].

- **Short-term use of benzodiazepines**: For agitation, anxiety, or insomnia management [^115orjhQ].

- **ECT consideration**: For severe, treatment-resistant, or life-threatening cases [^116Rck7q] [^113PcDRZ].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Treatment decisions in PPP must balance maternal and infant safety. Antipsychotic medications may pass into breast milk, albeit at low levels, and infants should be monitored for sedation, feeding difficulties, and developmental concerns [^111hxpq5] [^114eoMMS]. Lithium requires **careful monitoring** of maternal serum levels and infant renal and thyroid function if breastfeeding is continued [^111YXhbt]. ECT is generally considered safe during the postpartum period, with no significant adverse effects reported in breastfeeding infants [^116Rck7q].

---

## Prognosis and long-term management

With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for PPP is **generally favorable**, with most women achieving full remission and returning to premorbid functioning [^1127Vc9s] [^116efUhQ]. Long-term management typically involves continued pharmacological treatment, with lithium maintenance therapy recommended for relapse prevention [^113tvKnD] [^114jWAug]. Regular psychiatric follow-up, psychoeducation, and support for the mother-infant dyad are essential components of long-term care [^112NdtFf] [^116Pre3a] [^111FZSMD].

---

The first-line treatment for postpartum psychosis involves **immediate hospitalization**, initiation of antipsychotic medication, and adjunctive lithium therapy. ECT is reserved for severe or treatment-resistant cases. This approach balances rapid symptom control, safety, and long-term relapse prevention, with treatment individualized to maternal and infant needs.

Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that affects 1 to 2 per 1000 women. Key clinical features include mood fluctuation, abnormal thoughts or behaviors, and confusion. Women with a history of bipolar disorder are at heightened risk, as are first-time mothers; current research on the causes focuses on biological triggers, such as immune dysregulation. Women with postpartum psychosis require inpatient hospitalization and should be treated with lithium, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines.

Introduction

Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is a severe mental disorder with a dramatic and rapid onset of affective and psychotic symptoms in the immediate postpartum period. PPP is a psychiatric emergency that generally warrants acute inpatient care. Due to its severe and fluctuating nature, there is a significant risk to the mother and infant if left untreated, with potential for the tragic consequences of suicide or infanticide. With maternal suicide being the leading cause of direct maternal death occurring within the first postpartum year, early detection and management of postpartum mental illness is key to improving outcomes for the mother and her infant. Evidence indicates that PPP is a disorder on the bipolar spectrum in women with a vulnerability to the childbirth trigger. Although PPP is a discrete disorder on the affective disorder spectrum with a distinctive treatment profile, it is yet to be recognised as a separate nosological entity in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The primary aim of this review is to provide an evidence-based algorithm for the treatment of PPP, taking into account the unique management challenges during this vulnerable period for the mother–infant dyad.

Duration of pharmacological treatment

There are no available data on the appropriate duration of treatment for an episode of PPP. The BAP consensus guidelines on using psychotropic medication in pregnancy and postpartum recommend following BAP or NICE guidelines for non-perinatal episodes of mania. The BAP guideline for bipolar disorder recommends a minimum duration of 12 weeks for the short-term treatment of mania and recommends long-term treatment following a single severe episode of mania. NICE guidelines for bipolar disorder recommend reviewing the need for long-term treatment after 3–6 months of treatment for acute mania. The evidence-based UpToDate resource on the treatment of PPP recommends treating women for at least 1 year postpartum to reduce the risk of relapse, with a suggestion that some patients may require lifetime prophylaxis if there is risk of relapse without medication or in the presence of other risk factors such as suicidality.

### Antipsychotic drugs for non-affective psychosis during pregnancy and postpartum [^115pmN5G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotics are commonly prescribed for women suffering psychotic illnesses during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The potential adverse consequences of these different options are multiple and complex, impacting on the foetus, neonate, infant and early development of the child as well as the woman herself.

Objectives

To establish whether the benefits of taking antipsychotic drugs outweigh the risks for pregnant or post partum women.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 2003) was searched in order to identify all published trials of women during pregnancy or the postpartum period. We inspected all references of all identified studies. If any studies had been found, the first authors of each included study would have been contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of any type of antipsychotic drug compared with any other treatment option (including standard psychosocial care, any other antipsychotic drug, or an alternative therapy such as electro-convulsive therapy or cognitive behavioural therapy) and involving pregnant women and/or women during the postpartum period diagnosed with a non-affective psychotic disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Citations, and where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers and the papers ordered were scrutinised and quality assessed. Data would have been extracted independently by at least two reviewers. Binary outcomes were to have been analysed using Relative Risks (RR) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).

Main Results

We found no trials that met the broad inclusion criteria.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Current guidelines and clinical practice for the use of antipsychotic drugs in women with non-affective disorders during pregnancy and postpartum are not based on evidence from randomised controlled trials. Although ethical concerns have to date precluded the use of randomised controlled trials to address this research topic, the continued use of antipsychotic drugs in this group of women in itself poses significant clinical and ethical problems. Evidence is required from large pragmatic trials that reflect routine clinical practice, examine a broad range of outcomes and accurately quantify risks and benefits to both mothers and their offspring, so that comparison between different treatment options can be made.

### Postpartum psychosis [^113cN3es]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that can affect the health and life of mothers, infants, and families. Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is distinct from non-postpartum psychosis in many ways, and it is crucial to study and understand PPP to identify, treat, and possibly prevent this condition. We therefore sought to review the latest research findings about PPP with the intention of updating readers about the latest evidence base.

Recent Findings

Multiple physiologic pathways have been implicated in the development of PPP, and further understanding these pathways may allow for early detection and treatment. Risk assessment and treatment should include consideration of the woman patient but also the mother-infant dyad and the larger family. It is our hope that this review of research updates in postpartum psychosis may inform clinical practice and promote specialized, evidence-based diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^113tvKnD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PPP is a psychiatric emergency necessitating rapid initiation of pharmacotherapy and admission. Although it is a discrete disorder on the bipolar spectrum with effects on both the mother and the infant, it is yet to be recognised as a distinct nosological entity by diagnostic manuals for psychiatric disorders. There is limited research into the aetiology and treatment of PPP. Current evidence for treatment in the acute phase points to antipsychotics, lithium and ECT. Lithium appears to have the strongest evidence for prophylaxis and relapse prevention. As prognosis is generally good when treatment is commenced promptly, further understanding of the risk factors and aetiology of PPP will enable early detection and timely management to reduce illness burden for the mother–infant dyad.

### Treatment of psychosis and mania in the postpartum period [^112MsYwc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum psychosis is a severe disorder that warrants acute clinical intervention. Little is known, however, about what interventions are most effective. The authors present treatment response and remission outcomes at 9 months postpartum using a four-step algorithm in patients with first-onset psychosis or mania in the postpartum period. Treatment involved the structured sequential administration of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, lithium, and ECT. The outcome of clinical remission was examined in 64 women consecutively admitted for postpartum psychosis. Remission was defined as the absence of psychotic, manic, and severe depressive symptoms for at least 1 week. Women who remitted on antipsychotic monotherapy were advised to continue this treatment as maintenance therapy, and women who required both antipsychotics and lithium to achieve remission were maintained on lithium monotherapy. Relapse was defined as the occurrence of any mood or psychotic episode fulfilling DSM-IV-TR criteria. Using this treatment algorithm, the authors observed that nearly all patients (98.4%) achieved complete remission within the first three steps. None of the patients required ECT. At 9 months postpartum, sustained remission was observed in 79.7%. Patients treated with lithium had a significantly lower rate of relapse compared with those treated with antipsychotic monotherapy. Multiparity and nonaffective psychosis were identified as risk factors for relapse. The authors conclude that a structured treatment algorithm with the sequential addition of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and lithium may result in high rates of remission in patients with first-onset postpartum psychosis and that lithium maintenance may be most beneficial for relapse prevention.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^116Pre3a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Postpartum psychosis (PPP) is a psychiatric emergency that generally warrants acute inpatient care. PPP is marked by the sudden onset of affective and psychotic symptoms with a rapid deterioration in mental state. Evidence suggests that PPP is a discrete disorder on the bipolar disorder spectrum with a distinct treatment profile and prognosis.

Methods:

We conducted a PubMed database search for various terms involving PPP and its treatment and included peer-reviewed articles published in English.

Objective:

To provide a treatment algorithm for the management of PPP based on available evidence.

Results:

Pharmacological therapy is the mainstay of PPP management in the acute phase. Evidence points to a combination of antipsychotics and lithium in the acute treatment of PPP. Electroconvulsive therapy can offer a rapid treatment response where required. Lithium appears to have the best evidence for relapse prevention and prophylaxis in PPP. Psychoeducation is essential and psychosocial interventions used in bipolar disorder may be effective in PPP.

Conclusion:

Early detection and prompt treatment with antipsychotics and lithium, followed by maintenance treatment with lithium, is associated with a favourable prognosis in PPP.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^1127Vc9s]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Prognosis

A meta-analysis (of studies from 1949 to 1995) of long-term outcomes for women with PPP found that 40% had an isolated episode of PPP while 60% had a subsequent non-puerperal episode of mental illness during the follow-up period of 11–16 years. The majority of women (88%) in one study had returned to premorbid levels of functioning by nine months postpartum following PPP. More recently, a prospective longitudinal study examined 106 women with first-onset mania or psychosis in the postpartum period. In the 4-year follow-up period, 68% of women did not experience recurrence outside the postpartum period, with just 2% experiencing a recurrence exclusively following later pregnancies. Notably, the majority of women in this study were treated with lithium (76%) and antipsychotics (83%) during their MBU admission. In the same study, 32% of women experienced a relapse outside the postpartum period during the 4-year follow-up. Patients with a shorter duration of PPP have a more favourable prognosis, and a longer duration between index PPP and subsequent pregnancy predicts a further episode of PPP. A first episode of PPP also has a more favourable prognosis compared to a first episode of an affective disorder outside the perinatal period.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^115miC3F]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the evidence regarding safety and efficacy of psychiatric medications to treat mental health conditions during pregnancy and lactation. The conditions reviewed include depression, anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, bipolar disorder, and acute psychosis. For information on screening and diagnosis, refer to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Clinical Practice Guideline Number 4, "Screening and Diagnosis of Mental Health Conditions During Pregnancy and Postpartum" (1).

Target Population

Pregnant or postpartum individuals with mental health conditions with onset that may have predated the perinatal period or may have occurred for the first time in pregnancy or the first year postpartum or may have been exacerbated in that time.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of one specialist in obstetrics and gynecology and one maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics and two external subject matter experts. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on treatment and management of perinatal mental health conditions including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorders, and acute postpartum psychosis, with a focus on psychopharmacotherapy. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

### A review of postpartum psychosis [^1157UEBB]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective is to provide an overview of the clinical features, prognosis, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of postpartum psychosis.

Methods

The authors searched Medline (1966–2005), PsycInfo (1974–2005), Toxnet, and PubMed databases using the key words postpartum psychosis, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, organic psychosis, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. A clinical case is used to facilitate the discussion.

Results

The onset of puerperal psychosis occurs in the first 1–4 weeks after childbirth. The data suggest that postpartum psychosis is an overt presentation of bipolar disorder that is timed to coincide with tremendous hormonal shifts after delivery. The patient develops frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and grossly disorganized behavior that represent a complete change from previous functioning. These perturbations, in combination with lapsed insight into her illness and symptoms, can lead to devastating consequences in which the safety and well-being of the affected mother and her offspring are jeopardized. Therefore, careful and repeated assessment of the mothers' symptoms, safety, and functional capacity is imperative. Treatment is dictated by the underlying diagnosis, bipolar disorder, and guided by the symptom acuity, patient's response to past treatments, drug tolerability, and breastfeeding preference. The somatic therapies include antimanic agents, atypical antipsychotic medications, and ECT. Estrogen prophylaxis remains purely investigational.

Conclusions

The rapid and accurate diagnosis of postpartum psychosis is essential to expedite appropriate treatment and to allow for quick, full recovery, prevention of future episodes, and reduction of risk to the mother and her children and family.

### Non-psychotic mental disorders in the perinatal period [^111dojjs]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Mental disorders are among the most common morbidities of pregnancy and the postnatal period, and can have adverse effects on the mother, her child, and family. This Series paper summarises the evidence about epidemiology, risk factors, identification, and interventions for non-psychotic mental disorders. Although the phenomenology and risk factors for perinatal mental disorders are largely similar to those for the disorders at other times, treatment considerations differ during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Most randomised controlled trials have examined psychosocial and psychological interventions for postnatal depression, with evidence for effectiveness in treating and preventing the disorder. Few high-quality studies exist on the effectiveness or safety of pharmacological treatments in the perinatal period, despite quite high prescription rates. General principles of prescribing of drugs in the perinatal period are provided, but individual risk-benefit analyses are needed for decisions about treatment.

### Lithium use during pregnancy in 14 countries [^112zmCXo]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

In most populations, lithium use after childbirth returned to levels similar to use in the prepregnancy period. Although our study was not designed to follow up the treatment trajectories of individual patients, and users in the postpartum period may include women with acute treatment needs (eg, postpartum psychosis), our results suggest that lithium use is often discontinued during pregnancy and reinitiated after childbirth. Most clinical guidelines discourage breastfeeding in women using lithium. Our data do not include information on breastfeeding, but the increase in the number of women using lithium after childbirth highlights the need for information on how well postpartum lithium guidelines are adhered to, as well as consequences of lithium exposure through breast milk.

Lithium is the first-line treatment for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder. In a meta-analysis including data from 8 countries, the pooled prevalence of bipolar disorder in the perinatal period was 2.6% (95% CI, 1.2%-4.5%). While the only overlap between the 8 countries and the present study was the US, this prevalence of bipolar disorder was far higher than our observed prevalence of lithium use, suggesting that a much smaller fraction of pregnant women with bipolar disorder may be receiving lithium treatment than the number who have the disorder.

Strengths and Limitations

A strength of this study is the utilization of a common protocol to combine information on lithium use in pregnancy from different databases, allowing for comparison between populations. While differences in population coverage, socioeconomic factors, and what level of care the data cover may still limit comparability, our results also highlight the importance of considering such factors when studying lithium use in pregnancy.

This study also has some limitations. In prescription and health care utilization data, there is no participant recall or reporting bias on medication use during pregnancy. However, data on prescription fills and prescriptions do not capture actual use and adherence to treatment. Differences in prescribing practices between countries may limit uniform interpretation of trends and patterns in lithium use. For example, prescriptions typically cover 30 days of supply in the US, while in the Nordic countries they typically cover 90 days.

### Bipolar postpartum depression: an update and recommendations [^113o7hc5]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past few years there has been a surge of interest in the study of bipolar postpartum depression (PPD); however, questions remain about its prevalence, screening, clinical features, and treatment.

Methods

Three electronic databases, MEDLINE/PubMed (1966–2016), PsycINFO (1806–2016), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were searched using a combination of the keywords bipolar, depression, postpartum, peripartum, prevalence, screening, diagnosis, treatment, drugs, and psychotherapy. The reference lists of articles identified were also searched. All relevant articles published in English were included.

Results

Depending on the population studied, 21.4–54% of women with PPD have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD). Characteristic clinical features include younger age at illness onset, first onset of depression after childbirth, onset immediately after delivery, atypical depressive symptoms, psychotic features, mixed features, and history of BD in first-degree family members. Treatment should be guided by symptom acuity, safety concerns, the patient's response to past treatments, drug tolerability, and breastfeeding preference. In the absence of controlled treatment data, preference should be given to drugs normally indicated for bipolar depression including lithium, quetiapine and lamotrigine. Although antidepressants have been studied in combination with mood stabilizers in bipolar depression, these drugs should be avoided due to likelihood of elevated risk of induction of manic symptoms in the postpartum period.

Conclusions

In the postpartum period, bipolar PPD is common, can be differentiated from unipolar PPD, and needs to be identified promptly in order to expedite appropriate treatment. Future studies on pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy should focus on the acute and preventative treatment of bipolar PPD.

Pharmacological treatment in the acute phase

Pharmacological management is the mainstay of acute treatment for PPP (Figure 1). However, there is limited evidence available for the safety of medications in the perinatal period. Concerns about foetal and neonatal safety have led to the exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from clinical drug trials since the thalidomide tragedy in the 1960s. During the perinatal period, women are often required to consider the ethical implications of medication use without robust safety data. Recent ethical guidelines for clinical trials advocate for the inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women in clinical trials, promoting studies designed to obtain knowledge relevant to the health needs of these women, undertaken after careful consideration of the best available data. With these recent changes, there is hope for more robust safety and efficacy data in the future for medications in the perinatal period. Current recommendations, however, are based on prospective clinical cohorts, retrospective studies, surveillance data and case reports.

Helpful resources on the use of psychotropic medication postpartum include the BAP consensus guidance on the use of psychotropic medication in pregnancy and postpartum and the NICE guideline on antenatal and postnatal mental health. Decisions regarding medication use in the perinatal period must be made following a full individual risk/benefit analysis, including an evaluation of the risks and benefits of accepting treatment and the risks of untreated mental illness to the mother–infant dyad.

Benzodiazepines and hypnotics

As insomnia can lead to deterioration of symptoms in PPP, adequate sleep is of primary importance. Hypnotics and benzodiazepines may be used to treat insomnia and agitation. Low doses of benzodiazepines with a short half-life and no active metabolites are recommended in breastfeeding. Lorazepam is not thought to cause any adverse effects in breastfeeding infants and is the preferred benzodiazepine in breastfeeding mothers. Promethazine is often used in clinical practice, but there are no studies examining promethazine in PPP. Promethazine can lower basal prolactin secretion and may interfere with the establishment of lactation in the early postpartum period.

There is limited data on zolpidem safety in breastfeeding, but with low levels in breast milk and a short half-life, infant adverse effects are thought to be unlikely. There is no safety data on zopiclone in breastfeeding. Breastfed infants should be monitored for sedation, hypotonia and respiratory depression, particularly with regular use of large doses of hypnotics.

Management

Given the acuity and risk involved, PPP is a psychiatric emergency. Pharmacological treatment should be initiated immediately, and admission should be sought, preferably to an MBU where available (Figure 1). The recommendations for treatment of PPP should be personalised to each woman and her circumstances, taking into consideration the level of support a partner/carer may be able to provide overnight and the presence of other children needing care, among other family and social factors. Involvement of the patient's partner/carer or other family members is helpful in care planning. The immediate goals of treatment are to alleviate psychiatric symptoms and manage risk. Longer-term goals involve supporting the mother in improving self-esteem, confidence and maternal role gratification, in addition to supporting infant health and development by promoting a positive mother–infant relationship. Offering preconception counselling before planning future pregnancies may significantly reduce morbidity for a bipolar course of illness.

Assessment

A full psychiatric history and collateral history from the partner, maternity ward staff or carers should be obtained. Risk of suicide and infanticide should be ascertained, bearing in mind that risk is rapidly dynamic in the postpartum period. Enquiring about the patient's thoughts and feelings towards her infant, how she feels she is bonding with her infant and any thoughts about protecting herself, her infant or the world around her can inform risk assessment. Physical examination and investigations will rule out differential diagnoses as described above.

### The treatment of postpartum depression: minimizing infant exposures [^113soTqG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The first 3 postpartum months represent a high-risk period for psychiatric illnesses. This article reviews the prevalence and diagnostic criteria for postpartum illnesses, including the "maternal blues", postpartum depression, and postpartum psychosis. Pharmacologic treatment of these disorders is often complicated by a patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation. Infant exposure and limitations to monitoring infant sera are reviewed. Lastly, a model and guide for reducing fetal and infant exposures is presented.

Prevention and prophylaxis

Screening and prevention

Women have a 23 times higher risk for experiencing a first episode of an affective psychosis in the postpartum period than at any other period. Early identification of the signs of PPP in the postpartum period can reduce the duration of the psychotic illness and improve outcomes by alleviating the impact of PPP on the mother–infant dyad. There are currently no screening tools specific to PPP, but the use of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), a brief self-report screening tool used to detect bipolar disorder, has been advocated. The MDQ takes approximately 5 min to complete and incorporates 13 symptoms, as well as information on the timing of symptoms and the degree of impairment. The Spanish version of the 16-item Prodromal Questionnaire was found to have good construct validity as a screening tool for PPP in a Peruvian population of pregnant women. However, screening tools are not routinely used in clinical practice, where the diagnosis is reliant on collateral history and mental state examination.

In women at risk of developing PPP, relapse prevention and management are the most desirable strategies to improve outcomes for women and their infants. Personal or family history of bipolar disorder or PPP are strong risk factors for developing PPP. Identifying women at risk of PPP, offering preconception counselling and ensuring appropriate management and support during pregnancy can reduce the risks and impact of PPP. Preconception counselling is essential in women with established bipolar disorder or a history of PPP, as this initial psychiatric assessment will inform management and treatment decisions during the perinatal period. Most important in preventing relapse is the provision of pharmacological prophylaxis in the immediate postpartum period.

Pregnant women at risk of developing PPP should ideally be referred to a specialist perinatal mental health service where available. Developing an integrated perinatal mental healthcare plan with input from the patient, her family support and other professionals involved in her care including maternity services, community mental health teams, and, if involved, social care services, is important for the best outcome for the mother–infant dyad. The perinatal mental healthcare plan will include plans for pregnancy, delivery and the immediate postpartum period.

### Perinatal psychiatric episodes: a population-based study on treatment incidence and prevalence [^116EF4kc]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psychiatric episodes during pregnancy and following childbirth are complex, as the well-being of both the mother and infant must be considered in all treatment decisions. There is general consensus that childbirth triggers new postpartum episodes that can be on a spectrum of mild-to-severe presentation. The severe episodes affect 1–2 per 1000 new mothers, and have been described and quantified in a range of diverse studies using different data sources and study designs, for example, refs. Episodes requiring psychiatric hospitalization and specialist treatment in secondary and tertiary health-care systems are thought to be on the severe end of the spectrum. They are often characterized by severe depression with suicidal ideation, or as postpartum psychosis that has been closely associated with bipolar affective disorders, although it does not have a specific diagnoses. Adding to this, a proportion of more moderate postpartum psychiatric episodes will be treated in primary care with prescription drugs. Although the threshold for using pharmacological therapy is different in the perinatal period due to concerns about possible risks to the fetus and breastfeeding infant, antidepressants are used as one treatment option for perinatal depression, particularly non-psychotic moderate-to-severe depression. Antidepressant use in the perinatal period has increased over time, as it has for depression outside the perinatal period. Furthermore, the prevalence of antidepressant use in pregnancy varies significantly between countries and across studies: 3% in Denmarkand 13% in the United States, overall challenging direct comparisons across time periods and between studies. Adding to this, evidence suggests that some perinatal psychiatric episodes will be unnoticed and consequently untreated, with one recent study highlighting that pharmacological treatment is less likely to be prescribed in perinatal illnesses compared with other time points.

Together, postpartum psychiatric episodes comprise a range of different disorders and symptom severity, which subsequently are diagnosed and treated in a range of treatment settings. This poses a significant challenge to the investigation of incidence of postpartum psychiatric episodes, as the data from various settings are needed. An additional challenge is that the most available data in the field does not differentiate between first-time episodes vs recurrent episodes, which in epidemiological terms can be described as mixing incident and prevalent case groups. Finally, past diagnostic specifiers in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic systems vary in terms of defining postpartum onset ranging from 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, with the recent shift from DSM-4 to DSM-5 to also include psychiatric episodes in pregnancy as well as postpartum episodes.

Prophylaxis during pregnancy

Different strategies for prophylaxis may be necessary for women with a history of bipolar disorder and those with a history of PPP. While women with isolated episodes of PPP are at increased risk for subsequent postpartum episodes, one study found no risk of episodes during pregnancy, even when women do not take medications during pregnancy. Thus, there is no indication for women with isolated episodes of PPP to start prophylactic medication during pregnancy, although they should be monitored during this period.

A detailed discussion of the management of bipolar disorder in the perinatal period is beyond the scope of this review. We recommend referring to evidence-based guidelines such as the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP) guidelines on the management of perinatal mental illness and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on antenatal and postnatal mental health. Updated information on foetal and infant effects of individual psychotropic drugs in pregnancy can be found in databases such as the UK Teratology Information Service and the List of Pregnancy Exposure Registries.

### Screening and diagnosis of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 4 [^1171Y5hF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review evidence on the current understanding of mental health conditions in pregnancy and postpartum, with a focus on mood and anxiety disorders, and to outline guidelines for screening and diagnosis that are consistent with best available scientific evidence. The conditions or symptoms reviewed include depression, anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, bipolar disorder, suicidality, and postpartum psychosis. For information on psychopharmacologic treatment and management, refer to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Clinical Practice Guideline Number 5, "Treatment and Management of Mental Health Conditions During Pregnancy and Postpartum" (1).

Target Population

Pregnant or postpartum individuals with mental health conditions. Onset of these conditions may have predated the perinatal period or may have occurred for the first time in pregnancy or the first year postpartum or may have been exacerbated in that time.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of one specialist in obstetrics and gynecology and one maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics and two external subject matter experts. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of perinatal mental health conditions including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, acute postpartum psychosis, and the symptom of suicidality. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^116tK8WY]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — breastfeeding mothers using antidepressants — states that if a mother has previously responded to a specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tricyclic antidepressant, or serotonin–norepinephrine uptake inhibitor, the data for that agent should be reviewed and it should be considered as a first-line treatment if there are no contraindications; mothers treated with these agents during pregnancy with good symptom control should continue on the same agent during breastfeeding, exposure in breastmilk is far less than during pregnancy, and ongoing treatment is critical for the health of both mother and baby. Mothers should be monitored carefully in the initial stages of treatment for changes, women with histories of bipolar disorder are at increased risk of depression, mania, or psychosis in the postpartum period, mothers and partners should be made aware of symptoms including increased insomnia, delusions, hallucinations, racing thoughts, and talking/moving fast, and women experiencing such symptoms should contact their physician immediately; mothers should also receive information on known and unknown risks and benefits to make an informed decision.

Discussion

Childbirth as a trigger for psychiatric episodes

Our data confirmed that childbirth is a potent and highly significant trigger of severe psychiatric episodes. We identified a rapid increase of particularly inpatient-treated episodes shortly following childbirth, and the first postpartum months were associated with the highest risks of both first-time and recurrent episodes. More precisely, we found that in 0.64 per 1000 births, mothers experienced new psychiatric episodes necessitating treatment at inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities 0–3 months postpartum. This estimate is lower than previously reported incidences of postpartum psychosis/severe postpartum psychiatric episodes, 1 per 1000. We speculate that the reasons for this difference reflect changes across calendar time, as the number of available inpatient beds has decreased during the past decades, and possibly a subsequent shift toward treatment in outpatient clinic settings.

Applying an observation period of 3 months postpartum, we found that for every 1000 births the following numbers of psychiatric first-time episodes were treated: 0.64 inpatient psychiatric treatment, 1.63 outpatient psychiatric treatment and 7.72 primary care-treated moderate episodes treated with prescriptions of antidepressants/antipsychotics. This demonstrates that the majority of postpartum episodes are treated in primary care settings, but these numbers also reflect a difference in severity of the disorders, with inpatient admissions representing the most severe end of the spectrum.

Postpartum psychosis — incidence and risk in the postpartum period are characterized as follows: it can occur in one to three of every 1,000 deliveries and usually has a rapid onset (within hours to a few weeks) after delivery, and approximately 25–50% of women with bipolar disorder are at risk of developing postpartum psychosis; women may have a prior history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder, but some have no prior psychiatric history.

### The relationship between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder: a review [^112ShQPS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The evidence for a spectrum of bipolar disorders is mounting. Of particular interest and importance is the evolution and recurrence of bipolar disorder in the postpartum period and its relationship to postpartum psychosis. Understanding whether such a phenomenological link exists has diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment implications.

Objectives

A comprehensive review of (1) the literature regarding the relationships between postpartum psychosis and bipolar affective disorder, (2) the data regarding prophylactic treatment and acute management of postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder in the puerperium, and (3) critical areas for future research.

Study Design

MEDLINE and PubMed (1966–2002) databases were searched for English-language articles using the keywords postpartum/puerperal depression, puerperal/postpartum psychosis, bipolar disorder, lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and breastfeeding.

Results

Evidence from studies of women with a history of bipolar disorder, longitudinal studies of women with puerperal episodes of psychosis, and family studies support a link between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder.

Conclusions

Understanding the relationship between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder has implications for perinatal and long-term treatment. Prophylactic treatment of women with bipolar disorder and/or a history of postpartum psychosis may be indicated. Epidemiological, genetic, and pharmacologic research must be completed to understand, prevent, and adequately treat postpartum psychosis.

### Management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^111wWFNp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness.

Method

An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated.

Results

The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past.

Conclusions

Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

### Postpartum psychosis: madness, mania, and melancholia in motherhood [^116FbNtB]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Psychosis or mania after childbirth is a psychiatric emergency with risk for suicide and infanticide.

Method

The authors reviewed the epidemiologic and genetic research and physiological postpartum triggers (endocrine, immunological, circadian) of psychosis. They also summarized all systematic reviews and synthesized the sparse clinical studies to provide diagnostic recommendations, treatment options, and strategies for prevention.

Results

The incidence of first-lifetime onset postpartum psychosis/mania from population-based register studies of psychiatric admissions varies from 0.25 to 0.6 per 1,000 births. After an incipient episode, 20%-50% of women have isolated postpartum psychosis. The remaining women have episodes outside the perinatal period, usually within the bipolar spectrum. Presumably, the mechanism of onset is related to physiological changes after birth (e.g., hormonal, immunological, circadian), which precipitate disease in genetically vulnerable women. Some women have treatable causes and comorbidities, such as autoimmune thyroiditis or infections. N-methyl-d-aspartate-encephalitis or inborn errors of metabolism may present after birth with psychosis. Fewer than 30 publications have focused on the treatment of postpartum psychosis. The largest study (N = 64) provided evidence that lithium is highly efficacious for both acute and maintenance treatment. Another report (N = 34) described successful ECT treatment. Inpatient care is usually required to ensure safety, complete the diagnostic evaluation, and initiate treatment. The relapse risk after a subsequent pregnancy for women with isolated postpartum psychoses is 31% (95% CI = 22–42). Strategies for prevention of postpartum psychosis include lithium prophylaxis immediately postpartum and proactive safety monitoring.

Conclusions

Postpartum psychosis offers an intriguing model to explore etiologic contributions to the neurobiology of affective psychosis.

### Long-term outcomes of postpartum psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114appBo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is limited information on the longitudinal disease course after first-onset postpartum psychosis (PP). Some women will experience severe affective episodes outside the postpartum period, while for other women their vulnerability to mania and psychosis may be restricted to the postpartum period. This meta-analysis estimates the risk of recurrence after first-onset PP.

Data Sources

A computerized literature search was conducted using Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 100 hits) combining key terms regarding longitudinal studies of first-onset PP from inception through May 9, 2019. Two levels of screening were used on 2,807 citations.

Study Selection

A total of 6 English-language articles including patients with a first-onset PP within 1 year after childbirth and a minimum follow-up period of 18 months or more after the index episode were included in the quantitative analysis.

Data Extraction

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were used for data extraction, and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines were used to independently assess the quality of the included studies. The primary outcome was recurrence, defined as any subsequent psychiatric episode after first-onset PP.

Results

Six studies and 645 patients could be included in the quantitative analyses; follow-up periods were 11–26 years. Of these patients, 279 did not experience subsequent severe episodes outside the postpartum period. Meta-analysis using random-effect estimation resulted in a weighted estimate of 43.5% (95% CI, 37.7% to 49.4%).

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis, more than 40% of women were classified as having "isolated postpartum psychosis", which could be considered a distinct diagnostic category with a more favorable prognosis. The remaining women had severe non-puerperal psychiatric episodes during longitudinal follow-up.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^113spB2W]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding

The risks and benefits to the mother–infant dyad have to be considered when breastfeeding recommendations are made in PPP. Although breastfeeding is recommended where possible, we argue that in PPP, the risks of breastfeeding to the mother–infant dyad may often outweigh the benefits. Sleep deprivation is common in breastfeeding women and can lead to deterioration of symptoms in PPP. The choice of medications that may be used to treat PPP is limited in breastfeeding (e.g. lithium, with the best evidence base for treatment of PPP, is a relative contraindication to breastfeeding in many healthcare systems). Please see section 'Lithium and other mood stabilisers' for further discussion of lithium and breastfeeding), with additional constraints on doses of medications that may be used. The resulting inadequate treatment of PPP combined with the perpetuating effect of sleep deprivation can prolong the episode of PPP, further impacting the mother–infant dyad.

We acknowledge that in certain situations, such as low- and middle-income countries, formula feeding may not be feasible due to the costs of infant formula and hygiene concerns with bottles. Breast milk is vital for the development of preterm infants and the use of a breast milk bank where available might be considered in this circumstance. Occasionally, when the prescribed medication is safe in breastfeeding, daytime breastfeeding may be supplemented by nocturnal formula feeds offered by the partner or carer to facilitate maternal sleep. Reference to the latest guidance on medications in breastfeeding is recommended before prescribing. There is limited long-term safety data for psychotropic medication in breastfeeding. Information on the levels of individual drugs in breast milk and infant blood and the possible adverse effects in the breastfeeding infant may be found, in databases such as the Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed).

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^113tJY8q]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Inpatient admission

Admission to an inpatient setting is recommended for women with PPP. The mother and infant should not be left alone due to the rapidly changing and unpredictable nature of risk in PPP, with a kaleidoscopic picture of fluctuating mood and psychotic symptoms. MBU admissions, where available, are associated with better clinical outcomes, reduced time to recovery and improvement in maternal ability to care for the infant. Where an MBU is not available, admission to an inpatient mental health unit is recommended, although this will be disruptive to mother–infant bonding. In such cases, depending on a dynamic risk assessment, the patient may be provided supervised access to her infant. These meetings should take place in an appropriate room outside the mental health unit. In less severe cases of PPP where two trusted adults are available to care for the mother and infant, a decision may be made to treat the woman in the community, with daily multidisciplinary team reviews and support in the acute phase.

### First-onset psychosis occurring in the postpartum period: a prospective cohort study [^113vY6F4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively characterize a cohort of patients for whom first lifetime episode of psychosis occurs in the postpartum period.

Method

Included in the study were 51 women admitted to an inpatient facility for postpartum psychosis and a population-based control group (n = 6,969). All patients received naturalistic treatment using the sequential addition of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and lithium. A clinician-administered questionnaire and parallel history provided information about obstetric history, pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding, neonatal outcomes, and onset of the disease. Clinical remission was defined as the absence of psychotic, manic, and depressive symptoms for at least 1 week. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale. The study was conducted from 2005 to 2009.

Results

Compared to the general population sample, women with postpartum psychosis had a significantly higher incidence of primiparity (OR = 2.90; 95% CI, 1.49–5.67) but had no significant differences in delivery-related, lactational, or neonatal-related risk factors. The median onset of psychiatric symptoms occurred at 8 days' postpartum (interquartile range [IQR], 5–14), and median duration of episode was 40 days (IQR, 23–69). Patients with prominent depressive symptoms had a significantly later onset (P = 0.01) of psychosis and a longer duration of episode (P < .01) than patients without depressive symptoms. Psychotic symptoms were mood-incongruent in 64.7% of patients.

Conclusions

In contrast to other findings related to postpartum psychosis in bipolar patients, no delivery-related, neonatal-related, or lactational risk factors could be identified. Further, our findings of a delayed onset and mood incongruence of postpartum psychotic symptoms markedly contrasts with that of patients with a previous history of bipolar disorder. These results suggest that women with psychosis limited to the postpartum period might have a distinct risk profile and phenomenology.

### Infant safety with antipsychotic therapy in breast-feeding: a systematic review [^114vmhBJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A relatively high number of women may suffer from psychotic symptoms at postpartum onset. Such symptoms may have devastating effects not only on the mothers but also on the later infant's well being. Children born to mothers with psychosis are at increased risk of physiologic, psychological, and personality development disturbance, whereas children born to mothers with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of early-onset psychiatric disorders. Hence, clinicians should consider it imperative to prevent or manage effectively psychotic and affective relapses in new mothers.

Objectives

To analyze the literature for information about the safety of first- and second-generation antipsychotics for breast-fed infants in order to individuate the safest treatment option for women who need such medications during puerperium.

Data Sources

A computerized search was carried out on MEDLINE/PubMed/TOXNET (1950-January 2008). The following key words were used: breast-feeding, lactation, puerperium, psychotropic drugs, atypical antipsychotics, typical antipsychotics, and neuroleptics.

Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn about the risk/benefit profile of the majority of antipsychotic medications in breast-feeding. Hence, when clinicians are forced to start antipsychotic treatment in drug-naive patients, the choice of the safest option should be based on the general effectiveness profile of each agent, with 2 possible exceptions: clozapine (the drug should be considered contraindicated during breast-feeding because of its liability of inducing potential life-threatening events in the infant), and olanzapine (the drug seems to be associated with an increased risk of inducing extrapyramidal reactions in the breast-fed babies). Conversely, in patients who need to continue antipsychotic therapy during breast-feeding, it is suitable to maintain the previous pharmacologic regimen, if known as effective.

### Postpartum psychoses: prognosis, risk factors, and treatment [^114qALGy]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Puerperal psychoses do not represent a nosological entity, but rather a selection of puerperally triggered "ordinary" functional psychoses with cycloid psychoses predominating and schizophrenias occurring very rarely. The prognosis is basically favorable concerning symptom remission and social and occupational functioning. However, there is a considerable frequency of relapses and an increased suicide rate. The most important risk factors for an episode of a puerperal psychosis are being primiparous and having suffered a previous episode of a psychosis, particularly a cycloid psychosis. Controlled treatment studies up to now are absent. Case studies suggest in acute episodes the efficacy of a symptom-oriented pharmacologic treatment where ablactation is recommended. With respect to prophylactic treatment some authors propose to apply lithium in late pregnancy or immediately after delivery. Because of its possible teratogenic effects and the altogether rather sparse data, the authors however cannot recommend the use of lithium during pregnancy. Applying estradiol after delivery may be beneficial and safe, but further studies are necessary to clarify these issues.

Supporting rationale states that "the confidence in the quality of evidence was very low", that "The benefits and harms, burdens, or both associated with the augmentation of non-antipsychotic medications in the treatment of cognitive and negative symptoms was balanced", and that "Patient preferences varied for certain medications" with "Patient values and preferences varied somewhat because of differing medication preferences". Subgroup considerations include "individuals with seizures, pregnant or lactating women, and differences in effect on acute versus chronic schizophrenia", and limitations include "a small number of studies, significant attrition rates, risk of allocation concealment, and incomplete outcome data".

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^114jWAug]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Prophylaxis in the postpartum period

In women with a history of PPP, prophylactic antipsychotic medications or lithium should be started immediately after delivery to reduce the risk of relapse. There is an argument for introducing prophylaxis 2–4 weeks before delivery as a preventative measure in some cases of PPP, as postpartum prophylaxis is thought to come too late. However, there is no available data at present to support this practice. Lithium has the most robust evidence base for relapse prevention in PPP and may be considered the medication of choice for prophylaxis. Physiological changes in the perinatal period affect lithium pharmacokinetics and necessitate more frequent lithium blood level monitoring and dose adjustments in the perinatal period. Lithium levels should be checked twice weekly in the first 2 weeks postpartum, and target lithium levels should be high (0.8–1.0 mmol/L) during the first month postpartum for relapse prevention. A cohort study suggests that rates of relapse are low up to 9 months postpartum in women with PPP treated with lithium. Lithium dose may start to be tapered after 3 months postpartum but should be continued for 1 year postpartum for sustained remission.

There is evidence from a small sample study for the efficacy of olanzapine in the prophylaxis of PPP in the early postpartum period, although this needs replication in larger studies. The sedative side effects of olanzapine may be beneficial in improving sleep. Psychoeducation about minimising the risk of recurrence, with information about sleep hygiene and the use of medication to help reduce sleep loss around the time of delivery and in the early postpartum period is also important.

Breastfeeding is an important consideration in women at risk of developing PPP.

While the risks and benefits of prophylactic medication and the woman's preference for breastfeeding should be considered, it is important to bear in mind that sleep deprivation associated with breastfeeding can precipitate a relapse of PPP. Lithium crosses into breast milk in large quantities and can have an effect on the infant. Low levels of olanzapine are found in breast milk, and undetectable levels have been reported in the serum of breastfed infants. Infant sedation has been reported with olanzapine. Therefore, women with a history of PPP should be advised that breastfeeding, if it prevents adequate pharmacological prophylaxis and affects sleep, may increase the risk of relapse, with subsequent negative effects on the mother–infant dyad. Please see the section on breastfeeding below for a detailed discussion.

### Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis [^114BTUG3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postnatal psychosis is a worldwide life-threatening condition that affects one to two in every 1000 new mothers. It has an abrupt onset within a month of childbirth. Affected new mothers rapidly develop frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and disorganised behaviours. Factors that increase the risk of postnatal psychosis include primiparous mothers who are single, women who are older, or with a past psychiatric history and family history of affective psychosis, prenatal depression and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. The risk of a future postnatal recurrence is 25% to 57%. Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim at identifying women with risk factors, early recognition of imminent psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy. Mood stabilisers, antipsychotic drugs and hormone therapy may be beneficial in the prevention of postnatal psychotic episodes in women at risk.

Objectives

To investigate the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2012 using the search strategy of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials relevant to the prevention of postnatal psychosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection. If we had included relevant trials, we planned to assess the methodological quality of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors would have independently extracted data. For homogenous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and the number needed to treat to benefit/harm (NNTB/NNTH) on an intention-to-treat basis.

Main Results

There are no included studies in this review. The electronic search produced three relevant references, among which we identified two old planned trials that seem never to have started, and one which we excluded a study because it was a report of a case series.

Authors' Conclusions

This is not an empty review - it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite growing interest in women's mental health, the literature in the area of postnatal psychosis is still very limited. It seems that clinicians have no choice but to continue with their current practices guided solely by varied clinical judgement. Women at risk of postnatal psychosis and their relatives are justified to be disappointed in the medical/research fraternity. A post hoc PubMed topic (not methodology-specific) search identified mainly case series. Policy makers have no trial-based evidence upon which to base their guidelines. Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported randomised studies. Available publications suggest that such studies are possible and funders of research may wish to make this work a priority.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^114AVoxx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lithium and other mood stabilisers

There is evidence for lithium as an adjunctive medication in PPP for both acute treatment and prophylaxis, and a case report suggests it may also be effective in monotherapy in acute PPP. In a study of 64 women with PPP, 98.4% achieved clinical remission with a combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic and lithium. In this stepwise treatment study, 6.3% achieved remission with a benzodiazepine alone, 18.8% achieved remission with a combination of benzodiazepine and antipsychotic, and 73.4% achieved remission with a combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic and lithium. The final step of the study algorithm was ECT, which was not used as all participants had responded to the combination of benzodiazepine, antipsychotic and lithium. In the same cohort, 79.7% of women maintained remission at 9 months postpartum with lithium monotherapy.

Lithium has the most robust evidence base for relapse prevention in PPP. There are concerns about declining rates of lithium prescription worldwide at present, with preference given to second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Similarly, in PPP, antipsychotics are routinely preferred in clinical practice for long-term relapse prevention, possibly because of clinicians' negative perception of lithium's side effect profile and requirement for blood monitoring. However, given the metabolic risks of antipsychotics in women with PPP and the superiority of evidence for lithium in relapse prevention, we recommend consideration of lithium for relapse prevention in PPP.

There are no studies examining the mood stabilisers lamotrigine or carbamazepine in the treatment of PPP. Sodium valproate should not be used in women of reproductive age. Valproate use in pregnancy carries a significant risk of congenital malformations, developmental disability and reduction in IQ, and increased risk of autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in infants.

Antipsychotics

Antipsychotics are beneficial in the acute treatment of PPP. Second-generation antipsychotics, with the exception of clozapine, are relatively safe in breastfeeding. Olanzapine has the largest evidence base among antipsychotics in breastfeeding. Most of the evidence comes from a global safety surveillance report on olanzapine in breastfeeding by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Adverse events were reported in 15.6% of infants exposed to olanzapine through breast milk, with somnolence (4%), irritability (2%) and tremor (2%) being most commonly reported. Other smaller studies have reported a low relative infant dose for olanzapine and an absence of adverse effects in infants. With a low relative infant dose, quetiapine is also considered safe in breastfeeding. There are limited data on risperidone, and with a higher relative infant dose than olanzapine and quetiapine, use in breastfeeding should be considered with caution. Limited long-term follow-up data suggest normal development in infants exposed to olanzapine and quetiapine.

While antipsychotics are useful in the acute treatment of PPP and often preferred in clinical practice, only 50% of patients taking antipsychotic monotherapy have been found to remain in remission 9 months after the initial PPP episode. Antipsychotics used in conjunction with lithium have been reported to result in better outcomes.

### Bipolar disorder in pregnancy and postpartum: principles of management [^113jisjp]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Pregnancy and postpartum represent times of increased vulnerability for women with bipolar disorder, yet this condition remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. As 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, the risks associated with the illness and the potential risks associated with treatment should be considered when a woman of reproductive age first presents for evaluation. This article reviews the epidemiology of perinatal bipolar disorder, screening recommendations, and treatment with pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An overview of the data in pregnancy and lactation is presented for lithium, lamotrigine, valproic acid, newer antipsychotics, and ECT. General principles of management include close monitoring in pregnancy and postpartum, careful adjustment of the treatment regimen to attenuate the risk of relapse, and avoidance of valproic acid when possible. Thoughtful consideration of these issues will minimize the risks to the mother and baby.

### A cautionary note on the use of antidepressants in postpartum depression [^115MC7fC]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This paper discusses the effect of antidepressant use on the illness course in three women who were treated for first-onset postpartum depression (PPD) following childbirth.

Methods

A report of three cases of early-onset PPD in which bipolarity manifested following antidepressant treatment.

Results

There was no past history of psychiatric disturbance but in each case there was a family history of bipolar (BP) disorder. Treatment with antidepressants resulted in a highly unstable illness course characterized by a mixed episode, cycle acceleration, and a postpartum psychosis. However, discontinuation of antidepressants and institution of treatment with mood stabilizers and atypical neuroleptics resulted in sustained improvement and symptom remission.

Conclusions

Caution is urged in the use of antidepressants to treat early-onset PPD in women at risk for developing BP disorder due to a family history of bipolar illness.

### Prevention of postpartum psychosis and mania in women at high risk [^113sStNL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Women with a history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis are at extremely high risk of relapse postpartum. Although lithium prophylaxis has demonstrated efficacy in reducing postpartum relapse, the timing of prophylaxis remains controversial given the balance of risks and benefits for the mother and fetus. The authors compared lithium use during pregnancy to its initiation postpartum in women at high risk for postpartum psychosis.

Method

Between 2003 and 2010, 70 pregnant women at high risk for postpartum psychosis were referred to the authors' psychiatric outpatient clinic. Women who were initially medication free were advised to start lithium prophylaxis immediately postpartum. Women already taking maintenance lithium during pregnancy were advised to continue treatment.

Results

All women with a history of psychosis limited to the postpartum period (N = 29) remained stable throughout pregnancy despite being medication free. Of the women with bipolar disorder (N = 41), 24.4% relapsed during pregnancy, despite prophylaxis use by the majority throughout pregnancy. The postpartum relapse rate was highest in women with bipolar disorder who experienced mood episodes during pregnancy (60.0%). In contrast, none of the 20 women with a history of postpartum psychosis only who used postpartum prophylaxis relapsed, compared to 44.4% of patients with postpartum psychosis only who declined prophylaxis.

Conclusions

The authors recommend initiating prophylactic treatment immediately postpartum in women with a history of psychosis limited to the postpartum period, to avoid in utero fetal exposure to medication. Patients with bipolar disorder require continuous prophylaxis throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period to reduce peripartum relapse risk.

### Perinatal psychiatric episodes: a population-based study on treatment incidence and prevalence [^114p6D5u]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The newest version of the DSM classification system introduced a peripartum specifier for disease onset both during pregnancy and postpartum, which is different from the previous definition for a specifier solely related to the postpartum period. The register data used for the present study are administrative and measures contacts with the health-care system, but not the onset of specific illness. Consequently, some women may have had the onset within the time put out by the DSM specifier. However, when observing our findings, the peripartum specifier may be a useful definition for the patterns of treatment especially in outpatient clinics (Figure 2), as we here did not observe wide variations between pregnancy and postpartum for the more moderate episodes. In comparison, when we examined data covering more severe episodes that required inpatient psychiatric treatment, the variation between the pregnancy period and postpartum was vast with a very low incidence in pregnancy and a clear peak in incidence shortly following childbirth (Figure 1). This may suggest that a peripartum specifier as used in the DSM system is not the most suitable definition for disorders in the most severe end of the spectrum, and we further hypothesize that these episodes could have different underlying etiologies than the less severe episodes. However, for other purposes such as service planning a peripartum specifier could be beneficial, and hence it is important to consider how a specifier is useful and which time period the definition should include.

Childbirth triggers first-ever severe episodes that are treated at inpatient psychiatric facilities (Figure 1). This is a particularly concerning observation, as we at present are not able to predict which women will become ill postpartum. However, the majority of the treated severe postpartum episodes are recurrent episodes (Figure 1), meaning that the majority of women with severe episodes following childbirth are patients with previous records of treated psychiatric disorders outside the postpartum period. For these female patients, treatment and prevention plans should be available and initiated, especially if the individual women have histories of bipolar disorders or postpartum psychosis. Such plans could include medication prophylaxis, birth plan, intervention strategies from earliest signs of prodromal symptoms, neonatal medical evaluation, breastfeeding preferences and strategies for adequate sleep, maintenance of stable circadian rhythm, stress reduction, and support of maternal–newborn bonding.

### Bipolar II postpartum depression: detection, diagnosis, and treatment [^1116RxVQ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Research on postpartum mood disorders has focused primarily on major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and puerperal psychosis and has largely ignored or neglected bipolar II disorder. Hypomanic symptoms are common after delivery but frequently unrecognized. DSM-IV does not consider early postpartum hypomania as a significant diagnostic feature. Although postpartum hypomania may not cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, it is often associated with subsequent, often disabling depression. Preliminary evidence suggests that bipolar II depression arising in the postpartum period is often misdiagnosed as unipolar major depressive disorder. The consequences of the misdiagnosis can be particularly serious because of delayed initiation of appropriate treatment and the inappropriate prescription of antidepressants. Moreover, no pharmacological or psychotherapeutic studies of bipolar postpartum depression are available to guide clinical decision making. Also lacking are screening instruments designed specifically for use before or after delivery in women with suspected bipolar depression. It is recommended that the treatment of postpartum bipolar depression follow the same guidelines as the treatment of nonpuerperal bipolar II depression, using medications that are compatible with lactation.

### Psychiatric consultation to the postpartum mother [^113EiQCP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The immediate postpartum period is a time of acute vulnerability to mental illness, which presents unique challenges for the psychiatric consultant. Because the postpartum hospital stay is typically brief, the consultant must have a working knowledge of postpartum physiology and the myriad forms of mental illness that may emerge in this vulnerable time, in order to quickly make a diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan. This review aims to characterize the most common reasons for postpartum consultation, review postpartum physiology and psychiatric conditions, and propose an evidence-based, practical approach to treatment. A literature search using the terms "postpartum", "obstetric", "consultation", and "psychiatry" yielded six studies that identified reasons for psychiatric consultation to the obstetrics and gynecology services. These studies informed the structure of the article such that we review the most common reasons for consultation and how to approach each issue. The most common reason for consultation is past psychiatric history, often in the absence of current symptoms. For each clinical situation, including depression, adverse birth events, and psychosis, we present a differential diagnosis, as well as risk factors, clinical signs, and recommended treatment.

### British Association for Psychopharmacology consensus guidance on the use of psychotropic medication preconception, in pregnancy and postpartum 2017 [^117BUDjX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Decisions about the use of psychotropic medication in pregnancy are an ongoing challenge for clinicians and women with mental health problems, owing to the uncertainties around risks of the illness itself to mother and fetus/infant, effectiveness of medications in pregnancy and risks to the fetus/infant from in utero exposure or via breast milk. These consensus guidelines aim to provide pragmatic advice regarding these issues. They are divided into sections on risks of untreated illness in pregnancy; general principles of using drugs in the perinatal period; benefits and harms associated with individual drugs; and recommendations for the management of specific disorders.

### Olanzapine in the prevention of postpartum psychosis and mood episodes in bipolar disorder [^116oeg91]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The use of olanzapine (OLZ) in the prevention of postpartum psychosis (PP) and mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder was investigated in a naturalistic, prospective study.

Methods

Eleven women received OLZ alone or in combination with an antidepressant or mood stabilizer, and 14 women received either antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or no medication for a minimum of 4 weeks after delivery.

Results

Two (18.2%) of the women in the OLZ group experienced a postpartum mood episode, whereas eight (57.1%) of the women in the No-OLZ group did.

Conclusions

The role of OLZ in the prophylaxis of PP and mood episodes, particularly in women at high risk, clearly warrants further investigation.

### The impact of postpartum psychosis on partners [^116jSV4N]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postpartum Psychosis (PP) is a severe mental health condition, with a psychotic element and associated mood disturbance following childbirth, and is often described as a 'psychiatric emergency'. Postpartum Psychosis occurs in 1 to 2 per 1000 births, with a peak window of onset within the first two weeks after birth. The onset of PP is typically sudden, unexpected and severe. As an emerging field of research, studies have primarily focused on identifying incidence rates, aetiology, exploring genetic susceptibility and risk factors. Risk factors that have been identified include having a pre-existing mental health problem (such as Bipolar Disorder), primiparity, marital conflict, lack of social support, and the presence of stressful life events.

The London School of Economics report an 8.1 billion pound spend to cover the direct and indirect costs of perinatal mental health for each annual birth cohort within the United Kingdom. Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on antenatal and postnatal mental healthcare, recommend that healthcare professionals be alert to any possible symptoms of PP within the first two weeks after childbirth. However, only half of women have access to specialist perinatal mental health services, and both personal and service level barriers to receiving appropriate care have been outlined. Other NICE recommendations include for mental healthcare providers to: establish a co-ordinated care plan; provide medical and therapeutic interventions; and consider the support role of the partner, and the potential effect of the perinatal episode on the couple relationship.

Pregnancy and childbirth are times of considerable change, placing increased demands on a couple. The relationship that a couple have with each other, and the relationship that they build with their infant during the postnatal window, helps to provide a foundation for infant development and secure attachment. Establishing this foundation can be difficult in the best of circumstances, but perinatal mental health problems cause an additional challenge. The treatment of, and the course of recovery from, PP has been described as 'a long and difficult process', often involving a psychiatric admission of the mother to a general psychiatric ward, or admission of the mother and infant to a Mother and Baby Unit (MBU) (, p.155). Whilst the understanding of the impact of perinatal mental health problems for the mother might be improving, the literature provides little information on the impact of such difficulties on partners, or on their relationships with their new infant and the mother.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^116Rck7q]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants

There are no studies examining the efficacy of antidepressants in episodes of PPP characterised by severe depression with psychotic features. Some women with PPP may experience depression in the post-acute phase. Antidepressants are routinely prescribed, although there are no studies examining the use of antidepressants in PPP. Depression following an episode of PPP should be treated as bipolar depression. There is evidence for benefit of quetiapine, lamotrigine, lurasidone and olanzapine in bipolar depression. If the woman is already on lithium for PPP, lithium levels should be checked. If antidepressants are considered in women with a history of PPP, they should be prescribed along with a drug for mania, and should be tapered and discontinued when full remission of depressive symptoms has been achieved.

Electroconvulsive therapy

Extant data suggest that the rapid treatment response following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be beneficial in PPP. The response rate for ECT is reported to be higher in the postpartum period than outside this period. One study found lower rates of hospitalisation and suicidality in women with postpartum depression and PPP receiving ECT compared to women receiving ECT outside the perinatal period. A naturalistic study of 78 patients with PPP showed that 43.6% of these patients received ECT with good response. Indications for ECT in that study included augmentation to pharmacotherapy in treatment-resistant PPP (defined as minimal response to pharmacotherapy after 2 weeks), catatonia, and suicidal or infanticidal behaviour. In a case series of five women with postpartum affective disorders, two women had treatment-refractory PPP and showed rapid improvement in psychotic symptoms after three sessions of ECT.

Transient anterograde amnesia has been reported as an adverse effect of ECT in women with PPP. One study reported prolonged seizures which responded to treatment with barbiturates. Women receiving ECT can continue to breastfeed their infants with no adverse effects on the infant.

Although ECT is considered an option of last resort for treatment-resistant PPP in many healthcare systems, we recommend earlier consideration of ECT in women with severe symptoms, suicidal/infanticidal ideation, catatonia or severe agitation. ECT can be useful in these cases where rapid treatment response is required, and may lead to better outcomes for the mother–infant dyad.

### The Korean medication algorithm for depressive disorder: second revision [^111bLM5z]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

This study constitutes a revision of the guidelines for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) issued by the Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Depressive Disorder (KMAP-DD) 2006. In incorporates changes in the experts׳ consensus that occurred between 2006 and 2012 as well as information regarding newly developed and recently published clinical trials.

Methods

Using a 44-item questionnaire, an expert consensus was obtained on pharmacological treatment strategies for (1) non-psychotic MDD, (2) psychotic MDD, (3) dysthymia and depression subtypes, (4) continuous and maintenance treatment, and (5) special populations; consensus was also obtained regarding (6) the choice of an antidepressant (AD) in the context of safety and adverse effects, and (7) non-pharmacological biological therapies.

Results

AD monotherapy was recommended as the first-line strategy for nonpsychotic depression in adults, children and adolescents, elderly adults, and patients with postpartum depression or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The combination of AD and atypical antipsychotics (AAP) was recommended for psychotic depression. The duration of the initial AD treatment for psychotic depression depends on the number of depressive episodes. Most experts recommended stopping the initial AD and AAP therapy after a certain period in patients with one or two depressive episodes. However, for those with three or more episodes, maintenance of the initial treatment was recommended for as long as possible. Monotherapy with various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) was recommended for dysthymic disorder and melancholic type MDD.

Conclusion

The pharmacological treatment strategy of KMAP-DD 2012 is similar to that of KMAP-DD 2006; however, the preference for the first-line use of AAPs was stronger in 2012 than in 2006.

### Postpartum psychosis: a proposed treatment algorithm [^1165QB4o]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Non-psychiatric postpartum complications such as infection and lactation problems are risk factors for PPP and other postpartum psychiatric disorders. While a previous study found no link between psychosocial risk factors such as stressful life events and PPP, a more recent study found that severe childhood maltreatment and higher daily cortisol (a marker of stress response) in the third trimester of pregnancy predicted relapse in the first 4 weeks postpartum in women at risk of PPP.

Lithium and breastfeeding

Lithium is excreted in varying quantities into breastmilk and is considered a contraindication to breastfeeding, although there is some controversy in this regard. Some evidence suggests that lithium may not be an absolute contraindication in breastfeeding, particularly in lithium monotherapy in infants over 2 months of age. Infant serum lithium concentrations were compared among different feeding strategies (exclusive breastfeeding, formula feeding, and combination breast and formula feeding; n = 8 participants in each group) in a recent study of women with bipolar disorder taking lithium and their infants. There were no adverse infant effects reported in this study in the first 2 months postpartum. No sustained lithium accumulation was reported in the three groups and infant lithium clearance was independent of maternal lithium levels. Infant lithium levels were reported to decline in all groups, although levels in exclusively breastfed infants took up to 60 days to fall below the limit of quantification, while formula-fed and combination-fed infants reached this level by 6–8 days postpartum. The authors recommend checking infant serum lithium levels at 2 days and 1 week postpartum, with further checks at 1 and 2 months postpartum in breastfeeding infants. While combination of breast and formula feeding may be considered relatively safe from the results of this study, further evidence from larger cohorts are necessary before it can be recommended.

If lithium is prescribed during breastfeeding, this should be done in conjunction with a neonatologist/paediatrician. While there are no reports of lithium toxicity or developmental problems in infants, infant serum lithium levels, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen levels and thyroid function should be monitored regularly in breastfed infants exposed to lithium as lithium can affect renal and thyroid function in infants. Lithium may adversely affect breastfed infants when elimination is impaired, particularly in neonates and premature infants.

To summarise, PPP often requires polypharmacy and commonly occurs within the first 2 weeks postpartum, a period for which there is limited evidence for the safe use of lithium in breastfeeding. In the absence of more robust evidence on risks to the infant, our recommendation follows that of, suggesting that women prescribed lithium should abstain from breastfeeding.

### Risk of postpartum relapse in bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Sw9Wd]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Women with a history of bipolar disorder, postpartum psychosis, or both are at high risk for postpartum relapse. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the risk of postpartum relapse in these three patient groups.

Method

A systematic literature search was conducted in all public medical electronic databases, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included if they reported postpartum relapse in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and/or a history of postpartum psychosis or mania according to DSM or ICD criteria or the Research Diagnostic Criteria.

Results

Thirty-seven articles describing 5,700 deliveries in 4,023 patients were included in the quantitative analyses. The overall postpartum relapse risk was 35% (95% CI = 29, 41). Patients with bipolar disorder were significantly less likely to experience severe episodes postpartum (17%, 95% CI = 13, 21) than patients with a history of postpartum psychosis (29%, 95% CI = 20, 41). Insufficient information was available to determine relapse rates for patients with bipolar disorder and a history of postpartum episodes. In women with bipolar disorder, postpartum relapse rates were significantly higher among those who were medication free during pregnancy (66%, 95% CI = 57, 75) than those who used prophylactic medication (23%, 95% CI = 14, 37).

Conclusions

One-third of women at high risk experience a postpartum relapse. In women with bipolar disorder, continuation of prophylactic medication during pregnancy appears highly protective for maintaining mood stability postpartum. In women with a history of isolated postpartum psychosis, initiation of prophylaxis immediately after delivery offers the opportunity to minimize the risk of relapse while avoiding in utero medication exposure.

### Course of illness and treatment updates for bipolar disorder in the perinatal period [^114AvcV8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The perinatal period is a time of increased vulnerability for people with bipolar disorder (BD). The purpose of this review is to provide an update of the literature from the last 3 years regarding course of illness and treatments for BD in the perinatal period to guide clinical care.

Recent Findings

Postpartum manic and depressive episodes are emerging as having a unique presentation that may differentiate them from non-perinatal mood episodes. Many important updates regarding medication treatment in the perinatal period have been published recently that have considered the risks of untreated illness versus treatment risks in this population'. Despite significant research, there are still gaps in knowledge regarding safety and efficacy of medications for the mother and child. Crucial future areas of study include improved screening guidelines, randomized controlled trials examining medication safety in pregnancy and lactation, and efficacy of nonpharmacologic treatments.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111E4z4F]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Patients should be encouraged to initiate or optimize maintenance treatment as soon after giving birth as possible, with preference given to medications that have previously been shown to be successful. Near delivery, close monitoring is essential for early detection and management of symptoms that might signal onset of a mood or psychotic episode. 538 If an acute mood episode emerges in the postpartum period, the hierarchies for non‐postpartum episodes should be followed, but, because most psychotropic medications are excreted in breast milk, treatment choice should take into consideration safety in breastfeeding when applicable.

The FDA website mentioned in the previous section as well as Table 21 also include information on lactation. The FDA PLLR should be consulted for further information about medication risks, as many are secreted in milk, if breastfeeding is being considered.

The potential risks and benefits of taking medications while breastfeeding should be discussed with the patient. Education about early recognition of drug toxicity and requirement for ongoing monitoring of infants is also critical. 539 A recent systematic review suggested quetiapine and olanzapine as preferred choices for breastfeeding, considering their relatively lower infant dosages. 540 The impact of medication on the infant can be reduced by scheduling medication administration after breastfeeding. 541

Replacing or supplementing breast milk with formula can also be considered. Although there are many benefits to breastfeeding, associated sleep disruption may increase the risk of mood episodes in women with BD. If possible, bottle feeding at night by the woman's partner or a support can be beneficial to allow the woman to maintain a better sleeping schedule. In women with postpartum psychosis or mania, breastfeeding may be more risky, and therefore may not be indicated, as the mother may be too disorganized to safely breastfeed. 542

As childbirth can be a trigger for first onset of hypomania/mania in women with MDD, antidepressants should be used cautiously, especially in women with a family history of BD. 543 Women with first onset of depression in the postpartum period or those who have recurrence of depression during the early postpartum period, may also be at a high risk of switching to BD following treatment with antidepressants. 537

### Antipsychotic medication for women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^114eoMMS]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Special considerations regarding pharmacotherapy in postpartum women

After birth and especially in the first few weeks after delivery, women with bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or a history of postpartum psychosis are at an increased risk of postpartum psychosis due to hormonal alterations, neuro-immune changes and psychosocial factors (Hazelgrove et al; Meltzer-Brody et al.). In these women, it is important to closely monitor clinical symptoms in this period and to consider continuation of antipsychotic treatment (Jones, Chandra, Dazzan, & Howard). Of note, pharmacological agents that suppress lactation are usually dopamine D2 agonists and are suggested to increase the risk of postpartum psychosis. This type of medication should, therefore, not be prescribed in postpartum women with SSD (Snellen, Power, Blankley, & Galbally).

Breastfeeding

Although breastfeeding has clear benefits for bonding and immunity (Chandra, Babu, & Desai,), women with SSD are currently encouraged to breastfeed, unless they are taking clozapine (NICE). Although all antipsychotics are excreted into the breastmilk, the amount of active ingredients that is transferred to the infant is relatively low (Pacchiarotti et al.). Based on a systematic review of 49 studies, the highest penetration ratio has been found for amisulpride, followed by clozapine and haloperidol (Schoretsanitis, Westin, Deligiannidis, Spigset, & Paulzen). Anecdotal evidence on clozapine has reported considerable concentrations in breast milk, risk of agranulocytosis in the infant and potentially delayed speech development low (Pacchiarotti et al.). Based on the current literature, positive safety data are most consistent for olanzapine (Zincir). Apart from clozapine, other common antipsychotics are rarely associated with adverse events (Uguz,), but monitoring of neurodevelopment and motor abnormalities is warranted due to the limited amount of evidence (McAllister-Williams et al; NICE). Taken together, the choice of feeding method and about which antipsychotic is best taken is difficult and should be part of a shared decision process involving the partner and paediatrician (Table 2).

### Mood disorders and parity-a clue to the aetiology of the postpartum trigger [^112XoSSs]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

4.5 Limitations

Our results need to be interpreted in the light of several limitations.
(1) Information about perinatal episodes was collected retrospectively. It should be noted, however, that the reporting of episodes at interview was in agreement with the medical records and the recollection of episodes of illness in relation to childbirth has been shown to be excellent.
(2) Pregnancies that occurred before the onset of mood disorder were included in the analyses. However, this represents a conservative bias, making it less likely that we would find an effect of primiparity as subsequent pregnancies are increasingly likely to have occurred following the onset of mood disorder.
(3) Recent evidence from clinical, epidemiological and molecular studies has challenged the current clear-cut unipolar–bipolar distinction. To improve the validity and reliability of the phenotypes, we excluded from the original study on RMD women who had ever experienced mood incongruent psychosis or psychosis outside of mood episodes. Although our approach reduced the variability and the risk of misdiagnosis, the low numbers of postpartum psychotic episodes in the RMD group may be due to sample characteristics and not be representative of the broad clinical spectrum of women presenting major depressive symptoms in clinical settings.
(4) Mothers who have had a previous episode of postpartum psychosis and want to extend their families may be aware of the risk of recurrence and take medication to prevent or promptly treat an emerging postpartum episode. We did not have detailed information on the drug management of the women and could not, therefore, establish the effect of medication in reducing the risk of a perinatal relapse. It is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of medication use in pregnant women with bipolar disorder. Because of the remitting and relapsing course of bipolar disorder, many women with bipolar disorder may not be taking medications or be in contact with psychiatric services. Estimates from naturalistic prospective studies conducted in specialized centers vary. A study conducted in the US reported that only about 31% of women with bipolar I disorder maintained mood stabilizer treatment during pregnancy, while studies from Europe have found higher rates of medication being used in pregnancy in bipolar women (75% in, 63% in our prospective study on bipolar disorder in pregnancy, data unpublished). However, the evidence suggests the increased risk of recurrence following delivery does not appear to be merely a result of stopping mood-stabilising medication.

### Postpartum catatonia treated with electroconvulsive therapy: a case report [^116Pn8aT]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Catatonia is a rare syndrome that occurs in mood and psychotic disorders, and general medical conditions. Postpartum depression affects 10%-15% of women within 6 months after delivery. Postpartum psychosis affects 0.1%-0.5% of women within weeks after delivery, though it can occur within hours; it carries risk for suicide and infanticide. There is limited evidence available to guide treatment. We review a case of postpartum psychosis that presented with catatonia and was resistant to medications, but responded to electroconvulsive therapy.

### Bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia in pregnancy and the post-partum period [^1159SBoH]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

The perinatal period is associated with an increased risk of severe mental disorders. We summarise the evidence regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment of severe mental illness in relation to childbirth, focusing on bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia. We discuss women with ongoing chronic conditions and those with the onset of new episodes of post-partum psychosis. Despite the importance of perinatal episodes, with suicide a leading cause of maternal death, few studies are available to guide the management of women with severe mental disorders in pregnancy and the post-partum period. However, general principles of management are discussed, including the need for an individual risk-benefit analysis for each woman.

### Postpartum psychiatric outcomes and sick leave after discontinuing SSRI or SNRI in pregnancy [^1166FEDD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our findings showed no evidence overall of an association between SSRI or SNRI discontinuation and adverse postpartum psychiatric events. However, some estimates were high with large CIs (eg, for hospitalization due to psychosis at 90 days after childbirth, the aHR was 1.74; 95% CI, 0.72–4.22) but based on a small numbers of events.

Regarding sick leave absence, an internet-based study of more than 6000 women in 12 European countries found that two-thirds of participants with mood disorders reported being on sick leave during pregnancy and were more likely to have done so if they were not taking medication. To our knowledge, our study is the first population-based study to examine sick leave absence in pregnant women with prepregnancy SSRI or SNRI use. In our study cohort, 30.4% of women were on sick leave absence in the year prior to the start of pregnancy, while 47.6% were on sick leave absence during pregnancy. The proportion of women on sick leave in the postpartum period was similar between SSRI or SNRI continued and discontinued use groups, as was the proportion of individuals with a psychiatric indication for sick leave. However, individuals who continued SSRIs or SNRIs used more sick leave days, and a larger proportion used more than 90 days of sick leave, which may reflect a higher psychiatric burden.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^111WMdX5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

The perinatal period

The only systematic study of catatonia in the perinatal period is a retrospective chart review of 200 women consecutively admitted to hospital with postpartum psychosis, which suggests that the condition may be prevalent in women with severe mental illness in the postnatal period: 40 women (20%) were assessed as having catatonic signs. The literature in other perinatal groups with psychiatric or medical illnesses does not allow prevalence estimates.

In pregnancy, many potential complications of persistent catatonia place the mother and child at exceptionally high risk. These include venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, dehydration, malnutrition, incontinence, infections, communication difficulties, impaired co-operation with assessments and investigations, and impairment of capacity. Postnatally, the mother's ability to breastfeed and to care and bond with her infant are key concerns.

The sections that follow describe the risks that the two main treatments for catatonia, lorazepam and ECT, may pose to the mother and the child. More details about the general principles of use of psychotropic medications in the perinatal period may be found in the BAP guidance on this topic

The reproductive safety of lorazepam in the perinatal period

Research on the reproductive safety of benzodiazepines remains at an early stage, and studies more typically evaluate benzodiazepines as a group, rather than individual agents. In a meta-analysis of cohort studies of exposure to benzodiazepines, found a trend towards increased risks for total (n = 5195) and cardiovascular (n = 4414) malformations with the lower end of the 95% CI nearly achieving significance.reported in a nationwide cohort study of 3.1 million pregnancies with a larger sample of benzodiazepine exposures (n = 40,846), using propensity scores to account for a large number of potential confounders and several sensitivity analyses, that first trimester exposure to benzodiazepines was associated with a very small increased risk of overall congenital malformations (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05–1.13) and specifically, heart defects (adjusted RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.10–1.21). A risk of oral clefts, reported by several previous studies, was not confirmed. There were differences between compounds and lorazepam was not associated with significant effects (aRR for overall congenital malformations 1.00, CI: 0.85–1.18; aRR for cardiovascular malformations 1.14, CI: 0.93–1.40).

### Improvement of postpartum depression and psychosis after electroconvulsive therapy: a population-based study with a matched comparison group [^113PcDRZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used to treat postpartum depression and psychosis based on clinical experience and small observational studies.

Aims

The primary aim was to test the hypothesis that the response rate to ECT for depression and psychosis is higher during the postpartum period than outside this period. The secondary aim was to identify predictors of a response to ECT during the postpartum period.

Materials and Methods

Cases with postpartum depression and/or psychosis received ECT within 6 months of delivery. A matched comparison group with depression and/or psychosis (not within the postpartum period) was identified from the Swedish National Quality Register for ECT. The improvement 1 week after ECT was classified according to the Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Improvement scale (CGI-I) as responder (CGI-I score 1–2) or non-responder (CGI-I score 3–7).

Results

185 cases and 185 comparison group subjects were included (46% with psychosis in each groups). More cases (87.0%) than comparison group subjects (73.5%) responded to ECT (p = 0.001). Adjusted binary regression analysis revealed that more severe symptoms prior to treatment were the only statistically significant predictor of response.

Limitations

There was no control group without ECT treatment.

Conclusion

The response rate of those with postpartum depression and/or psychosis to ECT was high. The response rate of patients with psychosis or depression was higher during the postpartum period than outside it. This study supports the use of ECT for severe forms of postpartum depression and/or psychosis.

### A father with postpartum psychosis [^114QNd8n]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Postpartum psychosis is a rare, however severe mood disorder in the perinatal period. It is most commonly associated with postpartum bipolar disorder. The author reports a case where a male patient with psychosis was admitted to the psychiatric unit 5 days after his wife gave birth to their male child. The patient was very concerned about the well being of his child and was afraid that something bad would happen to his child. The patient was diagnosed with an acute manic episode with psychotic symptoms and treated with olanzapine and lithium. The patient has been continued on therapeutic dose of lithium without any relapse of the symptoms, 3 months after the initial episode. The role of psychological stress in precipitating such a severe mood or psychotic disorder needs to be highlighted.

Wherever possible, psychosocial strategies should be preferred over medications in the first trimester as this period holds the highest risk for teratogenicity. When medications are deemed necessary, preference should be given to monotherapy using the lowest effective dose.

Each pregnancy should be closely monitored and appropriate screening tests (eg, foetal ultrasound if lithium is used in the first trimester) should be performed. 528 Divalproex should be avoided during pregnancy due to elevated risk of neural tube defects (up to 5%), even higher incidences of other congenital abnormalities, and evidence of striking degrees of neurodevelopmental delay in children at 3 years of age and loss of an average of nine IQ points. 529, 530, 531 Because of changes in physiology in the second and early third trimesters, such as increased plasma volume, hepatic activity, and renal clearance, patients may require higher doses of medications towards the later part of the pregnancy. Prenatal vitamins, including high‐dose (5 mg/day) folic acid, are also recommended, preferably even before conception and continuously through pregnancy; and preparations containing choline have recently been recommended as possibly preventive of the later development of schizophrenia. 532 While it is important to note that folic acid may reduce the effectiveness of lamotrigine, 251 the anti‐teratogenic effects of folate may outweigh the potential for this loss of effectiveness. However, recent concerns have been raised regarding a potential association between very high plasma levels of maternal folate and risk of autism spectrum disorders. 533

7.1.4 Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder during the postpartum period

The postpartum period is a time of elevated risk for recurrence, with 66% of women who were medication free during pregnancy and 23% of those on treatment experiencing a mood episode following the delivery. 534 The risk of postpartum relapse is highest in women who also experienced a mood episode during pregnancy and those who are not on prophylactic treatment. 535 Despite the high prevalence of postpartum episodes, there is a dearth of studies investigating the efficacy of medications during this period. There is evidence of efficacy of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and lithium for postpartum mania, 535 and quetiapine for postpartum bipolar depression (level 4). 536 There are no studies of psychotherapy in the acute or preventative treatment of bipolar postpartum depression. 537

### The impact of postpartum psychosis on partners [^113jwmuA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Barriers to accessing care and unmet needs

Partners identified barriers to accessing care for the mother. These included healthcare professionals failing to accurately identify what was wrong with the mother due to poor understanding, the lack of empathy from primary care services, and the lack of consistency in care and communication between healthcare professionals.

… [GP] just told [the mother] to go and have a bath, try and chill out for a bit, and take some natural sleeping remedies and you'll be fine… that's another day or two down the line and we tried that and she just got worse and worse and worse. (James)

… people in the healthcare profession, they could have helped more, and got to get us support sooner, that is at the centre of everything. (Stuart)

… the locum at the end was "you'll have to try harder than that to kill yourself", and I could have disappeared I was so angry. (Ben)

Partners described not being heard, either individually or as a couple, by healthcare professionals, and if they were listened to then it was only after the mother had reached crisis point. For most partners, no enquiry was made by healthcare professionals to the partner's own needs and no support offered.

… when the medical teams would be coming around and I would be talking to them, and thinking back, ignoring every single word I said… From the typical bloke perspective it was just kind of assumed by everyone that everything would be okay. There was never much discussion, even from family, but certainly not from any of the medical services, as to how I was, what concerns did I have. I was very much left to feel that you have got to cope… [this interview]… is probably the first time I actually had the opportunity to express it because going right back to day one no one ever really asks.

Discussion

PP is relatively a rare disorder that most commonly presents within the first 2–4 weeks after delivery, but can emerge as early as 2–3 days after childbirth. Rapid mood fluctuation is considered the hallmark; however, the rapid onset of paranoia, grandiosity, bizarre delusions, confused thinking and grossly disorganised behaviour may also be present. Insomnia, anxiety or depressed mood have been reported as early warning symptoms prior to PP.PP is a unique disease in that its trigger is definable: childbirth. Exact pathophysiology of the disease; however, has yet to be determined, with several theories ranging from hormonal change to immune dysregulation and circadian rhythm disruption. In this particular case, the patient's history of hypothyroidism and levothyroxine use during pregnancy gives credence to an autoimmune aetiology to her PP, with literature demonstrating a strong association between PP and autoimmune thyroiditis/thyroid dysfunction. Understanding of risk factors would facilitate timely and appropriate response from health professionals via heightened awareness and proper preventive measures such as lithium prophylaxis. These risk factors related to PP; however, are still poorly understood and rarely studied.

PP is a clinical diagnosis. The DSM-5 does not recognise PP as a distinct condition; rather, it adds a "with a postpartum onset" specifier if a woman met criteria for a brief psychotic disorder during or within 4 weeks post partum. Due to its similar presentation, bipolar disorder is an important differential diagnosis that must be considered, especially with prior history. Other psychiatric conditions that must be included, but are not limited to, are generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and postpartum depression, as well as organic causes of psychosis such as infection, recreational drugs and electrolyte disturbances to name a few. Notwithstanding the classification in DSM-5, PP is a psychiatric emergency that requires urgent evaluation, psychiatric referral and inpatient hospitalisation due to the gravity of consequences, such as suicide, infanticide, impaired mother–infant bonding, infant abuse and neglect. While the overall prognosis is positive for women who have sought help, screening protocols or treatment guidelines have yet to be established. Atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilisers and antiepileptics are common drugs of choice along with electroconvulsive therapy; however, there is a paucity of evidence to support their efficacy due to the difficulty of randomised trials.

### Clinical guidelines for postpartum women and infants in primary care-a systematic review [^113LHEcX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Selected guidelines

A total of 626 references were identified by the search. The titles and abstracts of these articles were reviewed by CH and 607 references were discarded because they were not primarily clinical guidelines or their scope did not include postpartum care in primary care. The full text of a further 19 references were compared against the inclusion criteria and another 13 articles were rejected, leaving six guidelines for inclusion in the review (see Figure 1 and Table 1). These were: beyondblue 'Depression and related disorders – anxiety, bipolar disorder and puerperal psychosis – in the perinatal period' (Australia); Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health (FSRH) 'Postnatal sexual and reproductive health' (UK); Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) 'Preventative services for children and adolescents' (USA); National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 'Routine postnatal care of women and their babies' (UK); Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) 'Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice' (Australia); and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) 'Management of perinatal mood disorders' (UK).

√ The guideline has included this topic in the document.

The countries from where the guidelines were sourced have different maternity care systems. In Australia, women will access their GP or obstetrician/paediatrician respectively for routine care around 6 weeks. All women can also visit free Child and Infant Health Nurses regularly from birth, although not all take advantage of the service. In the United States most women will visit an obstetrician for routine care for themselves and a paediatrician for the infant, including well-baby checks. In the UK midwives play a more significant role in the birth and subsequent postpartum care. Women have access to midwifery care at home for up to a month and health visitors for the remaining postpartum period.

### Postpartum psychiatric hospital admissions: a population-based study from British columbia, Canada [^115NXaej]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of psychiatric hospitalization increases in the year postpartum, and rates have been rising. However, data describing these admissions is limited. In this retrospective, population-based study of all deliveries between 2015–2019 in British Columbia (BC), Canada, we linked BC perinatal data registry with other health services data, including all hospital admissions. Rates, characteristics, and risk factors for postpartum psychiatric hospital admissions were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling. Following 189,530 deliveries, there were 812 postpartum psychiatric admissions (∼4/1000 deliveries). The most common indications for postpartum admission were depression (n = 233[28.7%]) and substance-related disorders (n = 234[28.8%]). These hospitalizations were short (median = 3 days, IQR(Q1-Q3) = 1–8), and relatively late (median = 5.5 months postpartum, IQR(Q1-Q3) = 68.5–251 days). Hospitalizations for psychosis and bipolar disorder occurred much later than expected (psychosis: median = 111 days postpartum (IQR = 32–213); bipolar disorder: median = 118 days (IQR = 42–230)). The risk factors most associated with these admissions were younger age, especially age < 20 (aOR = 5.01, 95% CI:3.60–6.98), receiving treatment for schizophrenia during pregnancy (aOR = 4.21, 95% CI:2.42–7.34), and a psychiatric diagnosis during pregnancy (aOR = 3.58, 95% CI:2.30–5.58). These results show that those at high risk of severe postpartum psychiatric illness were young, took antidepressants during pregnancy, and had a recent psychiatric illness. This knowledge could support early intervention and avoid the need for hospitalization. This research should be replicated and expanded to explore gaps in the healthcare system for severe postpartum psychiatric illness.

### Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care: a systematic scoping review of clinical practice guidelines since 2011 [^113GFgKv]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Mental and substance use disorders

A total of 20 guidelines were identified for mental and substance use disorders, which provided recommendations for general mental disorders, bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders, depression and anxiety, substance use disorders, alcohol use disorders, and tobacco use (Table 2, Additional file 6: Tables 6–10). All guidelines were developed by international bodies or from HICs (Australia and/or New Zealand, Canada, USA, and Scotland).

In total, 81 recommendations pertained to general mood disorders, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, and suicide and infanticide risk (Additional file 6: Table 6). Recommendations for screening during antenatal and postnatal period included assessment by personal or family history, and the use of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for pregnant adolescents. Clinical interventions covered the development of an individualized treatment plan, pharmacological treatment, and referrals to psychiatric services. At the health system level, involvement of a multidisciplinary care team (psychiatrists, gynecologists, pediatricians, and midwives) were recommended. One guideline specified the need for a nationally managed clinical network for perinatal mental health which should coordinate provision of services, establish pathways for referral and management, and establish competencies and training resources for health professionals. No recommendations were identified relating specifically to the intrapartum period.

For depression and anxiety, 256 recommendations covered psychosocial assessment using tools such as EPDS, pharmacotherapy (risk-benefit analysis, medication review, and dosage adjustment), and psychotherapy (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy) (Additional file 6: Table 7). Recommendations for women at high risk — such as suicidal or severely depressed — included involvement of partner support, and appropriate use of home treatment or hospitalization. Further clinical assessment were also recommended, including referral to psychiatric services, and actively supporting women to use mental health services and counselling interventions. During the postnatal period, recommendations for breastfeeding included indications and possible risks associated with pharmacotherapy. Additionally, recommendations covered neonatal monitoring for adverse effects associated with maternal use of psychoactive therapeutic agents. At the health system level, recommendations focused on availability of local guidelines, establishing health provider competencies, ensuring service availability for diagnosis and treatment, and providing education and training for involved health professionals.

### Postpartum psychosis: two cohorts compared, 1875–1924 and 1994–2005 [^114oXRh6]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There has been a long-standing debate as to whether postpartum psychoses are distinct from other psychoses. While the outcomes of postpartum psychosis are in general thought to be good, the disorder is linked to a high rate of suicide.

Method

We have utilized a database of 3872 admissions to the North Wales Asylum during the period 1875–1924 to extract data on the prevalence, course and clinical features of postpartum psychoses during this period. We have collected first admissions for postpartum psychosis between 1994 and 2005 in North West Wales to establish a current incidence rate for the disorder.

Results

The incidence of psychoses with a first onset in the postpartum period in North West Wales has fallen in the modern period, while the incidence of postpartum psychoses in women with a pre-existing mental illness remains the same. Some features of the clinical picture and course of postpartum psychoses differ from other psychoses, but may be gender rather than disorder linked.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that psychoses with their first onset in the postpartum period may be vanishing. If replicated, this would support claims that these disorders are distinct from other disorders. Alternately, if regarded as affective disorders, establishing the basis for the apparent decline in frequency of these disorders may have implications for other affective disorders.

### Relapse in the first three months postpartum in women with history of serious mental illness [^115Uvmnb]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Relapse of serious mental illness (psychotic and bipolar disorders; SMI) in the postpartum period is potentially devastating for mother and baby. There is limited evidence on whether medication in the perinatal period is protective against postpartum relapse for women with SMI particularly non-affective psychoses. We aimed to investigate risk factors for postpartum relapse, particularly the potential prophylactic effects of medication.

Methods

Using an anonymised resource of comprehensive electronic secondary mental health care records linked with maternity data, women with history of SMI who gave birth from 2007 to 2011 were identified. Relapse was defined as admission to acute care in the first 3 months postpartum. Women who were exposed to regular medication were compared with women who were unexposed. Data were analysed by pregnancy using random effects models to account for repeated measures in women who had more than one pregnancy in the study period.

Results

There were 452 full term pregnancies, of which 128 (28.3%) were associated with relapse in the first 3 months postpartum, with recent relapse an independent predictor (aOR; 95% CI:1.30–2.27). There was no evidence of a prophylactic effect of medication (crude OR = 0.65; 0.34–1.25) (aOR = 0.99; 0.54–1.83), in women with non-affective or affective psychoses (interaction test p = 0.453).

Conclusions

Recent relapse increases the risk of relapse in the postpartum period so women with severe illnesses with a recent history of relapse should be warned pre-conception about the high risk of relapse. The lack of evidence of a protective impact of medication prophylaxis may reflect confounding by indication.

In patients with a history of MDD prior to pregnancy who responded to antidepressant medications, and are currently stable on pharmacotherapy, weigh risk/benefit balance to both mother and fetus in treatment decisions. For older adults (≥ 65 years) with mild to moderate MDD, we suggest offering a first-line psychotherapy (see Recommendation 7). Patient preference and the additional safety risks of pharmacotherapy should be considered when making this decision.

### Psychotropic drug use in perinatal women with bipolar disorder [^115mkBUq]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Optimal dose management of psychotropic drugs during the perinatal period reduces the risk for recurrence of mood episodes in women with Bipolar Disorder. Physiological changes during pregnancy are associated with decreases in the plasma concentrations of the majority of mood stabilizing medications. Regular symptom and drug concentration monitoring for lithium and anticonvulsants with reflexive dose adjustment improves the probability of sustained symptom remission across pregnancy. The elimination clearance trajectory across pregnancy for psychotropics dictates the frequency of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment. The literature on the pharmacokinetics of lithium, lamotrigine, carbamazepine and atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy and postpartum are reviewed, recommendations for symptom and laboratory monitoring are proposed and recommendations for dose adjustments are presented.

### A call for better guidance and treatments for comorbid postpartum depression and substance use disorders [^116bSzau]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

According to various clinical guidelines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) such as citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline are the specific recommended pharmacological therapy for PPD. However, these recommendations are largely derived from research conducted outside the PPD context, given limited evidence for antidepressants in PPD. For instance, in the Cochrane Collaboration Review looking at the use of antidepressant treatment for postpartum depression, the authors identified 6 randomized controlled trials, but concluded that there was only "limited, low-quality evidence that antidepressants may be associated with greater response and remission rates than placebo" and that "overall certainty of the evidence in the meta-analysis for the comparison of SSRIs with placebo to be low". Critically, 5 of the 6 trials included in the Cochrane review specifically excluded participants with active alcohol or drug use-related concerns demonstrating that even these disappointing findings are likely not applicable to those with AUD or other substance use concerns.

However, guideline recommendations for antidepressant therapy in PPD are overall consistent with the fact that various studies have demonstrated that serotonergic antidepressant use is very common among persons with alcohol use and other substance use disorders. However, while SSRIs have a relatively favorable reproductive safety profile, SSRIs are not linked to the hypothesized models on the causes of postpartum depression. Given the links between excessive alcohol use and alcohol use disorder and PPD, it is noteworthy that certain guidelines have indicated that "there is insufficient evidence to define formal treatment recommendations" for those with comorbid substance use disorders such as alcohol use disorders. Importantly, the most recent American Psychological Association (APA) clinical practice guidelines and the American College of Physicians guidelines on the treatment of depression does not mention specific recommendation for PPD patients or highlight concerns with antidepressants in comorbid substance use disorder.

In addition, in the context of SSRI treatment as routine first-line pharmacological therapy in PPD, an under-appreciated literature highlights an opportunity to improve patient safety and outcomes among those with comorbid substance use concerns and PPD. Specifically, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis looked at controlled trials investigated the treatment effects on depression scores in participants with depression and addiction comorbidities. This review demonstrated no clear benefit for depression symptoms in those with substance use disorders (SUD), including alcohol use disorder, with SSRI therapy in comparison to placebo.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — antidepressant treatment in lactating women: Current evidence suggests untreated maternal depression can have serious and long-term effects and treatment may improve outcomes; therefore treatment is strongly preferred (II-2). For women with mild symptoms in the first 2 weeks postpartum, close follow-up rather than starting antidepressants is suggested (II-2). When symptoms are mild to moderate, psychological/cognitive behavioral therapy is the first line as it carries no known infant risk; mothers must be monitored and reevaluated, and if not improving or worsening, antidepressant drug treatment should be considered (II-2). If psychological/cognitive behavioral therapy is unavailable, symptoms are severe, or mothers refuse this therapy, antidepressants are an effective option.

### Functional recovery after postpartum psychosis: a prospective longitudinal study [^116efUhQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Postpartum psychosis is an acute and severe mood disorder. Although the prognosis is generally good, postpartum psychosis is a highly stressful life-event presumed to have a major impact on functioning and well-being beyond the acute stage of the illness. We studied functional recovery, including psychosocial functioning and the presence of psychological distress, in patients with a recent diagnosis of postpartum psychosis.

Methods

Seventy-eight patients with postpartum psychosis consecutively admitted for inpatient hospitalization between 2005 and 2011 were assessed 9 months postpartum. Included were patients with DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, brief psychotic disorder, or mood disorder with psychotic features, each requiring the additional specifier "with postpartum onset". Functioning was assessed in 4 domains by the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation-Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT). Symptomatology was measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory and compared to a matched population-based cohort.

Results

Nine months postpartum, 74% (58/78) of women with postpartum psychosis reported good functioning on the domains of work, interpersonal relations, recreation, and global satisfaction. Moreover, 88% (69/78) of patients with postpartum psychosis had resumed their premorbid employment and household responsibilities. Compared to the general population, patients with postpartum psychosis reported a higher burden of depression and anxiety (effect sizes r ≤ 0.14). Patients who had a relapse episode (18%) experienced considerable functional impairments across several domains.

Conclusions

Nine months postpartum, the majority of patients with postpartum psychosis reported good functional recovery. Our relatively improved functional outcomes compared to nonpostpartum onset could be attributed to the postpartum onset and/or more favorable risk factor profile.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline — adjunctive pharmacologic augmentation for metabolic side effects and weight loss in schizophrenia is supported with moderate confidence and a suggestion for use. We suggest using metformin, topiramate, or aripiprazole augmentation for treatment of metabolic side effects of antipsychotic medication and weight loss for individuals with schizophrenia, categorized as Reviewed, New-added, with the Work Group noting that its confidence in the quality of evidence was moderate and that benefits slightly outweighed harms or burdens. In one RCT (n = 66) of adjunctive metformin, mean weight change was -3.50 kg in the intervention group versus +4 kg in the control group. Safety considerations include concern regarding adverse cognitive effects with topiramate and increased risk of congenital anomalies, low birth weight, and low vitamin K with resultant bleeding risk in pregnant women, and metformin was found to be the augmenting agent used most frequently in clinical practice.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^111RGA5H]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Schizophrenia — agent-specific augmentation findings indicate that adjunctive N-acetylcysteine showed no improvement in negative symptoms, and mixed NMDA glutamate receptor (NMDAR) enhancing agents showed no associated improvement in cognitive and negative symptoms. In contrast, augmentation with oxytocin > 40 IU was associated with improvements in negative symptoms, and raloxifene was associated with improvement in cognitive symptoms; in premenopausal women, raloxifene treatment was linked to fewer psychotic and negative symptoms, better cognitive and social functioning, and fewer hospitalizations compared with TAU, and higher estrogen levels are strongly correlated with better cognitive performance in women with schizophrenia.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114ZZWRB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patients who are pregnant and lactating — Clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits for the maternal–fetal dyad when considering continued BZD prescribing or tapering for pregnant patients (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). For infants who have been exposed to BZD in utero and are at risk of neonatal withdrawal symptoms, clinicians should encourage breastfeeding, which can reduce neonatal withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), and communicate with the infant's healthcare provider (with parental consent) regarding exposure to BZDs (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Implementation considerations add that clinicians should monitor patients who are pregnant closely for psychiatric symptoms during the BZD taper, as these symptoms may evolve rapidly during the pregnancy and postpartum period due to shifts in metabolism that influence the effects of medications, including BZDs, and clinicians should address evolving psychiatric symptoms as clinically indicated.

### Clinical utilization of atypical antipsychotics in pregnancy and lactation [^1129UbWn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the available literature regarding the safety of atypical antipsychotics in pregnancy and lactation in order to recommend evidence-based strategies for pharmacologic management of psychosis in these conditions.

Data Sources

We summarized the results from articles identified via MEDLINE/PubMed/TOXNET (1993-January 31, 2004), using the key terms pregnancy, lactation, breast-feeding, human milk, psychotropic drugs, atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, clozapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Retrospective studies, clinical observations, and case reports regarding the 6 atypical antipsychotics mentioned above were selected and analyzed. Extensive manual review of pertinent journals and textbooks was also performed.

Data Synthesis

Reviewed studies show that olanzapine and clozapine apparently do not increase the teratogenic risk if administered to pregnant women, while evidence on quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone is still limited. In contrast, available information is not able to exclude unwanted serious effects associated with the use of all atypical antipsychotics on mother-infant dyads. Furthermore, more than a few studies suggest increased hyperglycemic risk for pregnant women related to atypical antipsychotic therapy during gestation. Finally, published evidence about the effects on long-term infant neurodevelopment of drug exposure through both placenta and breast milk is represented only by sporadic case reports.

Conclusions

It is well known that potential consequences of an untreated psychotic episode may be severe and may lead to the mother attempting suicide and/or infanticide. For these reasons, clinicians need to help mothers weigh both fetal and neonatal risks of exposure to drugs against the potential risk they and their infant may incur if the psychiatric illness is not treated. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotics in pregnancy and breast-feeding do not show evident advantages in safety when compared with typical neuroleptic agents. Therefore, we suggest that the most relevant parameters for selecting the best clinical option for pregnant and breast-feeding women with schizophrenia and related disorders remain strongly related to 3 main points: (1). cautious evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio of fetal and neonatal drug exposure, (2). degree of severity of maternal psychiatric illness, and (3). careful preliminary choice of drugs characterized by a balanced safety/efficacy profile.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^114yFLo9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for peripartum depression, more specifically with respect to antidepressants, ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend to offer SSRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy for perinatal depression. Consider offering SNRIs as reasonable alternatives. Individualize pharmacotherapy based on prior response to treatment, and if there is no pharmacotherapy history, offer sertraline or escitalopram as reasonable first-line medications.

### Existing and emerging pharmacological approaches to the treatment of mania: a critical overview [^113PQcpV]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Among FGAs, haloperidol presents a long-known efficacy in the treatment of acute mania and it is still classified as level 1 evidence (see Table 1), but the risk for counterpolar depressive switch and its poor safety/tolerability profile suggests its use as a second-line option or use in special populations, such as manic pregnant women due to its long-known reproductive safety.

In the case of a refractory ME, a pharmacogenetic study of cytochrome P450 enzymes (especially 2D6 and 3A4) could be indicated to exclude the eventuality of rapid/ultra-rapid metabolizers. Finally, Clozapine and Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT) are the main treatment options to be considered in refractory ME, when all the above-mentioned options are not effective.

Indications for current treatment options in special populations (children and adolescents, older-age, childbearing and breastfeeding women) can be found in all major guidelines and recent works on this topic.

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112ZRJNe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD guideline — pregnant or breastfeeding individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD): For individuals with mild to moderate MDD who are breastfeeding or pregnant, we recommend offering an evidence-based psychotherapy as a first-line treatment; in patients with a history of MDD prior to pregnancy who responded to antidepressant medications, and are currently stable on pharmacotherapy, weigh risk/benefit balance to both mother and fetus in treatment decisions (Strong for | Not reviewed, Amended). The evidence does not support recommending any specific evidence-based psychotherapy over another, and a meta-analysis found fair evidence that CBT and IPT are efficacious for treating postpartum depression; an additional RCT (n = 192) found group treatments were not significantly different from each other although they were not as effective as individual counseling, and an SR of 40 RCTs found fair evidence supporting CBT to treat and prevent depression for women during pregnancy and one year postpartum; there are no studies comparing psychotherapy to medication. Before the initiation of medication in women of childbearing age, providers should discuss whether the individual is sexually active and may be pregnant and the potential risks to the fetus, newborn, and mother of treated and untreated depression, and medication safety should be reviewed again with pregnant or breastfeeding patients who have been prescribed antidepressant medication.

### A clinical review of the use of common psychiatric medications in pregnancy: guidelines for obstetrical providers [^111wPC2L]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medications are commonly prescribed in pregnancy, and obstetrical providers should be informed about how and when to use them. The current narrative review addresses the use of some of the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications-antidepressants, sedatives and hypnotics, and antipsychotic drugs. The aim is neither a complete review of psychiatric disorders in pregnancy nor all possible psychological and pharmacological treatments for mental illness around the time of pregnancy. Rather, the focus is on therapeutic considerations for general obstetrical providers.

### FDA approves first oral treatment for postpartum depression… [^114kVCMS]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zurzuvae, the first oral medication indicated to treat postpartum depression in adults. PPD is a major depressive episode that typically occurs after childbirth but can also begin during the later stages of pregnancy. Until now, treatment for PPD was only available as an IV injection given by a health care provider in certain health care facilities. "Postpartum depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition in which women experience sadness, guilt, worthlessness — even, in severe cases, thoughts of harming themselves or their child. And, because postpartum depression can disrupt the maternal-infant bond, it can also have consequences for the child's physical and emotional development, " said Tiffany R. Farchione, M. D., director of the Division of Psychiatry in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

"Having access to an oral medication will be a beneficial option for many of these women coping with extreme, and sometimes life-threatening, feelings". The efficacy of Zurzuvae for the treatment of PPD in adults was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The trial participants were women with PPD who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for a major depressive episode and whose symptoms began in the third trimester or within four weeks of delivery. In Study 1, patients received 50 mg of Zurzuvae or placebo once daily in the evening for 14 days. In Study 2, patients received another zuranolone product that was approximately equal to 40 mg of Zurzuvae or placebo, also for 14 days. Patients in both studies were monitored for at least four weeks after the 14-day treatment.

The primary endpoint of both studies was the change in depressive symptoms using the total score from the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale, measured at day 15. Patients in the Zurzuvae groups showed significantly more improvement in their symptoms compared to those in the placebo groups. The treatment effect was maintained at Day 42 — four weeks after the last dose of Zurzuvae. The daily recommended dose for Zurzuvae is 50mg. It should be taken once every day, for 14 days, in the evening with a fatty meal. The FDA granted this application Priority Review and Fast Track designation. Approval of Zurzuvae was granted to Sage Therapeutics, Inc.

### ACOG guidelines on psychiatric medication use during… [^112Gc9HT]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Lithium therapy should be tapered before conception, but gradually restarted after organogenesis in women who have more severe episodes and are at moderate risk of short-term relapse. Lithium therapy should be continued throughout the pregnancy in women who have severe, frequent episodes, and these patients should be counseled about the reproductive risks associated with therapy. ANTIEPILEPTIC THERAPY FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER Several antiepileptic drugs are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, including valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. However, data on the fetal effects of these drugs come primarily from studies of women with seizures. It is not clear whether the underlying pathology of epilepsy contributes to the teratogenic effect of these drugs on the fetus. The use of lamotrigine during pregnancy has not been associated with any major fetal anomalies and is an option for maintenance therapy in women with bipolar disorder.

Valproic acid use during lactation has been studied in 41 maternal-infant dyads; only one infant was adversely affected with thrombocytopenia and anemia. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization consider valproic acid safe in breastfeeding women. Carbamazepine is ruled "probably safe"; rare side effects include transient cholestatic hepatitis and hyperbilirubinemia. Atypical antipsychotics have replaced typical agents as first-line therapy for psychotic disorders because these drugs are better tolerated and may be more effective in managing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The reproductive safety data on atypical antipsychotics are limited, but the use of olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and clozapine has been associated with increased rates of low birth weight and therapeutic abortion. No long-term studies of children exposed to atypical antipsychotics during gestation have been conducted.

Therefore, the routine use of these drugs during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended. Typical antipsychotics have a larger reproductive safety profile; no significant teratogenic effect has been documented with chlorpromazine, haloperidol, or perphenazine. Doses of typical antipsychotics should be minimized during the peri-partum period to limit the necessity of using additional medications to manage extrapyramidal side effects.
