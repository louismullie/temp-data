## Question

Viral exanthem

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a viral exanthem. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and exposure assessment. Then, I should characterize the rash morphology and distribution. Next, I will consider associated systemic symptoms and enanthems. After that, I will build a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline targeted diagnostic testing. Finally, I will address management, special populations, and when to escalate care, while continuously checking for pitfalls and correcting assumptions as needed.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of the history that narrow the differential quickly: age, immunization status, recent exposures, travel, season, sick contacts, and new medications, because these contextual clues often separate viral from drug-induced or bacterial etiologies and guide urgency of testing and isolation needs [^1176aEnF] [^112uGnjz]. I should double-check for measles and rubella susceptibility if unvaccinated, for vector exposures that raise arboviruses, and for STI risks that broaden testing to HIV, syphilis, and mpox, since missing these has public health and treatment implications [^112uGnjz] [^114HdsfZ] [^116bc6BQ] [^1158uASm].

> Wait, let me verify the morphology and distribution before anchoring on a single diagnosis, because maculopapular versus vesicular versus petechial patterns, and acral versus truncal versus flexural involvement, carry different probabilities of viral etiologies and severity signals [^116jiLNq]. I need to check for classic patterns: morbilliform eruptions suggest measles, rubella, parvovirus B19, EBV, or drug reactions; vesiculobullous lesions point to varicella, HSV, or enteroviruses like coxsackie A6; acral accentuation favors HFMD or Gianotti-Crosti; unilateral periflexural involvement suggests UTLE; and petechial or purpuric lesions should prompt concern for meningococcemia, RMSF, or parvovirus B19 variants, so I should not jump to conclusions until I map the distribution carefully [^114Mpf9r] [^112x8piF] [^114uJvXe] [^112kC3Ad] [^113WJTuC].

> Hold on, I should verify associated symptoms next, because enanthems, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and neurologic or respiratory signs can pivot the diagnosis. Koplik spots support measles. Oral ulcers support HFMD. Posterior cervical nodes support rubella. And the triad of fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis supports EBV, while symmetric arthralgias push me toward parvovirus B19, so I need to ask about these explicitly and examine the oropharynx and nodes [^114Mpf9r] [^112x8piF] [^115CkZd1]. I should also confirm whether the rash appeared at peak fever or after defervescence, since roseola's rash follows the fever break and that timing is diagnostically helpful [^114Mpf9r].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis in tiers, starting with common viral causes, then drug eruptions, then bacterial and atypical infections, and finally noninfectious mimics, because this prioritization reduces missed serious disease while avoiding unnecessary testing [^1176aEnF]. Common viral exanthems include measles, rubella, roseola, parvovirus B19, enteroviruses including coxsackie A6, EBV, and now SARS-CoV-2 with its polymorphic cutaneous patterns, so I should keep a broad viral net early and narrow based on morphology and epidemiology [^114Mpf9r] [^112x8piF] [^1167nVrQ]. Drug eruptions, especially morbilliform patterns, are common and often temporally linked to new medications, so I need to check initiation dates and cross-reactivity history before labeling a viral cause [^116aad29]. Bacterial mimics like scarlet fever, RMSF, and meningococcemia require prompt recognition and antibiotics, so I should screen for toxicity, purpura, and focal signs that would escalate care immediately [^1176aEnF].

> I will now examine targeted diagnostic testing, but wait, I should confirm that I am ordering tests that change management rather than fishing broadly. Serology is appropriate for measles, rubella, parvovirus B19, EBV, and HIV when suspected, and PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs helps for enteroviruses, adenovirus, and SARS-CoV-2; in children with nonspecific exanthems, multiplex panels can increase yield, though clinical correlation remains essential [^115nZrHV] [^1156hxUv]. I should double-check that I am not over-ordering skin biopsies, because histology is often nonspecific in morbilliform viral eruptions and cannot reliably distinguish viral from drug causes, though it can exclude mimics like vasculitis, AGEP, or lymphoproliferative disease when the presentation is atypical or severe [^111q2N25].

> But wait, what if the eruption is urticarial or vesicular rather than classic maculopapular? I need to ensure I do not conflate urticaria with viral exanthems, since urticaria is evanescent and often infection-associated in children, whereas fixed viral exanthems are more persistent, and this distinction guides whether I pursue an infectious workup versus symptomatic antihistamine therapy [^1114q1bc]. If vesicles are present, I should confirm VZV or HSV with PCR from a lesion swab and consider enterovirus testing when distribution and season fit, because missing varicella or HSV changes isolation and antiviral decisions, especially in immunocompromised hosts [^115rqsu6] [^112x8piF].

> Next, I should review management principles, and I need to ensure I am not over-treating self-limited viral exanthems. Supportive care with antipyretics, topical corticosteroids for pruritus, and emollients is usually sufficient, while antivirals are reserved for specific indications such as acyclovir for varicella or HSV, and oseltamivir for influenza when within the therapeutic window, so I should verify the pathogen and timing before prescribing [^1139k7tW]. I should confirm isolation precautions for measles, varicella, and COVID-19, and counsel on contagion windows, because parvovirus B19 is no longer infectious once the rash appears, whereas measles and varicella remain contagious, which affects school and childcare decisions [^1159yF5A].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and complications so I do not miss high-risk scenarios. In pregnancy, parvovirus B19, measles, rubella, varicella, and syphilis carry fetal risks and warrant serologic confirmation and obstetric co-management, so I must ask about gestational age and prior immunity before reassuring the patient [^1168oMvo]. In immunocompromised patients, disseminated HSV or VZV, COVID-19 vasculopathy, and drug-induced eruptions like AGEP or DRESS are more likely and may require biopsy, broader infectious testing, and early specialty input, so I should lower thresholds for escalation here [^111q2N25] [^112Cg6RZ]. In children with atopic dermatitis, I need to check for eczema herpeticum when there are painful, punched-out erosions or hemorrhagic crusts, because this is an emergency requiring systemic acyclovir and hospitalization if severe [^116SrNsy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that any new drug exposure within 1–2 weeks would automatically implicate a drug eruption, but I should double-check that assumption because viral exanthems and drug eruptions can be morphologically indistinguishable and timing alone is insufficient. A careful reconciliation of start dates, prior tolerances, and the clinical course is necessary before attributing causality and discontinuing essential medications [^111q2N25]. I also need to ensure I do not overcall COVID-19 solely based on a morbilliform rash without compatible epidemiology or testing, even though SARS-CoV-2 can produce diverse exanthems that may precede or accompany systemic symptoms [^1167nVrQ].

> Let me reconsider the role of biopsy one more time to avoid missteps. While I initially thought a biopsy might help distinguish viral from drug causes, I should confirm that vacuolar interface dermatitis and dyskeratosis are nonspecific and shared across viral, drug, and GVHD etiologies, so biopsy is most useful when I need to exclude vasculitis, AGEP, SJS/TEN, lymphoma, or nutritional deficiencies, or when the eruption is atypical, persistent, or severe and the diagnosis remains unclear despite targeted testing [^111q2N25]. If I do biopsy, I should request viral staining or PCR selectively when HSV/VZV is suspected, recognizing that routine H&E alone rarely yields a specific viral diagnosis in morbilliform eruptions [^111q2N25].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and safety-netting advice, because some viral exanthems evolve over days to weeks and require anticipatory guidance. Parents should be counseled on expected course, warning signs such as respiratory distress, altered mental status, bleeding, or rapidly progressive purpura, and when to return, and I should arrange follow-up to verify resolution and address complications like onychomadesis after coxsackie A6 or persistent pruritus after parvovirus B19, ensuring the diagnosis remains consistent as new findings emerge [^112x8piF] [^113WJTuC]. If the rash fails to follow the expected trajectory or new systemic symptoms develop, I need to revisit the differential, repeat exposure and medication histories, and consider additional testing or biopsy to avoid premature closure [^1176aEnF].

Viral exanthems are **common, mostly self-limited rashes** caused by systemic viral infections, with presentations ranging from classic childhood diseases (measles, rubella, roseola, fifth disease, varicella) to atypical or emerging patterns such as COVID-19 and Coxsackievirus A6 HFMD variants [^114Mpf9r] [^1167nVrQ] [^112x8piF]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by morphology, distribution, and epidemiology; **confirmatory testing** (PCR, serology) is reserved for atypical cases or public health concerns [^112uGnjz] [^115nZrHV]. Most cases resolve with supportive care, but clinicians must recognize red flags (respiratory distress, altered mental status, purpura, immunocompromise) and manage complications promptly [^1176aEnF] [^1139k7tW].

---

## Clinical features and classification

Viral exanthems are **classified by morphology and distribution**, which guide diagnosis and management:

| **Morphology** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Maculopapular | Measles, rubella, roseola, parvovirus B19, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, enteroviruses, HIV, COVID-19 [^116eCghd] [^1167nVrQ] |
| Vesicular | Varicella, HSV, Coxsackievirus (HFMD), COVID-19 vesicular eruptions [^113hH1pG] [^1167nVrQ] |
| Urticarial | COVID-19, enteroviruses, EBV, CMV [^1167nVrQ] |
| Petechial/purpuric | Meningococcemia, RMSF, parvovirus B19, COVID-19 vasculitis [^1167nVrQ] [^111n9wFu] |
| Papulovesicular acral | Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, Coxsackievirus A6 (eczema coxsackium) [^114uJvXe] [^112c7joG] |

- **Laboratory testing**: PCR/serology for measles, rubella, parvovirus B19, EBV, CMV, enteroviruses, HIV, COVID-19; CBC, LFTs, urinalysis as indicated [^115nZrHV] [^1156hxUv].
- **Imaging**: Rarely indicated unless systemic complications suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Most viral exanthems are **self-limited** and managed supportively:

- **Supportive care**: Antipyretics, antipruritics, topical corticosteroids, hydration [^111qaFtR].
- **Antiviral therapy**: Acyclovir for varicella/HSV; oseltamivir for influenza if indicated [^notfound].
- **Isolation precautions**: Measles, varicella, COVID-19, mpox per public health guidance [^114r53Qq].

Complications vary by virus and host factors; **key risks** include:

- **Respiratory**: Pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup [^notfound].
- **Neurologic**: Encephalitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome [^116UWfSp].
- **Hematologic**: Thrombocytopenia, aplastic crisis (parvovirus B19) [^1159yF5A].
- **Dermatologic**: Secondary infection, scarring, postinflammatory pigment change [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Congenital infection, fetal loss (measles, rubella, parvovirus B19, Zika) [^1168oMvo].

---

## Preventive measures

Prevention relies on **vaccination, hygiene, and public health** measures:

- **Vaccination**: MMR, varicella, influenza, COVID-19, mpox (high-risk groups) [^notfound].
- **Hygiene**: Handwashing, respiratory etiquette, avoiding close contact [^notfound].
- **Public health**: Surveillance, outbreak control, travel advisories [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally excellent** for immunocompetent patients; most exanthems resolve in 1–3 weeks without sequelae. Poorer outcomes occur with immunocompromise, comorbidities, or delayed care [^113EFxWD].

---

Viral exanthems are **common, mostly benign rashes** with diverse causes and presentations. Accurate clinical recognition, selective testing, and supportive care are the cornerstones of management, with vigilance for complications and public health implications.

### Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem in association with coronavirus disease 2019 [^112kC3Ad]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Given the right-sided predominance and flexural distribution, this rash is most consistent with a unilateral laterothoracic exanthem (UTLE). UTLE is typically characterized by a unilateral, periflexural exanthema that often involves the axillae and spreads to the contralateral side over time. Individual cases of UTLE in association with Epstein Barr virus and parvovirus B19 have been reported.UTLE is typically preceded by nonspecific systemic symptoms, including low-grade fever, diarrhea, or rhinitis. Although most often seen in children, UTLE can affect adults.

The differential diagnosis in this patient with known SARS-CoV-2 infection included viral exanthema and exanthematous drug eruption. However, UTLE has not been associated with medications. Although acetaminophen is a rare cause of exanthematous drug eruptions, the time course of this eruption after 2 days of medication administration and resolution while on acetaminophen would be exceedingly quick. The morphology of the rash could be consistent with symmetric drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema but the patient's rash improved while she was on acetaminophen, making this diagnosis much less likely. Many cases of UTLE are initially mistaken for contact dermatitis because of the unusual distribution. Pathology of UTLE is nonspecific, similar to viral exanthem and exanthematous drug eruption, and typically shows mild spongiosis with variable lymphocytic perivascular infiltrates. UTLE typically self-resolves with supportive care within 3 to 6 weeks without recurrence.

### Defining D-irAEs: consensus-based disease definitions for the diagnosis of dermatologic adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^112Zr1ED]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

ICI-exanthem

ICI-exanthem is a common specific D-irAE that typically presents early in the ICI treatment course. Although there is some ambiguity in the name of this entity, the development of a type IV hypersensitivity (commonly manifested as an exanthematous/morbilliform drug rash) implies unique immunologic pathways that warrant a specific morphologic diagnosis.

ICI-exanthem often presents with itching, but burning has been reported and some cases can be asymptomatic. ICI-exanthem can be classified into two morphologic subtypes based on the panel's experience: (1) morbilliform, characterized by erythematous papules (3–4 mm) that may coalesce into plaques on the torso, extremities, and less commonly the face; (2) macular erythema, which involves geographic erythematous patches or thin scaly erythematous plaques. Later in the course of an ICI-exanthem, superficial desquamation is often present.

Notably, ICI-exanthem can precede more severe D-irAEs. As such, if patients who have been diagnosed with ICI-exanthem develop systemic symptoms, bullous lesions, or mucosal involvement, revision in D-irAE diagnostic category should be considered (online supplemental table S11).

The proposed workup for ICI-exanthem includes the standard D-irAE evaluation. Diagnostic evaluation for ICI-exanthem commonly includes an FSE by a BCD and may include biopsies in cases without classic features or where there is morphologic overlap with other specific D-irAEs. Laboratory studies may be done to rule out systemic hypersensitivity.

Consensus by expert panel adjudication was reached for the morphologic subtypes of ICI-exanthem (median: 8, range 5–9), the symptoms (median: 8, range 7–9), the supportive examination findings (median: 8, range 7–9), labs/imaging (median: 8, range 6–9), diagnostic criteria accuracy (median: 8, range 3–9), and usability (median: 8, range 3–9) (online supplemental table S12).

### Viral exanthems [^112uGnjz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Determining the viral cause of a rash presents significant diagnostic challenges. We review contemporary literature on viral exanthems and suggest a structured approach to aid diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Strains responsible for, and the clinical presentation of, enteroviral infections have diverged from classic descriptions. The causative relationship between antibiotic administration and rash in Epstein-Barr virus infection has been recently questioned. Major measles virus outbreaks have recently occurred in Europe and the USA. The largest Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has resulted in importation of the virus to other countries and secondary local transmission. Autochthonous transmission of Chikungunya virus has occurred in nonendemic areas, including Europe, the Caribbean and Americas. Zika virus has re-emerged in the Pacific with local transmission from imported cases. Climate change, global warming and spillover of zoonotic viruses are contributing to the emergence and spread of viral diseases.

Summary

Important clues to the diagnosis of viral exanthems include their distribution and morphology, geographic location and potential exposure to vector-borne or blood-borne viruses. Diagnosis is commonly made via serology, nucleic acid tests or, rarely, viral culture. Skin biopsy is not usually required. In general, viral exanthems are self-limiting and treatment is supportive.

### Petechial and purpuric rashes during a parvovirus B19 outbreak: are skin symptoms differentiated? [^111n9wFu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Human parvovirus B19 typically causes erythema infectiosum, but unusual exanthems and hemorrhagic manifestations, such as purpuric-petechial rashes, have also been reported. PVB19-associated purpuric-petechial eruption (PAPPE) should be recognized as a distinct clinical feature of primary parvovirus B19 infection and considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with febrile purpura. This report aims to highlight several scenarios of B19V-associated petechial and purpuric rashes, which may present to pediatric departments during outbreaks.

### Toxic exanthems in the adult population [^115Cwa1N]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Frequently the internist is confronted with the nonspecific exanthematous eruption. While often a sign of a benign and self-limiting process, an exanthem also might herald the development of a more severe systemic syndrome. Infections, immune-mediated processes, drug reactions, a neoplasm, and familial syndromes with poor prognoses might all manifest initially with an exanthem. A thorough history and complete physical examination should be performed on all patients who present with an exanthem. Characterization of the exanthem morphology, other physical examination findings, and review of systems can help guide laboratory testing and ensure prompt diagnosis and early treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions. This article provides a brief overview of the conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of an ill patient with an exanthem.

### Clinical patterns and morphology of COVID-19 dermatology [^112wyrio]. Dermatologic Clinics (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emergent disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread throughout the globe since its discovery in December 2019. Although first appreciated to cause pneumonia, numerous organ systems are now known to be involved. The objective of this article is to review the broad spectrum of cutaneous manifestations reported in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most commonly reported cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection include pernio (chilblain)-like acral lesions, morbilliform (exanthematous) rash, urticaria, vesicular (varicella-like) eruptions, and vaso-occlusive lesions (livedo racemosa, retiform purpura). It is important to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with these lesions in the appropriate clinical context, as cutaneous manifestations may be present in otherwise asymptomatic individuals, or present before developing other symptoms of infection. With increased access to diagnostic testing, we are beginning to understand the utility and limitations of currently available assays.

### Teledermatology viewpoint: sudden onset of a widespread rash [^1159yF5A]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum (EI), is a childhood exanthem that is benign in nature and commonly occurs in school-age children in the early spring and late winter months. The viremia is a result of a parvovirus B19, nonenveloped single-stranded DNA virus. It is highly infectious and spreads in the air through respiratory droplets. Interestingly, by the time the rash appears, children are no longer infectious. Patients usually exhibit a nonspecific prodrome or are entirely asymptomatic before the classic skin findings of "slapped-cheeks" and a pruritic, erythematous net-like rash arise. As the rash fades, the reticular or lace-like pattern may become confluent. Although the disease is self-limited, exercise leading to overheating can lead to reappearance of the erythema, but usually not pruritus, in the areas where rash occurred for weeks to months. Pramoxine-containing moisturizers, low-potency topical corticosteroids, and oral antihistamines may be used to control any associated pruritus.

EI requires consideration of certain special populations. In adolescents with sickle cell disease, it is associated with red cell aplasia — otherwise known as aplastic crisis. Complications such as acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration crisis, nephrotic syndrome, stroke, and acute severe pain occur after the viremia phase of EI.EI can also cause harmful effects to both pregnant mothers and the fetus. Risk of adverse fetal outcomes has been associated with EI, including the development of fetal anemia, fetal hydrops, and fetal death. No specific treatment is available; however, counseling of at-risk mothers and monitoring of confirmed fetal infections throughout pregnancy will likely decrease fetal mortality. Here, we present a case that uniquely uses teledermatology as a way to identify and diagnose EI.

### Baboon syndrome in childhood: easy to avoid, easy to diagnose, but the problem continues [^117UGDfu]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Baboon syndrome was first described as a particular type of systemic contact dermatitis, characterized by an exanthem with involvement of the buttocks and flexures. In children, it is an important entity to take into account for the differential diagnosis of viral exanthem. A large number of allergens have been implicated, although inhalation of mercury vapor is a common trigger. We present the findings in 14 patients younger than 14 years with baboon syndrome. We also look at the frequency in children and the most common causes and triggers in our area.

### Diffuse purpuric eruption in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia [^112kgT1z]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 67-year-old Caucasian female newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was initiated on chemotherapy with daunorubicin 60 mg/m 2 (days 1–3) and cytarabine 100 mg/m 2 (days 1–7). The patient developed a progressive, purpuric eruption on day 20 post-treatment initiation. She had diffuse, purpuric macules involving her trunk, chest, extremities, face, scalp, and palate (Fig 1). Her eruption became more confluent in the days following her initial presentation (Fig 2). Bloodwork revealed severe pancytopenia with negative autoimmune markers, infectious work-up, and normal complements. Punch biopsy revealed extravasated red blood cells in the superficial dermis without any vasculitis or inflammation (Fig 3).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Cutaneous vasculitis
B. Fixed drug eruption
C. Viral exanthem
D. Progressive papular purpuric eruption
E. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis

Answers:
A. Cutaneous vasculitis – Incorrect. While both vasculitis and progressive papular purpuric eruption associated with cytarabine may appear clinically similar, the absence of vasculitis on histology points away from this diagnosis.
B. Fixed drug eruption – Incorrect. The diffused involvement of this eruption, lesion morphology, and absence of histologic evidence rule out this diagnosis.
C. Viral exanthem – Incorrect. Although immunosuppressed, this patient did not have any other clinical signs or symptoms indicative of viral infection, nor was her infectious work-up remarkable. Further, histologic assessment was not consistent with this diagnosis.
D. Progressive papular purpuric eruption – Correct. A frequently used antineoplastic for hematologic malignancies, cytarabine can cause a progressive papular purpuric eruption that develops during or days to weeks after treatment. Unlike other more serious dermatoses induced by cytarabine use, this purpuric eruption shows evidence of hemorrhage and purpura with several possible concomitant features such as spongiosis, acantholysis and dyskeratosis, and/or lymphocytic infiltrate on biopsy. Patients often also have evolution of their eruption with involvement of the skin folds.
E. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis – Incorrect. While most associated with cytarabine, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis presents with sterile neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis.

### Role of human herpesvirus 6 infection in young Brazilian children with rash illnesses [^111oGfTj]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) has been shown to infect almost all children by 4 years of age. Primary infection causes an undifferentiated febrile illness, with approximately 30% of children exhibiting the classic clinical manifestations of exanthem subitum. Even with typical clinical presentation, exanthem subitum is frequently misdiagnosed as measles or rubella. Our aim was to describe the frequency and clinical manifestations of HHV-6 infection in children less than 4 years of age enrolled in a study designed to define the etiology of rash diseases.

Patients and Methods

The study was conducted between January 1998 and December 2006 at a general hospital and a large primary health care unit from Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Sera from 223 children, in whom measles, rubella, dengue fever, and parvovirus B19 infections were excluded, were studied for anti-HHV-6 antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescence test. Demographic and clinical data of those patients were described.

Results

Ninety-seven (43.5%) of the children had evidence of primary HHV-6 infection. The age of onset peaked at 6–11 months and 75% of the HHV-6 infection occurred in children between 6 and 17 months. Only 21% of the HHV-6 cases had a typical roseola-like illness and 73% and 46%, respectively, fulfilled the clinical criteria of measles and rubella suspected case.

Conclusions

Our study confirms the importance of HHV-6 infection in young children and highlights the difficulties of diagnosing a rash illness on clinical grounds alone.

### West nile virus encephalitis presenting with a vesicular dermatitis [^1159VFHU]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Suggestive clinical symptoms and confirmatory laboratory testing are necessary to diagnose WNV infection. Presentation of symptoms during mosquito season and travel to known areas of transmission should increase suspicion for WNV. Clinical symptoms and routine blood tests do not offer specific signs of WNV infection. Computed tomography imaging is often normal, but magnetic resonance imaging may show abnormalities in approximately one-third of WNV encephalitis cases. WNV infection is diagnosed by the presence of WNV-specific IgM antibodies in the serum or CSF. Detection of WNV IgM in the CSF indicates central nervous system involvement. CSF analysis may also show increased protein levels, normal glucose, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Detection of WNV antigen in formalin-fixed central nervous system tissues by immunohistochemistry or reverse transcription-PCR has been reported as an adjunctive measure.

Patients infected with WNV may present with a morbilliform eruption affecting the trunk and extremities, but reported rates are variable (25%-50%). A vesicular eruption associated with WNV has not been previously reported. WNV-associated rash commonly appears 3 to 7 days after symptom onset and typically lasts up to 7 days. Rash onset frequently coincides with defervescence. WNV-associated rashes may be associated with tingling, burning, and pruritus. Analysis of large-scale WNV outbreaks revealed an inverse association between rash and risk of encephalitis and death, after adjusting for age. The pathomechanisms underlying the improved prognosis of patients with WNV-associated rash is unclear, but its presence may represent a stronger host immune response against the virus. Rare histologic characterizations of WNV-associated rash have reported histopathologic features similar to those seen in viral exanthem, including superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time WNV proteins have been sought by IHC and/or IF on a WNV related rash, and these studies revealed strong WNV NS1 intracellular staining in keratinocytes by both IF and IHC. The presence of WNV NS1 protein in lesional skin raises the possibility that that the cutaneous eruptions in WNV infections may be mediated by an immune response against viral proteins present in the skin.

### Viral exanthems: an update [^114UoADN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Classic viral exanthems, such as measles, rubella, and Fifth disease, have great historical significance and, despite vaccine successes, still occur both in the United States and across the world. Because they are either less commonly seen (e.g., measles) or recognized by pediatricians (e.g. Fifth disease), viral exanthems that present to dermatology clinics are often "atypical" and may cause diagnostic confusion. This article will first review a general approach to the patient with a possible viral exanthem, discuss several current issues germane to "classic" exanthems, and delve into greater detail regarding atypical presentations.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^112Cg6RZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Photolocalized varicella
B. Phototoxic drug reaction
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda
D. Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

Answers:
A. Photolocalized varicella – Correct. Varicella is a common viral infection with a characteristic exanthem. Although viral rashes aggravated by sun exposure, trauma, and inflammation have been described, photolocalized varicella is rare, and the typical distribution may not be seen. As with our patient, a mild viral prodrome or constitutional symptoms are often reported. This case highlights the importance of including varicella in the differential diagnosis of a photolocalized eruption, especially in a patient with a known history of exposure and immunosuppression.
B. Phototoxic drug reaction – Incorrect. Phototoxic drug reactions present as more similar to a sunburn than to a pruritic eruption. Commonly reported etiologic drugs include vemurafenib, voriconazole, doxycycline, hydrochlorothiazide, amiodarone, and chlorpromazine. This patient was taking only ustekinumab and prednisone.
C. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. Porphyria cutanea tarda is a disorder of porphyrin accumulation and is characterized by painful vesicles that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, most commonly the hands and face. Most cases are due to acquired or inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency.
D. PMLE – Incorrect. PMLE is an idiopathic photodermatosis that can present with a wide range of morphologies.PMLE can affect any skin type but is more commonly reported in lighter skin types. Systemic symptoms are rare in PMLE.
E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a subtype of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that usually presents symmetrically as an annular or papulosquamous eruption distributed on the sun-exposed sites of the skin.

### Lyme disease as a cause of acropapular dermatitis of childhood [^114infVx]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acropapular dermatitis of childhood is a symmetric self-limited papulovesicular exanthem that classically occurs on the cheeks, extensor extremities, and buttocks in young children. The eruption of acropapular dermatitis of childhood represents a reaction to a variety of infections usually of viral origin. We present a child with typical findings of acropapular dermatitis of childhood whose serologic workup revealed an acute Lyme infection.

### Erythema multiforme [^116USwR5]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, (MP), and less commonly other agents such as Poxviruses and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -Coronavirus 2(although some EM remain "idiopathic: see below). Epidemiological data of EM are scarce. The estimated prevalence ranges between 0.01% and 1%.EM predominantly affects young adults, with a female preponderance, having a worldwide distribution without any ethnic predilection. The clinical presentation is typically characterized by raised acral target lesions on the skin with sometimes mucous membranes involvement, causing significant morbidity, impaired food intake, acute pain, hospitalization, and possible long-term sequelae. The treatment is mainly symptomatic and the use of systemic corticosteroids remains debated. The objective of this review is to detail a pragmatic approach to EM, focusing on the identification of triggers, red flags and management, providing a roadmap for future research. New concepts regarding nosology and severity will be provided as well.

### An old virus with atypical presentation-tomato flu? [^117YEvtQ]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

Enterovirus serotypes mainly CA 6 and CA 16 has variety of clinical presentation. Even if TF was described as a rare non-life-threatening disease considered endemic in India, with a potential epidemic, recent evidence showed it could be a variant of an old disease, the HFMD. As an atypical manifestation was described, the disease's geographical spreading and clinical evolution should be closely monitored, as recent outbreaks of other viral diseases urge caution. More information is therefore needed with more samples from endemic region is required to be sequenced to generate more scientific evidence, regional and central WHO office should clear the misconception around the virus and the diseases. Its similarity with other viral exanthems may lead to an under or late diagnosis of those latter. If delayed or non-diagnosed, those other viral infections could seriously affect children and families as some of them, such as measles, may have severe complications. Therefore, frontline healthcare providers should be aware of these various viral rash differentials and informed of the new scientific evidence and epidemiologic distribution of TF for their daily practice. Family and communities should increase surveillance of children in shared spaces during outbreaks and apply preventive measures dictated by health authorities based on scientific evidence.

### Gloves and socks syndrome: early and late histopathologic features [^1126THuM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Gloves and socks syndrome (GSS) is a recently described exanthem, most commonly caused by parvovirus B19.

Objective

Our purpose was to describe both early and late histopathologic features of GSS.

Methods

We performed histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens from a case of GSS and reviewed all the English-language literature reports of GSS to compare the reported histologic descriptions.

Results

A total of 46 cases of GSS have been reported in the English-language literature. In 18 of those, the pathologic features were described. The histologic features of the current case evolved from a nonspecific superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate to a vacuolar interface dermatitis with necrotic keratinocytes, erythrocyte extravasation, and a superficial perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate.

Conclusion

Early lesions of GSS show nonspecific features common to viral exanthems. The late features, of a fully evolved exanthem, demonstrate a vacuolar interface dermatitis with necrotic keratinocytes, a superficial perivascular and interstitial infiltrate, and dermal hemorrhage. These late pathologic features, together with the clinical appearance of GSS, may help distinguish it from other entities.

### Children atopic dermatitis: diagnosis, mimics, overlaps, and therapeutic implication [^116SrNsy]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

4.2.3 Eczema herpeticum

Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a life‐threatening viral infection, which occurs acutely and is due to HSV in patients with a history of AD. Nearly a third of children who are hospitalized for AD infectious complications were related to EH. It can manifest with skin pruritus or pain and presence of vesicles, punched‐out erosions, or haemorrhagic crusts that can become more extensive. A local skin infection may progress to disseminated vesicles with skin breakdown. Systemic EH infection may present with fever, malaise, viremia, and complications including kerato‐conjunctivitis, encephalitis, and septic shock. Patients with AD who develop EH tend to have more severe AD, earlier‐onset AD, high total serum immunoglobulin E/peripheral eosinophils, and presence of other atopic diseases such as food allergies and asthma, as compared to their AD counterparts without EH.

It may be confused with impetigo, especially in patients with a history of severe AD (EH incognito) or in the early stages with AD itself. Bacterial positivity on skin culture does not exclude EH. The diagnosis can be confirmed by PCR or Tzank smear.

4.2.4 Eczema coxsackium

Coxsackium eczema (EC) is due to coxsackievirus A6 and frequently presents as EH‐like with a greater prevalence of haemorrhagic vesicles over dermatitis, thus casting diagnostic doubt with AD, which is often associated. Some patients with EC may also have symptoms of the hand‐foot‐mouth disease, such as oral sores and papules involving hands and feet. Other possible symptoms include fever, sore throat, and poor appetite.EC should be considered also as a differential diagnosis for EH because it can present with extensive vesicles and skin erosion. However, contrast to EH, EC is not life‐threatening and can be managed with standard AD treatments. The diagnosis is supported by PCR.

4.2.5 Viral exanthem

Viral exanthems (e.g. hand‐foot and mouth disease, unilateral laterothoracic exanthema, Gianotti‐Crosti syndrome) are a heterogeneous group of disorders with cutaneous manifestations that may occasionally resemble AD. However, the sudden, symmetrical mode of onset with small, well‐demarcated plaques allow them to be distinguished from AD, in addition to the presence of other systemic symptoms.

### Outbreak of exanthematous illness associated with zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses, salvador, Brazil [^116UWfSp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The epidemic curve peaked in the first week of May, which was 1 week after molecular diagnosis of ZIKV in 8 patients residing ≈50 km from Salvador and during a period of intense media coverage of the outbreak (Figure). Reporting of suspected dengue cases in Salvador did not vary substantially from that in other years and was > 5 times lower: 2,630 cases, of which 165/366 (45.1%) were positive for dengue IgM, 20/590 (3.4%) positive for dengue virus nonstructural protein 1, and 1/11 (9.1%) positive for dengue virus by reverse transcription PCR (Figure). During the same period, 58 cases of suspected chikungunya were reported and 24 patients with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome were hospitalized.

Figure
Reported cases of indeterminate acute exanthematous illness and suspected dengue fever in Salvador, Brazil, by date of medical care, February 15−June 25, 2015. Letters indicate specific events. A) February 15: systematic reporting of cases of acute exanthematous illness of unknown cause begins in Salvador. B) April 13: Salvador Epidemiologic Surveillance Office releases its first epidemiologic alert about the outbreak in Salvador. C) April 29: Zika virus is confirmed in 8 samples from patients residing ≈50 km from Salvador and media coverage of the outbreak intensifies. D) May 14: Brazilian Ministry of Health announces circulation of Zika virus in Brazil. E) June 11: Brazilian press announces that cases of Zika virus infection have been confirmed in 8 states in Brazil.

The median age of case-patients was 26 years (interquartile range 11–39 years), but all age groups were affected, which is a pattern typical of spread of new microorganisms (or subtypes) in a susceptible population. Median duration of symptoms at time of medical attention was 1 day (interquartile range 0–3 days). All patients had exanthema and most (12,711/14,093 [90.2%]) had pruritus. Fever (4,841/13,786, 35.1%), arthralgia (278/1,048 [26.5%]), headache (3,446/13,503 [25.6%]), and myalgia (223/1,033 [21.6%]) were less common.

### Human herpesvirus 7 in dermatology: what role does it play? [^1172nr1V]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) was discovered in 1989 as a new member of the beta-herpesvirus subfamily. Primary infection occurs early in life and manifests as exanthema subitum, or other febrile illnesses mimicking measles and rubella. Thus, HHV-7 has to be considered as a causative agent in a variety of macular-papular rashes in children. In addition, HHV-7 was found in some cases of other inflammatory skin disorders, such as psoriasis. There are controversial data on the detection of HHV-7 in pityriasis rosea, but so far there is not enough evidence for a pathogenetic association of HHV-7 with this exanthematic skin disease. Although HHV-7 can be found in some cases of Hodgkin's disease, there are no data supporting a direct causative role in this lymphoma type nor in other nodal or primary cutaneous lymphomas. In various epidemiologic forms of Kaposi's sarcoma, infection of monocytic cells with HHV-7 was demonstrated, which may indirectly influence tumor biology. In the context of immunosuppression, HHV-7 has recently been identified as an emerging pathogen in transplant recipients and may exacerbate graft rejection in renal transplant recipients. The ability of HHV-7 to induce cytokine production in infected cells could make HHV-7 an important pathogenetic co-factor in inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Moreover, the restricted cellular tropism of HHV-7 may render this virus an interesting vector for gene therapy. Thirteen years after the discovery of HHV-7, there has been considerable progress in characterizing its genetic structure, virus-induced effects on infected host cells and in the development of diagnostic tools. Nevertheless, the role of HHV-7 in various skin diseases and the clinical manifestations of reactivation of HHV-7 infection have still to be defined.

### Unusual acral bullous dyshidrosiform rash associated with acute human herpes virus-6 infection in a 2-year-old girl [^111xKHri]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This case underscores the importance of considering viral etiologies, such as HHV-6, when making a differential diagnosis of vesiculobullous eruptions in children. Atypical viral presentations can resemble primary immunobullous or eczematous disorders, making accurate virologic investigation crucial for proper diagnosis and management. This observation contributes to the growing body of evidence indicating that HHV-6 and HHV-7 may be associated with a wider range of cutaneous manifestations, including those in immunocompetent pediatric patients. Recognizing these patterns may facilitate timely diagnosis and appropriate, conservative treatment.

### Histopathological study of a broad spectrum of skin dermatoses in patients affected or highly suspected of infection by COVID-19 in the Northern part of Italy: analysis of the many faces of the viral-induced skin diseases in previous and new reported cases [^1118GdZQ]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, we can assert that SARS-CoV-2 can provoke a systemic coagulopathy with a yet unclear pathogenetic mechanism. As for the cytopathic capacity of the virus on epithelial cells, we have only clues warning us. Our case history should induce clinical dermatologists to suspect, in this tragic period, the possibility of COVID-19 infection if they encounter patients with fever and cough who show urticarial skin lesions, chilblains, targetoid lesions (erythema multiforme–like lesions), exanthema, maculohemorrhagic rash, or chickenpox-like lesions.

### Atypical clinical features of a human herpesvirus-6 infection in a neonate [^113TFdPQ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

A case of neonatal human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) B infection is presented. Although HHV-6 B was isolated from peripheral blood at the onset of the illness, a significant increase in viral antibody titers was not observed. The patient had a slight fever with generalized maculopapular skin rash and an increased number of atypical lymphocytes, which is quite different from the typical clinical features of exanthem subitum.

### Acute pruritic eruption [^115rqsu6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
A. Allergic contact dermatitis
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection
D. Coxsackie A infection
E. Herpes zoster infection

Answers:
A. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. This is less likely considering the patient's clinical history, rapid progression of her rash, and presence of scattered vesicles. In addition, she denied exposure to new personal care products.
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection – Incorrect. While HSV-1 is a consideration for vesicular eruptions, it tends to be more localized and presents more classically as herpes labialis or herpes gingivostomatitis rather than a generalized eruption.
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection – Correct. The clinical history and acute onset are most consistent with an infection. Despite the absence of overt viral cytopathic changes (multinucleation, nuclear margination, chromatin molding) on pathology, follicular necrosis was noted – a feature of herpes virus infection. Thus, the clinical picture was most consistent with pVZV infection. A swab of an unroofed vesicle for viral polymerase chain reaction and VZV stain on pathology confirmed this diagnosis.
D. Coxsackie A infection – Incorrect. While hand, foot, mouth disease can present with a similar eruption, this patient exhibited no oral, hand, foot, buttock, or scalp lesions, making this differential diagnosis less likely. Further, the exanthem of hand, foot, mouth disease is not pruritic.
E. Herpes zoster infection – Incorrect. While herpes zoster is a reactivation of the latent VZV, this typically presents with a dermatomal, unilateral vesicular eruption associated with pain, including sensations of burning and tingling.

### Viral infections of the folds (intertriginous areas) [^115oVnvy]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Viruses are considered intracellular obligates with a nucleic acid, either RNA or DNA. They have the ability to encode proteins involved in viral replication and production of the protective coat within the host cells but require host cell ribosomes and mitochondria for translation. The members of the families Herpesviridae, Poxviridae, Papovaviridae, and Picornaviridae are the most commonly known agents for the cutaneous viral diseases, but other virus families, such as Adenoviridae, Togaviridae, Parvoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Hepadnaviridae, can also infect the skin. Though the cutaneous manifestations of viral infections are closely related to the type and the transmission route of the virus, viral skin diseases may occur in almost any part of the body. In addition to friction caused by skin-to-skin touch, skin folds are warm and moist areas of the skin that have limited air circulation. These features provide a fertile breeding ground for many kinds of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. In contrast to specific bacterial and fungal agents that have an affinity for the skin folds, except for viral diseases of the anogenital area, which have well-known presentations, viral skin infections that have a special affinity to the skin folds are not known. Many viral exanthems may affect the skin folds during the course of the infection, but here we focus only on the ones that usually affect the fold areas and also on the less well-known conditions or recently described associations.

### The rash with maculopapules and fever in children [^116eCghd]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Several medical conditions can cause children to present with fever and a maculopapular rash Although some presentations are benign, others may be medical emergencies, which warrant a prompt diagnosis. We review some of the more common causes of fever and maculopapular dermatitirs, rash including infectious processes (roseola; rubeola; rubella; parvovirus B19; hand, foot, and mouth disease; scarlet fever; meningococcemia; Epstein-Barr virus infection), hypersensitivity reactions (exanthematous drug reactions), and vasculitis syndromes (Kawasaki disease). We have included a diagnostic algorithm to facilitate rapid identification of the etiology of the rash and fever. Those conditions that can occur in children but are seen predominantly in adults are discussed in the contribution "Rash with maculopapules and fever in adults" in this issue.

### Superimposed lateralized exanthem of childhood: report of a case related to adenovirus infection [^114Ww1qn]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

A 6-year-old boy developed a unilateral itchy rash, which was followed by a less severe bilateral involvement. The lesions resolved spontaneously within 4 weeks. Apparently, the rash was triggered by an adenovirus infection of the respiratory tract. Terms used currently for this disorder include 'unilateral laterothoracic exanthem' or 'asymmetrical periflexural exanthem of childhood'. The recently proposed term 'superimposed lateralized exanthem of childhood' implies the new concept that an early postzygotic mutation has rendered the skin on one side of the body more reactive to infective agents. The subsequent bilateral involvement would reflect a less severe reactivity of the contralateral keratinocytes.

### Viral exanthems: an update on laboratory testing of the adult patient [^115nZrHV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Although classic viral exanthems of childhood are well described, they are rarely differentiated in adults. Laboratory techniques for viral identification have advanced without substantial literature to suggest how a dermatologist ought to conduct a cost-effective and diagnostic viral panel. Certain clinical features such as petechiae, vesicles, and dusky macular or morbilliform exanthems point strongly toward a viral exanthem. Differentiation of drug and viral causes of morbilliform eruptions has proven difficult. It is possible that with further diagnostic refinement that unnecessary and fruitless workups of an exanthem and unneeded discontinuation of drugs can be avoided. We review viral exanthems based on clinical features and discuss the available and optimal laboratory techniques to assist the dermatologist in a targeted workup.

### Urticarial exanthem as early diagnostic clue for COVID-19 infection [^113qnrfB]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 61-year-old Spanish physician came to the emergency department with a 4-day history of a progressive cutaneous rash. He had been treating patients with coronavirus infection for 3 weeks. On presentation, his temperature was 37.3°C. He did not complain of respiratory symptoms (such as cough or dyspnea), headache, malaise, sore throat, or nasal congestion. The patient also denied receiving any drugs during the last 2 months.

Physical examination showed an urticarial rash consisting of confluent, edematous, and erythematous papules on his thighs, arms, and forearms (Fig 1, A and B). Palms and soles were spared. Cutaneous lesions were mildly itchy. COVID-19 infection was suspected because of the current epidemiologic situation. A nasopharyngeal sample was obtained and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Other common viral infections such as parvovirus B19, rubella, measles, Epstein-Barr, human herpes virus 6, and enterovirus that might cause fever and rash were ruled out by laboratory investigation. A chest radiograph did not reveal lung abnormalities. Because the patient had no risk factors, in accordance with Spanish guidelines he did not receive any specific treatment for the infection. He remained afebrile during the next week. Cutaneous rash resolved in 7 days. The patient received only oral antihistamine because of mild pruritus.

### Pityriasis rosea: diagnosis and treatment [^1158uASm]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common self-limiting rash that usually starts with a herald patch on the trunk and progresses along the Langer lines to a generalized rash over the trunk and limbs. The diagnosis is based on clinical and physical examination findings. The herald patch is an erythematous lesion with an elevated border and depressed center. The generalized rash usually presents two weeks after the herald patch. Patients can develop general malaise, fatigue, nausea, headaches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and sore throat before or during the course of the rash. The differential diagnosis includes secondary syphilis, seborrheic dermatitis, nummular eczema, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, tinea corporis, viral exanthems, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea-like eruption associated with certain medications. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and consists of corticosteroids or antihistamines. In some cases, acyclovir can be used to treat symptoms and reduce the length of disease. Ultraviolet phototherapy can also be considered for severe cases. Pityriasis rosea during pregnancy has been linked to spontaneous abortions.

### An old virus with atypical presentation-tomato flu? [^116rXd2r]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Disease transmission and symptoms

The first evidence showed that TF, as the HFMD, is a very contagious disease transmitted by close contact making under-five children a particular group at risk. Infants can be infected mainly through nappies or if they touch unclean surfaces or put infected objects directly into the mouth.

The main symptoms of TF are described as high fever, intense arthralgias with sometimes joint swelling, and a rash localized in the mouth (tongue, gums, inside of the cheek), palms, and soles. Doctors now report some atypical localization of the lesions; they can also be found on the buttocks or even the shedding of nails. The lesions are described as red, painful, growing blisters.

Additional symptoms like many viral infections include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, fatigue, body aches, and influenza-like symptoms. The symptoms may have different presentations or intensity from one child to another, as illustrated by the two cases diagnosed in the United Kingdom a week after returning from a trip to Kerala. The two siblings, a five-year-old boy and a 13-month-old girl presented a vesicular rash without fever or other systemic symptoms. The girl's rash was more florid, and she gave two days after painful oral lesions while his brother was in a healing process. After six days, the boy's lesion completely healed without scarring, while his sister had to wait until 16 days for the same result. The Enterovirus PCR was positive for both children, and the EV typing by sequencing showed Coxsackie A-16, another finding in favor of the likeliness of the tomato flu as an atypical presentation of the HFMD.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^115CkZd1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis of Atypical Pityriasis Rosea

In cases of atypical PR, particularly when systemic symptoms are present or when the herald patch is absent and the exanthem is widespread, it is essential to consider other infectious exanthems in the differential diagnosis. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Parvovirus B19 are two potential infectious agents that can present with exanthems similar to PR.

EBV, a herpesvirus, can cause a variety of dermatological manifestations, including morbilliform, papulovesicular, and petechial eruptions during systemic infection. In some cases, EBV can lead to a florid morbilliform eruption or other atypical exanthems, which may resemble PR. EBV-associated exanthems may also be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and fatigue, which can overlap with the prodromal symptoms of PR. A thorough clinical history, including serological testing for EBV (e.g. positive viral capsid antigen IgM in acute infection), can help differentiate EBV-related exanthems from PR in patients presenting with systemic signs.

Similarly, Parvovirus B19 should be considered in patients with an atypical PR-like presentation and systemic involvement. Parvovirus B19 is known to cause erythema infectiosum, which can mimic PR with its characteristic facial rash ('slapped cheek' appearance) and systemic symptoms, such as fever and arthralgia. In some cases, Parvovirus B19 infection can present with a widespread, nonspecific exanthem that can be confused with PR.

Given the overlapping clinical features between PR and these viral exanthems, particularly in the setting of systemic symptoms, serological testing for EBV and Parvovirus B19 may be considered to exclude these infectious causes. This is particularly important in cases where the herald patch is absent or the rash is more generalized and atypical in distribution.

### Update on hand-foot-and-mouth disease [^112x8piF]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a viral exanthem caused, primarily by Coxsackie A16 and enterovirus 71 with typical clinical features of fever, painful papules and blisters over the extremities and genitalia and an enanthem involving ulceration of the mouth, palate, and pharynx. Other enteroviruses have recently been noted to cause severe neurologic illness and paralysis (enterovirus 68) with variable cutaneous features. A recent outbreak of Coxsackie A6 infection has been seen worldwide with cases reported in the United States, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Europe. These cases have caused extensive cutaneous disease variants, some of which are not previously recognized in Coxsackie infection, namely vesicobullous and erosive eruptions, extensive cutaneous involvement, periorificial lesions, localization in areas of atopic dermatitis or in children with atopic dermatitis (the so-called eczema coxsackium), Gianotti-Crosti-like lesions, petechial/purpuric eruptions, delayed onychomadesis, and palmoplantar desquamation. Finally, adult cases appear to occur with this form of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, likely due to fecal-oral transmission in a household setting.

### Immunological aspects of COVID-19-related skin manifestations: revisiting pathogenic mechanism in the light of new evidence [^113w43G4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), induced by a novel strain of the coronavirus family, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a rapidly spreading global threat. This virus affects a fair number of tissues in the human body by availing itself of potential target receptors like Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Presenting with diverse clinical manifestations, COVID-19 has raised the urge for extensive research in different medical fields, including dermatology. Developing a comprehensive knowledge of cutaneous manifestations is highly important as it can help us in early diagnosis and better management of the ongoing pandemic. The dermatological presentations of COVID-19 are classified into main categories of vascular and non-vascular (exanthematous) patterns. Though not yet fully confirmed, the pathogenesis of these cutaneous presentations has been suggested to be more related to the overactivation of the immune system. In this review, we discuss in detail the clinical features of the diverse skin lesions in COVID-19 patients and the imperative role of the immune system in their pathogenesis and development. Furthermore, we will discuss the reasons behind the accentuation of skin lesions in COVID-19 compared to the same virus family predecessors.

### Pityriasis rosea and other infectious eruptions during pregnancy: possible life-threatening health conditions for the fetus [^1168oMvo]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Any infectious illness presenting with an eruption in a pregnant patient may be associated with an increased risk of fetal loss. The viruses that can infect the placenta during maternal infection and can be transmitted to the fetus and cause congenital disease include the rubella virus, the measles virus, the varicella zoster virus, parvovirus B19, human cytomegalovirus, arboviruses, and hepatitis E virus type 1. In addition, some bacteria responsible for exanthematous diseases, like Treponema pallidum, can be transmitted during pregnancy from the mother to the fetus and cause fetal loss. All these infectious agents can cause typical and/or atypical exanthems whose etiologic diagnosis is sometimes difficult but important to determine, especially in pregnant women because of the potential risk to the fetus. In the last 20 years, we have extensively studied pityriasis rosea from the clinical and laboratory perspectives, demonstrating the pathogenic role of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and -7. We synthesize the available evidence that PR may be associated with active HHV-6/7 infection and therefore with complications during pregnancy and fetal loss. We have also summarized the emerging infectious illnesses of dermatologic interest that may represent life-threatening health conditions for the fetus: measles, rubella, arbovirus infection, and syphilis.

### Fever and skin rash… [^114Mpf9r]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

The answer is C: roseola infantum. This viral exanthem of childhood is characterized by three days of high fever that can exceed 104°F, which may lead to febrile seizures. The fever or seizures are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department but rarely necessitate admission. After several days, the fever abruptly subsides, and the characteristic rash appears. 1 Roseola infantum is most prevalent in children seven to 13 months of age, and most cases occur in children younger than two years. Overall, the most common cause of roseola is human herpes-virus 6B. Less common causes include human herpesvirus 7, enterovirus, coxsackievirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Roseola infantum has a seasonal distribution, occurring most often in late summer to early fall. It affects males and females equally. The most common mode of transmission is shedding of the virus from asymptomatic carriers, such as older siblings or parents.

Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is caused by human parvovirus B19. The illness begins with fever, coryza, headache, nausea, and diarrhea followed by a rash two to five days later. The classic slapped cheek rash is erythematous with circumoral pallor, with a lacelike rash developing on the trunk and extremities several days later. The rash may recur after stimuli such as change in temperature, sunlight exposure, stress, or exercise. 2 Measles begins with fever, malaise, and anorexia followed by conjunctivitis, coryza, and cough. Characteristic Koplik spots appear 48 hours before the exanthem. Streptococcus bacteria. The rash is diffuse and blanchable, with numerous 1- to 2-mm papules causing a sandpaper-like texture. The rash usually starts on the groin and armpits and quickly spreads to the rest of the trunk and the extremities, sparing the palms and soles, before it desquamates.

It often has a linear petechial appearance in the antecubital fossae and axillary folds, known as Pastia lines. 6 Other physical findings may include strawberry tongue and circumoral pallor.

### Mpox infection presenting with morbilliform rash: a case series [^113yKSXq]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Classic morbilliform rashes often occur in the setting of a new drug exposure or as a viral exanthem. Morbilliform drug–induced exanthem is the most common drug hypersensitivity reaction, characterized by a disseminated, symmetric eruption of erythematous macules and/or papules that occur approximately 1 to 2 weeks after initiating treatment with the causative drug or, in previously sensitized individuals, as early as 6 to 12 hours and up to 3 days after initiating treatment with the causative drug. The most common eliciting drugs include penicillins, cephalosporins, and agents with sulfhydryl groups. These drugs act as haptens, bind to endogenous proteins, and then become antigens.

Morbilliform viral exanthem in the setting of mpox infection is not a well-known occurrence, although morbilliform eruptions have also been reported as prodromal eruptions in smallpox, a related orthopoxvirus. To our knowledge, the first case report published in Spain by de Nicolas-Ruanes et alin June 2022 described a case of mpox virus with maculopapular exanthem and proctitis. In addition, Català et alpublished a prospective cross-sectional study of 185 patients with cutaneous mpox findings. In this study, 6% of their population experienced morbilliform rashes during the disease process. Tarín-Vicente et aldescribed an observational prospective cohort study that found mpox infection to be the culprit of genital, perianal, and oral lesions. Notably, Tarín-Vicente et alreported that 4% of the cohort experienced maculopapular exanthem, of whom 3% were ruled as having a morbilliform drug eruption. Only 1 patient in the cohort was reported to have a viral exanthem.

### Different patterns of skin manifestations associated with parvovirus B19 primary infection in adults [^113WJTuC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Skin involvement is reported during primary parvovirus B19 infection in adults.

Objectives

We sought to describe the cutaneous presentations associated with parvovirus B19 primary infection in adults.

Methods

We conducted a descriptive, retrospective, multicenter study. The patients included (> 18 years old) had well-established primary infections with parvovirus B19.

Results

Twenty-nine patients were identified between 1992 and 2013 (17 women, 12 men). The elementary dermatologic lesions were mostly erythematous (86%) and often purpuric (69%). Pruritus was reported in 48% of cases. The rash predominated on the legs (93%), trunk (55%), and arms (45%), with a lower frequency of facial involvement (20%). Four different but sometimes overlapping patterns were identified (45%): exanthema, which was reticulated and annular in some cases (80%); the gloves-and-socks pattern (24%); the periflexural pattern (28%); and palpable purpura (24%).

Limitations

The limitations of this study were its retrospective design and possible recruitment bias in tertiary care centers.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that primary parvovirus B19 infection is associated with polymorphous skin manifestations with 4 predominant, sometimes overlapping, patterns. The acral or periflexural distribution of the rash and the presence of purpuric or annular/reticulate lesions are highly suggestive of parvovirus B19 infection.

### Viral exanthems in the tropics [^113EFxWD]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Viral exanthems are a common problem in tropical regions, particularly affecting children. Most exanthems are transient and harmless, but some are potentially very dangerous. Pregnant women and malnourished or immunocompromised infants carry the greatest risk of adverse outcome. In this article, parvovirus B19; dengue and yellow fever; West Nile, Barmah Forest, Marburg, and Ebola viruses, and human herpesviruses; asymmetric periflexural exanthema of childhood; measles; rubella; enteroviruses; Lassa fever; and South American hemorrhagic fevers will be discussed.

### Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in children (and adults): a virus that does not discriminate [^1167nVrQ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a beta coronavirus with a characteristic S-glycoprotein spike on the cell surface. Initial reports did not include cutaneous manifestations as a feature of COVID-19; however, there is a growing repertoire of reports demonstrating an array of dermatologic manifestations on the skin in children and adults. Dermatologic afflictions have been summarized into different categories several times, with the most recent analysis identifying six clinical patterns: urticaria, maculopapular-morbilliform eruption, papulovesicular exanthem, chilblain-like acral pattern, livedo reticularis-livedo racemosa pattern, and purpuric vasculitic pattern. In children, the dermatologic features appear to occur before or concomitantly with other COVID-19 manifestations. Dermatologists play a key role in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 who may present for the first time unwittingly exhibiting early signs of COVID-19. We have reviewed the current evidence on the dermatologic impact of COVID-19 in both the adult and pediatric populations.

### Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis sine pustules: a case series [^116zQuCq]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AGEP "sine" (without) pustules has not been previously described. Rather than a distinct disorder, these findings support a subtle clinical variant or an early manifestation of AGEP. Prompt resolution without significant sequelae following drug cessation was observed in all 8 of these patients, and distinction from morbilliform drug eruption is challenging without histopathology. Therefore, it is possible that this variant of AGEP is underdiagnosed. Given that AGEP has the potential to produce life-threatening complications, awareness of this presentation is important in order to prevent misdiagnosis as morbilliform drug eruption, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, or viral exanthem.

The onset of AGEP is typically more rapid than that observed in morbilliform drug eruption or DRESS. Morbilliform drug eruptions and DRESS usually appear 1 to 2 weeks and 2 to 8 weeks after initiation of the culprit drug, respectively. Nevertheless, histopathologic evaluation may be helpful for patients with morbilliform-like exanthems and unclear medication history in order to exclude AGEP without pustules.

### Asymmetrical periflexural exanthem exhibiting pseudoisomorphic Köebner response in an adult [^115eJGC4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Asymmetrical periflexural exanthem is a rare clinical condition, seen almost exclusively in children. Very few adult cases have been reported in the literature. We report a case of this rare eruption in an adult man showing characteristic clinical and histological features. Interestingly, this patient also exhibited a pseudoisomorphic Köebner response. Although an infective aetiology of viral origin has been suggested for this localized eruption, the aetiology remains unknown. We are of the opinion that the pseudoisomorphic Köebner response in this patient may support the inoculation hypothesis in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

### Viral exanthems and enanthems… [^114Nz7Px]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Time Was when measles, rubella, scarlet fever, and the "fourth disease" were the infections to he considered when dealing with puzzling rashes. Events in the past generation have changed the problem considerably and complicated it to an extraordinary degree. This is due largely to the discovery in the late 1940's and early 1950's of several whole new families of viruses, including the Coxsackie, echo-, and adenoviruses. In the subsequent two decades the pathogenic potential and diverse clinical associations of these agents, which number close to 100, have gradually emerged. One of the most striking features has been an uncovering of an etiologic relationship to the so-called "summer exanthems. " l, 2 This content is only available via PDF.

### "Eczema coxsackium" and unusual cutaneous findings in an enterovirus outbreak [^112c7joG]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the atypical cutaneous presentations in the coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6)-associated North American enterovirus outbreak of 2011–2012.

Methods

We performed a retrospective case series of pediatric patients who presented with atypical cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) from July 2011 to June 2012 at 7 academic pediatric dermatology centers. Patients were included if they tested positive for CVA6 or if they met clinical criteria for atypical HFMD (an enanthem or exanthem characteristic of HFMD with unusual morphology or extent of cutaneous findings). We collected demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data including history of skin conditions, morphology and extent of exanthem, systemic symptoms, and diagnostic test results.

Results

Eighty patients were included in this study (median age 1.5 years, range 4 months-16 years). Seventeen patients were CVA6-positive, and 63 met clinical inclusion criteria. Ninety-nine percent of patients exhibited a vesiculobullous and erosive eruption; 61% of patients had rash involving > 10% body surface area. The exanthem had a perioral, extremity, and truncal distribution in addition to involving classic HFMD areas such as palms, soles, and buttocks. In 55% of patients, the eruption was accentuated in areas of eczematous dermatitis, termed "eczema coxsackium". Other morphologies included Gianotti-Crosti-like (37%), petechial/purpuric (17%) eruptions, and delayed onychomadesis and palm and sole desquamation. There were no patients with serious systemic complications.

Conclusions

The CVA6-associated enterovirus outbreak was responsible for an exanthem potentially more widespread, severe, and varied than classic HFMD that could be confused with bullous impetigo, eczema herpeticum, vasculitis, and primary immunobullous disease.

### The emerging zika virus threat: a guide for dermatologists [^115YvPfK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

We provide a guide for dermatologists to follow if they encounter patients with a rash and clinical history suspicious of Zika virus infection, including diagnostic testing and management options. We also provide an illustrative case report of a patient from Brazil who was diagnosed with Zika virus infection after presenting with a generalized pruritic rash. One of the most prominent symptoms of Zika virus infection is a cutaneous eruption. As such, it is especially necessary for dermatologists to understand this virus so that they may appropriately recognize this entity as a diagnostic consideration in the clinic. The rash associated with Zika virus infection is most commonly an erythematous maculopapular eruption that presents after an initial 3–4 days of fever, headache, and arthralgia or myalgia. The rash typically lasts for an average of 6 days, and can spread to involve any part of the body, including the face, torso, extremities, palms, and soles.

### Disseminated herpes simplex virus type 2 infection manifesting as cutaneous vasculitis: a case report [^114TySAC]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Classic skin biopsy findings for HSV infection include balloon degeneration, acantholysis, and viral cytopathic changes, including multinucleated giant cells, chromatin molding, and margination. Although it is not uncommon to find leukocytoclastic vasculitis in herpes virus infection on histopathologic examination, there is limited clinical documentation of disseminated cutaneous vasculitis. Several pathogenetic mechanisms have been postulated to explain how herpes viruses induce vasculitis, mainly reported for cases of varicella-zoster virus infection. These include hematogenous spread of viral infection destroying small cutaneous vessels, and direct invasion of the virus to dermal vessels from vesicles or from adjacent nerves. Given the extensive involvement in our patient, vasculitis secondary to viremia is the most reasonable mechanism to explain her presentation.

Cutaneous HSV infection typically presents as grouped vesicles on erythematous bases that may subsequently develop into erosions or herpetic ulcers. One of the common presentations of disseminated cutaneous HSV infection, regarded as eczema herpeticum, could be seen in patients with a preexisting skin disease that had resulted in an impaired functional barrier. Rare manifestations, including maculopapular eruption without the presence of vesicles or pustules and diffuse, ulcerative rash, have been reported, which should be differentiated from other causes, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute HIV exanthem.

In the reported patient, palpable purpura was distributed over her chest, back, buttocks, and extremities. The erosions and ulcers at the intergluteal folds were considered to be the primary site of recurrent HSV infections, while the virus later disseminated and presented as vasculitis at other sites. As the skin biopsy from the right knee, far from and distinct from the typical primary HSV infection site, revealed concurrent HSV infection and vasculitis pathologically, HSV-induced cutaneous vasculitis should be considered. This causative relationship could be further substantiated by the dramatic improvement of all skin lesions after administration of antiviral treatment and discontinuation of most immunosuppressants. To our knowledge, there is only 1 other report of both clinically and pathologically proven concomitant herpes simplex infection and disseminated vasculitis. Several reports of dermatomal herpes zoster infection associated with concurrent or subsequent localized vasculitis have also been documented. However, HSV infection presenting with generalized vasculitis is rare. Our case provides an unusual presentation of disseminated HSV infection as cutaneous vasculitis in an immunocompromised patient, highlighting the necessity to consider HSV infection as a differential diagnosis when encountering widespread cutaneous vasculitis.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^116c4nVw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Presence of the Herald Patch in PR Variants

The presence of a herald patch is a key feature of classic PR, but it may be absent in atypical variants of the condition. In inverted PR, where the lesions predominantly involve the flexural areas, a herald patch may be less easily identified or entirely absent. Similarly, in localized PR, the exanthem may be confined to one area, and a distinguishable herald patch may not be present. Persistent PR and relapsing PR also tend to have more varied presentations, with a herald patch being less commonly reported.

In pediatric PR and PR associated with COVID-19, the presence of a herald patch is variable. Studies have suggested that in COVID-19-related PR-like eruptions, the exanthem may present without a classic herald patch, mimicking the morphology of viral exanthems. Identifying the herald patch can be crucial for diagnosis, but its absence should not rule out PR, particularly in atypical or variant forms, where the clinical course and morphology of lesions may differ.

### SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, skin and immunology-what do we know so far? [^113hH1pG]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Virus‐induced vesicular eruptions

Virus‐induced vesicular eruptions are quite common for herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus‐induced skin lesions in which the vesicles are caused by intraepidermal blister and epithelial necrosis. Either reticular degeneration of the epidermis or ballooning of keratinocytes might cause intraepidermal vesicle formation,(Table 2). Another example for virus‐induced vesicular eruptions is caused by Coxsackie A16 virus, an enterovirus, which is responsible for Hand‐foot‐and‐mouth diseases. Intraepidermal vesicles with reticular degeneration and ballooned cells are characteristic features. Papillary edema and mild perivascular infiltrates might be detectable as well. In all of these virus‐induced skin eruptions, viral antigens are detectable in various cutaneous structures using different methods such as antibody staining, electron microscopy, or others.

Whether vesicular eruptions observed in part of the COVID‐19 patients are caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, needs to be evaluated in further studies.

Some reports of erythemato‐violaceous papules and patches with a pseudo‐vesicle in the center, resembling erythema multiforme and an enanthem of the oral cavity in some of those patients during or after improvement of COVID‐19 symptoms, exist. If those lesions are related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or drugs applied in this context, then both remain to be elucidated in further studies.

Virus‐induced urticarial rashes

Urticaria and acute urticarial rashes go along with up to 50% of all cases with infections of the upper respiratory tractand are most often mediated by complement activation and serum sickness induced by viral antigens or secondary mechanisms, due to the interaction of the immune system with viral antigens. This could be also the case in part of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients with urticarial eruptions (Figure 7).

### Pityriasis rosea [^111qaFtR]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common, acute exanthem of uncertain etiology. Viral and bacterial causes have been sought, but convincing answers have not yet been found. Pityriasis rosea typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by an initial herald patch, followed by the development of a diffuse papulosquamous rash. The herald patch often is misdiagnosed as eczema. Pityriasis rosea is difficult to identify until the appearance of characteristic smaller secondary lesions that follow Langer's lines (cleavage lines). Several medications can cause a rash similar to pityriasis rosea, and several diseases, including secondary syphilis, are included in the differential diagnosis. One small controlled trial reported faster clearing of the exanthem with the use of erythromycin, but the mechanism of effect is unknown. Resolution of the rash may be hastened by ultraviolet light therapy but not without the risk of hyperpigmentation. Topical or systemic steroids and antihistamines often are used to relieve itching.

### Atypical mucocutaneous manifestations of MPOX: a systematic review [^113Kedsn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

7 OTHER ATYPICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Between 6% and 13.7% of patients with MPOX present with a confluent maculopapular rash on the trunk and proximal extremities concurrent with the primary MPOX lesions(Figure 5), but up to 17% of patients do not present with the typical pseudopustules, which complicates the diagnosis. About half of affected patients present with MPOX pharyngitis and some with associated Forchheimer spots. Pruritus may or may not be present. The rash usually appears 3 to 11 days after the onset of the disease, although cases have been reported in which it occurs simultaneously. A viral cause has been postulated, but drug or concurrent infections have been proposed in some patients. The failure to detect these contributing factors in many cases gives strength to the theory of MPOX as the causative agent. Histology of these lesions shows a superficial lymphocytic infiltrate, consistent with a maculopapular exanthem of viral or drug‐induced origin.

FIGURE 5
(a) Maculopapular rash in a patient with MPOX with neck and shoulder involvement. (b) Morbilliform rash in another patient in the right axilla.

A patient with hemorrhagic purpuric lesions in the inguinal region, who also had multiple perianal vesiculopustules and significant inguinal lymphadenopathy, has been reported (Figure 6). The authors propose that this phenomenon could be indirectly caused by the virus after negative results for viral RNA in the biopsy. A case of reactive panniculitis secondary to MPOX with a lupus panniculitis–like histology has recently been reported in a patient with recent MPOX infection.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing a rapidly expanding pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website describes fever, cough, and shortness of breath as the primary symptoms of the disease, but it does not describe cutaneous manifestations of the illness. Understanding how COVID-19 might present on the skin may help practitioners and patients recognize and manage the disease more effectively.

### Atypical exanthems: morphology and laboratory investigations may lead to an aetiological diagnosis in about 70% of cases [^111BVYhG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Besides the six classical exanthems, other exanthems may occur, differing in morphology and causative agent (atypical exanthems). Their aetiological diagnosis is difficult but crucial for both the patient and community concerning issues such as time off school, immunizations, and risks for pregnant women and immunocompromised patients.

Objectives

To investigate whether morphology, associated symptoms and laboratory results can help to determine the aetiology of atypical exanthems.

Methods

We studied 112 consecutive out-patients attending two university dermatology departments. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and throat, rectal and vaginal swabs were studied to identify viral and bacterial growth. Nested polymerase chain reaction was performed on PBMC and plasma using specific primers for herpesviruses. Serology for common viruses was investigated.

Results

We classified the exanthems into seven morphological patterns: macular erythema (32 patients), papular erythema (eight), maculopapular erythema (42), maculopapular erythema with petechiae (seven), erythema with vesiculation (11), erythema with pustules (five) and urticaria (seven). On the basis of morphology, in concert with the associated symptoms and laboratory results, we found a causal relationship in 76 patients (68%): 25 cases due to drugs, 32 to viruses, 16 to bacteria and three to parasites. A good correspondence between morphology and aetiology was found. The erythematous-vesicular pattern was exclusive to viral infections and was often accompanied by enanthema. The erythemato-pustular and papular patterns were found only in drug-related cases and in some undiagnosed cases. In contrast, the macular and maculopapular patterns were almost evenly distributed among the various aetiologies, although their colour was duskier in the drug-related exanthems. Severe pruritus was associated with drug-related exanthems.

Conclusions

This is the largest series of consecutive patients with atypical exanthems reported. Their morphology and their association with pruritus or constitutional symptoms proved to be important diagnostic clues.

### Etiological and predictive factors of pediatric urticaria in an emergency context [^1114q1bc]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urticaria is common in pediatric population and is one of the most common dermatologic conditions presenting at the emergency departments. The prevalence of urticaria in children ranged from 15.3 to 22.5%. Even though the majority of patients with urticaria are usually benign, however, this problem can cause parental concern especially with the first episodic attack. Urticaria and angioedema can be an early sign of anaphylaxis which need an immediate treatment. The diagnosis of urticaria can be made by its typical presentation of acute edematous, wheal and flare appearance, sometimes also with angioedema. It has its fleeting nature (may be absent by the time patients are actually seen). The lesions are usually itchy. The diagnosis can be challenging in some circumstances conditions which can mimic urticaria (e.g. viral exanthem, morbilliform drug eruption, insect bites, contact dermatitis, etc.). The acute episodic form is the most prevalent in the pediatric population, and it is often a recurrent phenomenon. Urticaria and angioedema are caused by various etiologies which usually differ among different age groups. These included; infections (virus, bacteria, fungus, and parasite), allergic reactions to foods and drugs, or physical stimuli. In many instances it is not possible to identify a specific cause (idiopathic urticaria). The different etiologies require different management strategies. A recent publication has found etiologies related to medications or infections, a history of allergies, and the co-occurrence of pyrexia or urticaria were predictors of angioedema. Thus, understanding the details of the etiologies of urticaria in children would help pediatricians to perform appropriate further treatment. This led to the objective of the present study to explore the etiology of urticaria in children in the emergency department and find out the predictive factors associated with different etiologies of pediatric urticaria that may help pediatricians in managing urticaria in an emergency setting.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of exanthems among Japanese children younger than 6 years old in the post-measles-rubella vaccine era [^1156hxUv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Exanthems are a common reason for visits to the pediatric emergency department. However, epidemiological data in the post-measles-rubella vaccine era is limited.

Objective

We sought to determine the recent causes of exanthems in children younger than 6 years old in the pediatric emergency department.

Methods

A prospective single-center study was conducted in Japan from August 2019 to March 2020. Children younger than 6 years old with exanthems were enrolled. Exanthems were classified into 7 morphological patterns. Varicella, herpes zoster, impetigo, urticaria and Kawasaki disease were diagnosed clinically. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients with nonspecific exanthems and evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays capable of detecting 24 pathogens. The final diagnosis was made by discussion of 3 physicians based on clinical course and microbiology.

Results

There were 9705 pediatric visits, of which 296 (3%) had exanthems and were younger than 6 years old. Clinical diagnosis was possible for 160 (54%), including urticaria in 110 (37%), Kawasaki disease in 29 (10%), impetigo in 10 (3%), varicella or herpes zoster in 7 (2%) and group A Streptococcus in 4 (1%). Among the remaining 136 (46%) children, 75 (25%) underwent testing by PCR. One or more pathogens were detected in 49 (65%), specifically enterovirus in 14 (19%), cytomegalovirus in 13 (17%), human herpesvirus type-6 in 12 (16%), adenovirus in 11 (15%) and human herpesvirus type-7 in 8 (11%). Final infectious disease diagnoses were roseola infantum in 11 (15%), enterovirus in 9 (12%), adenovirus in 6 (8%), mixed virus infection in 5 (7%), group A Streptococcus in 3 (4%), parechovirus-A in 3 (4%) and influenza in 3 (4%).

Conclusions

The most common causes of pediatric exanthems were noninfectious diseases and viral exanthema. PCR assay was instrumental for etiological diagnosis of nonspecific exanthems.

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease first described in Wuhan, China, which has quickly emerged as a global pandemic with a myriad of manifestations including dermatologic (Li My et al., n.d.; Gottlieb and Long, 2020 [1,2]). A variety of cutaneous symptoms have presented throughout various stages of the disease (Marzano, 2020; Recalcati, n.d.; Henry et al., n.d.; Fernandez-Nieto et al., n.d.; Quintana-Castanedo et al., n.d. [3–5,7,8]). We describe a case of a female patient who presented with an Erythema Nodosum-like exanthema likely secondary to COVID-19. The patient described tested positive for COVID-19 three days prior to presentation for the rash with minimal other symptoms of COVID-19. Given the high infectivity rate as well as multisystem presentation, it is important to continue to report on novel presentations of the virus for early identification and treatment of complications.

### Livedo reticularis as a presenting sign of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^115YqxPy]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important for clinicians to be aware of dermatologic manifestations, including exanthems, with SARS-CoV-2 infections. As the pandemic continues and rapid identification of disease remains important, the observation of COVID-19–associated skin rashes such as COVID-19 LR may serve as an early sign of developing disease. The association between COVID-19 LR and disease severity remains to be determined. To better treat patients who have COVID-19 LR, we recommend documenting coagulopathic parameters, viral load versus time, and progression of clinical findings.

### Morbilliform eruptions: differentiating low-risk drug eruptions, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, viral eruptions, and acute graft-versus-host disease [^111q2N25]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of developing a morbilliform eruption is related to both patient and exogenous factors. Individuals at a higher risk for developing a morbilliform drug eruption include those with (1) an increased number of medical comorbidities, (2) multiple medications initiated during a hospitalization, and (3) exposure to chemotherapy. Specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have also been associated with increased risk for SCARs. With regard to medication factors, there are several classes associated with higher rates of hypersensitivity, including antimicrobials (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones), antiepileptics (lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin), antiretrovirals, and allopurinol.

Unlike many inflammatory dermatoses and morphologic classifications, the skin biopsy tends to have limited value in morbilliform eruptions, particularly when the clinical differential diagnosis includes a drug eruption, GVHD, and/or a viral exanthem, all of which are characterized by vacuolar interface change, dyskeratosis, and dermal infiltrate that may include eosinophils. Some studies have suggested that some histologic differences exist between morbilliform drug eruptions and other morbilliform eruptions. The differentiation depends on the degree of changes such as greater lymphocyte exocytosis and dermal infiltrate (which are more highly associated with drug eruptions than viral exanthems) rather than the complete presence or absence of these findings. These findings are difficult to categorize, and a blinded study of two expert dermatopathologists found that skin biopsies only had a 62.9% sensitivity and 41.1% specificity for drug-induced exanthems, and no statistically significant association with specific histopathologic findings. This study concluded that biopsy was only beneficial in patients with AGEP, where pustules were consistently detected between the two dermatopathologists.

While unlikely to differentiate the early diagnosis among entities characterized by vacuolar interface change, a skin biopsy can be helpful to exclude mimickers of morbilliform eruptions, such as nutritional-deficiency-associated eruptions, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, eczematous dermatitis, and erythrodermic psoriasis. It will differentiate late stages of SJS/TEN and aGVHD both by having full-thickness epidermal necrosis and interface dermatitis. Similarly, a direct immunofluorescence test can be used to differentiate SJS/TEN from Linear IgA bullous dermatosis, both of which could occur in a patient treated with multiple antibiotics. As in all conditions, histopathology should be interpreted in tandem with appropriate clinical context, with special attention to morphology to support the diagnosis.

### Add in a virus: four cases of severe Kawasaki disease and concurrent adenovirus infection [^1149DTvM]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an idiopathic systemic vasculitis. KD typically presents in children between the ages of six months and five years as an acute illness characterized by fever, conjunctivitis, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, peri-oral erythema, and extremity swelling. These features often follow a brief prodrome of respiratory or gastrointestinal illness and may not all be present at the same point in time.

Recent population-based time series analyses have demonstrated a correlation between seasonal viral infections and KD incidence. One third of children with KD have a concurrent acute infection, and approximately 41% of KD patients have a respiratory virus detected on nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.

The differential diagnosis in a child with KD is broad, as KD shares common features with many childhood infectious conditions, such as streptococcal infections and viral exanthems (e.g. measles, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus), rheumatic disorders (e.g. systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and drug reactions (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Distinguishing between acute infections and KD early in the illness course is often challenging, particularly when concurrent infection is present. Diagnostic confusion between KD and acute infections contributes to delays in instituting early immunomodulatory management, which may contribute to higher complication rates.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111APzz1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Summary Statement 61 — urticaria-like dermatoses can occur at various stages of pregnancy (C) (Table VI), with gestational pemphigoid presenting with abrupt onset of pruritic papular urticarial annularity on the trunk (especially about the umbilicus) that becomes generalized and blistering then occurs; up to 10% of newborns of affected mothers can present with an eruption, ELISA to BP180NC16A has 90% sensitivity and similar specificity, initial treatment includes topical glucocorticoids (class III to class I) with ointments providing the best results, and for pemphigoid refractory to topical corticosteroids an initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d prednisone that is then tapered slowly is beneficial with flares at delivery and recurrences with menstruation and oral contraceptives (in 25% of women). Prurigo of pregnancy is characterized by extremely pruritic papules and nodules predominantly on the extensor surfaces, the papules can last for weeks to months after delivery, histopathology is nonspecific with negative immunofluorescence, and treatment is mostly supportive with topical corticosteroids. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy can begin within the abdominal striae (sparing the umbilicus) during the third trimester in primigravid women, the involvement spares the face, hands, and soles and can recur with subsequent pregnancies with a higher prevalence of multiple-gestation pregnancy, and within the differential urticaria, prurigo of pregnancy, gestational pemphigoid, viral exanthems, and contact dermatitis can be considered.

### Mpox infection presenting with morbilliform rash: a case series [^116bc6BQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

In our case series, we report 4 patients with morbilliform rashes occurring at or around the time of umbilicated papule formation, not associated with the prodromal phase (Table I). Limitations of our observation include the concomitant diagnoses made at the time of mpox diagnosis. However, we do not believe that the morbilliform rashes present are consistent with those typically seen in secondary syphilis because secondary syphilis involves a papulosquamous eruption on the trunk with a predilection for acral areas.

Table I
Patient characteristics and diagnostic information

The rapid development of the rash at the time of mpox symptom onset is also suggestive of a unifying viral-mediated process.

We have described 4 cases of morbilliform rash that are likely related to acute mpox infection. In our patients, the morbilliform rash appeared to occur concomitantly or soon after development of the classic mpox lesions and not as part of the prodrome. All patients had a morbilliform rash presentation with truncal predominance, extremity involvement, and no facial involvement. Patient 4 was the exception whose presentation included striking groin and proximal thigh involvement.

Awareness of this presentation is extremely important so that providers maintain a high index of suspicion for mpox when patients present with a morbilliform exanthem during the current epidemic. The high rate of coinfection with other sexually transmitted infections underscores the importance of broad testing when patients present with symptoms of mpox.

### Cutaneous drug reactions in the pediatric population [^116aad29]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) constitute a major pediatric health problem frequently encountered in clinical practice, and represent a diagnostic challenge. Children are more susceptible than adults to errors in drug dosage because of their smaller body size; moreover, ADRs can mimic other skin diseases of children, especially viral exanthems. Most ADRs with cutaneous involvement are mild and resolve on withdrawal of the causative drug. The most common forms of cutaneous ADRs, maculopapular exanthems and urticarial reactions, have excellent outcomes. Less frequent but more severe reactions may incur a risk of mortality.

### Pityriasis rosea and herpesviruses: facts and controversies [^115XGHmY]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is an acute exanthem with many clinical and epidemiologic features of an infectious disease. To date, human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and HHV-7 appear to be the most indicted culprits, and the evidence in favor of this hypothesis and the controversial results produced elsewhere are discussed. The complex pathophysiology of HHV-6 and HHV-7 infection, their diffusion in the population at large, the difficulties of understanding whether the infection is still latent or is clinically manifest, and well as whether pityriasis rosea depends on a reinfection or on a viral reactivation, all make the issue extremely difficult to study and understand.

### Fever and rash [^1176aEnF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Morbilliform eruptions: differentiating low-risk drug eruptions, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, viral eruptions, and acute graft-versus-host disease [^111Du6G4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

HSCT patients are also uniquely at risk for other morbilliform eruptions that occur in the post-transplant setting, including engraftment syndrome, eruption of lymphocyte recovery, viral exanthems, and drug eruptions. As with aGVHD, engraftment syndrome may present with non-infectious fever, morbilliform eruption, diarrhea, and hepatic dysfunction; however, engraftment syndrome can be differentiated by its timing, frequent pulmonary involvement, and often self-limited nature. This eruption tends to occur several days prior to engraftment, measured as when the absolute neutrophil count is over 500 cells/uL for 3 consecutive days, typically 1–3 weeks post-transplant. Eruption of lymphocyte recovery is a similar entity with onset heralding the detection of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, which falls under a similar 1–3 week timeframe post-transplant. Unlike aGVHD, eruption of lymphocyte recovery is characterized by isolated fevers and morbilliform eruption without systemic organ involvement and is self-limited, resolving over several days with desquamation and mild residual hyperpigmentation.

If patients are within the 100-day window since HSCT, patients with overlapping features of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and GVHD most likely have forms of aGVHD with either organ involvement (DRESS/DiHS-like presentations) and/or grade 4 aGVHD (SJS/TEN-like).

### Severe atypical hand-foot-and-mouth disease in adults due to coxsackievirus A6: clinical presentation and phylogenesis of CV-A6 strains [^114ry7Do]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Typically, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a mild childhood illness associated with coxsackievirus (CV)-A16, CV-A6, enterovirus (EV)-A71.

Objectives

To identify the viral agents associated with severe cases of atypical HFMD in Italy.

Study Design

Epidemiologically unrelated cases of severe atypical HFMD admitted to the Emergency Room (ER) of IRCCS San Martino IST (Genoa, Italy) in 2014–2016 were investigated. Serologic screening for viral positivity was performed against exanthem-inducing agents. Ten cases with serology indicative of recent EV infection were selected. Molecular assays were used to detect viral genomes in blood [EVs, Parvovirus B19 (PVB19), herpesviruses (CMV; EBV, HHV-6, -7, -8)].

Results

CV-A6 was detected in 10 cases of severe atypical HFMD. Two cases were also infected with PVB19. Herpesviruses were not detected. Phylogenetic analysis mapped the CV-A6 strains into a single cluster related to two recent isolates from a German and an Asian child. Fever, systemic symptoms, severe vasculitis-like rash, and enanthem were predominant at presentation. Spontaneous recovery occurred in 1–3 weeks.

Conclusions

CV-A6 is emerging as a frequent cause of severe atypical HFMD in Italian adults. This viral agent is disseminating worldwide. Dermatologists must identify the manifold alterations caused by EVs and understand the diagnostic power of current virology methods.

### Atypical exanthems associated with parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection in children and adults [^114Un7jB]. Journal of Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection may differently manifest in various age groups. Erythema infectiosum ('fifth disease') is the most common B19V manifestations in children. Arthralgias and arthritis, with or without rash, are common manifestations of B19V infection in adults. Pruritus is usually present in adults and children. However, other cutaneous manifestations and atypical exanthems have been occasionally reported during B19V infection. To investigate the putative role of B19V infection in atypical exanthems, a total of 390 consecutive patients with atypical exanthems were analysed for B19V infection by determining B19V IgG and IgM antibodies titres in acute and convalescent phase as well as B19V DNA detection in serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Atypical exanthems resulted related to B19V infection in 6 of the 120 pediatric (5%) and 14 of the 270 adult patients (5.2%). In conclusion this study reveals that atypical exanthems related to B19V infection are possible both in children and in adults, with a similar prevalence.

### The challenge of diagnosing atypical exanthems: a clinico-laboratory study [^116jiLNq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although atypical exanthems pose a severe diagnostic challenge, they have not been studied widely.

Objective

To identify the clinical features, laboratory parameters and other characteristics that help establish the etiology of atypical exanthems.

Methods

We collected the following information from 260 consecutive patients with atypical exanthems, including 108 children and 152 adults: demographic data, exanthem and enanthem morphology, clinical symptoms, month of outbreak and total duration. Throat, rectal, and vesicle swabs as well as urine and skin samples were examined for bacterial and viral signs. Serologic studies were performed for the most common infectious agents.

Results

Seven morphological patterns were identified: macular erythema, papular erythema, macular-papular erythema, erythematovesicular, macular-papular erythema with petechiae, erythema with pustules, and urticarial. Ninety-four cases were due to viruses, 38 to bacteria, 65 to drugs, 3 to parasites, and one to viruses-plus-drugs. Nineteen of the 25 cases with a petechial pattern had an infectious etiology (12 viral and 7 bacterial) and only 4 were iatrogenic. Sixty-one of 69 patients with enanthems were infectious (57 viral and 4 bacterial), 6 were iatrogenic, and 2 remained undiagnosed. The petechial pattern was infectious in 80% of cases (14 viral and 2 bacterial). Four cases were iatrogenic. During the spring and summer, 60% of exanthems were infectious and 21% were iatrogenic. Picornavirus infections exhibited summer prevalence (57%), peaking in July.

Limitations

There were a variable number of patients with each of the morphological patterns.

Conclusions

Morphological patterns, seasonal occurrence, and enanthem are key for etiological diagnosis of atypical exanthems.

### SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, skin and immunology-what do we know so far? [^115VRgK2]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on the largest collection of skin lesions from patients from Spain, lesions have been recently categorized into five main groupssummarized in Figure 4A‐E.
Vesicular eruptions, predate in about 15% COVID‐19 symptoms or occur with symptoms, last 10‐12 days and go along with COVID‐19 with intermediate severity, patients affected are middle aged, and lesions are accompanied by moderate itch (Figure 4A).
Maculopapular exanthema manifests together with COVID‐19 symptoms, often in more severe cases with a mortality rate up to 2%, lasts 7‐9 days, and is in over 50% of the cases accompanied by itch (Figure 4B).
Urticarial eruptions occur at the same time as other symptoms in more severe COVID‐19 cases are accompanied by itching and last 6‐8 days (Figure 4C).
Livedo or necrosis and other vasculitis forms tend to occur in older and more severe cases, with relatively high mortality (up to 10%), and the onset was together with COVID‐19 symptoms (Figure 4D).
Chilblain was observed in younger patients with mild or even asymptomatic courses or negative SARS‐CoV‐2 testing, the onset is late, duration 12‐14 days and in one third are the lesions accompanied by pain and itch,(Figure 4E).

FIGURE 4
A: Typical skin lesions (vesicular eruptions occurring early during COVID‐19 (A), with symptoms of COVID‐19, that is, maculopapular exanthema (B), urticarial rash (C), vasculitis (D), and later during COVID‐19 disease Chilblain eruptions (E). The bar on top indicates the onset of skin symptoms in relation to COVID‐19 symptoms, as well as average age and severity of COVID‐19 patients, and typical predilection sites of the lesions are also depicted

Since it is quite difficult to verify, in which context the skin lesions occur in terms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections, we would like to summarize in the next few sections current knowledge about the pathophysiologic background of virus‐induced and drug‐induced lesions of the skin and the vascular system.

Differential diagnosis

As with many other febrile rashes, the diagnosis of TF is not straightforward because of the similarity of its main symptoms with other diseases. When considering the exanthem, the most common differential diagnoses are HFMD, Monkeypox, and Varicella. The intense generalized pain and Flu-like symptoms brought to eliminate Dengue, also Dengue present with fever initially but rash appears in the late stage of disease, Chikungunya, Zika, or COVID-19, as shown in Table 1.

### Deadly viral syndrome mimics [^115vBN8Q]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections (ie, "the common cold") have several hundred causes, the most common of which include rhino-virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The clinical presentation varies with symptoms. Every emergency department, no matter what the demographics, cares for patients with this constellation of symptoms. Emergency physicians examine, diagnose, and treat these disorders frequently. With increasing burdens being placed on emergency physicians, it is possible to assume a diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection without generating a complete differential diagnosis. The challenge is to identify and recognize the distinctions between an innocuous upper respiratory tract infection and a life-threatening disease "mimic" or entities. This article discusses some of these life-threatening mimics.

### Erythema multiforme [^115UAroo]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Erythema multiforme is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, though it can also be "idiopathic". The characteristic skin lesions are typical or atypical acral raised target lesions. The oral mucosa can be affected, alone or in combination with other mucosal/cutaneous sites, sometimes causing extreme pain, severely impacting food intake, and warranting hospitalization. A comprehensive understanding of erythema multiforme clinical characteristics, triggering agents, and differential diagnosis including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, is crucial to conduct proper workup and management. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be immediately ruled out because of the need of antibiotics. The cornerstone of management is symptomatic treatment and will be detailed in this review as well as the etiologic treatment. Lastly, the management of persistent or recurrent erythema multiforme can be challenging, especially when antivirals fail to prevent a relapse, but breakthrough treatments have been reported successful in this difficult-to-treat subset of patients.

### Human herpesvirus 6 [^112H5da9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The development of techniques for the culture of lymphoid cells and the isolation of viruses that infect these cells led to the discovery of human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 in 1986. At the time, HHV-6 was the first new human herpesvirus to be discovered in roughly a quarter of a century, and its isolation marked the beginning of an era of discovery in herpesvirology, with the identification of HHV-7 and HHV-8 (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) during the following decade. Like most human herpesviruses, HHV-6 is ubiquitous and capable of establishing a lifelong, latent infection of its host. HHV-6 is particularly efficient at infecting infants and young children, and primary infection with the virus is associated with roseola infantum (exanthem subitum) and, most commonly, an undifferentiated febrile illness. Viral reactivation in the immunocompromised host has been linked to a variety of diseases, including encephalitis, and HHV-6 has been tentatively associated with multiple sclerosis. This article discusses the major properties of HHV-6, its association with human disease, and the pathobiological significance of viral reactivation.

### Visual diagnosis: 12-month-old boy with persistent rash and lymphadenopathy [^113ExTqQ]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) is a self-limiting, papular or papulovesicular, symmetric, acral exanthem that typically presents subsequent to viral infection, bacterial infection, or immunization in a child 1 to 4 years old. The rash can persist for 2 to 10 weeks. Recent infection with Epstein-Barr virus is the most common serologic finding in patients who have developed GCS. The diagnosis is often made after the child has been unsuccessfully treated for a more common cause of an acral rash (eg, scabies). There are no pathognomonic laboratory or histopathologic findings. GCS, therefore, is still a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. The rash is self-limited, and treatment is usually not necessary. However, topical corticosteroids are anecdotally reported to reduce duration of rash. Oral antihistamines can be used to treat pruritus. Parents should be assured that resolution is almost always complete, scarring seldom occurs, and recurrence is rare.

### Morbilliform eruptions: differentiating low-risk drug eruptions, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, viral eruptions, and acute graft-versus-host disease [^114HdsfZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Viral exanthems typically involve similar locations to high-risk drug eruptions, including involvement of the hands, feet, face, and buttocks. Features, including brighter erythema and less pruritus, are typically associated with viral eruptions but can be difficult to quantify. The primary differentiator of viral and drug eruptions is typically location, with acral, facial, and gluteal involvement all associated with viral eruptions. Seasonality should also be considered; viral eruptions more commonly occur in the spring and summer. Finally, systemic symptoms such as conjunctivitis, cough, headache, irritability, and vomiting are more frequently seen in viral eruptions, but can precede the rash by weeks.

Once a high-risk identification has been made and after evaluating for potential SCARs, evaluation of viral causes should be considered. Additional workup should be tailored on the basis of clinical suspicion. For instance, a respiratory panel should be ordered if upper respiratory tract infection symptoms are present. Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis warrant specific testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Arthralgias should prompt workup for parvovirus B19 and, in patients with the appropriate travel history, Dengue virus, Zika virus, and Chikungunya virus. Acral and oral involvement should raise suspicion for enterovirus, coxsackievirus, and echovirus. Finally, those who are underimmunized or unimmunized should be tested for measles and rubella viruses. Viral testing is of particular importance if the virus in question, such as HIV, affects patient outcomes. Other laboratory values, such as skin or serum cytokines, are not clinically useful to differentiate viral from other causes of drug eruptions at this time. Because the histopathology of viral eruptions can be nonspecific, skin biopsy is unlikely to be beneficial.

### Gianotti-crosti syndrome: a challenging exanthema [^114uJvXe]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (GCS) is a self-limited condition, mainly affecting children younger than 6 years, less common in adolescents and adults. It consists of a viral exanthema with papular lesions with a flat top and symmetrical distribution, affecting predominantly extremities, gluteal region and extensor surfaces. It is often associated with viral infections but can also be related to bacterial infections, vaccination or be idiopathic. In this report, we present a case of GCS in a 13-year-old healthy female adolescent who presented with fever, odynophagia, prostration and diffuse maculopapular rash. The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis due to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus was established. On the second week of the disease, a clinical recrudescence occurred, with worsening of the fever and modification of the exanthema characteristics. GCS is often an underdiagnosed entity. The differential diagnosis of viral exanthema can prove to be challenging and clinical suspicion is essential to achieve the diagnosis.

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): P369

Introduction: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology that primarily affects children under five years of age. Exanthema is reported in 50%–90% of cases, typically within the first five days of illness, presenting as a diffuse, nonspecific erythematous maculopapular rash, often described as morbilliform, scarlatiniform, or urticarial. Less commonly, pustular or erythema multiforme-like eruptions have been described, usually during the convalescent phase. The occurrence of psoriasiform dermatitis during the active phase of KD is exceptional and may pose diagnostic challenges.

Objectives: To describe a rare case of psoriasiform dermatitis during the active phase of KD, and to highlight the importance of differential diagnosis and multidisciplinary management in the setting of persistent systemic inflammation.

Methods: We present the case of a 3-month-old male infant who developed a classical form of KD, including persistent fever, maculopapular rash, cheilitis, conjunctival injection, swelling of the hands and feet, and elevated inflammatory markers. Initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids led to temporary resolution of symptoms.

Results: On day 8 of illness, fever recurred, and by day 10 a new cutaneous eruption emerged, prompting a second IVIG infusion and escalation to anakinra due to persistent inflammation. The new rash consisted of crusted erythematous papules predominantly on the limbs, with perioral and perineal involvement. Additional features included erosive cheilitis and crusted blepharitis. These findings were atypical for classical KD and raised suspicion of viral or bacterial co-infection, alternative vasculitis, or a drug-related eruption. Herpes simplex virus co-infection was clinically suspected, leading to empirical initiation of intravenous acyclovir and temporary discontinuation of anakinra. Concurrently, coronary artery aneurysms developed, indicating ongoing systemic inflammation. Virologic testing (PCR on blood and skin) was negative. A skin biopsy revealed a psoriasiform dermatitis without cytopathic changes, ruling out viral etiology. After multidisciplinary review, the eruption was interpreted as KD-related psoriasiform dermatitis. Anakinra and corticosteroids were then reintroduced, with progressive improvement in systemic, cardiac, and cutaneous manifestations.

### Eruptive hypomelanosis: a novel exanthem associated with viral symptoms in children [^113Vt36J]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recognition of different clinical presentations of viral and virally triggered ("paraviral") exanthems is necessary for patients to be appropriately diagnosed and counseled.

Observations

Nine children presented with eruptions of hypopigmented macules following coryzal symptoms. Other diagnostic considerations, such as pityriasis alba, pityriasis versicolor, and progressive macular hypomelanosis, were excluded. This novel clinical presentation, eruptive hypomelanosis, may represent a paraviral exanthem with a prodromal coryzal phase, sudden eruption of fairly monomorphic lesions, and predictable time course with spontaneous resolution.

Conclusions and Relevance

Eruptive hypomelanosis is a novel viral exanthem. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the etiology of this condition and its relationship to other exanthemas and eruptions such as pityriasis rosea.

### Morbilliform exanthem associated with COVID-19 [^1162F6gL]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case suggests that COVID-19 is capable of stimulating a standard-appearing viral exanthem either by itself or in a patient sensitized by receiving azithromycin or benzonatate in the same way an Epstein-Barr virus infection may cause a cutaneous eruption by itself or in a patient sensitized by taking amoxicillin. Understanding how COVID-19 may present on the skin may help practitioners and patients recognize and manage the illness better.

### Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19: an evidence-based review [^112DKRgP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected 18 million people and killed over 690,000 patients. Although this virus primarily causes respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of cutaneous manifestations associated with this disease have been reported.

Objective

The aim of this review was to collate and categorize the dermatologic findings reported in patients with COVID-19 and identify specific lesions that may facilitate diagnosis and prognostication.

Methods

An evidence-based review of the PubMed database was conducted on 14 May, 2020 using the search terms "Covid-19 skin", "Covid-19 rash", "Covid-19 exanthem", and "Covid-19 chilblains". Peer-reviewed publications containing original COVID-19 patient cases and a discussion of the associated cutaneous findings were included in the analysis.

Results

The literature search identified 115 records, of which 34 publications describing 996 patients with dermatologic conditions were included. Case reports (n = 15), case series (n = 13), and observational prospective studies (n = 4) were the most common publication types. Acral lesions resembling pseudo-chilblains were the most frequent lesion identified (40.4% of cases), appearing in young adults (mean age, 23.2 years) after the onset of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (55/100 patients). Erythematous maculopapular rashes affected 21.3% of patients, most frequently impacting middle-aged adults (mean age, 53.2 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (110/187 patients). Vesicular rashes affected 13.0% of patients, appearing in middle-aged adults (mean age, 48.3 years) after the onset of other symptoms (52/84 patients). Urticarial rashes affected 10.9% of patients, appearing in adults (mean age, 38.3 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (46/78 patients). Vascular rashes resembling livedo or purpura were uncommon (4% of cases), appearing in elderly patients (mean age, 77.5 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (18/29 patients). Erythema multiforme-like eruptions, although infrequent (3.7% of cases), affected mostly children (mean age, 12.2 years).

Conclusions

Vesicular rashes may suggest an initial diagnosis of COVID-19, acral lesions may be most appropriate for epidemiological uses, and vascular rashes may be a useful prognostic marker for severe disease. As a potential correlate to disease severity, prognosis, or infectibility, it is critical that all healthcare professionals be well versed in these increasingly common cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.

### Chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6: questions and answers [^113zvApt]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

What is human herpesvirus 6?

Human herpesvirus 6 is the collective name for HHV-6A and HHV-6B, which are two closely related herpesviruses that have a combined seroprevalence of > 90% in adults. HHV-6B is typically transmitted via saliva and primary infection usually occurs between 6 months and 2–3 years of age. Many primary HHV-6B infections are not associated with any specific clinical features, although the virus causes roseola infantum (exanthema subitum or sixth disease) in ~30% of children, presenting with high-grade fever followed by a characteristic rash that is sometimes accompanied by benign febrile convulsions, and rarely by status epilepticus. Little is known about primary HHV-6A infection and its disease associations. For the 99% of the population without ciHHV-6, most become infected with the virus in the first 2 years of life, with the virus establishing latency in a small fraction of mononuclear cells.

Disease associated with HHV-6A and HHV-6B reactivations can occur in immunocompromised hosts, and rarely in immunocompetent individuals. HHV-6B reactivation often occurs in immunocompetent individuals during drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) and the related drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Symptoms and conditions that have been firmly associated with HHV-6B in immunocompromised patients include exanthematous rash, fever, seizures 2005, encephalopathy 2009, limbic encephalitis 2007 and amnesia, cognitive dysfunction 2011, lymphadenopathy 2004, colitis, and hepatitis. Less well established, and in some cases controversial associations have been reported for Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) 2010, renal failure, hemophagocytic syndrome, myocarditis, pneumonitis, hypogammaglobulinemia 2004, and arteriopathies. HHV-6A reactivation has been found in subsets of patients with multiple sclerosis, HIV infection, encephalitis 2007, and syncytial giant-cell hepatitis 2008 (reviewed in). The vast majority of low-level HHV-6 reactivations in immunocompromised patients are asymptomatic.

### Skin manifestations in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^116ddtCN]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a well established respiratory tract illness. Recent studies in adults and children have shown an increasing number of patients reporting polymorphic cutaneous manifestations during COVID-19, including different types of rashes, from maculopapular, vascular, vesicular to atypical forms.

Recent Findings

Although pathogenesis of skin manifestations is still not fully understood, it has been proposed that cutaneous involvement during COVID-19 may be the results of the activation of the immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the reactivation or co-infection of herpesviruses or drug hypersensitivity.

Summary

According to available literature, skin manifestations in patients with COVID-19 may be categorized on the basis of their clinical presentations as follows: erythematous rashes, lesions of vascular origin, vesicular rash, urticarial rash and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme and other polymorphic erythema/atypical reactions. Prompt recognition of these cutaneous manifestations represents a crucial point to facilitate diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.

### Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem and primary Epstein-Barr virus infection: case report [^113N9CkX]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem is a self-limited disease that occurs most commonly in children. It is characterized by unilateral exanthem, often in axillary region. The etiology is unknown, but a viral agent is suspected. We report a 1-year-old white girl with unilateral laterothoracic exanthem associated with Epstein Barr virus infection, suggesting this virus has a possible etiologic role.

### The rash with maculopapules and fever in adults [^115o3d1u]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a broad differential diagnosis for the presentation of fever and maculopapular rash in an adult. Although some causative conditions are benign, others are medical emergencies that require prompt diagnosis. We describe various conditions that result in a fever and maculopapular rash in adults. These include infectious processes (meningococcemia, infectious mononucleosis, West Nile virus, zika virus, rubella, primary human immunodeficiency virus, parvovirus B19, ebolavirus), tick-borne illnesses (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis), and hypersensitivity reactions (exanthematous drug reactions). We also provide an algorithm to aid in the diagnosis of the patient with fever and maculopapular rash. Such conditions that can occur in adults but are seen predominantly in children are discussed in the article "Rash with maculopapules and fever in children" of this issue.

### Morbilliform exanthem associated with COVID-19 [^117NMcFV]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 58-year-old Hispanic man presented on March 23, 2020, for a widespread dermatitis that arose on March 21. Affected areas were pruritic, expanding, and worsening in severity at presentation. He had called his primary care physician on March 20 to report a new cough and pain in his legs and hands. The physician did not see the patient but called in a prescription for azithromycin and benzonatate, and the patient started taking these medications the same day. Azithromycin was prescribed at 500 mg for the first day and 250 mg for the next 4 days. Benzonatate was prescribed at 100 mg every 6 hours as needed for cough. The patient reported never before experiencing a similar cutaneous eruption.

When the patient arrived in the dermatology clinic, his cough had resolved, but pain in his hands and lower extremities remained. He never had a fever at home or in the office. Physical examination demonstrated a well-appearing man with a Fitzpatrick IV skin type. There were erythematous macules with islands of normal-appearing skin between them, arranged in a morbilliform pattern, on the legs, thighs, forearms, arms, shoulders, back, chest, and abdomen. These primary lesions aggregated into confluent erythematous patches larger than 10 cm in diameter on the back, abdomen, and chest. The face, hands, and feet were spared, and perniolike lesions on the fingers and toes were not observed. The patient reported no intraoral symptoms, and an intraoral examination was not performed.

The differential diagnosis for the dermatitis included viral exanthem, drug eruption caused by azithromycin, and hypersensitivity reaction to azithromycin because of a concurrent viral infection. The patient recalled that on February 14, 2020, he received azithromycin and benzonatate at the same prescribed doses to completion, without adverse effects, and his pharmacist confirmed the report, making drug eruption caused by azithromycin less likely in the differential diagnosis.

Triamcinalone 0.1% cream was prescribed to suppress the dermatitis, and COVID-19 testing was performed by swabbing the nasopharynx and oropharynx and submitting the swab to LabCorp (Raritan, NJ) in standard viral transport medium. The patient's test result was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) according to LabCorp's qualitative test using polymerase chain reaction technology.

### Contagious exanthematous diseases… [^1139k7tW]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points Several viral infections such as measles and varicella, as well as infections with bacteria such as streptococci and meningococci, cause skin rashes. Diagnosis is clinical based on prodrome, characteristics of rash, accompanying signs and symptoms, and immunization and contact history. Among viral infections rubeola and varicella typically require intervention with antiviral treatment and monitoring for systemic involvement and secondary bacterial complications. Bacterial infections do need appropriate antibacterial therapy.

### T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma / leukemia presenting as a diffuse viral exanthem-like reaction: a clinical and histopathological challenge [^1154brZr]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous involvement by leukemia, or leukemia cutis, is a rare manifestation of leukemic disorders, most frequently occurring in children. The skin findings, which usually include multiple violaceous or erythematous nodules on the face, most often follow the classic presenting signs and symptoms of leukemia and occur in patients with an established primary diagnosis. Patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and associated leukemia cutis typically present with a solitary firm red to bluish nodule, often with an accompanying mediastinal mass, that can produce respiratory symptoms. In this article, we report a case of a patient with primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma presenting with a diffuse exanthem mimicking a viral illness with an associated SET-NUP214 translocation.

### Eruptive hypomelanosis… [^116ymEFR]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Nine children presented with eruptions of hypopigmented macules following coryzal symptoms. Other diagnostic considerations, such as pityriasis alba, pityriasis versicolor, and progressive macular hypomelanosis, were excluded. This novel clinical presentation, eruptive hypomelanosis, may represent a paraviral exanthem with a prodromal coryzal phase, sudden eruption of fairly monomorphic lesions, and predictable time course with spontaneous resolution. Conclusions and Relevance Eruptive hypomelanosis is a novel viral exanthem. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the etiology of this condition and its relationship to other exanthemas and eruptions such as pityriasis rosea. Introduction. Several skin eruptions — Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, pityriasis rosea, asymmetric periflexural exanthem, eruptive pseudoangiomatosis, papular-purpuric-gloves-and-socks-syndrome — are suspected to be caused by viruses because of a.

predictable course of clinical events with a prodromal phase, primary lesions with or without secondary lesions in single or successive eruptions, and spontaneous resolution; epidemiological characteristics; and histopathological and virological findings. 1 Differing clinical presentations of viral exanthems and virally triggered eruptions need to be recognized in order to appropriately evaluate, diagnose, and counsel patients. 1–4Although no specific treatment for many viral exanthems is known, recognition of exanthems allows clinicians to differentiate such from other treatable cutaneous diseases. Eruptive hypomelanosis is likely to be a primary viral exanthem in its own right, like PR. The possibility of postinflammatory hypopigmentation as one of the underlying causes should be investigated further.

Considering that the anatomical clinical distribution of the hypomelanotic eruptions in patients 2 and 6 mimic the paraviral exanthems GCS and PR, respectively, it seems that EH is a paraviral exanthem similar to GCS and PR.

### Viral exanthems in children: a great imitator [^1167AeVs]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Viral exanthems are frequent in children and are mostly self-limited. Early recognition and differentiation from other childhood illnesses are important to direct further investigations and treatment initiation. The clinical presentation of viral exanthems in children includes a polymorphic spectrum of skin eruptions ranging from classic viral exanthems to "atypical" presentations that can mimic nonviral diseases; thus, viral exanthems of childhood can be readily diagnosed on clinical grounds, but not rarely do they represent a diagnostic challenge. In this review, we focus on viral diseases in children that may be difficult to diagnose due to their clinical similarities with nonviral diseases, and we offer clues for the differential diagnosis and proper diagnostic testing in such cases.
