## Question

Smoker lung infection abx treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic treatment of lung infections in smokers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how smoking alters host defenses and microbiology to frame risk and expected pathogens. Then, I should classify the lung infection syndromes that commonly present in smokers and map them to evidence-based antibiotic decisions. Next, I will examine special considerations for smokers, including COPD, bronchiectasis, and Pseudomonas risk. After that, I should integrate antimicrobial stewardship principles and duration guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight smoking cessation as a core therapeutic intervention, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation: smoking impairs mucociliary clearance, alveolar macrophage function, and both innate and adaptive immunity, while also promoting dysbiosis and microbial virulence, which collectively increase susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia and shape the lung microbiome in ways that can complicate antibiotic responses and resistance dynamics [^113cCjrk] [^114hEN89] [^114o7uqo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should categorize the clinical syndromes that typically present in smokers, because treatment hinges on syndrome identification: community-acquired pneumonia, acute bronchitis, acute COPD exacerbation, bronchiectasis exacerbation, and hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, each with distinct diagnostic criteria and antibiotic indications [^117J4ouG] [^112hi12x] [^114C293u] [^112vexmK] [^114KScDn].

> For community-acquired pneumonia, I need to check severity and site-of-care first, then choose empiric therapy aligned with ATS/IDSA guidance; for nonsevere inpatient disease without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk, a beta-lactam plus macrolide such as ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is recommended, with a minimum of 5 days total therapy once clinical stability is achieved, and I should remember that smokers are at higher risk of complications and treatment failure, which justifies vigilance for deterioration and early reassessment [^112hi12x] [^11422hz5] [^117J4ouG] [^115GGfNj].

> Wait, let me verify outpatient CAP management; in otherwise healthy adults without comorbidities, amoxicillin or doxycycline are acceptable options, and macrolides are reasonable only if local pneumococcal resistance is low, whereas in smokers with comorbidities I should broaden to amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if beta-lactam allergy or intolerance is present, always anchoring duration to clinical stability and a minimum of 5 days [^112hi12x] [^11422hz5].

> I should double-check the role of macrolide monotherapy; although older data suggested benefit, contemporary evidence and stewardship perspectives caution against routine macrolide monotherapy in many settings due to resistance and limited incremental benefit, so combination therapy or nonmacrolide options are often preferred when appropriate [^112hi12x].

> For acute bronchitis, I need to ensure I do not over-treat; routine antibiotics are not recommended because most cases are viral, and while a Cochrane review shows modest symptom reductions with antibiotics, the clinical significance is limited and outweighed by adverse effects and resistance, so supportive care and patient education are the mainstays in smokers and nonsmokers alike [^113ptkgp] [^115ZLpNh].

> For acute COPD exacerbations, let me consider bacterial triggers; antibiotics are indicated when there is increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence, with guideline-concordant short courses of 5 days favored, and amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone are reasonable empiric choices in smokers who may harbor more resistant organisms; I should also remember that macrolide prophylaxis can reduce future exacerbations but is less effective in current smokers and carries resistance and QT risk, so I must individualize long-term macrolide decisions [^112z16dX] [^1159Zckd] [^114C293u] [^115rzPgH] [^115nJfxj].

> But wait, what if the smoker has bronchiectasis; in that case, long-term macrolides reduce exacerbation frequency and inhaled antibiotics are recommended for patients with chronic Pseudomonas or high exacerbation burden despite standard care, so I should screen for bronchiectasis in recurrent exacerbators and tailor antibiotic strategies accordingly [^116vQdkC] [^114AU6us] [^112vexmK].

> I will now examine Pseudomonas risk; smokers with structural lung disease or severe COPD are at higher risk for Pseudomonas, and in outpatients with pre-existing lung disease and recent Pseudomonas isolation, dual systemic anti-pseudomonal therapy reduced exacerbations and improved clinical cure in a randomized trial, which supports targeted therapy when cultures or clinical context suggest this pathogen [^1125eK2x] [^114KScDn].

> Next, I should review antimicrobial stewardship principles; smokers often receive antibiotics more frequently than nonsmokers even when not indicated, so I need to confirm diagnoses rigorously, use the narrowest effective spectrum, align duration with guideline minimums, and de-escalate based on cultures whenever possible to mitigate resistance and adverse events [^111b3KoZ] [^11422hz5] [^115ZzQTE].

> Let me think about duration and step-down; for most CAP and COPD exacerbations, 5 days is sufficient once clinically stable, with earlier switch to oral therapy when feasible, whereas MRSA or Pseudomonas pneumonia generally warrant 7 days, and I should verify stability criteria before stopping therapy to avoid premature discontinuation [^1159Zckd] [^11422hz5] [^112hi12x].

> I should confirm special scenarios; in smokers with severe CAP or ICU admission, combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a beta-lactam plus fluoroquinolone is recommended, and I must consider atypicals and aspiration risk, while in nonresponding pneumonia after 48–72 hours I need to reassess for resistant or atypical pathogens, complications like empyema, or noninfectious mimics and adjust therapy accordingly [^112hi12x] [^113heVKw].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of smoking cessation; smoking cessation is a core therapeutic intervention that reduces future infection risk, improves treatment response, and should be offered at every encounter using evidence-based pharmacotherapy and counseling, given its broad impact on respiratory and systemic outcomes [^1139agBC] [^113cCjrk] [^117Vy1UY].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying; first, distinguish syndrome and severity; second, rule out pneumonia with vitals, exam, and chest radiography when indicated; third, if CAP is confirmed, risk-stratify and select guideline-concordant empiric therapy with attention to comorbidities and local resistance; fourth, if acute bronchitis, avoid antibiotics and provide supportive care; fifth, if COPD exacerbation, use antibiotics only when bacterial features are present and limit to 5 days; sixth, if bronchiectasis or recurrent exacerbations, consider long-term macrolides or inhaled antibiotics per guidelines; seventh, embed smoking cessation and vaccination into the plan; eighth, reassess at 48–72 hours to ensure clinical response and de-escalate or broaden as needed [^112hi12x] [^113ptkgp] [^1159Zckd] [^114C293u].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaway is explicit; smokers with lung infections require the same evidence-based antibiotic principles as nonsmokers, but their higher risk of severe disease, treatment failure, and resistant pathogens justifies careful syndrome classification, guideline-concordant empiric therapy, vigilant reassessment, and aggressive risk-factor modification, especially smoking cessation, to optimize outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship [^117J4ouG] [^115GGfNj] [^112hi12x] [^113cCjrk].

For smokers with lung infections, **empiric antibiotics should cover typical CAP pathogens** (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) and atypicals (Legionella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia) [^112hi12x]. Use **amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) for outpatients; add a macrolide or doxycycline if atypical coverage is needed [^115eTVAH]. For inpatients, use a beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam) plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^117J4ouG]; add anti-pseudomonal coverage if risk factors are present [^112KyGo7]. Treat for 5–7 days, extending to 10–14 days for severe disease or complications [^11422hz5]. Emphasize **smoking cessation** and monitor for adverse effects, including QT prolongation and C. difficile infection [^1139agBC].

## Clinical considerations in smokers with lung infections

Smokers have **increased susceptibility** to respiratory infections due to impaired mucociliary clearance, altered immune responses, and structural lung damage [^113cCjrk]. Common pathogens include:

- **Streptococcus pneumoniae**: Most common CAP pathogen [^112KyGo7].
- **Haemophilus influenzae**: Common in smokers with chronic bronchitis [^notfound].
- **Moraxella catarrhalis**: Associated with chronic bronchitis and COPD exacerbations [^notfound].
- **Atypical pathogens**: Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae [^notfound].
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: Consider in severe COPD, bronchiectasis, or recent hospitalization [^112qk15H].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy recommendations

Empiric therapy should cover typical and atypical pathogens, with adjustments based on severity, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns [^116LA8Eg].

---

### Outpatient therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Mild to moderate CAP without comorbidities | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Macrolide (if local resistance < 25%) [^112hi12x] |
| Moderate to severe CAP or comorbidities | - Respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) <br/> - Or combination therapy (beta-lactam plus macrolide) [^112hi12x] |
| COPD exacerbation with increased sputum purulence | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Macrolide (azithromycin) <br/> - Respiratory fluoroquinolone [^112z16dX] |

---

### Inpatient therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Non-severe CAP | - Beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ampicillin-sulbactam) + macrolide <br/> - Or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy [^117J4ouG] |
| Severe CAP or ICU admission | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Or beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone [^112KyGo7] |
| Risk factors for Pseudomonas (severe COPD, bronchiectasis, recent hospitalization) | Add anti-pseudomonal coverage (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or carbapenem) [^notfound] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Standard duration is **5–7 days** for most CAP cases, provided the patient is clinically stable and afebrile for 48–72 hours [^11422hz5]. Severe disease or complications (e.g. empyema, lung abscess) may require **10–14 days**, tailored to clinical response.

---

## Adjunctive therapies and supportive care

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended to improve outcomes and reduce recurrence [^1139agBC].
- **Vaccinations**: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are recommended [^116LA8Eg].
- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor for **clinical stability** within 48–72 hours — including fever, respiratory rate, oxygenation, and mental status — and watch for adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset, QT prolongation, and C. difficile infection. Arrange follow-up to ensure symptom resolution, adherence, and smoking cessation support [^113heVKw].

---

## Special considerations

- **Macrolide resistance**: High resistance rates limit monotherapy; use combination therapy when appropriate [^notfound].
- **Fluoroquinolone risks**: QT prolongation, CNS effects, and C. difficile infection; monitor closely [^notfound].
- **Pseudomonas coverage**: Essential in severe COPD, bronchiectasis, or recent hospitalization [^notfound].

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^115ZLpNh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics in spite of expert recommendations against this practice.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also wrote to study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE has previously been searched from 1974 to 2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65 and including smokers and non-smokers were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than did those receiving placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 5; 95% CI 3 to 14), show no improvement on physician assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50), or have abnormal lung findings (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); and had shorter durations of cough (weighted mean difference 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16 days), productive cough (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.52 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03 days), and feeling ill (WMD 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16 days). There were no significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, or activity limitations at follow up, or in the mean duration of activity limitations. The benefits of antibiotics were less apparent in a sensitivity analysis that included data from two other studies of patients with upper respiratory tract infections with productive cough. There was a non significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, relative risk (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The magnitude of this benefit, however, is similar to that of the detriment from potential adverse effects.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^116LdoMD]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Severity of exacerbations

Puhan et al have grouped together mild and moderate exacerbations based on the site of treatment, that is, outpatient treatment. This classification is clearly very broad as the site of care will vary among countries and healthcare systems as well as with patient and physician preferences. Furthermore, over time, changes in healthcare delivery and results of outcome studies can change the site of care for the same severity of exacerbation. A 40-year-old smoker without underlying airway obstruction, infrequent exacerbations and free of comorbid conditions would have been included as a 'mild to moderate' exacerbation. On the other hand, a patient with severe COPD, frequent exacerbations and comorbid conditions who does not require hospitalization would also be classified as a 'mild to moderate exacerbation'. In the former patient, it is possible that host immunity can adequately deal with the infection and the exacerbation will spontaneously resolve. In the latter patient, such resolution is less likely and complications are more frequent. Grouping these patients together can lead to confusing and contradictory results.

The severity of an exacerbation is a complicated concept, constituted by at least two factors, the severity of the underlying COPD and the acute change induced by the exacerbation itself. Therefore, a patient with severe underlying COPD will have significant clinical consequences from a relatively small change from the baseline state, while a patient with mild COPD will tolerate a much larger change in symptoms and lung function. It is evident that we need more objective measures of severity of exacerbations. Ongoing developmental efforts in patient-reported outcomes and biomarkers should provide us with such tools in the future, and allow for trials to be pooled as attempted by Puhan et al here.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to long-term antibiotics, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering azithromycin, preferably but not limited to former smokers, experiencing exacerbations despite appropriate therapy,
to reduce exacerbations.
Recognize that azithromycin therapy is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial resistance
and hearing test impairments.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^1152zHys]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician — patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### New opportunities for managing acute and chronic lung infections [^113gyTxj]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Lung diseases caused by microbial infections affect hundreds of millions of children and adults throughout the world. In Western populations, the treatment of lung infections is a primary driver of antibiotic resistance. Traditional therapeutic strategies have been based on the premise that the healthy lung is sterile and that infections grow in a pristine environment. As a consequence, rapid advances in our understanding of the composition of the microbiota of the skin and bowel have not yet been matched by studies of the respiratory tree. The recognition that the lungs are as populated with microorganisms as other mucosal surfaces provides the opportunity to reconsider the mechanisms and management of lung infections. Molecular analyses of the lung microbiota are revealing profound adverse responses to widespread antibiotic use, urbanization and globalization. This Opinion article proposes how technologies and concepts flowing from the Human Microbiome Project can transform the diagnosis and treatment of common lung diseases.

### Systemic antibiotics cause deterioration of emphysema associated with exaggerated inflammation and autophagy [^111mqNSR]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Smoking causes various chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, asthma and lung cancer. Among them, COPD is a chronic progressive disease with global mortality associated with the inflammatory response and lung injury caused by exposure to noxious particles, and smoking represents the greatest risk factor. COPD is a heterogeneous disease; many patients have never smoked, and only some heavy smokers have airflow limitation. This heterogeneity has been explained by environmental and genetic factors, which cannot explain every aspect. Immune homeostasis can also be involved because it is crucial in smoking susceptibility, and recent reports have suggested that microorganisms regulate immune homeostasis.

Indeed, the association between respiratory diseases and the microbiota was suggested epidemiologically even when the concept of the microbiome was still in its infancy. Now, the systemic effect of the intestinal microbiome has become relatively definitive on the brain, liver, and lung beyond the gut. This notion has led to the coining of a new, now established term, the gut–lung axis, explaining the close relationship between an imbalance in intestinal microorganisms and the pathogenesis of lung diseases –. This relationship suggests that the manipulation of the microbiota can also be applied to the treatment of respiratory diseases. Recent studies have shown that the modulation of the intestinal microbiota by diet and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) attenuated emphysema development, indicating the therapeutic potential of a healthy microbiota on COPD utilizing the concept of the gut–lung axis.

Antibiotics are widely prescribed in the acute exacerbation of respiratory diseases. Selective and narrow-spectrum antibiotics can be applied in some cases, but broad-spectrum antibiotics are inevitable in most clinical situations because causative organisms are not definite at initial presentation. In addition to antibiotic resistance and unnecessary side effects due to their overuse, it should also be acknowledged that antibiotics are the representative treatment causing an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota. It has already been documented that the imbalance and depletion of microbiota can aggravate pulmonary infection from both bacteriaand viruses. Moreover, the potential effects of antibiotics on COPD from this view of microbiome imbalance have not been adequately addressed. Here, we analyzed whether antibiotic treatment can aggravate emphysema utilizing a smoking-exposed murine model. Additionally, we addressed whether this aggravation can be improved with bacterial metabolites.

### Cigarette smoking and mechanisms of susceptibility to infections of the respiratory tract and other organ systems [^113cCjrk]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

The predisposition of cigarette smokers for development of oral and respiratory infections caused by microbial pathogens is well recognised, with those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at particularly high risk. Smoking cigarettes has a suppressive effect on the protective functions of airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells and adaptive immune mechanisms, in the setting of chronic systemic activation of neutrophils. Cigarette smoke also has a direct effect on microbial pathogens to promote the likelihood of infective disease, specifically promotion of microbial virulence and antibiotic resistance. In addition to interactions between smoking and HIV infection, a number of specific infections/clinical syndromes have been associated epidemiologically with cigarette smoking, including those of the upper and lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous and other organ systems. Smoking cessation benefits patients in many ways, including reduction of the risk of infectious disease.

### Long-term macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of bronchiectasis in adults: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^116vQdkC]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis guidelines recommend long-term macrolide treatment for patients with three or more exacerbations per year without Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Randomised controlled trials suggest that long-term macrolide treatment can prevent exacerbations in adult patients with bronchiectasis, but these individual studies have been too small to do meaningful subgroup analyses. We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to explore macrolide benefit in subpopulations, including those in which macrolide therapy is not currently recommended.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from Jan 1, 2000, to Sept 30, 2018, to identify double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics in adult patients with bronchiectasis. We applied no language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials were eligible if treatment was defined a priori as long term and had a primary or secondary outcome of bronchiectasis exacerbations. Studies in patients with cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis were excluded. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was frequency of exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics. Secondary endpoints were time to first exacerbation, change in quality of life according to the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in FEV 1. IPD meta-analysis was done using fixed effects models adjusting for age, sex, FEV 1, and trial. We did prespecified subgroup analyses for each of the primary and secondary endpoints using one-step meta-analysis only. Subgroups were defined by age, sex, previous exacerbation frequency, smoking status, inhaled corticosteroid use at baseline, body-mass index at baseline, cause, C-reactive protein at baseline, baseline FEV 1 percentage of predicted, SGRQ total score, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum culture at baseline. The meta-analysis is registered with the PROSPERO international register of systematic reviews, number CRD42018102908.

Findings

Of 234 identified studies, we included three randomised controlled trials, and IPD was obtained for 341 participants. Macrolide antibiotics reduced the frequency of exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66; p < 0.0001). We also found that macrolide treatment improved the time to first exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46, 0.34 to 0.61; p < 0.0001) and was associated with improved quality of life measured by the SGRQ (mean improvement 2.93 points, 0.03 to 5.83; p = 0.048). Macrolides were not associated with a significant improvement in FEV 1 (67 mL at 1 year, -22 to 112; p = 0.14). Effect estimates in prespecified subgroup analyses revealed a reduced frequency of exacerbations in all prespecified subgroups, including a high level of benefit in patients with P aeruginosa infection (IRR 0.36, 0.18–0.72; p = 0.0044) and in patients with one to two exacerbations per year (0.37, 0.16–0.88; p = 0.025). Studies were rated as low risk of bias across all domains.

Interpretation

Long-term macrolide treatment significantly reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, with similar benefits observed in all subgroups based on patient characteristics. This finding suggests that macrolides might be considered in patients in whom macrolides are not indicated according to the current guidelines, particularly if alternative approaches to reduce exacerbations have been unsuccessful. However, downsides of long-term macrolide treatment must also be taken into account.

### Tobacco smoking as a risk factor for increased antibiotic prescription [^111b3KoZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotic resistance is rapidly spreading, affecting millions of people and costing billions of dollars. Potential factors affecting antibiotic prescription, such as tobacco use, could dramatically influence this public health crisis. The study determined the magnitude of impact that tobacco use has on antibiotic prescribing patterns.

Methods

Pooled data were analyzed in 2015 from the 2006–2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a cross-sectional survey describing use of ambulatory medical services in the U.S. via healthcare provider-patient encounters. Patients aged > 18 years with documented tobacco use status diagnosed with an infection were included (i.e., all encounters in the analysis included an infectious diagnosis of interest). The analytic sample included 8,307 visits, representing 294 million visits nationally.

Results

Half (49.9%) of encounters that included any infection had an antibiotic prescribed. Adjusted odds of receiving antibiotics among current tobacco users was 1.20 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.42), and even higher for encounters of respiratory infections (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.62). Antibiotic prescription rates were lower among patients aged > 65 years, those with comorbid asthma or cancer, non-whites, and those covered by Medicaid and higher for primary care physicians.

Conclusions

Despite lack of evidence-based rationale, among a national sample of patients with an infectious diagnosis, tobacco users had 20%-30% higher odds of receiving antibiotics than non-tobacco users. This is the first U.S. study to quantify the magnitude of this unsubstantiated practice. Prescribers should understand that tobacco use could be associated with higher antibiotic prescription, which may subsequently increase antimicrobial resistance in the community.

### Lung abscess: an update on the current knowledge and call for future investigations [^113bnrMH]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lung abscess is a severe and complex respiratory infection. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent publications on lung abscess, covering topics such as epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment and prevention.

Recent Findings

Risk factors associated with lung abscess include structural lung disease, poor dental hygiene, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, while concerns are now raised regarding the potential of electronic cigarettes use as a risk factor. The complexity of lung abscess is reflected by the relative high number of case reports describing rare and complex cases. Early transthoracic drainage could improve in-hospital outcomes, while next-generation sequencing could become an important tool in diagnostics and future clinical studies.

Summary

High-quality evidence and guidelines to support treatment of lung abscess are lacking. Despite advancements, we call for prospective studies to evaluate the use of invasive procedures and antibiotic treatment regimens.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. 1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare. 3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.

EVALI therapeutic management and monitoring — although clinical management algorithms were provided toward the end of the epidemic peak, there has been no prospective evaluation of the efficacy of treatments (e.g., corticosteroids and antibiotic therapy); future work should include prospective evaluation of therapeutic management options, monitoring recovery was discussed as a critical need to ensure lower readmission, manage potential longer-term effects, and support cessation, yet no consensus has been reached about the timing of short-term follow-up or which evaluation metrics to include.

### Applying clinical outcome variables to appropriate aerosolized antibiotics for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis [^111SKvEQ]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Commercial availability of more than one inhaled antibiotic for the management of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in persons with cystic fibrosis creates a welcome question: Can different inhaled therapies be combined to improve patient outcomes? Although clinicians intuit that antibiotic alternation might extend the duration of benefit, prospective clinical trials will be unable to test this hypothesis. Rather, endpoints acceptable for demonstrating the efficacy of a chronic pulmonary therapy (lung function improvement/stabilization, reduction in exacerbation risk, improvement in quality of life) can test only whether the benefit amplitude is increased during fixed treatment periods. Reduction in pulmonary exacerbation risk appears to be best suited for this task, although lack of consensus on an objective definition of exacerbation independent of the decision to treat is a shortcoming. The broader clinical question of whether a patient has become refractory to a chronic therapy over time would be better addressed with a carefully conducted withdrawal study.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117EwZ3y]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Anti-inflammatory therapy in stable COPD — phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and antibiotics: In patients with chronic bronchitis, severe to very severe COPD and a history of exacerbations, roflumilast improves lung function and reduces moderate and severe exacerbations, and ensifentrine improves lung function but an effect on exacerbations has not been evaluated in patients at increased exacerbation risk. Long-term azithromycin and erythromycin therapy reduces exacerbations over one year. Preferentially, but not only in former smokers with exacerbations despite appropriate therapy, azithromycin can be considered. Treatment with azithromycin is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial resistance and hearing test impairments.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: defining quality care [^112mvRg8]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of 3 initial conditions for which the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have defined quality measures. Eight "core measures" of pneumonia care have been targeted for reporting by U.S. hospitals to facilitate performance monitoring.

Methods

A review of the literature supporting the core measures was performed.

Results

Indicators encouraging influenza vaccination and appropriate antibiotic selection had the most robust evidence. Rapid delivery of antibiotics also showed significant reduction in mortality, though the actual timing (4 versus 8 hours) varied between studies. Other measures, such as performance of blood cultures, pneumococcal vaccination, smoking cessation, and oxygenation assessment, demonstrated less obvious clinical benefit.

Conclusions

There is inherent value in setting standards of care for high-impact conditions such as CAP, but these standards should be chosen on the basis of high-quality research. Public reporting of the current measures is problematic, as it implies they represent best practices for CAP despite relatively weak evidence.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115rzPgH]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotics — In older studies prophylactic, continuous use of antibiotics had no effect on the frequency of exacerbations in COPD and a study of chemoprophylaxis undertaken in winter months over a period of 5 years concluded that there was no benefit, although later studies have shown that regular use of some antibiotics may reduce exacerbation rate. Azithromycin (250 mg/day or 500 mg three times per week) or erythromycin (250 mg two times per day) for one year in patients prone to exacerbations reduced the risk of exacerbations compared to usual care, but azithromycin use was associated with an increased incidence of bacterial resistance, prolongation of QTc interval, and impaired hearing tests. A post-hoc analysis suggests lesser benefit in active smokers, and there are no data showing the efficacy or safety of chronic azithromycin treatment to prevent COPD exacerbations beyond one-year of treatment.

### Predictors for individual patient antibiotic treatment effect in hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia patients [^111UrpHW]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to identify clinical predictors of antibiotic treatment effects in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who were not in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

Post-hoc analysis of three prospective cohorts (from the Netherlands and Spain) of adult patients with CAP admitted to a non-ICU ward having received either β-lactam monotherapy, β-lactam + macrolide, or a fluoroquinolone-based therapy as empirical antibiotic treatment. We evaluated candidate clinical predictors of treatment effects in multiple mixed-effects models by including interactions of the predictors with empirical antibiotic choice and using 30-day mortality, ICU admission and length of hospital stay as outcomes.

Results

Among 8562 patients, empirical treatment was β-lactam in 4399 (51.4%), fluoroquinolone in 3373 (39.4%), and β-lactam + macrolide in 790 (9.2%). Older age (interaction OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.23–2.29, p 0.034) and current smoking (interaction OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.34–4.17, p 0.046) were associated with lower effectiveness of fluoroquinolone on 30-day mortality. Older age was also associated with lower effectiveness of β-lactam + macrolide on length of hospital stay (interaction effect ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.06–1.22, p 0.008).

Conclusions

Older age and smoking could influence the response to specific antibiotic regimens. The effect modification of age and smoking should be considered hypothesis generating to be evaluated in future trials.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a review [^117J4ouG]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually.

Observations

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count < 4000/μL or > 10 000/μL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (eg, antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease severity and evaluate the likelihood of a bacterial infection-or resistant infection-and risk of harm from overuse of antibacterial drugs. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

Community-acquired pneumonia is common and may result in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death. First-line therapy varies by disease severity and etiology. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP and without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days.

### Oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics for cystic fibrosis [^115nH2Nw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common bacterial pathogen causing lung infections in people with CF and appropriate antibiotic therapy is vital. Antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations are usually given intravenously, and for long-term treatment, via a nebuliser. Oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics with the same efficacy and safety as intravenous or nebulised antibiotics would benefit people with CF due to ease of treatment and avoidance of hospitalisation.

Objectives

To determine the benefit or harm of oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotic therapy for people with CF, colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the:1. treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation; and 2. long-term treatment of chronic infection.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and checked reference lists of identified trials. Date of last search: 28 June 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any dose of oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, to other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics, or to placebo or usual treatment for pulmonary exacerbations and long-term treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the trials, extracted data and assessed quality. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included three trials examining pulmonary exacerbations (171 participants) and two trials examining long-term therapy (85 participants). We regarded the most important outcomes as quality of life and lung function. The analysis did not identify any statistically significant difference between oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments for these outcome measures for either pulmonary exacerbations or long-term treatment. One of the included trials reported significantly better lung function when treating a pulmonary exacerbation with ciprofloxacin when compared with intravenous treatment; however, our analysis did not confirm this finding. We found no evidence of difference between oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics and other treatments regarding adverse events or development of antibiotic resistance, but trials were not adequately powered to detect this. None of the studies had a low risk of bias from blinding which may have an impact particularly on subjective outcomes such as quality of life. The risk of bias for other criteria could not be clearly stated across the studies.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that an oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotic regimen is more or less effective than an alternative treatment for either pulmonary exacerbations or long-term treatment of chronic infection with P. aeruginosa. Until results of adequately-powered future trials are available, treatment needs to be selected on a pragmatic basis, based upon any available non-RCT evidence, the clinical circumstances of the individual, the known effectiveness of drugs against local strains and upon individual preference.

### Antibiotics for treatment and prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114VuTEe]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations (AE) can be recurrent problems for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increasing morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that ≥ 50% of acute exacerbations involve bacteria requiring treatment with an antibiotic which should have high activity against the causative pathogens. However, sputum analysis is not a pre-requisite for antibiotic prescription in outpatients as results are delayed and patients are likely to be colonised with bacteria in the stable state. Clinicians rely on the clinical symptoms, sputum appearance and the patient's medical history to decide if an AE-COPD should be treated with antibiotics. This article reviews the available data of antibiotic trials in AE-COPD. Management of frequent exacerbators is particularly challenging for physicians. This may include antibiotic prophylaxis, especially macrolides because of anti-inflammatory properties; though successful in reducing exacerbations, concerns about resistance development remain. Inhalation of antibiotics achieves high local concentrations and minimal systemic exposure; therefore, it may represent an attractive alternative for antibiotic prophylaxis in certain COPD patients. Inhaled antibiotic prophylaxis has been successfully used in other respiratory conditions such as non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis which itself might be present in COPD patients who have chronic bacterial infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^114EZeEi]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of our study include residual confounding from unmeasured/unrecorded factors leading clinicians to prescribe macrolides to more unwell patients, particularly affecting time to discharge analyses, although we adjusted more completely for confounding with our more detailed data than previous studies. We could not adjust for causative pathogens because most patients lacked positive microbiological data, including for atypical infections (identified in < 1%). Low rates of organisms requiring macrolides for treatment potentially explain the lack of association, suggesting that better pathogen diagnostics are needed to identify at-risk populations to target additional antibiotics, but still supporting the conclusion that at a population-level empirical macrolide use may have more harms than benefits. However, this may not generalize in settings with different bacterial species or resistance prevalences. Other limitations include using diagnostic codes for CAP identification, which may be imperfect; however, previous studies have shown that diagnostic codes have high positive predictive value for identifying CAP, although they do miss some cases (ie, lower sensitivity). The large number of admissions included in our analyses precluded individual note review. Further, results remained consistent among patients with radiologically confirmed CAP. We restricted to patients with nonmissing covariates to best control for confounding, but sicker patients may have a higher likelihood of recorded measurements; nevertheless, sensitivity analyses imputing missing values produced broadly similar results. We only examined baseline antibiotics without considering changes over time, reflecting an "intention-to-treat" approach targeting the effect of empiric macrolide prescriptions. We did not account for smoking status, individual clinicians, or prior community antibiotic usage, as they were not available for analysis. Only a very small proportion of patients were admitted to ICU within the baseline period (1.7%), so our conclusions cannot be generalized to this specific patient group. Also, most patients received oral clarithromycin, so conclusions may not generalize to populations prescribed different macrolides. Although macrolide use is associated with individual antimicrobial resistance, risks of resistance at a population level may only be partially influenced by hospital prescribing of macrolides for CAP, as use for other indications and in the community may also play a role. However, in our hospital the main recipients of macrolides were adults (86%), and based on prescriber documented indications, 58% were prescribed for a respiratory infection, whereas only 5% were prescribed for ear, nose, or throat infections, with no clear source recorded in the majority of the remainder.

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia in previously healthy adults: case report and review of the literature [^113UjKEs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

We report a case of rapidly fatal Pseudomonas aeruginosa community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a previously healthy 67-year-old woman. Eleven published case reports of P. aeruginosa CAP in previously healthy adults are reviewed. According to our review, the mean age of affected patients is 45.3 years. Five patients described in the literature were smokers with a mean smoking history of 40 pack-years. The clinical presentation is nonspecific, and although the pneumonia can be rapidly fatal, only 33% of the patients who were reported died. However, mortality may be independent of treatment within the first 36 hours of presentation. Exposure to aerosols of contaminated water is a risk factor for P. aeruginosa CAP in this population. Pseudomonas CAP should be considered in the differential diagnosis for anyone with a smoking history who presents with rapidly progressive pneumonia. We discuss treatment recommendations that are based on evidence in the currently available literature on the subject.

### Efficacy of antibiotic therapy for acute exacerbations of mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112z16dX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Antimicrobial therapy remains a controversial issue in nonsevere exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in moderate exacerbations of mild-to-moderate COPD.

Methods

This study involved a multicenter, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Patients aged 40 years or older, smokers, or ex-smokers of 10 pack-years or more with spirometrically confirmed mild-to-moderate COPD (FEV(1) > 50% predicted and FEV(1)/FVC ratio < 0.7) and diagnosed with an exacerbation were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized to receive amoxicillin/clavulanate 500/125 mg three times a day or placebo three times a day for 8 days.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome measure was clinical cure at end of therapy visit (EOT) at Days 9 to 11. A total of 310 subjects fulfilled all the criteria for efficacy analysis. A total of 117 patients with amoxicillin/clavulanate (74.1%) and 91 with placebo (59.9%) were considered cured at EOT (difference, 14.2%; 95% confidence interval, 3.7–24.3). The median time to the next exacerbation was significantly longer in patients receiving antibiotic compared with placebo (233 d [interquartile range, 110–365] compared with 160 d [interquartile range, 66–365]; P < 0.05). The best C-reactive protein serum cut-off for predicting clinical failure with placebo was 40 mg/L, with an area under the curve of 0.732 (95% confidence interval, 0.614–0.851).

Conclusions

Treatment of ambulatory exacerbations of mild-to-moderate COPD with amoxicillin/clavulanate is more effective and significantly prolongs the time to the next exacerbation compared with placebo.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115GGfNj]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 5.6 million cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occur annually in the US, resulting in 600 000 to 800 000 hospitalizations, with the highest incidence rate in older patients. Community-acquired pneumonia is a heterogeneous disease that ranges from a mild, self-limiting disease to a severe infection that causes respiratory failure, shock, and death. Treatment failure is the most serious complication. Failure significantly increases the risk of complications, length of hospital stay, and death, especially in patients with severe CAP. The incidence of clinical failure in patients with CAP ranges from 6% to 24%, and can reach up to 31% in patients with severe CAP. Several risk factors for treatment failure have been identified in the literature, such as age, smoking, malnutrition, previous CAP episodes, and comorbidities (chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, and immunosuppression). Reaching clinical stability is associated with a high rate of favorable outcomes. The Pneumonia Short Treatment (PTC) trial was a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that studied antibiotic treatment duration (3 vs 8 days of β-lactam treatment) among 310 patients hospitalized with moderately severe CAP who reached clinical stability at day 3 of treatment. In this secondary analysis, we aim to evaluate the risk factors for treatment failure among this specific population.

### Treatment of lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis: current and future strategies [^1142eMXM]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2012). Low credibility.

In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) lung damage secondary to chronic infection is the main cause of death. Treatment of lung disease to reduce the impact of infection, inflammation and subsequent lung injury is therefore of major importance. Here we discuss the present status of antibiotic therapy for the major pathogens in CF airways, including prophylaxis against infection, eradication of early infection, suppression of chronic infection, and the treatment of infective exacerbations. We outline measures to optimize maintenance treatment for infection in the light of novel antibiotic drug formulations. We discuss new developments in culture-independent microbiological diagnostic techniques and the use of tools for monitoring the success of antibiotic treatment courses. Finally, cost-effectiveness analyses for antibiotic treatment in CF patients are discussed.

Discussion

There may be no more challenging aspect of CF exacerbation management than determining an "appropriate" or "optimal" use of systemic antibiotics. In addition to the question of which organisms within complex multispecies lung infections should be targeted (and by extension, which specific antibiotics should be chosen), the question of how long antibiotics should be administered has yet to be meaningfully explored. In the past, CF treatment guidelines have suggested that treatment duration should be determined empirically by "the improvement, or lack thereof" of pulmonary function. This suggestion is logical, in that loss of FEV 1 is a strong predictor of exacerbation diagnosis, and antibiotic therapy has been shown to significantly improve lung function in CF patients experiencing an exacerbation. Unfortunately, many patients treated for a CF exacerbation do not fully recover lung function lost immediately prior to intervention, creating a dilemma for the treating clinician: if a patient has not fully recovered lost lung function following weeks of antibiotic treatment, should treatment be extended? At what point does the clinician accept that the patient will not fully recover lung function on the current regimen, and that continued antibiotic treatment may be futile and possibly deleterious?

The reasons that some patients fail to completely recover lost lung function following exacerbation remain unknown. It may be that antibiotic choices and/or treatment durations made for some patients have been suboptimal, or simply that irreversible lung damage has occurred in some patients, or both. It can be argued, however, that an "optimal" duration for any antibiotic therapy would be one that includes an observed peak increase in FEV 1, regardless of the magnitude of the increase observed. In practice, it is impossible to recognize that moment in time when a patient is experiencing his or her peak FEV 1 improvement, as this is an inherently retrospective analysis. It is possible, however, to retrospectively review a series of treatment courses and ask whether the timing of peak responses adhere to a consistent pattern that could be useful in predicting future response time courses. Recently, a retrospective analysis of 1,535 patients treated for exacerbation while participating in the US CF Twin and Sibling Study between 2000–2007 showed that, on average, lung function recovery reached a plateau after 8 and 10 days of treatment a result similar to that observed in a small prospective study by Regelmann et al. two decades earlier. Our results compliment and expand on these earlier findings, in that we have been able to analyze daily PFT measures for individual patients to confirm that attainment of peak FEV 1 occurs fairly consistently within 2 weeks of initiation of antibiotic treatment.

### Azithromycin during acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations requiring hospitalization (BACE). A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111FVRgp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Azithromycin prevents acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPDs); however, its value in the treatment of an AECOPD requiring hospitalization remains to be defined. Objectives: We investigated whether a 3-month intervention with low-dose azithromycin could decrease treatment failure (TF) when initiated at hospital admission and added to standard care. Methods: In an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients who had been hospitalized for an AECOPD and had a smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years and one or more exacerbations in the previous year were randomized (1:1) within 48 hours of hospital admission to azithromycin or placebo. The study drug (500 mg/d for 3 d) was administered on top of a standardized acute treatment of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics, and subsequently continued for 3 months (250 mg/2 d). The patients were followed for 6 months thereafter. Time-to-first-event analyses evaluated the TF rate within 3 months as a novel primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat population, with TF defined as the composite of treatment intensification with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics, a step-up in hospital care or readmission for respiratory reasons, or all-cause mortality. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 301 patients were randomized to azithromycin (n = 147) or placebo (n = 154). The TF rate within 3 months was 49% in the azithromycin group and 60% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.01; P = 0.0526). Treatment intensification, step-up in hospital care, and mortality rates within 3 months were 47% versus 60% (P = 0.0272), 13% versus 28% (P = 0.0024), and 2% versus 4% (P = 0.5075) in the azithromycin and placebo groups, respectively. Clinical benefits were lost 6 months after withdrawal. Conclusions: Three months of azithromycin for an infectious AECOPD requiring hospitalization may significantly reduce TF during the highest-risk period. Prolonged treatment seems to be necessary to maintain clinical benefits.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112hi12x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. Results: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. Conclusions: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^113heVKw]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48–72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs-such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities-with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g., empyema) or not (e.g., acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g., pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Predictors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation reduction in response to daily azithromycin therapy [^115nJfxj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

Daily azithromycin decreases acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), but long-term side effects are unknown.

Objectives

To identify the types of exacerbations most likely to be reduced and clinical subgroups most likely to benefit from azithromycin, 250 mg daily, added to usual care.

Methods

Enrollment criteria included irreversible airflow limitation and AECOPD requiring corticosteroids, emergency department visit, or hospitalization in the prior year or use of supplemental oxygen. Recurrent events and cumulative incidence analyses compared treatment received for AECOPD by randomization group, stratified by subgroups of interest. Cox proportional hazards models estimated treatment effects in subgroups adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, FEV1% predicted, concomitant COPD medications, and oxygen use.

Measurements and Main Results

Azithromycin was most effective in reducing AECOPD requiring both antibiotic and steroid treatment (n = 1,113; cumulative incidence analysis, P = 0.0002; recurrent events analysis, P = 0.002). No difference in treatment response by sex (P = 0.75), presence of chronic bronchitis (P = 0.19), concomitant inhaled therapy (P = 0.29), or supplemental oxygen use (P = 0.23) was observed. Older age and milder Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage were associated with better treatment response (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). A significant interaction between treatment and current smoking was seen (P = 0.03) and azithromycin did not reduce exacerbations in current smokers (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.38; P = 0.95).

Conclusions

Azithromycin is most effective in preventing AECOPD requiring both antibiotic and steroid treatment. Adjusting for confounders, we saw no difference in efficacy by sex, history of chronic bronchitis, oxygen use, or concomitant COPD therapy. Greater efficacy was seen in older patients and milder Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages. We found little evidence of treatment effect among current smokers. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT0011986 and NCT00325897).

### A systematic review of antimicrobial therapy in children with tracheostomies [^1115gYrC]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This systematic review summarizes the current evidence base for the use of antimicrobials in tracheostomy‐dependent pediatric patients. All 12 studies identified were retrospective cohort studies. These highlight four core themes that should be the topic of future research: (i) route of antimicrobial administration (systemic vs. topical); (ii) the role of cultures in guiding antimicrobial use; (iii) timing of antimicrobial use (reactive vs. prophylactic); and (iv) clinical decision aids to help determine which patients would benefit from antimicrobial therapy. All of these would help clinicians optimize management for these children, reducing the need for escalation of care and improving antimicrobial stewardship. There is an urgent need for prospective, randomized controlled trial evidence to address these issues and guide the management of this vulnerable patient group.

Systemic antimicrobials are in routine use for tracheostomy‐associated infections, with empirical treatment often aiming to cover Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus as common causative organisms. Although anti‐pseudomonal antimicrobial usage has been associated with increased hospital admission duration both on an individual leveland hospital level, this likely reflects other clinical confounders such as their use in severe infections. The relationship between longer hospital admissions and hospital‐level prescribing rates may also represent poorer antimicrobial stewardship leading to increased antimicrobial resistance.

Inhaled antimicrobial use is also widespread in the management of tracheostomy‐associated infections; this is largely based on theoretical benefits, such as higher tracheal antibiotic concentrations and reduced side effects. As well as the extrapolation of evidence from the management of adult ventilator‐associated pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, and non‐cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Clearly, none of these populations represent children with tracheostomy‐associated infections well due to differences in both pathology and between children and adults, including physiology, anatomy, and risk factor exposure profiles (such as smoking). Although nebulized antimicrobials have been used in the treatment of respiratory illness for over 70 years, further studies are needed to evaluate and compare alternate antimicrobial use in children with tracheostomies.

### Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis: pre-emptive, appropriate antibiotic therapy recommended [^113R8uX3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Bouza and colleagues compared use of pre-emptive antibiotic therapy versus controls to prevent VAT and VAP in high-risk patients following major heart surgery. Forty patients were randomly assigned to a 3-day course of linezolid and meropenem versus 38 control patients followed for development of VAT, VAP or both. The antibiotic-treated group had significantly lower rates of VAT/VAP, 32/1,000 days versus controls 65/1,000 days (P < 0.03), and a longer time to the first episode of VAT/VAP (9 versus 4.5 days, P = 0.02).

Recently, there has been increased interest in the use of adjunctive aerosolized antibiotic therapy for VAT and VAP, administered by an improved nebulizer delivery system to increase weaning from the ventilator and shorten ICU stay. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study is in progress to evaluate adjunctive aerosolized amikacin and fosfomycin therapy for the treatment of VAP due to Gram-negative bacilli and to decrease ventilator days and ICU stay.

Interestingly, different approaches exist for antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) due to cystitis or pyelonephritis versus respiratory tract infections due to VAT and VAP (Figure 1 A). Patients with UTI presenting with fever, leukocytosis, dysuria, and a urine culture having at least 100,000 bacterial pathogens per milliliter due to cystitis or pyelonephritis are treated with antibiotics as a standard of care and infected urine can be removed by voiding or bladder catheter. By comparison, VAT and VAP are 'descending' infections in a mechanically ventilated, intubated patient requiring removal of infected secretions by intermittent suctioning (Figure 1 B). Leakage of oropharyngeal secretions around the endotracheal tube (ETT) or embolization of bacterial biofilm from the inner surface of the ETT to lower tracheobronchial and alveoli after airway instrumentation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of VAT to VAP. Also, bacterial colonization in ventilator tubing condensate can be inadvertently washed into the lung, especially with supine positioning. Intubated patients have decreased bacterial clearance due to reduced cough, sedation, and the presence of the ETT, all of which may increase bacterial lung burden and challenge lung cellular and humoral defenses. These significant clinical differences in pathogenesis between lung and urinary tract infections, in our opinion, add support for the use of pre-emptive appropriate intravenous or aerosolized antibiotic treatment (or both) for VAT or VAP as a standard of care.

### Amikacin (Arikayce) [^1161nvm4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Trial 1 (NCT#02344004) was an open-label, randomized (2:1), multi-center trial in patients with refractory Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as confirmed by at least 2 sputum culture results. Patients were considered to have refractory MAC lung disease if they did not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum duration of 6 consecutive months of background regimen therapy that was either ongoing or stopped no more than 12 months before the screening visit. Patients were randomized to either ARIKAYCE plus a background regimen or background regimen alone. The surrogate endpoint for assessing efficacy was based on achieving culture conversion (3 consecutive monthly negative sputum cultures) by Month 6. The date of conversion was defined as the date of the first of the 3 negative monthly cultures, which had to be achieved by Month 4 in order to meet the endpoint by Month 6. Patients who achieved culture conversion by Month 6 were continued on study drug (ARIKAYCE plus background regimen or background regimen alone based on their randomization) for a total of 12 months after the first negative sputum culture.

A total of 336 patients were randomized (ARIKAYCE plus background regimen, n = 224; background regimen alone, n = 112) (ITT population), with a mean age of 64.7 years and there was a higher percentage of females (69.3%) than males (30.7%) in the study. At the time of enrollment, of the 336 subjects in the ITT population, 302 (89.9%) were either on a guideline-based regimen for MAC or off guideline-based therapy for MAC for less than 3 months while 34 (10.1%) were off treatment for 3 to 12 months prior to enrollment. At screening, patients were stratified by smoking status (current smoker or not) and by whether patients were on treatment or off treatment for at least 3 months. Most patients at screening were not current smokers (89.3%) and had underlying bronchiectasis (62.5%). At baseline, 329 patients were on a multidrug background regimen that included a macrolide (93.3%), a rifamycin (86.3%), or ethambutol (81.4%). Overall, 55.6% of subjects were receiving a triple-drug background regimen consisting of a macrolide, a rifamycin and ethambutol.

### Update: interim guidance for health care providers for managing patients with suspected E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury-United States, November 2019 [^116hHYeD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Consideration of outpatient management. Some patients with recent history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use who are evaluated for respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms might be candidates for outpatient management. Hospital admission should be strongly considered for patients with concurrent illness such as influenza and suspected EVALI, especially if respiratory distress, comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve, or decreased oxygen saturation (< 95% while breathing room air) are present. Candidates for outpatient management should have normal oxygen saturation (≥ 95%), no respiratory distress, no comorbidities that might compromise pulmonary reserve, reliable access to care, strong social support systems, and should be able to ensure follow up within 24–48 hours of initial evaluation and to seek medical care promptly if respiratory symptoms worsen; in some cases, patients who initially had mild symptoms experienced a rapid worsening of symptoms within 48 hours. Additional follow-up might be indicated, based on clinical findings.

Influenza testing and empiric antimicrobial treatment. Influenza testing should be strongly considered, particularly during influenza season. § It might be difficult to differentiate EVALI, a diagnosis of exclusion, from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia on initial assessment, and EVALI might co-occur with respiratory infections. Treatment with empiric antimicrobials, including antivirals, should be considered in accordance with established guidelines and local microbiology and resistance patterns for bacterial pneumonia. Persons with suspected influenza who are at high risk for influenza complications, those with severe or progressive illness, and hospitalized patients are recommended for prompt administration of antiviral treatment. Antiviral treatment also can be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk for influenza complications, who is diagnosed with confirmed or suspected influenza, on the basis of clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

### Commensal microbes affect host humoral immunity toInfection [^112qnZyD]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Last but not the least, the sequencing results for the gut and lung microbiota showed that the gut microbiota was the most affected by oral antibiotic treatment. At the phylum level, both the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decreased markedly after antibiotic treatment, whereas the Proteobacteria increased dramatically after antibiotic treatment (Fig. 1B). Indeed, several studies have reported an increased abundance of Proteobacteria in the lower airway secretions of individuals with asthma compared to that in healthy individuals. Enrichment of Proteobacteria has also been identified in the lungs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients compared with those of healthy smokers and nonsmokers. In addition, in a recent Finnish study, increased numbers of Proteobacteria in the intestine as a result of antibiotic use have been shown to be associated with an increased asthma risk in 2- to 7-year-old children. Combined analysis with heat map data revealed that the dramatic increase in Proteobacteria was mainly attributed to Escherichia-Shigella at the genus level. Although shigellosis in humans is a disease of the intestine and the roles of Shigella in lung diseases have not been documented in humans, it does infect the lungs and does cause disease in mouse models. The roles of Bacteroidetes in lung diseases probably depend on the exact disease. A higher intestinal Bacteroidetes abundance was found to be associated with an increased asthma risk in 2- to 7-year-old children; however, a markedly lower abundance of gut Bacteroidetes was detected in digestive tract samples from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients than in samples from non-CF patients. Interestingly, although the abundance of the Firmicutes decreased significantly, there was a remarkable increase in the Lactobacillus abundance at the genus level (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material). This could be a result of the expansion of antibiotic-resistant strains during the course of antibiotic treatment. Indeed, a marked enrichment of Lactobacillus was observed in the lung tissue of COPD patients compared with that of nonsmokers, smokers without COPD, and patients with CF. An increased representation of Lactobacillus has also been reported in a lipopolysaccharide/elastase-challenged mouse model of COPD.

Dysbiosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — gene sequencing of respiratory samples has been used to describe the lung microbiome and is more sensitive than traditional cultures, showing that the lower respiratory tract is not sterile but permanently contains a diverse array of bacteria; dysbiosis, defined as disruption of the microbiome, has been observed in several compartments in COPD including the airways; diverse risk factors such as cigarette smoking or prematurity alter mucosal immunity and the gut and airway microbiota, which interact bidirectionally via the 'gut-lung axis'; dysbiosis is cross-sectionally associated with COPD and disease features such as frequency of exacerbations, and microbiome profiles change with viral infections, during exacerbations, and with antibiotics or oral or inhaled corticosteroids; overall, observations suggest a role for dysbiosis in COPD development and progression, but the paucity of longitudinal and interventional studies underlines the need for further research to ascertain causality and potential prognostic, diagnostic or therapeutic applications.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a practical approach to management for the hospitalist [^112KyGo7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common, and inpatient physicians should be familiar with the most current evidence about and guidelines for CAP management. Our conclusions and recommendations include: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common identified cause of CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of severe CAP. The chest radiograph remains an essential initial test in the diagnosis of CAP and should be supplemented by blood cultures sampled prior to antibiotic therapy and sputum for gram stain and culture if a high-quality specimen can be rapidly processed. Once the diagnosis is made, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) should be used to optimize the location of treatment and to provide prognostic information. Absent other mitigating factors, patients in PSI risk classes I, II, and III can safely be treated as outpatients. Hospitalized patients with CAP should be treated promptly with empiric antibiotics. Nonsevere pneumonia should be treated with a parenteral beta-lactam plus either doxycycline or a macrolide. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone as well as be evaluated for pseudomonal risk factors. Most patients with nonsevere CAP reach clinical stability in 2–3 days and should be considered for a switch to oral therapy and discharge shortly thereafter. Patients should receive pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, and tobacco cessation counseling prior to discharge if eligible. Multiple quality indicators are measured and publicly reported in the management of CAP, which provides hospitals with an opportunity to improve care processes and patient outcomes.

### Antibiotic treatment for nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infection in people with cystic fibrosis [^114eqTKN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nontuberculous mycobacteria are mycobacteria, other than those in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and are commonly found in the environment. Nontuberculous mycobacteria species (most commonly Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus) are isolated from the respiratory tract of approximately 5% to 20% of individuals with cystic fibrosis; they can cause lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis leading to more a rapid decline in lung function and even death in certain circumstances. Although there are guidelines for the antimicrobial treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease, these recommendations are not specific for people with cystic fibrosis and it is not clear which antibiotic regimen may be the most effective in the treatment of these patients.

Objectives

The objective of our review was to compare antibiotic treatment to no antibiotic treatment, or to compare different combinations of antibiotic treatment, for nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. The primary objective was to assess the effect of treatment on lung function and pulmonary exacerbations and to quantify adverse events. The secondary objectives were to assess treatment effects on the amount of bacteria in the sputum, quality of life, mortality, nutritional parameters, hospitalizations and use of oral antibiotics.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and hand searching of journals and conference abstract books. Date of last search: 13 November 2014. We also searched a register of ongoing trials and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 24 September 2014.

Selection Criteria

Any randomized controlled trials comparing nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotics to no antibiotic treatment, as well as one nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotic regimen compared to another nontuberculous mycobacteria antibiotic regimen, in individuals with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were not collected because no completed trials were identified by the searches.

Main Results

No completed trials were identified by the searches, but one ongoing trial was identified, which may be eligible for inclusion in this review when completed.

Authors' Conclusions

This review did not find any evidence for the effectiveness of different antimicrobial treatment for nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Until such evidence becomes available, it is reasonable for clinicians to follow the American Thoracic Society guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of nodular or bronchiectatic pulmonary disease due to Mycobacterium avium complex or Mycobacterium abscessus in patients with cystic fibrosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lung infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria [^115ywwq9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are diagnosed with increasing frequency, in part due to growing at-risk populations but also as a result of improved awareness and diagnostic facilities. This review summarizes recent literature regarding epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of NTM lung infections.

Recent Findings

The number of species known to cause NTM infections has increased due to the extended use of molecular techniques. The number of recognized risk factors, including newly discovered inherited immunological disorders and novel types of immunomodulating drugs such as antagonists of tumor necrosis factor-alpha is also growing. Revised diagnostic criteria for NTM lung infection are available but the decision whether to treat a patient remains a matter of careful individual evaluation taking into account the NTM species, extent of disease, general condition and underlying disorders. No major breakthrough has been made with regard to treatment. Antibiotic treatment of NTM infection is complicated by the necessary long duration and the adverse toxicity profile of many of the potentially effective drugs while there is an uncertain correlation between in-vitro susceptibility and in-vivo effectiveness except for two drug-NTM species combinations. The role for novel antibiotics in the treatment of NTM infection is still uncertain.

Summary

Much remains unknown regarding treatment of NTM lung infections. In order to provide optimal care, the recommendations provided in the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America statement should be taken as a starting point and there should be a low threshold to seek expert consultation.

### Pneumonia in HIV-infected persons: increased risk with cigarette smoking and treatment interruption [^113Hu4Ki]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale

Bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity for HIV-infected persons and contributes to excess mortality in this population.

Objectives

To evaluate the frequency and risk factors for occurrence of bacterial pneumonia in the present era of potent antiretroviral therapy.

Methods

We evaluated data from a randomized trial of episodic antiretroviral therapy. The study, Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy, enrolled 5,472 participants at 318 sites in 33 countries. Study patients had more than 350 CD4 cells at baseline. Diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia was confirmed by a blinded clinical-events committee.

Measurements and Main Results

During a mean follow-up of 16 months, 116 participants (2.2%) developed at least one episode of bacterial pneumonia. Patients randomized to receive episodic antiretroviral therapy were significantly more likely to develop pneumonia than patients randomized to receive continuous antiretroviral therapy (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–2.25; P = 0.02). Cigarette smoking was a major risk factor: Current-smokers had more than an 80% higher risk of pneumonia compared with never-smokers (hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–3.04; P = 0.02). Participants who were on continuous HIV treatment and were current smokers were three times more likely to develop bacterial pneumonia than nonsmokers. Current smoking status was significant, but a past history of smoking was not.

Conclusions

Bacterial pneumonia is a major source of morbidity, even for persons on potent antiretroviral therapy, including those with high CD4 cells. Efforts to reduce this illness should stress the importance of uninterrupted antiretroviral therapy and attainment and/or maintenance of nonsmoking status.

COPD exacerbations on LABA+LAMA with low eosinophils — adjunct options: If patients treated with LABA+LAMA and eosinophil counts < 100 cells/μL still have exacerbations the following options may be considered: Among those who are not currently smoking, consider adding azithromycin. Consideration to the development of resistant organisms should be factored into decision-making. Among those with FEV1 < 50%, symptoms of chronic bronchitis and history of prior severe exacerbation, consider adding roflumilast.

### Global initiative for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease. the 2020 GOLD science committee report on COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113DLquB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There are currently no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the effect of smoking on the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, but studies suggest that smoking is associated with increased severity of disease and risk of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

In summary, on current evidence, patients with COPD do not seem to be at a greatly increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, but this may reflect the effect of protective strategies. They are at an increased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and may be at increased risk of developing severe disease and death.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; including chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by shortness of breath, cough and recurrent exacerbations. Long-term antibiotic use may reduce both bacterial load and inflammation in the airways. Studies have shown a reduction of exacerbations with antibiotics in comparison to placebo in people with COPD, but there are concerns about antibiotic resistance and safety.

Objectives

To compare the safety and efficacy of different classes of antibiotics (continuous, intermittent or pulsed) for prophylaxis of exacerbations in patients with COPD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was conducted on 6 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected that compared one prophylactic antibiotic with another in patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third review author.

Main Results

We included two RCTs, both published in 2015 involving a total of 391 participants with treatment duration of 12 to 13 weeks. One RCT compared a quinolone (moxifloxacin pulsed, for 5 days every 4 weeks), with a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) or a macrolide (azithromycin intermittent). The second RCT compared a tetracycline (doxycycline continuous) plus a macrolide (roxithromycin continuous), with roxithromycin (continuous) alone. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 68 years, with moderate-severity COPD. Both trials included participants who had between two and five exacerbations in the previous one to two years. In one trial, 17% of patients had previously been using inhaled corticosteroids. In the other study, all patients were positive for Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C pneumoniae). Overall, we judged the evidence presented to be of very low-certainty, mainly due to imprecision, but we also had concerns about indirectness and methodological quality of the included studies. The primary outcome measures for this review included exacerbations, quality of life, drug resistance and serious adverse events. Macrolide + tetracycline versus macrolide There was no clear difference between treatments in improvement in quality of life as assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). The CRQ scale ranges from 0 to 10 and higher scores on the scale indicate better quality of life. CRQ sub-scales for dyspnoea (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to 2.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), fatigue (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.08 to 1.12; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), emotional function (MD -0.37, 95% CI -1.74 to 1.00; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or mastery (MD -0.79, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.28; 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 12 weeks. For serious adverse events, it was uncertain if there was a difference between combined roxithromycin and doxycycline versus roxithromycin alone at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.93; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were five deaths reported in the combined treatment arm, versus three in the single treatment arm at 48 weeks follow-up after active treatment of 12 weeks (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.02; 198 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quinolone versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants, very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Quinolone versus macrolide There was no clear difference between moxifloxacin and azithromycin for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. Marcolide versus tetracycline There was no clear difference between azithromycin and doxycycline for the number of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.38; 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at 13 weeks. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported in either treatment groups. We did not identify any evidence for our other primary outcomes. We did not find head-to-head evidence for impact of antibiotics on drug resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not clear from the evidence included in this review whether there is a difference in efficacy or safety between different classes or regimens of prophylactic antibiotic, given for 12 to 13 weeks to people with COPD. Whilst no head-to-head comparisons of antibiotic resistance were identified, concerns about this continue. The sample size in this review is small and both included studies are of short duration. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty in effects observed and the effects of different prophylactic antibiotics requires further research.

### Smoking cessation interventions for pulmonary tuberculosis treatment outcomes [^1132LzJz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Active smoking increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection 2 to 2.5 times and is significantly associated with recurrent TB and TB mortality. Observational studies have shown associations between smoking and poor TB treatment outcomes such as increased loss to follow-up rate, severity of disease, drug resistance and slow smear conversion. Since most smoking-related immunologic abnormalities are reversible within six weeks of stopping smoking, smoking cessation may have substantial positive effects on TB treatment outcomes, TB relapse and future lung disease.

Objectives

To analyse the effect of tobacco smoking cessation interventions (SCIs) on the treatment outcomes of people with adult pulmonary TB.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register using free-text and MeSH terms for TB and antitubercular treatment. We also searched MEDLINE and EMBASE using the same topic-related terms, combined with the search terms used to identify trials of tobacco cessation interventions from the Specialised Register. We also searched reference list of articles and reviews, the Conference Paper Index, clinicaltrials.gov and grey literature. The searches are current to 29th July 2015.

Selection Criteria

Individual and cluster-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), regardless of date, language and publication status, studies of adults with pulmonary TB on first-line anti-tubercular drugs, with interventions at either an individual or a population level, delivered separately or as part of a larger tobacco control package. This included any type of behavioural or pharmaceutical intervention or both for smoking cessation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Using the eligibility criteria, two authors independently checked the abstracts of retrieved studies for relevance, and acquired full trial reports of candidates for inclusion. The authors resolved any disagreements on eligibility by mutual consent, or by recourse to a third author. Two authors intended to independently extract study data from eligible studies into a data extraction form and compare the findings, synthesise data using risk ratios, and assess risk of bias using standard Cochrane methodologies. However, we found no eligible trials.

Main Results

There were no randomised controlled trials that met the eligibility criteria. A number of potentially eligible studies are underway, and we will assess them for inclusion in the next update of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of high-quality evidence, i.e. RCTs, that tests the effectiveness of cessation interventions in improving TB treatment outcomes. There is a need for good-quality randomised controlled trials that assess the effect of SCIs on TB treatment outcomes in both the short and long term. Establishing such an evidence base would be an essential step towards the implementation of SCIs in TB control programmes worldwide.

### Measuring the impact of an empiric antibiotic algorithm for pulmonary exacerbation in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis [^116Hx9tr]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disease affecting more than 30,000 individuals in the United States, is characterized by a dysfunctional ATP‐gated chloride channel in the airways, pancreas, and other organs. Pulmonary disease, presenting with increasing respiratory symptoms and eventual respiratory failure, remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality for persons with CF. Lung function decline is exacerbated by recurrent episodes of lung infection and inflammation referred to as pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), which are often treated with antibiotic therapy. Despite the ubiquitous and repetitious nature of PEx, there is not a universal, standardized definition to diagnose these events although most definitions include an increase in respiratory symptoms and/or an acute decrease in lung function.PEx treatment goals typically include recovery of lost lung function and improvement of PEx symptoms.

Antibiotic therapy has long been the mainstay of PEx treatment, and national consensus guidelines recommend an anti‐pseudomonal beta‐lactam and tobramycin for PEx treatment among people with CF and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa endobronchial infection. Guidance for bacterial infections beyond P. aeruginosa or polymicrobial infections are often based on the intrinsic susceptibility of those organisms. As current consensus supports the use of bacterial species but not specifically susceptibility data in selecting antibiotic therapy, this would not support the use of frequent broad‐spectrum antibiotic courses unless a person with CF has not responded to narrow‐spectrum antibiotics in the recent past. Furthermore, while early infection with P. aeruginosa can be eradicated, chronic infection can predispose to the development of increased antibiotic resistance due to strong selective pressure. In prior studies, the treatment of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria with resistant antibiotics has still led to overall improvement in the respiratory symptoms/pulmonary function of persons with CF, as cultured antibiotic resistance has been demonstrated to be less predictive in persons with CF with chronic infections, leading to further difficulty in establishing clear guidelines for PEx treatment in persons with CF.

### Guidelines for the management of adult lower respiratory tract infections – full version [^113xvMxS]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

This document is an update of Guidelines published in 2005 and now includes scientific publications through to May 2010. It provides evidence-based recommendations for the most common management questions occurring in routine clinical practice in the management of adult patients with LRTI. Topics include management outside hospital, management inside hospital (including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis) and prevention. Background sections and graded evidence tables are also included. The target audience for the Guideline is thus all those whose routine practice includes the management of adult LRTI.

### Update: interim guidance for health care providers evaluating and caring for patients with suspected E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury-United States, October 2019 [^111TurUP]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Medical treatment. Corticosteroids might be helpful in treating this injury. Several case reports describe improvement with corticosteroids, likely because of a blunting of the inflammatory response. In a series of patients in Illinois and Wisconsin, 92% of 50 patients received corticosteroids; the medical team documented in 65% of 46 patient notes that "respiratory improvement was due to the use of glucocorticoids". Among 140 cases reported nationally to CDC that received corticosteroids, 82% of patients improved (Table). However, the natural progression of this injury is not known, and it is possible that patients might recover without corticosteroids or by avoiding use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products. In some circumstances, it would be advisable to withhold corticosteroids while evaluating patients for infectious etiologies, such as fungal pneumonia, that might worsen with corticosteroid treatment. Nevertheless, because the diagnosis remains one of exclusion, aggressive empiric therapy with corticosteroids, antimicrobial, and antiviral therapy might be warranted for patients with severe illness. A range of corticosteroid doses, durations, and taper plans might be considered on a case-by-case basis. Whenever possible, decisions on the use of corticosteroids and dosing regimen should be made in consultation with a pulmonologist.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background [^112hzNXH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus. 1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care. 3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: (a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; (b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or (c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered. 5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient.

### Which individuals are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease and why? Impact of COPD, asthma, smoking, diabetes, and / or chronic heart disease on community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease [^111FDeV9]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Another study found that inhaled corticosteroids increased the risk of CAP in patients with COPD, whereas inhaled anticholinergics increased the risk of CAP in patients with asthma. Inhaled β 2 -adrenergic agonists, however, did not appear to affect the risk of CAP. The authors of this study concluded that these associations may not be causal but reflect the severity of the underlying conditions. A recent Cochrane review concluded that the inhaled corticosteroids budesonide and fluticasone, administered alone or in combination with a long-acting β 2 agonist, increase the risk of pneumonia requiring hospitalisation in patients with COPD, although they do not significantly affect mortality compared with controls.

Within a patient population with underlying lung diseases, patients with COPD have been found to have a higher risk of IPD than those with asthma, regardless of age (fourfold vs twofold increased risk of IPD). The increased risk of IPD in individuals with COPD may be due to reduced innate defence mechanisms in the airways, smoking and/or use of corticosteroids.

Smoking status

Smoking has also been identified as a risk factor for CAP (ORs for current smoking: 1.0–2.3) with the risk varying according to smoking history (table 1; see onlineS2). The effect of smoking on the risk of CAP has been explored in a case–control study. Compared with individuals who had never smoked, current smokers and ex-smokers were found to have a higher risk of CAP (OR: 1.34 and 1.37, respectively), with smoking confirmed as an independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis. This risk increased with the number of pack-years (OR vs 0 pack-years: 1.46 for > 150 pack-years and 1.01 for ≤ 150 pack-years). Among the ex-smokers, those who had stopped smoking > 4 years ago had a significantly reduced risk of CAP than those who had stopped smoking < 1 year ago (OR: 0.39). Individuals aged > 65 years who had never smoked but were exposed to passive smoking were also at significantly increased risk of CAP (OR adjusted for age and sex: 1.56). Similarly, in a separate study, individuals aged ≥ 65 years who were exposed to passive smoke at home had an increased risk of CAP (relative risk (RR): 1.48 vs those not exposed to passive smoke).

### Antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD: patient outcomes with amoxicillin vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-data from 43, 636 outpatients [^1158oF7m]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

This study was designed as a retrospective cohort study. Patients that had at least one hospital outpatient visit were included from the The Danish Registry of COPD (DrCOPD), a nationwide COPD registry. Data were crosslinked with The Danish National Health Service Prescription Database, The Danish National Patient Registry, a registry of all hospital contacts and The Danish Civil Registration System which includes vital status at any given time. The first prescription of AMX or AMC after inclusion in DrCOPD was used as an exposure variable. The patients were followed for 30 days after they had redeemed a prescription for antibiotics at the pharmacy. Time-to-event data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models and expressed as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The model was adjusted for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), smoking status, prescription of oral corticosteroids ± 7 days from antibiotic prescription, hospitalizations for pneumonia or AECOPD within the past year and comorbidities in form of history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, depression, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease or renal failure. If more than one record of BMI, FEV1 or smoking status existed, the most recent prior to exposure was used. Missing BMI was regarded as a normal value (18.5–24.9), for missing FEV1 and smoking status data, replacement with median values (respectively "30% < FEV1 < 50%" or "Ex-/Non-smoker") from our data set was performed. All the models were run twice, with these patients included and excluded. Oral corticosteroid prescriptions equal to or below 250 mg prednisolone were classified as short course treatments, prescriptions above 250 mg as long. Comorbidities was based on diagnosis codes from hospital visits in the 10 years prior to inclusion. The primary endpoint was hospitalization for pneumonia or AECOPD (DJ12-DJ18, DJ440 or DJ441), or death by all-cause within 30 days after exposure. Four secondary endpoints were analyzed: (1) time to all-cause hospitalization or death, (2) time to non-pneumonia hospitalization or death, (3) time to death and lastly (4) time to a new prescription of oral antibiotics used for treating lower respiratory tract infections, pneumonia hospitalization or death. For this endpoint moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and amoxicillin was considered antibiotics used for treating lower respiratory tract infections. It was made as a composite endpoint as to avoid bias i.e. only looking at the mild treatment failures that do not require hospitalization. Microbiological data were available from Region Zealand and the Capital Region of Denmark, accounting for around half of the population in Denmark.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^1164oRSK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations punctuate the natural history of COPD and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and disease progression. Chronic airflow limitation is caused by a combination of small airways (bronchitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), which can impact day-to-day activities and overall quality of life. In carefully selected patients with COPD, long-term, prophylactic use of antibiotics may reduce bacterial load, inflammation of the airways, and the frequency of exacerbations.

Objectives

To assess effects of different prophylactic antibiotics on exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events in people with COPD in three separate network meta-analyses (NMAs), and to provide rankings of identified antibiotics.

Search Methods

To identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and clinical trials registries. We conducted the most recent search on 22 January 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with a parallel design of at least 12 weeks' duration evaluating long-term administration of antibiotics prophylactically compared with other antibiotics, or placebo, for patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

This Cochrane Review collected and updated pair-wise data from two previous Cochrane Reviews. Searches were updated and additional studies included. We conducted three separate network meta-analyses (NMAs) within a Bayesian framework to assess three outcomes: exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. For quality of life, we collected data from St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Using previously validated methods, we selected the simplest model that could adequately fit the data for every analysis. We used threshold analysis to indicate which results were robust to potential biases, taking into account each study's contributions to the overall results and network structure. Probability ranking was performed for each antibiotic class for exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Characteristics of studies and participants Eight trials were conducted at multiple sites that included hospital clinics or academic health centres. Seven were single-centre trials conducted in hospital clinics. Two trials did not report settings. Trials durations ranged from 12 to 52 weeks. Most participants had moderate to severe disease. Mean age ranged from 64 years to 73 years, and more males were recruited (51% to 100%). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) ranged from 0.935 to 1.36 L. Most participants had previous exacerbations. Data from 12 studies were included in the NMAs (3405 participants; 16 treatment arms including placebo). Prophylactic antibiotics evaluated were macrolides (azithromycin and erythromycin), tetracyclines (doxycyclines), quinolones (moxifloxacin) and macrolides plus tetracyclines (roxithromycin plus doxycycline). Risk of bias and threshold analysis Most studies were at low risk across domains, except detection bias, for which only seven studies were judged at low risk. In the threshold analysis for exacerbations, all comparisons in which one antibiotic was compared with another were robust to sampling variation, especially macrolide comparisons. Comparisons of classes with placebo were sensitive to potential bias, especially macrolide versus placebo, therefore, any bias in the comparison was likely to favour the active class, so any adjustment would bring the estimated relative effect closer to the null value, thus quinolone may become the best class to prevent exacerbations. Exacerbations Nine studies were included (2732 participants) in this NMA (exacerbations analysed as time to first exacerbation or people with one or more exacerbations). Macrolides and quinolones reduced exacerbations. Macrolides had a greater effect in reducing exacerbations compared with placebo (macrolides: hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.60 to 0.75; quinolones: HR 0.89, 95% CrI 0.75 to 1.04), resulting in 127 fewer people per 1000 experiencing exacerbations on macrolides. The difference in exacerbations between tetracyclines and placebo was uncertain (HR 1.29, 95% CrI 0.66 to 2.41). Macrolides ranked first (95% CrI first to second), with quinolones ranked second (95% CrI second to third). Tetracyclines ranked fourth, which was lower than placebo (ranked third). Contributing studies were considered as low risk of bias in a threshold analysis. Quality of life (SGRQ) Seven studies were included (2237 participants) in this NMA. SGRQ scores improved with macrolide treatment compared with placebo (fixed effect-fixed class effect: mean difference (MD) -2.30, 95% CrI -3.61 to -0.99), but the mean difference did not reach the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Tetracyclines and quinolones did not improve quality of life any more than placebo, and we did not detect a difference between antibiotic classes. Serious adverse events Nine studies were included (3180 participants) in the NMA. Macrolides reduced the odds of a serious adverse event compared with placebo (fixed effect-fixed class effect: odds ratio (OR) 0.76, 95% CrI 0.62 to 0.93). There was probably little to no difference in the effect of quinolone compared with placebo or tetracycline plus macrolide compared with placebo. There was probably little to no difference in serious adverse events between quinolones or tetracycline plus macrolide. With macrolide treatment 49 fewer people per 1000 experienced a serious adverse event compared with those given placebo. Macrolides ranked first, followed by quinolones. Tetracycline did not rank better than placebo. Drug resistance Ten studies reported drug resistance. Results were not combined due to variation in outcome measures. All studies concluded that prophylactic antibiotic administration was associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance.

Authors' Conclusions

This NMA evaluated the safety and efficacy of different antibiotics used prophylactically for COPD patients. Compared to placebo, prolonged administration of macrolides (ranked first) appeared beneficial in prolonging the time to next exacerbation, improving quality of life, and reducing serious adverse events. No clear benefits were associated with use of quinolones or tetracyclines. In addition, antibiotic resistance was a concern and could not be thoroughly assessed in this review. Given the trade-off between effectiveness, safety, and risk of antibiotic resistance, prophylactic administration of antibiotics may be best reserved for selected patients, such as those experiencing frequent exacerbations. However, none of the eligible studies excluded patients with previously isolated non-tuberculous mycobacteria, which would contraindicate prophylactic administration of antibiotics, due to the risk of developing resistant non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

### Smoking and COVID-19: what we know so far [^112E3rVK]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on infectious diseases and their associations with host factors and underlying conditions. New data on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus are entering the public domain at a rapid rate such that their distillation often lags behind. To minimise weak associations becoming perceived as established paradigms, it is imperative that methodologies and outputs from different studies are appropriately critiqued and compared. In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades' worth of multi-centre epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive. There is therefore a need for some caution to be exercised until further research has been conducted in a wider range of geographical settings with sufficient numbers of patients that have been carefully phenotyped in respect of smoking status and adequate statistical control for confounding factors.

### A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of long-term doxycycline therapy on exacerbation rate in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117CHrbc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common and drive healthcare use, hospitalization, disease progression, and mortality. Preventing exacerbations is a key approach toward improving quality of life and reducing healthcare use. Preventative, long-term antibiotic treatment has been shown to prevent exacerbations among those with COPD. Most trials have studied macrolides (predominantly azithromycin), although one studied moxifloxacin, and one four-armed trial studied azithromycin, doxycycline, and moxifloxacin. Guidelines support the use of long-term macrolides to prevent exacerbations, but azithromycin is contraindicated in some patients, and the effectiveness of other antibiotics remains uncertain. Furthermore, except for current smokers, for whom azithromycin appears to be ineffective, it is unclear which subgroups of patients benefit most from long-term antibiotic therapy.

Although the effectiveness of long-term nonmacrolide antibiotics remains uncertain, we found that doxycycline was the second most common long-term antibiotic therapy used by patients with COPD in the United Kingdom. Doxycycline possesses both bacteriostatic antibacterial properties and complex antiinflammatory actions. Long-term doxycycline is already used for several nonrespiratory conditions, can reduce airway bacteria in patients with COPD, and compares favorably with azithromycin and moxifloxacin regarding adverse events, bacterial resistance, and adherence profiles. However, the beneficial effect of macrolides may relate in part to their immunomodulatory effects, a feature not shared by many other antibiotic classes.

Studies assessing the efficacy of nonmacrolide antibiotics, in particular doxycycline, are needed to help clinicians decide which long-term antibiotics to prescribe and identify those patients who might benefit from such therapy. In this study, we assessed whether 12-month use of doxycycline reduced the COPD exacerbation rate and whether there were different responses among particular patient subgroups.

### Guidelines for the management of adult lower respiratory tract infections – summary [^113jyyYq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

This document is an update of Guidelines published in 2005 and now includes scientific publications through to May 2010. It provides evidence-based recommendations for the most common management questions occurring in routine clinical practice in the management of adult patients with LRTI. Topics include management outside hospital, management inside hospital (including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis) and prevention. The target audience for the Guideline is thus all those whose routine practice includes the management of adult LRTI.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116e1ywh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) fluoroquinolone prophylaxis with moxifloxacin has been evaluated using pulsed dosing with measurable effects on exacerbations. The fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin has been used as a 5-day pulse every 8 weeks to reduce the frequency of exacerbations in patients with moderate to severe COPD, and in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial it reduced exacerbations by 25% overall and by up to 45% in the subgroup of patients with purulent or mucopurulent sputum at baseline; results suggest particular effectiveness in patients likely colonized by bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while key determinants such as which patients benefit most, optimal dosage and duration, mode of action, other patient-centered outcomes, and between-fluoroquinolone differences remain unknown.

### Systemic antibiotics for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in outpatients with non-hospitalised exacerbations of pre-existing lung diseases: a randomised clinical trial [^1125eK2x]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We conducted a multicenter, randomised, controlled, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy of dual systemic anti-pseudomonal antibiotics in outpatients with pre-existing lung disease and a recent respiratory tract culture sample with P. aeruginosa. We found that the risk of prednisolone or antibiotic requiring exacerbation or death within one year was reduced to about half. The total number of hospitalisation-requiring exacerbations within one year was reduced from almost three to approximately one, and clinical cure at day 14 also improved markedly. In all other secondary outcomes, we observed a non-significant trend in the direction of benefit from the dual systemic antibiotic intervention. These included: i) days alive and without hospitalisation from day 20 to 365 from randomisation, ii) death from all causes within 365 days, iii) number of days with non-invasive ventilation or invasive ventilation within 90 days, iv) microbiological cure at day 90, v) change in CAT score to day 90, vi) change in BMI to day 90, vii) change in FEV 1 to day 90, and viii) decrease of ≥ 200 mL in FEV 1 from randomisation to day 365. No secondary outcomes trended towards harm from the intervention. The majority of outpatients had COPD, followed by non-CF bronchiectasis. The main result seemed to be preserved both among P. aeruginosa -naïve and P. aeruginosa -non-naïve patients.

To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to explore the clinical effects of systemic antibiotic treatment targeting P. aeruginosa in patients with pre-existing lung disease and frequent exacerbations. Previously, a smaller and retrospective observational study conducted between 2004–2010 assessed the effects of different antibiotic regimens after the first colonisation of P. aeruginosa in 30 patients with non-CF bronchiectasis, in whom the majority were treated with systemic antibiotics for two weeks. Exacerbation frequencies seemed lower after antibiotic treatment.

In the past two decades, a growing number of trials have investigated the potential clinical advantages of inhaled antibiotic as eradication treatment in patients with lung disease and recurrent isolation of P. aeruginosa. Recent meta-analyses have highlighted some controversy regarding their impact on exacerbations in non-CF bronchiectasis. To date, no randomised controlled trials have tested inhaled antibiotics in patients with asthma or COPD.

Case Presentation

A 70-year-old woman who had received a diagnosis of pneumonia in the right lower lobe was treated with antibiotics at a general practitioner's clinic 9 months earlier. Her pneumonia had improved, but the cough and lung infiltrates persisted for > 6 months, so the patient was referred to our hospital. She had undergone surgery for breast cancer 30 years earlier but had no other medical history. She was not taking any medications and had no history of smoking, including passive smoking.

### Inhaled antibiotics for long-term therapy in cystic fibrosis [^115bWXV6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled antibiotics are commonly used to treat persistent airway infection that contributes to lung damage in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Objectives

To examine the evidence that inhaled antibiotic treatment in people with CF reduces frequency of exacerbations of infection, and improves lung function, quality of life and survival. To examine adverse effects of inhaled antibiotic treatment.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register. Last search: 31 January 2011.

Selection Criteria

Trials were selected if inhaled antibiotic treatment was used for at least four weeks in people with CF, treatment allocation was randomised or quasi-randomised, and there was a control group (either placebo, no placebo or another inhaled antibiotic).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, judged the risk of bias and extracted data from these trials.

Main Results

The searches identified 176 citations to 78 trials. Nineteen trials, with 1724 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Adequate meta-analysis was not possible because of the variability of study design and reporting of results. Seventeen trials with 1562 participants compared an inhaled antibiotic with placebo or usual treatment for a duration between 1 and 32 months. Inhaled tobramycin was studied in eight trials. Lung function (measured as forced expired volume in one second) was higher and exacerbations of lung infection (by different measures) were less in the antibiotic-treated group. Resistance to antibiotics increased more in the antibiotic-treated group than in placebo group when results were reported. No auditory or renal impairment was found; analysis showed tinnitus, voice alteration, hemoptysis and cough were more frequent with tobramycin than placebo. One trial, compared tobramycin with colistin in 115 participants, after one month the mean difference in forced expiratory volume at one second was 6.33 (95% confidence interval -0.04 to 12.70) favouring tobramycin.

Authors' Conclusions

Inhaled antibiotic treatment probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rate, but a pooled estimate of the level of benefit is not possible. The best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence, from trials of longer duration, is needed to determine whether this benefit is maintained and to determine the significance of development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^112qk15H]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli coverage emphasizes initial antipseudomonal activity and stratified breadth. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend prescribing antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have factors increasing the likelihood for Pseudomonas or other gram-negative infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days; also see Remarks) or a high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). All other patients with HAP who are being treated empirically may be prescribed a single antibiotic with activity against P. aeruginosa. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend not using an aminoglycoside as the sole antipseudomonal agent (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

General considerations for human respiratory bacterial infections describe that they "are initiated by an unknown dose of the infectious agent that enters the respiratory tract through an unknown route (inhalation, microaspiration) at an unknown time", and note that "Typically, vulnerable humans such as the immune-insufficient like in infants, elderly persons, and those with a debilitating chronic disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis), as well as the immunodeficient (e.g., those with cancer) and the immunosuppressed (e.g., pregnant mothers, corticosteroid-treated patients, transplant recipients), are more likely to have bacterial infections that progress to pneumonia". If initial defenses fail, "inflammation ensues, leading to alveolar consolidation of varying intensities", with symptoms that "such as fever, productive cough, chest pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia develop", and although "most patients recover with antibiotic treatment, some develop severe disease that can be fatal".

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric antipseudomonal therapy — For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend prescribing antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For those with factors increasing the likelihood for Pseudomonas or other gram-negative infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days) or a high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting that risk factors for mortality include need for ventilatory support due to HAP and septic shock. All other patients with HAP who are being treated empirically may be prescribed a single antibiotic with activity against P. aeruginosa, and we recommend not using an aminoglycoside as the sole antipseudomonal agent (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks add that if a patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended, and that the 20% threshold for deciding whether or not to target MRSA or MSSA may be modified by individual units.

### Smoking is associated with pneumonia development in lung cancer patients [^111TgBQ6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, old age, smoking, and neutropenia were common risk factors for pneumonia development in total patients with lung cancer and patients who received treatment that included chemotherapy. Thus, cautious monitoring of elderly patients, especially those who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy or have a history of smoking, is important. Future studies are needed to clarify effects of smoking cessation before treatment on pneumonia development in lung cancer patients.

### Cigarette smoking and infection… [^114o7uqo]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

The clinical implications of our findings include emphasizing the importance of smoking cessation as part of the therapeutic plan for people with serious infectious diseases or periodontitis, and individuals who have positive results of tuberculin skin tests. Controlling exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke in children is important to reduce the risks of meningococcal disease and otitis media, and in adults to reduce the risk of influenza and meningococcal disease. Other recommendations include pneumococcal and influenza vaccine in all smokers and acyclovir treatment for varicella in smokers. Studies on Lung Fluids. The results of studies of bronchoalveolar fluid from smokers differ from findings in the peripheral blood. Bronchoalveolar lavage studies19, 21, 22 have demonstrated a marked decrease in the percentage and absolute number of CD4+ cells, and an increase in CD8+ cells with a lower CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio in moderate smokers vs nonsmokers.

No significant changes in these variables in the peripheral blood were found in this population of moderate smokers, in contrast with the findings in heavy smokers discussed previously. Thus, changes in lymphocyte population in the bronchoalveolar lavage in smokers may disclose pathologic changes earlier than in blood. Moreover, these findings suggest that smokers have a deficit in cell-mediated immunity in the lung alveolus, a site critical in the first-line defense against infection. Smoking is also associated with significant increases in the percentage of macrophages22 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. This suggests that the effect was reversible, with a return toward the immunoglobulin levels of nonsmokers. Hersey et al18 found that 3 months after subjects stopped smoking, IgG and IgM but not IgA levels had increased compared with levels during smoking. Lung Fluids. The IgG content of bronchial fluids was found to be twice as high in smokers than nonsmokers.

18, 52 A selective increase in immunoglobulin levels could be explained either by stimulation of local immunoglobulin production or by exudation of plasma immunoglobulin into alveolar spaces in response to inhaled cigarette smoke.
53. The availability of opsonic antimicrobial antibodies is essential for optimal function of phagocytes to take up and contain bacteria. 54 The antibody response to a variety of antigens, such as influenza virus infection and vaccination55 and Aspergillus fumigatus, 56 is depressed in cigarette smokers.

### Effect of azithromycin maintenance treatment on infectious exacerbations among patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: the BAT randomized controlled trial… [^117RLLXa]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Azithromycin or placebo for 12 months. Main Outcome Measures Number of infectious exacerbations during 12 months of treatment. Secondary end points included lung function, sputum bacteriology, inflammatory markers, adverse effects, symptom scores, and quality of life. Conclusions and Relevance Among adults with non-CF bronchiectasis, the daily use of azithromycin for 12 months compared with placebo resulted in a lower rate of infectious exacerbations. This could result in better quality of life and might influence survival, although effects on antibiotic resistance need to be considered. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00415350. 1 If progressive, this process may lead to respiratory failure and the need for lung transplantation or to death. The course of the disease is highly variable.

Nearly symptom-free periods intersperse with infectious exacerbations, characterized by worsening of symptoms of productive cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Frequent exacerbations have a major influence on quality of life.
2. After randomization and a 2-week run-in period, patients underwent follow-up every 3 months during the 52-week treatment period for blood sampling, lung function tests, questionnaires, sputum cultures, and safety checks and once at the end of the run-out period. Laboratory tests included measurement of serum CRP level, WBC count, and levels of AST and ALT. Lung function measurements were performed according to European Respiratory Society standard criteria. 18 Sputum samples were collected at each visit and submitted for culture and susceptibility testing at the Medical Centre Alkmaar.

The primary hypothesis was that prolonged treatment with azithromycin would cause a 33% or greater reduction of the number of exacerbations per patient, decreasing the yearly number of exacerbations per patient from 3 to 2. A recently published trial of non-CF bronchiectasis found a similar significant reduction in exacerbation frequency with 6 months of macrolide treatment. 15 Lung functional improvement and better QOL was not maintained during the 6 months after the intervention concluded. In contrast to the EMBRACE study, which found a small but significant reduction of the already low baseline CRP values, CRP values in our study did not change significantly, probably because of lack of power for this secondary end point. Improvement in pulmonary function may eventually affect survival, because impaired lung function has been identified as an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with bronchiectasis. 27.
